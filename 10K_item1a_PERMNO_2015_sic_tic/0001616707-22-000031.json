{"cik": "1616707", "company": "Wayfair Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-24", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below. We caution you that the following important factors, among others, could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf in filings with the SEC, press releases, communications with investors and oral statements. Any or all of our forward-looking statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in any other public statements we make may turn out to be wrong. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. Many factors mentioned in the discussion below will be important in determining future results. Consequently, no forward-looking statement can be guaranteed. Actual future results may differ materially from those anticipated in forward-looking statements. We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosure we make in our reports filed with the SEC.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe ongoing global pandemic, and any future outbreaks or other public health emergencies, could materially affect our business, liquidity, financial condition and operating results.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the various responses to it globally have created significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption. Authorities across the U.S. and the globe have implemented and continue to implement varying degrees of restriction on social and commercial activity in an effort to slow the spread of the virus, some of which have been subsequently rescinded or modified, such as travel bans, stay-at-home orders and shutdowns of certain businesses. These measures have impacted and may continue to impact all or portions of our workforce, operations, suppliers and customers and demand for our products and services.\nIn particular, while we have seen increased sales and order activity at times during the COVID-19 pandemic, the pandemic has significantly disrupted the global supply chain, including many of our suppliers. Such disruptions, including staffing shortages, production slowdowns, stoppages and/or disruptions in delivery systems, could materially and adversely affect our suppliers\u2019 ability to provide products in a timely manner, or at all, and could materially and adversely affect our logistics providers\u2019 ability to distribute products to our customers in a timely manner, or at all. We expect issues related to the global supply chain to continue into 2022.\nIn addition, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted, and may continue to disrupt, third-party business partners\u2019 ability to meet their obligations to us. These third parties include our suppliers and logistics providers, such as FedEx, UPS, DHL, the U.S. Postal Service and other third-party delivery agents, as their workers may be prohibited or otherwise unable to report to work and transporting products within regions or countries may be limited due to extended holidays, factory closures, port closures and increased labor shortages, among other things. We have also incurred, and may continue to incur, higher shipping costs due to various surcharges by third-party delivery agents on retailers related to the increased shipping demand resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. These higher costs affected us over the past year and may continue to affect us in the future.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic also impacted our workforce, causing us to move a large portion of our employees to work-from-home and adding administrative complexity to our everyday human resources and employee technology functions. Furthermore, if significant portions of our workforce are unable to work effectively, including because of illness, quarantines, government actions, the impact of vaccine mandates and the willingness of our employees to comply with such mandates, facility closures, remote working or other restrictions in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, our operations will likely be adversely impacted. Further, the steps we have taken to protect the health, safety and financial security of our employees, including instituting testing and vaccination requirements at our facilities, may result in other negative impacts on our operations, including increased costs, reduced efficiency levels or labor disputes resulting in a strike or other work stoppage or interruption.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has also significantly increased economic uncertainty and has led to disruption and volatility in the global capital markets, which could increase the cost of and accessibility to capital. If we need to access the capital markets, there can be no assurance that financing may be available on attractive terms, if at all. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused and could continue to cause periods of significant economic slowdown, which could lead to reduced discretionary consumer spending and a corresponding reduction in demand for our products and could result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nTo counteract the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, governments around the world have implemented fiscal stimulus measures and vaccination rollouts, however, the magnitude and overall effectiveness of these actions remain uncertain and certain\nU.S. federal and state laws and regulations intended to reduce the spread of COVID-19 are in direct conflict, which means we may be unable to comply with all applicable laws and regulations in some of the jurisdictions in which we operate. Further, the full extent of the impact of COVID-19, including the extent of its impact on our business and financial condition, will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict, including, but not limited to: the length of time that the pandemic continues; the availability, distribution and continued efficacy of available treatments and vaccines; vaccination rates among the general public and our employees; its effect on our suppliers, logistics providers and the demand for our products; the effect of governmental regulations imposed in response to the pandemic; the effect on our customers, their communities and customer demand and ability to pay for our products and services, which may be affected by increased consumer debt levels, changes in net worth due to market conditions and other factors that impact consumer confidence; disruptions or restrictions on our employees\u2019 ability to work and travel, as well as uncertainty regarding all of the foregoing.\nWhile the home industry has fared much better during the COVID-19 pandemic than other sectors of the economy, the recent surges in COVID-19 cases due to new variants and the resurgence of inflation brought on by labor and supply shortages have had and may continue to have an adverse impact upon our business. Much is still unknown, including the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, the emergence of variants of COVID-19 that may continue to prolong the pandemic, the amount of time it will take for normal economic activity to resume, and future government actions that may be taken. Accordingly the situation remains dynamic and subject to rapid and possibly material change, including but not limited to changes that may materially affect the operations of our suppliers, logistics providers and customers, which ultimately could result in material adverse effects on our business, financial condition and operating results. We cannot at this time predict the full impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, but it could have a larger material adverse effect on our business, liquidity, financial condition and operating results beyond what is discussed within this report. We will continue to actively monitor the COVID-19 situation and may take further actions that alter our business operations as may be required by federal, state, local or foreign authorities, or that we determine are in the best interests of our customers, employees, suppliers, partners, stockholders and communities. We cannot predict with any certainty whether and to what degree the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic and reactions thereto will continue, and we expect to face difficulty in accurately forecasting our financial condition and operational results.\nAdditionally, to the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business, results of operations or financial condition, it may heighten other risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section below.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nOur recent growth rates may not be sustainable or indicative of our future growth.\nOur historical growth rates may not be sustainable or indicative of future growth. We believe that our continued revenue growth will depend upon, among other factors, our ability to:\n\u2022build our brands and launch new brands;\n\u2022acquire new customers and increase repeat purchases from existing customers;\n\u2022develop new features to enhance the consumer experience on our sites, mobile-optimized sites and mobile applications;\n\u2022increase the frequency with which new and repeat customers purchase products on our sites through merchandising, data, analytics and technology;\n\u2022add new suppliers and deepen our relationships with our existing suppliers;\n\u2022grow certain categories where we under index the broader home goods market today;\n\u2022enhance the systems our consumers use to interact with our sites and invest in our infrastructure platform;\n\u2022increase delivery speed and improve the delivery experience for our customers through the continued build-out of our proprietary logistics network;\n\u2022continue to expand internationally;\n\u2022continue to execute our omni-channel strategy with the launch of physical retail stores across our family of brands; and\n\u2022opportunistically pursue strategic acquisitions.\nWe cannot assure you we will be able to achieve any of the foregoing. Our customer base may not continue to grow or may decline as a result of increased competition and the maturation of our business. Failure to continue our revenue growth rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. You should not rely on our historical rate of revenue growth as an indication of our future performance.\nIf we fail to manage our growth effectively, our business, financial condition and operating results could be harmed.\nTo manage our growth effectively, we must continue to implement our operational plans and strategies, improve and expand our infrastructure of people and information systems and expand, train and manage our employee base. To support our continued growth, we have rapidly increased employee headcount since our inception. To support continued growth, we must effectively integrate, develop and motivate a large number of new employees. If our new hires perform poorly, if we are unsuccessful in hiring, training, managing and integrating these new employees and staff, or if we are not successful in retaining our existing employees and staff, our business may be harmed. Moreover, in 2020 we implemented reductions in force and may in the future implement other reductions in force. Any reduction in force may yield unintended consequences and costs, such as attrition beyond the intended reduction in force, the distraction of employees, reduced employee morale and adverse effects to our reputation as an employer, which could make it more difficult for us to hire new employees in the future, and the risk that we may not achieve the anticipated benefits from the reduction in force. Properly managing our growth will require us to establish consistent policies across regions and functions, and a failure to do so could likewise harm our business. We also face significant competition for personnel. Failure to manage our hiring needs effectively or successfully integrate our new hires may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Further, we have a substantial number of hourly employees. In January 2021, we announced a minimum wage increase for all U.S. employees to at least $15 per hour. While we are at or above current local and federal minimum wage requirements across the U.S, any future local or federal minimum wage increases may increase our labor costs, which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nAdditionally, the growth of our business places significant demands on our operations, as well as our management and other employees. For example, we typically launch hundreds of promotional events across thousands of products each month on our sites via emails, \"push\" notifications and personalized displays. These events require us to produce updates of our sites and emails to our customers on a daily basis with different products, photos and text. Any surge in online traffic and orders associated with such promotional activities places increased strain on our operations, including our logistics network, and may cause or exacerbate slowdowns or interruptions. The growth of our business may require significant additional resources to meet these daily requirements, which may not scale in a cost-effective manner or may negatively affect the quality of our sites and customer experience. Further, we may face a number of challenges to our expansion into physical retail locations, including locating retail space with a cost and geographic profile that will allow us to operate in highly desirable shopping locations, hiring in-store talent and expanding our physical retail operations in a cost-effective manner. We may also have to enter into long-term leases before we know whether our physical retail strategy or a particular geography will be successful. We are also required to manage relationships with a growing number of suppliers, customers and other third parties. Our information technology systems and our internal controls and procedures may not be adequate to support future growth of our supplier and employee base. If we are unable to manage the growth of our organization effectively, our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected.\nIf we fail to acquire new customers or retain existing customers, or fail to do so in a cost-effective manner, our business, financial condition and operating results could be harmed.\nOur success depends on our ability to acquire and retain customers in a cost-effective manner. In order to expand our customer base, we must appeal to and acquire customers who have historically used other means of commerce to purchase home goods and may prefer alternatives to our offerings, such as traditional brick and mortar retailers, the websites of our competitors or our suppliers' own websites. We have made significant investments related to customer acquisition and expect to continue to spend significant amounts to acquire additional customers. Our paid advertising efforts consist primarily of online channels, including display advertising, paid search advertising, social media advertising, search engine optimization, comparison shopping engine advertising, television advertising, direct mail, catalog and print advertising. These efforts are expensive and may not result in the cost-effective acquisition of customers. We cannot assure you that the net profit from new customers we acquire will ultimately exceed the cost of acquiring those customers. Additionally, actions by third parties to block or impose restrictions on the delivery of certain advertisements could also adversely impact our business. If we fail to deliver a quality shopping experience, or if consumers do not perceive the products we offer to be of high value and quality, we may not be able to acquire new customers or retain existing customers. If we are unable to acquire new customers who purchase products in numbers sufficient to grow our business, we may not be able to generate the scale necessary to drive beneficial network effects with our suppliers or efficiencies in our logistics network, our net revenue may decrease, and our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected.\nWe believe that many of our new customers originate from word-of-mouth and other non-paid referrals from existing customers. Therefore, we must ensure that our existing customers remain loyal to us in order to continue receiving those referrals. If our efforts to satisfy our existing customers are not successful, we may not be able to acquire new customers in sufficient numbers to continue to grow our business, or we may be required to incur significantly higher marketing expenses in order to acquire new customers.\nWe also utilize non-paid advertising. Our non-paid advertising efforts include search engine optimization, non-paid social media, mobile \"push\" notifications and email. We obtain a significant amount of traffic via search engines and, therefore, rely on search engines such as Google, Bing and Yahoo!. Search engines frequently update and change the logic that determines the placement and display of results of a user's search, such that the purchased or algorithmic placement of links to our sites can be negatively affected. Moreover, a search engine could, for competitive or other purposes, alter its search algorithms or results, causing our sites to place lower in search query results. A major search engine could change its algorithms in a manner that negatively affects our paid or non-paid search ranking, and competitive dynamics could impact the effectiveness of search engine marketing or search engine optimization. We also obtain a significant amount of traffic via social networking websites or other channels used by our current and prospective customers. As e-commerce and social networking continue to rapidly evolve, we must continue to establish relationships with these channels and may be unable to develop or maintain these relationships on acceptable terms. If we are unable to cost-effectively drive traffic to our sites, our ability to acquire new customers or retain our existing customers and our financial condition would suffer.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to increase our net revenue per active customer. If our efforts to increase customer loyalty and repeat purchasing as well as maintain high levels of customer engagement are not successful, our growth prospects and net revenue will be materially adversely affected.\nOur ability to grow our business depends on our ability to retain our existing customer base and generate increased net revenue and repeat purchases from this customer base and maintain high levels of customer engagement. To do this, we must continue to provide our customers and potential customers with a unified, convenient, efficient and differentiated shopping experience by:\n\u2022providing imagery, tools and technology that attract customers who historically would have bought elsewhere;\n\u2022maintaining a high-quality and diverse portfolio of products and services;\n\u2022delivering products on time and without damage; and\n\u2022maintaining and further developing our mobile platforms.\nIf we fail to increase net revenue per active customer, generate repeat purchases or maintain high levels of customer engagement, our growth prospects, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nOur business depends on our ability to build and maintain strong brands. We may not be able to maintain and enhance our brands if we receive unfavorable customer complaints, negative publicity or otherwise fail to live up to consumers' expectations, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and growth prospects.\nMaintaining and enhancing our brands is critical to expanding our base of customers and suppliers. Our ability to maintain and enhance our brand depends largely on our ability to maintain customer confidence in our product and service offerings, including by maintaining product availability and delivering products on time and without damage. If customers do not have a satisfactory shopping experience, they may seek out alternative offerings from our competitors and may not return to our sites as often in the future, or at all. In addition, unfavorable publicity regarding, for example, our practices relating to privacy and data protection, product quality or availability, delivery problems, competitive pressures, litigation or regulatory activity, could seriously harm our reputation. Such negative publicity also could have an adverse effect on the size, engagement and loyalty of our customer base and result in decreased net revenue, which could adversely affect our business and financial results. A significant portion of our customers' brand experience also depends on third parties outside our control, including suppliers, assembly and installation service providers and logistics providers such as FedEx, UPS, DHL, the U.S. Postal Service and other third-party delivery agents. If these third parties do not meet our or our customers' expectations, our brands may suffer irreparable damage.\nIn addition, maintaining and enhancing these brands may require us to make substantial investments, and these investments may not be successful. If we fail to promote and maintain our brands, or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our business, operating results and financial condition may be materially adversely affected. We anticipate that, as our market becomes increasingly competitive, maintaining and enhancing our brands may become increasingly difficult and expensive. Maintaining and enhancing our brands will depend largely on our ability to provide high quality products to our customers and a reliable, trustworthy and profitable sales channel to our suppliers, which we may not be able to do successfully.\nCustomer complaints or negative publicity about our sites, products, delivery times, company practices, employees, customer data handling and security practices or customer support, especially on blogs, social media websites and our sites, could rapidly and severely diminish consumer use of our sites and consumer and supplier confidence in us and result in harm to our brands.\nOur efforts to expand our business into new brands, channels, products, services, technologies and geographic regions will subject us to additional business, legal, financial and competitive risks and may not be successful.\nOur business success depends to some extent on our ability to expand our customer offerings by launching new brands and services and by expanding our existing offerings into new geographies. For example, we launched the Kelly Clarkson Home Collection in 2020, Hykkon, a European Union flagship brand in 2019, and in 2016 we launched Wayfair.ca in Canada. Launching new brands and services or expanding internationally requires significant upfront investments, including investments in marketing, information technology and additional personnel. Expanding our brands internationally is particularly challenging because it requires us to gain country-specific knowledge about consumers, regional competitors and local laws, construct catalogs specific to the country, build local logistics capabilities and customize portions of our technology for local markets. We may not be able to generate satisfactory net revenue from these efforts to offset these costs. Any lack of market acceptance of our efforts to launch new brands and services or to expand our existing offerings could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results. Further, as we continue to expand our fulfillment capability or add new businesses with different requirements, our logistics networks become increasingly complex and operating them becomes more challenging. There can be no assurance that we will be able to operate our networks effectively.\nWe have also entered and may continue to enter new markets or channels in which we have limited or no experience, which may not be successful or appealing to our customers. These activities may present new and difficult technological and logistical challenges, and resulting service disruptions, failures or other quality issues may cause customer dissatisfaction and harm our reputation and brand. Further, our current and potential competitors in new market segments may have greater brand recognition, financial resources, longer operating histories and larger customer bases than we do in these areas. As a result, we may not be successful enough in these newer areas to recoup our investments in them. If this occurs, our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected.\nExpansion of our international operations will require management attention and resources, involves additional risks, and may be unsuccessful, which could harm our future business development and existing domestic operations.\nWe believe international expansion represents a significant growth opportunity for us. We currently deliver products to customers in a number of countries, and plan to expand into other international markets in order to grow our business, which will require significant management attention and resources. For example, we have made and will continue to make significant investments in information technology, logistics, supplier relationships, merchandising and marketing in the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate or plan to operate. We have limited experience in selling our products to conform to different local cultures, standards and regulations, and the products we offer may not appeal to customers in the same manner, if at all, in other geographies. We may have to compete with local companies who understand the local market better than we do and/or may have greater brand recognition than we do. In addition, to deliver satisfactory performance for customers in international locations, it may be necessary to locate physical facilities, such as consolidation centers and warehouses, in foreign markets, and we may have to invest in these facilities before we can determine whether or not our foreign operations are successful. We have limited experience establishing such facilities internationally and therefore may decide not to continue with the expansion of international operations. We may not be successful in expanding into additional international markets or in generating net revenue from foreign operations. Furthermore, different privacy, censorship, liability, intellectual property and other laws and regulations in foreign countries may cause our business, financial condition and operating results to be materially adversely affected.\nOur future results could be materially adversely affected by a number of factors inherent in international operations, including:\n\u2022localization of our product offerings, including translation into foreign languages and adaptation for local practices, standards and regulations;\n\u2022the need to vary our practices in ways with which we have limited or no experience or which are less profitable or carry more risk to us;\n\u2022new and different sources of competition;\n\u2022unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, taxes, trade laws, tariffs, export quotas, custom duties or other trade restrictions;\n\u2022differing labor regulations where labor laws may be more advantageous to employees as compared to the U.S.;\n\u2022different or more stringent regulations relating to data protection, privacy, encryption and security, including the use of commercial and personal information, particularly in the European Union;\n\u2022different laws or regulations regarding restrictions on pricing or discounts;\n\u2022changes in a specific country's or region's political or economic conditions, including the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union, commonly referred to as \"Brexit\";\n\u2022the rising cost of labor in the foreign countries in which our suppliers operate, resulting in increases in our costs of doing business internationally;\n\u2022challenges inherent in efficiently managing an increased number of employees over large geographic distances, including the need to implement appropriate systems, policies, benefits and compliance programs and maintain our corporate culture across geographies;\n\u2022risks resulting from changes in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022limitations on our ability to reinvest earnings from operations in one country to fund the capital needs of our operations in other countries;\n\u2022different or lesser intellectual property protection;\n\u2022exposure to liabilities under anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar laws and regulations in other jurisdictions;\n\u2022business licensing or certification requirements, such as for imports, exports and international operations;\n\u2022differing payment processing systems as well as consumer use and acceptance of electronic payment methods, such as payment cards; and\n\u2022differing fulfillment, distribution, logistics and systems infrastructure.\nOperating internationally requires significant management attention and financial resources. We cannot be certain that the investment and additional resources required to establish and expand our international operations will produce desired levels of net revenue or profitability. If we invest substantial time and resources to establish and expand our international operations and are unable to do so successfully and in a timely manner, our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected.\nFluctuations in currency exchange rates could adversely affect our financial performance and our reported results of operations.\nBecause we generate net revenue in the local currencies of our international business, our financial results are impacted by fluctuations in currency exchange rates. The results of operations of our international business are exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations as the financial results of the applicable subsidiaries are translated from the local currency to U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes. Our consolidated financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars and as a result fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect our results of operations or financial results. If the U.S. dollar weakens against foreign currencies, the translation of these foreign currency denominated net revenues or expenses will result in increased U.S. dollar denominated net revenues and expenses. Similarly, if the U.S. dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, particularly the euro, the British pound, or the Canadian dollar, our translation of foreign currency denominated net revenues or expenses will result in lower U.S. dollar denominated net revenues and expenses. To date, we have not entered into any currency hedging contracts. As a result, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates could significantly impact our financial results.\nFurther, Brexit has and may continue to have a significant impact on currency exchange rates and the global and European economy generally. The outcome of the referendum caused volatility in global stock markets and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, including the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the British pound and the euro, and such volatility may continue.\nWe have had a history of losses and we may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability and positive cash flow in the future as we continue to expand our business.\nWe have had a history of losses and negative cash flow and a resulting accumulated deficit of $1.9 billion as of December 31, 2021. Although we achieved profitability and positive cash flow in fiscal 2020, we incurred losses in fiscal year 2021 and we can provide no assurance that we will be profitable in future years or achieve our goal of sustained profitability. Because the market for purchasing home goods online is rapidly evolving and has not yet reached widespread adoption, it is difficult for us to predict our future operating results. As a result, we may incur future losses that may be larger than anticipated. Also, we expect our operating expenses to increase over the next several years as we expand internationally, expand into physical retail locations, continue to grow our proprietary logistics network, hire more employees and continue to develop new brands, features and services. Furthermore, if our future growth and operating performance fail to meet investor or analyst expectations, or if we have future negative cash flow or losses resulting from our investment in acquiring new customers, our financial condition and stock price could be materially adversely affected.\nSystem interruptions that impair customer access to our sites or other performance failures or incidents involving our logistics network, our technology infrastructure or our critical technology partners could damage our business, reputation and brand and substantially harm our business and results of operations.\nThe satisfactory performance, reliability and availability of our sites, transaction processing systems, logistics network and technology infrastructure are critical to our reputation and our ability to acquire and retain customers, as well as maintain adequate customer service levels.\nFor example, if one of our data centers or our cloud provider fails or suffers an interruption or degradation of services, we could lose customer data and miss order fulfillment deadlines, which could harm our business. Our systems and operations, including our ability to fulfill customer orders through our logistics network, are also vulnerable to damage or interruption from inclement weather, fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, terrorist attacks, labor disputes, cyber-attacks, data loss, acts of war, break-ins, other physical security threats, earthquake and similar events. In the event of a system outage or degradation, the failover to another site or a back-up could take substantial time, during which time our sites could be completely shut down. Further, our back-up services may not effectively process spikes in demand, may process transactions more slowly and may not support all of our sites' functionality.\nWe use complex proprietary software in our technology infrastructure, which we seek to continually update and improve. We may not always be successful in executing these upgrades and improvements, and the operation of our systems may be subject to failure. In particular, we have in the past and may in the future experience slowdowns or interruptions in some or all of our sites when we are updating them, and new technologies or infrastructures may not be fully integrated with existing systems on a timely basis, or at all. Additionally, we have expanded our use of third-party services, including third-party \"cloud\" computing services, and as a result our technology infrastructure may be subject to slowdowns or interruptions as a result of integration with such services and/or failures by such third-parties, which are out of our control. Our net revenue depends on the number of visitors who shop on our sites and the volume of orders we can handle. Unavailability of our sites or reduced order fulfillment performance would reduce the volume of goods sold and could also materially adversely affect consumer perception of our brand.\nWe may experience periodic system interruptions from time to time. In addition, continued growth in our transaction volume, as well as surges in online traffic and orders associated with promotional activities, seasonal trends in our business or the COVID-19 pandemic, place additional demands on our technology platform and could cause or exacerbate slowdowns or interruptions. If there is a substantial increase in the volume of traffic on our sites or the number of orders placed by customers, we may be required to further expand and upgrade our technology, logistics network, transaction processing systems and network infrastructure. There can be no assurance that we will be able to accurately project the rate or timing of increases, if any, in the use of our sites or expand and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to accommodate such increases on a timely basis. In order to remain competitive, we must continue to enhance and improve the responsiveness, functionality and features of our sites, which is particularly challenging given the rapid rate at which new technologies, customer preferences and expectations, and industry standards and practices are evolving in the e-commerce industry. Accordingly, we redesign and enhance various functions on our sites on a regular basis, and we may experience instability and performance issues as a result of these changes.\nAny slowdown, interruption or performance failure of our sites and the underlying technology and logistics infrastructure could harm our business, reputation and our ability to acquire, retain and serve our customers, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations. Our disaster recovery plan may be inadequate, and our business interruption insurance may not be sufficient to compensate us for the losses that could occur.\nWe rely upon Google Cloud to operate certain aspects of our service and any disruption of or interference with our use of the Google Cloud services would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted.\nGoogle Cloud provides a distributed computing infrastructure platform for business operations, or what is commonly referred to as a \"cloud\" computing service. We have architected our software and computer systems so as to also utilize data processing, storage capabilities and other services provided across multiple Google Cloud data centers. Given this, along with our inability to rapidly switch our Google Cloud operations to another cloud provider, any disruption of or interference with our use of Google Cloud or any widespread disruption in Google Cloud itself would impact our operations and our business would be adversely impacted.\nOur failure or the failure of third-party service providers to protect our sites, networks, systems, confidential information and assets against security breaches or loss could damage our reputation and brand and substantially harm our business and operating results.\nWe collect, maintain, transmit and store data about our customers, employees, contractors, suppliers, vendors and others, including credit card information and personally identifiable information, as well as other confidential and proprietary information. We also employ third-party service providers that store, process and transmit certain proprietary, personal and confidential information on our behalf. We rely on encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties in an effort to secure our systems and assets and securely transmit, encrypt, anonymize or pseudonymize certain confidential and sensitive information, including credit card numbers. Advances in computer capabilities, new technological discoveries or other developments may result in the whole or partial failure of this technology to protect our assets, our transaction and personal data or other confidential and sensitive information from being breached, compromised or lost. Despite all of our efforts to protect these assets, our security measures and those of our third-party service providers, may not be effective in preventing a failure of our systems, a loss of assets or a failure of our platforms to operate effectively and be available to us. This may be as a result of deliberate attempts to infiltrate our systems by state-sponsored attackers or cybercriminals, denial-of-service attacks, viruses, malicious software, zero-day vulnerabilities, break-ins, phishing attacks, social engineering, security breaches or other attacks, or incidents due to employee error or malfeasance. Failures may also be caused by various other factors, including, disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing computer software or hardware, power outages, hardware and software errors by the vendors we rely upon, telecommunication or utility failures or natural disasters or other catastrophic events or other disruptions that may jeopardize the security of our assets or information stored in or transmitted by our sites, networks and systems or that we or our third-party service providers otherwise maintain, process or transmit including payment card systems and human resources management platforms. We and our service providers may not anticipate or prevent all types of attacks until after they have already been launched, and techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to or sabotage systems change frequently and may not be known until launched against us or our third-party service providers. In addition, security breaches or data and asset leaks can also occur as a result of non-technical issues, including intentional or inadvertent actions by our employees or by persons with whom we have commercial relationships.\nCyber security incidents, data or asset losses or breaches of our security measures or those of our third-party service providers could result in unauthorized access to our sites, networks and systems; unauthorized access to and misappropriation of personal information, including consumers' and employees' personally identifiable information, or other confidential or proprietary information of ours or our third parties; limited or terminated access to certain payment methods or fines or higher transaction fees to use such methods; viruses, worms, spyware or other malware being served from our sites, networks or systems; deletion or modification of content or the display of unauthorized content on our sites; interruption, disruption or malfunction of operations; costs relating to breach remediation, deployment or training of additional personnel and protection technologies, responses to governmental investigations and media inquiries and coverage; engagement of third party experts and consultants; litigation, regulatory action and other potential liabilities. If any of these breaches of security or other incidents occur, our reputation and brand could be damaged, our business may suffer, we could be required to expend significant capital and other resources to alleviate problems caused by such incidents, such as investigative and remediation costs, the costs of providing individuals and/or data owners with notice of the breach, legal fees, the costs of any additional fraud detection activities, or the costs of prolonged system disruptions or shutdowns, and we could be exposed to a risk of loss, litigation or regulatory action and possible liability. In addition, any party who is able to illicitly obtain a customer's password could access that customer's transaction data or personal information. Any compromise or breach of our security measures, or those of our third-party service\nproviders, could violate applicable privacy, data security and other laws and regulations, and cause significant legal and financial exposure, adverse publicity and a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Although we maintain privacy, data breach and network security liability insurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all. We may need to devote significant resources to protect against security breaches or to address problems caused by breaches, diverting resources from the growth and expansion of our business.\nOur business is highly competitive. Competition presents an ongoing threat to the success of our business.\nOur business is rapidly evolving and intensely competitive, and we have many competitors in different industries. Our competition includes furniture stores, big box retailers, department stores, specialty retailers and online retailers and marketplaces in the U.S., Canada, the United Kingdom and Germany, including those listed in Part I, Item 1, Business.\nWe expect competition in e-commerce generally to continue to increase. We believe that our ability to compete successfully depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control, including:\n\u2022the size and composition of our customer base;\n\u2022the number of suppliers and products we feature on our sites;\n\u2022our selling and marketing efforts;\n\u2022the quality, price and reliability of products we offer;\n\u2022the convenience of the shopping experience that we provide;\n\u2022our ability to distribute our products and manage our operations; and\n\u2022our reputation and brand strength.\nMany of our current competitors have, and potential competitors may have, longer operating histories, greater brand recognition, larger fulfillment infrastructures, greater technical capabilities, faster and less costly shipping, significantly greater financial, marketing and other resources and larger customer bases than we do. These factors may allow our competitors to derive greater net revenue and profits from their existing customer base, acquire customers at lower costs or respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in consumer habits. These competitors may engage in more extensive research and development efforts, undertake more far-reaching marketing campaigns and adopt more aggressive pricing policies, which may allow them to build larger customer bases or generate net revenue from their customer bases more effectively than we do.\nPurchasers of home goods may not choose to shop online, which would prevent us from growing our business.\nWe believe the online market for home goods is less developed than the online market for apparel, consumer electronics and other consumer products and, we believe, only accounts for a small portion of the market as a whole. If the online market for home goods does not gain acceptance, our business may suffer. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to attract consumers who have historically purchased home goods through traditional retailers. Furthermore, we may have to incur significantly higher and more sustained advertising and promotional expenditures in order to attract additional online consumers to our sites and convert them into purchasing customers. Specific factors that could impact consumers' willingness to purchase home goods from us include:\n\u2022concerns about buying products, and in particular larger products, without a physical storefront, face-to-face interaction with sales personnel and the ability to physically examine products;\n\u2022delivery time associated with online orders;\n\u2022actual or perceived lack of security of online transactions and concerns regarding the privacy or protection of personal information;\n\u2022delayed shipments or shipments of incorrect or damaged products;\n\u2022inconvenience associated with returning or exchanging items purchased online; and\n\u2022usability, functionality and features of our sites.\nIf the shopping experience we provide does not appeal to consumers or meet the expectations of existing customers, we may not acquire new customers at rates consistent with historical periods, acquired customers may not become repeat customers and existing customers' buying patterns and levels may be less than historical rates.\nWe may be subject to product liability and other similar claims if people or property are harmed by the products we sell.\nSome of the products we sell may expose us to product liability and other claims and litigation (including class actions) or regulatory action relating to safety, personal injury, death or environmental or property damage. Some of our agreements with members of our supply chain may not indemnify us from product liability for a particular product, and some members of our supply chain may not have sufficient resources or insurance to satisfy their indemnity and defense obligations. Although we maintain liability insurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate for liabilities actually incurred or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all.\nRisks associated with the suppliers from whom our products are sourced could materially adversely affect our financial performance as well as our reputation and brand.\nWe depend on our ability to provide our customers with a wide range of products from qualified suppliers in a timely and efficient manner. Political and economic instability, global or regional adverse conditions, such as pandemics or other disease outbreaks or natural disasters, the financial stability of suppliers, suppliers' ability to meet our standards, labor problems experienced by suppliers, the availability or cost of raw materials, merchandise quality issues, currency exchange rates, trade tariff developments, transport availability and cost, including import-related taxes, transport security, labor inflation and other factors relating to our suppliers are beyond our control. As an example, the COVID-19 pandemic has and may continue to adversely impact supplier facilities and operations due to factory closures, raw material and labor inflation and risks of labor shortages, among other things, which may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur agreements with most of our suppliers do not provide for the long-term availability of merchandise or the continuation of particular pricing practices, nor do they usually restrict such suppliers from selling products to other buyers. There can be no assurance that our current suppliers will continue to seek to sell us products on current terms or that we will be able to establish new or otherwise extend current supply relationships to ensure product availability on acceptable commercial terms. Our ability to develop and maintain relationships with reputable suppliers and offer high quality merchandise to our customers is critical to our success. If we are unable to develop and maintain relationships with suppliers that would allow us to offer a sufficient amount and variety of quality merchandise on acceptable commercial terms, our ability to satisfy our customers' needs, and therefore our long-term growth prospects, would be materially adversely affected.\nFurther, we rely on our suppliers\u2019 representations of product quality, safety and compliance with applicable laws and standards. If our suppliers or other vendors violate our agreements, applicable laws or regulations, or implement practices regarded as unethical, unsafe, or hazardous to the environment, it could damage our reputation and negatively affect our operating results. Further, concerns regarding the safety and quality of products provided by our suppliers could cause our customers to avoid purchasing those products from us, or avoid purchasing products from us altogether, even if the basis for the concern is outside our control. As such, any issue, or perceived issue, regarding the quality and safety of any items we sell, regardless of the cause, could adversely affect our brand, reputation, operations and financial results.\nWe also are unable to predict whether any of the countries in which our suppliers' products are currently manufactured or may be manufactured in the future will be subject to new, different, or additional trade restrictions imposed by the U.S. or foreign governments or the likelihood, type or effect of any such restrictions. Any event causing a disruption or delay of imports from suppliers with international manufacturing operations, including the imposition of additional import restrictions, restrictions on the transfer of funds or increased tariffs or quotas, could increase the cost or reduce the supply of merchandise available to our customers and materially adversely affect our financial performance as well as our reputation and brand. Furthermore, some or all of our suppliers' foreign operations may be adversely affected by political and financial instability, resulting in the disruption of trade from exporting countries, restrictions on the transfer of funds or other trade disruptions.\nIn addition, our business with foreign suppliers, particularly with respect to our international sites, may be affected by changes in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other foreign currencies. For example, any movement by any other foreign currency against the U.S. dollar may result in higher costs to us for those goods. Declines in foreign currencies and currency exchange rates might negatively affect the profitability and business prospects of one or more of our foreign suppliers. This, in turn, might cause such foreign suppliers to demand higher prices for merchandise in their effort to offset any lost profits associated with any currency devaluation, delay merchandise shipments, or discontinue selling to us altogether, any of which could ultimately reduce our sales or increase our costs.\nWe may be unable to source new suppliers or strengthen our relationships with current suppliers.\nWe have relationships with over 23,000 suppliers. Our agreements with suppliers are generally terminable at will by either party upon short notice. If we do not maintain our existing relationships or build new relationships with suppliers on acceptable commercial terms, we may not be able to maintain a broad selection of merchandise, and our business and prospects would suffer severely.\nIn order to attract quality suppliers to our platform, we must:\n\u2022demonstrate our ability to help our suppliers increase their sales;\n\u2022offer suppliers a high quality, cost-effective fulfillment process; and\n\u2022continue to provide suppliers with a dynamic and real-time view of our demand and inventory needs.\nIf we are unable to provide our suppliers with a compelling return on investment and an ability to increase their sales, we may be unable to maintain and/or expand our supplier network, which would negatively impact our business.\nWe depend on our suppliers to perform certain services regarding the products that we offer.\nAs part of offering our suppliers' products for sale on our sites, suppliers are often responsible for conducting a number of traditional retail operations with respect to their respective products, including maintaining inventory, preparing merchandise for shipment to our customers, and, in some cases, delivering products on our behalf. In these instances, we may be unable to ensure that suppliers will perform these services to our or our customers' satisfaction in a manner that provides our customer with a unified brand experience or on commercially reasonable terms. If our customers become dissatisfied with the services provided by our suppliers, our business, reputation and brands could suffer.\nWe depend on our relationships with third parties, including our suppliers and logistics carriers, and changes in our relationships with these parties could adversely impact our net revenue and profits.\nWe rely on third parties to operate certain elements of our business. For example, carriers such as FedEx, UPS, DHL and the U.S. Postal Service deliver many of our small parcel products, and third party national, regional and local transportation companies deliver a portion of our large parcel products, including through our WDN. Our ability to efficiently ship products to customers may be negatively affected by factors beyond our and our carriers' control, including inclement weather, natural disasters, system interruptions and technology failures, labor activism, supply chain issues, including congestion and delays, labor inflation and increased costs, health pandemics and epidemics (including the COVID-19 pandemic) or bioterrorism. We are also subject to risks of breakage or other damage during delivery by any of these third parties. We also use and rely on other services from third parties, such as cloud computing services, telecommunications services, customs, consolidation and shipping services, as well as warranty, installation, assembly and design services. We may be unable to maintain these relationships, and these services may also be subject to outages and interruptions that are not within our control. For example, failures by our telecommunications providers have in the past and may in the future interrupt our ability to provide phone support to our customers. Third parties may in the future determine they no longer wish to do business with us or may decide to take other actions that could harm our business. We may also determine that we no longer want to do business with them. If products are not delivered in a timely fashion or are damaged during the delivery process, or if we are not able to provide adequate customer support or other services or offerings, our customers could become dissatisfied and cease buying products through our sites, which would adversely affect our operating results.\nIf our internal control over financial reporting or our disclosure controls and procedures are not effective, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, prevent fraud or file our periodic reports in a timely manner, which may cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and may lead to a decline in our stock price.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires that we maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. In particular, we must perform system and process evaluation, document our controls and perform testing of our key control over financial reporting to allow management and our independent public accounting firm to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Our testing, or the subsequent testing by our independent public accounting firm, may reveal deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses. If we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, or if we or our accounting firm identify deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, the market price of our stock would likely decline and we could be subject to lawsuits, sanctions or investigations by regulatory authorities, including SEC enforcement actions, and we could be required to restate our financial results, any of which would require additional financial and management resources.\nWe continue to invest in more robust technology and resources to manage those reporting requirements. Implementing the appropriate changes to our internal controls may distract our officers and employees, result in substantial costs and require significant time to complete. Any difficulties or delays in implementing these controls could impact our ability to timely report our financial results. For these reasons, we may encounter difficulties in the timely and accurate reporting of our financial results, which would impact our ability to provide our investors with information in a timely manner. As a result, our investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, and our stock price could decline.\nIn addition, any such changes do not guarantee that we will be effective in maintaining the adequacy of our internal controls, and any failure to maintain that adequacy could prevent us from accurately reporting our financial results.\nFurther, we have not experienced any material impact to our internal controls over financial reporting despite the fact that most of our employees continue to work remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but we may experience a material impact in the future. As the majority of our employees continue to work from home in some capacity, new processes, procedures and controls could be required to respond to changes in our business environment, and should any key employees become ill from COVID-19 and unable to work, our ability to operate our internal controls may be adversely affected.\nWe may be unable to accurately forecast our financial and operating results and appropriately plan our expenses in the future.\nOur financial and operating results are inherently uncertain and difficult to forecast because they generally depend on the volume, timing and type of orders we receive, all of which are uncertain. In particular, we cannot be sure that our historical growth rates, trends and other key performance metrics are meaningful predictors of future growth. In addition, our mix of product offerings is highly variable from day-to-day and quarter-to-quarter. This variability makes it difficult to predict sales and could result in significant fluctuations in our net revenue from period-to-period. Our business is also affected by general economic and business conditions globally. As a result, forecasted financial and operating results may differ materially from actual results, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and stock price. For example, if certain of our assumptions or estimates prove to be wrong, we may spend more than we anticipate acquiring and retaining customers or may generate less net revenue per active customer than anticipated, which could cause us to miss our earnings guidance or negatively impact the results we report, either of which could negatively impact our stock price.\nSeasonal trends in our business create variability in our financial and operating results and place increased strain on our operations.\nHistorically, we have experienced surges in online traffic and orders associated with promotional activities and seasonal trends. This activity may place additional demands on our technology systems and logistics network and could cause or exacerbate slowdowns or interruptions. Any such system, site or service interruptions could prevent us from efficiently receiving or fulfilling orders, which may reduce the volume or quality of goods or services we sell and may cause customer dissatisfaction and harm our reputation and brand.\nHowever, beginning in mid-March 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic and the related responses disrupted our usual seasonal patterns, resulting in higher sales volumes during the second and third fiscal quarters of 2020. During fiscal year 2021, as global economies began to reopen with rising vaccination rates during the first half of the year, spending patterns shifted as consumers moved back to experiential categories in a broad fashion. The combination of these changes in consumer spending with continued global supply chain challenges, led to lower sales in the second half of the year as compared to the first.\nOur ability to raise capital in the future may be limited, and our failure to raise capital when needed could prevent us from growing.\nIn the future, we could be required to or may decide to raise capital through public or private financing or other arrangements. Such financing may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all, and our failure to raise capital when needed or desired could harm our business. Our ability to raise additional capital, if and when required, will depend on, among other factors, investor demand, our operating performance, our credit rating and the condition of the capital markets. We may sell Class A common stock, convertible securities and other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner as we may determine from time to time. Our convertible notes are and any future issuance of equity or equity-linked securities would be dilutive to holders of our Class A common stock. New investors in such subsequent transactions could gain rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our Class A common stock or our convertible notes. Debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants and could reduce our operational flexibility or profitability. If we cannot raise funds on acceptable terms, we may not be able to grow our business or respond to competitive pressures.\nOur business may be adversely affected if we are unable to provide our customers a cost-effective shopping platform that is able to respond and adapt to rapid changes in technology.\nThe number of people who access the Internet through devices other than personal computers, including mobile phones, smartphones, smartwatches, handheld computers such as notebooks and tablets, video game consoles and television set-top devices, has increased dramatically in the past few years. We continually upgrade existing technologies and business applications to keep pace with these rapidly changing and continuously evolving technologies, and we may be required to implement new technologies or business applications in the future. The implementation of these upgrades and changes requires significant investments and as new devices, operating systems and platforms are released, it is difficult to predict requirements or the problems we may encounter in developing applications for these alternative devices, operating systems and platforms. Additionally, we may need to devote significant resources to the support and maintenance of such applications once created. Our results of operations may be affected by the timing, effectiveness and costs associated with the successful implementation of any upgrades or changes to our systems and infrastructure to accommodate such alternative devices, operating systems and platforms. Further, in the event that it is more difficult or less compelling for our customers to buy products from us on their mobile or other devices, or if our customers choose not to buy products from us on such devices or to use mobile or other products that do not offer access to our sites or limit the effectiveness of our marketing or other offerings, our customer growth could be harmed and our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected.\nSignificant merchandise returns could harm our business.\nWe allow our customers to return products, subject to our return policy. If merchandise returns are significant, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations could be harmed. Further, we modify our policies relating to returns from time to time, which may result in customer dissatisfaction or an increase in the number of product returns. Many of our products are large and require special handling and delivery. From time to time our products are damaged in transit, which can increase return rates and harm our brand.\nUncertainties in global economic conditions and their impact on consumer spending patterns, particularly in the home goods market, could adversely impact our operating results.\nConsumers may view a substantial portion of the products we offer as discretionary items rather than necessities. As a result, our operating results are sensitive to changes in macro-economic conditions that impact consumer spending, including discretionary spending. Some of the factors adversely affecting consumer spending include levels of unemployment; consumer debt levels; changes in net worth based on market changes and uncertainty; home foreclosures and changes in home values or the overall housing, residential construction or home improvement markets; fluctuating interest rates; credit availability, including mortgages, home equity loans and consumer credit; government actions; fluctuating fuel and other energy costs; inflation; fluctuating commodity prices and general uncertainty regarding the overall future economic environment. Adverse economic changes in any of the regions in which we sell our products could reduce consumer confidence and could negatively affect net revenue and have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nOur business relies heavily on email and other messaging services, and any restrictions on the sending of emails or messages or an inability to timely deliver such communications could materially adversely affect our net revenue and business.\nOur business is highly dependent upon email and other messaging services for promoting our sites and products. Daily promotions offered through emails and other messages sent by us, or on our behalf by our vendors, generate a significant portion of our net revenue. We provide daily emails and \"push\" communications to customers and other visitors informing them of what is available for purchase on our sites that day, and we believe these messages are an important part of our customer experience and help generate a substantial portion of our net revenue. If we are unable to successfully deliver emails or other messages to our subscribers, or if subscribers decline to open our emails or other messages, our net revenue and profitability would be materially adversely affected. Changes in how webmail applications organize and prioritize email may also reduce the number of subscribers opening our emails. For example, Google's Gmail service has a feature that organizes incoming emails into categories and such categorization or similar inbox organizational features may result in our emails being delivered in a less prominent location in a subscriber's inbox or viewed as \"spam\" by our subscribers and may reduce the likelihood of that subscriber opening our emails. Actions by third parties to block, impose restrictions on or charge for the delivery of emails or other messages could also adversely impact our business. From time to time, Internet service providers or other third parties may block bulk email transmissions or otherwise experience technical difficulties that result in our inability to successfully deliver emails or other messages to third parties. Changes in the laws or regulations that limit our ability to send such communications or impose additional requirements upon us in connection with sending such communications would also materially adversely impact our business. Our use of email and other messaging services to send communications about our sites or other matters may also result in legal claims against us, which may cause us increased expenses, and if successful might result in fines and orders with costly reporting and compliance obligations or might limit or prohibit our ability to send emails or other messages. We also rely on social networking messaging services to send communications and to encourage customers to send communications. Changes to the terms of these social networking services to limit promotional communications, any restrictions that would limit our ability or our customers' ability to send communications through their services, disruptions or downtime experienced by these social networking services or decline in the use of or engagement with social networking services by customers and potential customers could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe are subject to risks related to online transactions and payment methods.\nWe accept payments using a variety of methods, including credit card, debit card, PayPal, credit accounts (including promotional financing), gift cards and customer invoicing. We rely on third parties to provide many of these payment methods and payment processing services, including certain Wayfair-branded programs and promotional financing. As we offer new payment options to consumers, we may be subject to additional regulations, compliance requirements and fraud. For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs and lower profitability. We also offer private label and/or co-branded credit card programs, which could adversely affect our operating results if terminated. We are also subject to payment card association operating rules and certification requirements, including the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard and rules governing electronic funds transfers, which could change or be reinterpreted to make it difficult or impossible for us to comply. As our business changes, we may also be subject to different rules under existing standards, which may require new assessments that involve costs above what we currently pay for compliance. If we fail to comply with the rules or requirements of any provider of a payment method we accept, if the volume of fraud in our transactions limits or terminates our rights to use payment methods we currently accept, or if a data breach occurs relating to our payment systems, we may, among other things, be subject to fines or higher transaction fees and may lose, or face restrictions placed upon, our ability to accept credit card and debit card payments from consumers or to facilitate other types of online payments. If any of these events were to occur, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nWe occasionally receive orders placed with fraudulent credit card data. We may suffer losses as a result of orders placed with fraudulent credit card data even if the associated financial institution approved payment of the orders. Under current credit card practices, we may be liable for fraudulent credit card transactions. We may also suffer losses from other online transaction fraud, including fraudulent returns. If we are unable to detect or control credit card or transaction fraud, our liability for these transactions could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur business could suffer if we are unsuccessful in making, integrating and maintaining acquisitions and investments.\nAs part of our business strategy, we may acquire other companies, businesses or assets. However, we may not be able to find suitable acquisition candidates, and we may not be able to complete acquisitions on favorable terms, if at all. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, any of which could harm our business, including: difficulties in integrating the technologies, operations, existing contracts and personnel of an acquired company; difficulties in supporting and transitioning customers and suppliers, if any, of an acquired company; diversion of financial and management resources from existing operations or alternative acquisition opportunities; failure to realize the anticipated benefits or synergies of a transaction; failure to identify all of the problems, liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired company or technology, including issues related to intellectual property, regulatory compliance practices, liabilities related to data security and privacy of customer data, the acquired company's internal controls over financial reporting, including revenue recognition or other accounting practices; employee or customer issues; risks of entering new markets in which we have limited or no experience; potential loss of senior management or other key employees, customers and suppliers from either our current business or an acquired company's business; inability to generate sufficient net revenue to offset acquisition costs; additional costs or equity dilution associated with funding the acquisition; and possible write-offs or impairment charges relating to acquired businesses, and these liabilities may be greater than the warranty and indemnity limitations we negotiate.\nIn addition, our investments in properties may not be fully realized. We continually review our operations and facilities in an effort to reduce costs and increase efficiencies. For strategic or other operational reasons, we may decide to consolidate or co-locate certain aspects of our business operations or dispose of one or more of our properties. If we decide to fully or partially vacate a leased property, we may incur significant costs, including facility closing costs, employee separation and retention expenses, lease termination fees, rent expense in excess of sublease income, impairment charges for right-of-use (\"ROU\") assets and leasehold improvements and accelerated depreciation of assets. Any of these events may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe rely on the performance of members of management and highly skilled personnel, and if we are unable to attract, develop, motivate and retain well-qualified employees, our business could be harmed.\nWe believe our success has depended, and continues to depend, on the efforts and talents of Niraj Shah, one of our co-founders, co-chairman of the board of directors (the \"Board\") and our Chief Executive Officer, Steven Conine, one of our co-founders and co-chairman of the Board, and the other members of our senior management team. The loss of any of our senior management or other key employees could materially harm our business. Our future success also depends on our continuing ability to attract, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified and skilled employees, particularly mid-level managers, engineers and merchandising and technology personnel. The market for such positions in the Boston area and other cities in which we operate is competitive and has intensified and may continue to intensify if overall demand in the labor market continues to increase or we incur attrition at levels higher than we have historically. Qualified individuals are in high demand, and we may incur significant costs to attract them. Our inability to recruit and develop mid-level managers, including through virtual-only outreach due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, could materially adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan, and we may not be able to find adequate replacements, particularly in light of high attrition rates in some regions where we have operations. All of our officers and other U.S. employees are at-will employees, meaning that they may terminate their employment relationship with us at any time, and their knowledge of our business and industry would be extremely difficult to replace. If we do not succeed in attracting well-qualified employees or retaining and motivating existing employees, our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights.\nWe regard our customer lists, trademarks, domain names, copyrights, patents, trade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technology and similar intellectual property as critical to our success, and we rely on trademark, copyright and patent law, trade secret protection, agreements and other methods with our employees and others to protect our proprietary rights. We might not be able to obtain broad protection in the U.S. or internationally for all of our intellectual property, and we might not be able to obtain effective intellectual property protection in every country in which we sell products or perform services. For example, we are the registrant of marks for our brands in numerous jurisdictions and of the Internet domain name for the websites of Wayfair.com, Wayfair.ca, Wayfair.co.uk, Wayfair.de and our other sites, as well as various related domain names. However, we have not registered our marks or domain names in all major international jurisdictions and may not be able to register or use such domain names in all of the countries in which we currently or intend to conduct business. Further, we might not be able to prevent third parties from registering, using or retaining domain names that interfere with our consumer communications or infringe or otherwise decrease the value of our marks, domain names and other proprietary rights.\nThe protection of our intellectual property rights may require the expenditure of significant financial, managerial and operational resources. We may initiate claims or litigation against others for infringement, misappropriation or violation of our intellectual property rights or proprietary rights or to establish the validity of such rights. Any litigation, whether or not it is resolved in our favor, could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel, which may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. Moreover, the steps we take to protect our intellectual property may not adequately protect our rights or prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating our proprietary rights, and we may not be able to broadly enforce all of our trademarks or patents. Any of our patents, marks or other intellectual property rights may be challenged by others or invalidated through administrative process or litigation. Our patent and trademark applications may never be granted. Additionally, the process of obtaining intellectual property protections is expensive and time-consuming, and we may not be able to pursue all necessary or desirable actions at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. Even if issued, there can be no assurance that these protections will adequately safeguard our intellectual property, as the legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of patent and other intellectual property rights are uncertain. We also cannot be certain that others will not independently develop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology or intellectual property rights. We may also be exposed to claims from third parties claiming infringement of their intellectual property rights, demanding the release or license of open source software or derivative works that we developed using such software (which could include our proprietary code) or otherwise seeking to enforce the terms of the applicable open source license. These claims could result in litigation and could require us to purchase a costly license, publicly release the affected portions of our source code, be limited in or cease using the implicated software unless and until we can re-engineer such software to avoid infringement or change the use of the implicated open source software.\nWe have been, and may again be, accused of infringing intellectual property rights of third parties.\nThe e-commerce industry is characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights, which has resulted in protracted and expensive litigation for many companies. We are subject to claims and litigation by third parties that we infringe their intellectual property rights, and we expect additional claims and litigation with respect to infringement to occur in the future. The costs of supporting such litigation and disputes are considerable, and there can be no assurances that favorable outcomes will be obtained. As our business expands and the number of competitors in our market increases and overlaps occur, we expect that infringement claims may increase in number and significance. Any claims or proceedings against us, whether meritorious or not, could be time-consuming, result in considerable litigation costs, require significant amounts of management time or result in the diversion of significant operational resources, any of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nLegal claims regarding intellectual property rights are subject to inherent uncertainties due to the oftentimes complex issues involved, and we cannot be certain that we will be successful in defending ourselves against such claims. In addition, some of our larger competitors have extensive portfolios of issued patents. Many potential litigants, including patent holding companies, have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to enforce their intellectual property rights and to defend claims that may be brought against them. Furthermore, a successful claimant could secure a judgment that requires us to pay substantial damages or prevents us from conducting our business as we have historically done or may desire to do in the future. We might also be required to seek a license and pay royalties for the use of such intellectual property, which may not be available on commercially acceptable terms, or at all. Alternatively, we may be required to develop non-infringing technology or intellectual property, which could require significant effort and expense and may ultimately not be successful.\nWe have received in the past, and we may receive in the future, communications alleging that certain items posted on or sold through our sites violate third-party copyrights, designs, marks and trade names or other intellectual property rights or other proprietary rights. Brand and content owners and other proprietary rights owners have actively asserted their purported rights against online companies, including Wayfair. In addition to litigation from rights owners, we may be subject to regulatory, civil or criminal proceedings and penalties if governmental authorities believe we have aided and abetted in the sale of counterfeit or infringing products.\nSuch claims, whether or not meritorious, may result in the expenditure of significant financial, managerial and operational resources, injunctions against us or the payment of damages by us. We may need to obtain licenses from third parties who allege that we have violated their rights, but such licenses may not be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. These risks have been amplified by the increase in third parties whose sole or primary business is to assert such claims.\nWe are engaged in legal proceedings that could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses and could occupy a significant amount of our management's time and attention.\nFrom time to time, we are subject to litigation or claims that could negatively affect our business operations and financial position. As we have grown, we have seen a rise in the number of litigation matters against us. These matters have included intellectual property claims, employment related litigation, as well as consumer and securities class actions, each of which are typically expensive to defend. Litigation disputes could cause us to incur unforeseen expenses, result in site unavailability, service disruptions and otherwise occupy a significant amount of our management's time and attention, any of which could negatively affect our business operations and financial position. We also from time to time receive inquiries and subpoenas and other types of information requests from government authorities and we may become subject to related claims and other actions related to our business activities. While the ultimate outcome of investigations, inquiries, information requests and related legal proceedings is difficult to predict, such matters can be expensive, time-consuming and distracting, and adverse resolutions or settlements of those matters may result in, among other things, modification of our business practices, reputational harm or costs and significant payments, any of which could negatively affect our business operations and financial position.\nWe cannot guarantee that our stock repurchase program will be fully consummated or that it will enhance long-term shareholder value. Stock repurchases could also increase the volatility of the trading price of our stock and could diminish our cash reserves.\nIn August 2020, the Board authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $700 million of our Class A common stock in the open market, through privately negotiated transactions, or otherwise, including pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan (the \u201c2020 Repurchase Program\u201d). On August 10, 2021, the Board authorized a new $1.0 billion stock repurchase program on the same terms (the \u201c2021 Repurchase Program\u201d together with the 2020 Repurchase Program, the \u201cRepurchase Programs\u201d). Wayfair will begin repurchasing shares under the 2021 Repurchase Program upon the completion of the 2020 Repurchase Program. Although the Board has authorized the Repurchase Programs, the programs do not obligate us to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares. Even if our Repurchase Programs are fully implemented, we cannot guarantee that the Repurchase Programs will be fully consummated or that the programs will enhance long-term stockholder value. The programs could affect the trading price of our Class A common stock and increase volatility, and any announcement of a termination of either program may result in a decrease in the trading price of our Class A common stock. In addition, the amount, timing, and execution of our Repurchase Programs may fluctuate based on our priorities for the use of cash for other purposes and because of changes in cash flows, tax laws, and the market price of our Class A common stock, and the Repurchase Programs could diminish our cash reserves.\nRisks Related to Laws and Regulations\nGovernment regulation of the Internet and e-commerce is evolving, and unfavorable changes or failure by us to comply with these regulations could substantially harm our business and operating results.\nWe are subject to general business regulations and laws as well as regulations and laws specifically governing the Internet and e-commerce. Existing and future regulations and laws could impede the growth of the Internet, e-commerce or mobile commerce. These regulations and laws may involve taxes, tariffs, privacy and data security, anti-spam, content protection, electronic contracts and communications, consumer protection, Internet neutrality and gift cards. It is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as property ownership, sales and other taxes and consumer privacy apply to the Internet as the vast majority of these laws were adopted prior to the advent of the Internet and do not contemplate or address the unique issues raised by the Internet or e-commerce. It is possible that general business regulations and laws, or those specifically governing the Internet or e-commerce, may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or our practices. We cannot be sure that our practices have complied, comply or will comply fully with all such laws and regulations. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with any of these laws or regulations could result in damage to our reputation, a loss in business and proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others. Any such proceeding or action could hurt our reputation, force us to spend significant amounts in defense of these proceedings, distract our management, increase our costs of doing business, decrease the use of our sites by consumers and suppliers and may result in the imposition of monetary liability. We may also be contractually liable to indemnify and hold harmless third parties from the costs or consequences of non-compliance with any such laws or regulations. In addition, it is possible that governments of one or more countries may seek to censor content available on our sites or may even attempt to completely block access to our sites. Adverse legal or regulatory developments could substantially harm our business. In particular, in the event that we are restricted, in whole or in part, from operating in one or more countries, our ability to retain or increase our customer base may be adversely affected, and we may not be able to maintain or grow our net revenue and expand our business as anticipated. Further, as we enter new market segments or channels or geographical areas and expand the products and services we offer, we may be subject to\nadditional laws and regulatory requirements or prohibited from conducting our business, or certain aspects of it, in certain jurisdictions. We will incur additional costs complying with these additional obligations and any failure or perceived failure to comply would adversely affect our business and reputation.\nFailure to comply with federal, state and international laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection and consumer protection, or the expansion of current, or the enactment of new, laws or regulations relating to privacy, data protection and consumer protection, could adversely affect our business and our financial condition.\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state and international laws and regulations which govern the collection, use, retention, sharing, processing, export and security of personal information. These laws and regulations are complex and rapidly evolving and subject to potentially differing interpretations.\nThere is no harmonized approach to these laws and regulations. Consequently, we increase our risk of non-compliance with applicable foreign data protection laws and regulations as we continue our international expansion. We may need to change and limit the way we use personal information in operating our business and may have difficulty maintaining a single operating model that is compliant. Further, many of these laws may require consent from consumers for the use of data for various purposes, including marketing, which may reduce our ability to market our products. Compliance with such laws and regulations will result in additional costs and may necessitate changes to our business practices and divergent operating models, which may adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nAmong others, we are subject to the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cEU GDPR\u201d) in the European Union (\u201cEU\u201d). Following the United Kingdom\u2019s (\u201cU.K.\u201d) withdrawal from the EU, the EU GDPR has been incorporated into U.K. laws (\u201cU.K. GDPR\u201d), together with the EU GDPR referred to as \u201cGDPR\u201d). The GDPR is wide-ranging in scope and imposes numerous requirements on companies that process personal data, including providing information to individuals regarding data processing activities, implementing safeguards to protect the security and confidentiality of personal data, where required providing notification of data breaches, and taking certain measures when engaging third-party processors. The GDPR also restricts transfers of data outside of the European Economic Area and the United Kingdom. Data protection authorities hold a number of enforcement powers, including issuing fines of up to 4% of global annual turnover or \u20ac20 million (\u00a317.5 million) (whichever is higher) for the most serious infringements.\nThe GDPR includes restrictions on cross-border data transfers. Adequate safeguards must be implemented to enable the transfer of personal data outside of the EEA or the U.K., in particular to the U.S., in compliance with GDPR. On June 4, 2021, the European Commission (\u201cEC\u201d) issued new forms of standard contractual clauses for data transfers from controllers or processors in the EEA (or otherwise subject to the EU GDPR) to controllers or processors established outside the EEA. The U.K. is not subject to the EC\u2019s new standard contractual clauses but has published its own version of standard clauses and, unless objections are raised, will enter into force on March 21, 2022 to enable transfers originating from the U.K to third countries. We will be required to implement these new safeguards when conducting restricted data transfers under the GDPR and doing so may require significant effort and cost. The EC has currently concluded that the U.K. ensures an equivalent level of data protection to the GDPR, which provides some relief regarding the legality of continued personal data flows from the EEA to the U.K, and the U.K. Government has confirmed that transfers from the U.K. to the EEA may currently continue to flow freely. Changes with respect to any of these matters may lead to additional costs and increase our overall risk exposure.\nFurther, we are subject to various state privacy laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA), which came into effect in January of 2020; the California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), which will go into effect in 2023; the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act (Virginia CDPA), which will go into effect in 2023; and the Colorado Privacy Act (ColoPA), which will go into effect in 2023; all of which give new data privacy rights to their respective residents (including, in California, a private right of action in the event of a data breach resulting from our failure to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices) and impose significant obligations on controllers and processors of consumer data. The potential effects of these laws, and any other regulations under consideration around the globe, are far-reaching, uncertain, and evolving, and may require us to modify our data processing practices and policies and incur substantial costs and expenses in an effort to comply.\nThese requirements may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another or may conflict with other rules or our practices. As a result, our practices may not comply, or may not comply in the future, with all such laws, regulations, requirements and obligations. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with our posted privacy policies or with any federal, state or international privacy or consumer protection-related laws, regulations, industry self-regulatory principles, industry standards or codes of conduct, regulatory guidance, orders to which we may be subject or other legal obligations relating to privacy or consumer protection could adversely affect our reputation, brand and business, and may\nresult in claims, proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others or other liabilities or require us to change our operations and/or cease using certain data sets. Any such claim, proceeding or action, including a complaint by an activist to a regulatory authority or other public statement criticizing our practices, could hurt our reputation, brand and business, force us to incur significant expenses in defense of such proceedings, distract our management, increase our costs of doing business, result in a loss of customers and suppliers and may result in the imposition of monetary penalties and otherwise adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. We may also be contractually required to indemnify and hold harmless third parties from the costs or consequences of non-compliance with any laws, regulations or other legal obligations relating to privacy or consumer protection or any inadvertent or unauthorized use or disclosure of data that we store or handle as part of operating our business.\nIf the use of \u201ccookie\u201d tracking technologies is further restricted, regulated, or blocked, or if changes in technology cause cookies to become less reliable or acceptable as a means of tracking consumer behavior, the amount or accuracy of Internet user information we collect would decrease, which could harm our business and operating results.\nFederal, state and international governmental authorities continue to evaluate the privacy implications inherent in the use of proprietary or third-party \"cookies\" and other methods of online tracking for behavioral advertising. analytics and other purposes. U.S. and foreign governments have enacted, have considered or are considering legislation or regulations that could significantly restrict the ability of companies and individuals to engage in these activities, such as by regulating the level of consumer notice and consent required before a company can employ cookies or other electronic tracking tools or the use of data gathered with such tools. Additionally, some providers of consumer devices and web browsers have implemented, or announced plans to implement, means to make it easier for Internet users to prevent the placement of cookies, to block other tracking technologies or to require new permissions from users for certain activities, which could if widely adopted significantly reduce the effectiveness of such practices and technologies. We may have to develop alternative systems, which may be less effective, to analyze our customers\u2019 behavior and preferences, customize their online experience, or efficiently market to them if customers block cookies or regulations introduce additional barriers to collecting cookie data. The regulation of the use of cookies and other current online tracking and advertising practices or a loss in our ability to make effective use of services that employ such technologies could increase our costs of operations and limit our ability to acquire new customers on cost-effective terms and consequently, materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nChanges in tax treatment of companies engaged in e-commerce may adversely affect the commercial use of our sites and our financial results.\nDue to the global nature of the Internet, it is possible that various states or foreign countries might attempt to impose additional or new regulation on our business or levy additional or new sales, income or other taxes relating to our activities. Tax authorities at the international, federal, state and local levels are currently reviewing the appropriate treatment of companies engaged in e-commerce and digital services. New or revised international, federal, state or local tax regulations or court decisions may subject us or our customers to additional sales, income and other taxes. For example, on June 21, 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court rendered a 5-4 majority decision in South Dakota v. Wayfair Inc., 17-494 where the Court held, among other things, that a state may require an out-of-state seller with no physical presence in the state to collect and remit sales taxes on goods the seller ships to consumers in the state, overturning existing court precedent. Other new or revised taxes and, in particular, digital taxes, sales taxes, VAT and similar taxes could increase the cost of doing business online and decrease the attractiveness of selling products over the Internet. New taxes and rulings could also create significant increases in internal costs necessary to capture data and collect and remit taxes. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nRisks Related to our Indebtedness\nOur outstanding indebtedness, or additional indebtedness that we may incur, could limit our operating flexibility and adversely affect our financial condition.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $3.1 billion of indebtedness outstanding. Our indebtedness included unsecured 0.375% Convertible Senior Notes due 2022 that mature on September 1, 2022 (the \"2022 Notes\"), unsecured 1.125% Convertible Senior Notes due 2024 that mature on November 1, 2024 (the \"2024 Notes\"), unsecured 1.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2026 that mature on August 15, 2026 (the \"2026 Notes\"), unsecured 0.625% Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 that mature on October 1, 2025 (the \u201c2025 Notes\u201d, and together with the 2022 Notes, the 2024 Notes and the 2026 Notes, the \"Non-Accreting Notes\") and unsecured 2.50% Accreting Convertible Senior Notes due 2025 that mature on April 1, 2025 (the \u201c2025 Accreting Notes\u201d and together with the Non-Accreting Notes, the \u201cNotes\u201d). At maturity of the Non-Accreting Notes, unless earlier purchased, redeemed or converted, we will settle any conversions in cash, shares of Wayfair's Class A common stock or a combination thereof, at our election. At maturity of the Accreting Notes, unless earlier purchased, redeemed or converted, we will settle any conversions in shares of Wayfair's Class A common stock. If any Notes are not converted at or prior to maturity, we will be required to pay the holder thereof the principal amount or, with respect to the 2025 Accreting Notes, the accreted principal amount, in cash. We pay interest semiannually in arrears at fixed rates per annum of 0.375% for the 2022 Notes, 1.125% for the 2024 Notes, 0.625% for the 2025 Notes and 1.00% for the 2026 Notes. The 2025 Accreting Notes accrue interest at a rate of 2.50% per annum, which accretes semiannually to the principal amount. Under certain circumstances, the holders of the Notes may require us to repay all or a portion of the principal and interest outstanding under the Notes in cash prior to the maturity date, which could have an adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition.\nWe have the ability to borrow up to $600 million under our senior secured revolving credit facility (the \"Revolver\") to finance working capital and provide funds for permitted acquisitions, repurchases of equity interests and other general corporate purposes. The Revolver replaced our previous $200 million senior secured revolving credit facility which was set to mature on February 21, 2022. If we draw down on this facility, our interest expense and principal repayment requirements will increase, which could have an adverse effect on our financial results and our ability to make payments on the Notes. Further, the agreements governing the Revolver contain numerous requirements, including affirmative, negative and financial covenants. As a result of these covenants, our ability to respond to changes in business and economic conditions and engage in beneficial transactions, including to obtain additional financing as needed, may be restricted. Our failure to comply with any of these covenants or to meet any payment obligations under the Revolver could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, would result in any amounts outstanding, including any accrued interest and unpaid fees, becoming immediately due and payable. We might not have sufficient working capital or liquidity to satisfy any repayment obligations in the event of an acceleration of those obligations.\nOur business may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations, and we can give no assurance that future borrowings will be available to us in amounts sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness as such indebtedness matures, including the Notes, and to fund our other liquidity needs. If this occurs, we will need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. We may need to adopt one or more alternatives, such as reducing or delaying planned expenses and capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring debt, or obtaining additional equity or debt financing. These alternative strategies may not be implemented on satisfactory terms, if at all. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness or obtain additional financing, or to do so on commercially reasonable terms, will depend on, among other things, our financial condition at the time, restrictions in agreements governing our indebtedness, and other factors, including the condition of the financial markets and the markets in which we compete.\nFurther, we may from time to time seek to retire, restructure, repurchase or redeem, or otherwise mitigate the equity dilution associated with, our outstanding convertible debt, through cash purchases, stock buybacks of some or all of the shares underlying convertible notes, and/or exchanges for equity or debt, in open-market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. Such repurchases, exchanges or liability management exercises, if any, will be upon such terms and at such prices and sizes as we may determine, and will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions and other factors. The amounts involved may be material.\nIf we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations, and additional borrowings, refinancings or proceeds from asset sales are not available to us, we may not have sufficient cash to enable us to meet all of our obligations, including our obligations under the Notes.\nThe conditional conversion feature of any series of the Non-Accreting Notes, if triggered, and conversion of the 2025 Accreting Notes may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nIf the conditional conversion feature of any series of our Non-Accreting Notes is triggered, holders of such series of Non-Accreting Notes will be entitled to convert the applicable series of Non-Accreting Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their Non-Accreting Notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our Class A common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. If the holders of the 2025 Accreting Notes convert their 2025 Accreting Notes, we would be required to settle all of our conversion obligation by delivering shares of our Class A common stock. During 2020, CBEP Investments, LLC converted $253 million of accreted principal of the 2025 Accreting Notes and received 3,490,175 shares of our Class A common stock. During 2021, GHEP VII Aggregator, L.P (\"Great Hill\") converted $253 million of accreted principal of the 2025 Accreting Notes and received 3,490,175 shares of our Class A common stock. To the extent we satisfy our conversion obligation of the Non-Accreting Notes by delivering shares of our Class A common stock or if the remaining holders of the 2025 Accreting Notes convert their 2025 Accreting Notes, we would be required to deliver a significant number of shares, which would cause dilution to our existing stockholders. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their Notes in such circumstances, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the applicable series of Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Class A Common Stock\nThe dual class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with our co-founders, which will limit your ability to influence corporate matters.\nOur Class B common stock has ten votes per share, and our Class A common stock, which is the stock that is publicly traded, has one vote per share. Following our initial public offering (the \"IPO\"), our Class B common stock was held primarily by our co-founders, other executive officers, directors and their affiliates. Due to optional conversions of Class B common stock into Class A common stock following the IPO, our Class B common stock is currently held primarily by our co-founders and their affiliates. As of December 31, 2021, our co-founders and their affiliates owned shares representing approximately 26.3% of the economic interest and 77.0% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock. This concentrated control limits your ability to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future. For example, these stockholders are able to control elections of directors, amendments of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws, increases to the number of shares available for issuance under our equity incentive plans or adoption of new equity incentive plans and approval of any merger or sale of assets for the foreseeable future. This control may materially adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock. Additionally, holders of our Class B common stock may cause us to make strategic decisions or pursue acquisitions that could involve risks to you or may not be aligned with your interests. The holders of our Class B common stock are also entitled to a separate vote if we seek to amend our certificate of incorporation to increase or decrease the par value of a class of our common stock or in a manner that alters or changes the powers, preferences or special rights of the Class B common stock in a manner that affects its holders adversely.\nFuture transfers by holders of Class B common stock will generally result in those shares converting on a 1:1 basis to Class A common stock, which will have the effect, over time, of increasing the relative voting power of those holders of Class B common stock who retain their shares in the long-term, which may include our executive officers.\nOur stock price may be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the risks described elsewhere herein, as well as:\n\u2022actual or anticipated fluctuations in our results of operations;\n\u2022the financial projections we may provide to the public, any changes in these projections or our failure to meet these projections;\n\u2022failure of securities analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of our company, changes in financial estimates or ratings by any securities analysts who follow our company or our failure to meet these estimates or the expectations of investors;\n\u2022announcements by us or our competitors of new businesses, services or products, significant technical innovations, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, operating results or capital commitments;\n\u2022changes in operating performance and stock market valuations of other technology or retail companies generally, or those in our industry in particular;\n\u2022price and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market, including as a result of trends in the economy as a whole;\n\u2022changes in interest rates;\n\u2022changes in the Board or our management;\n\u2022sales of large blocks of our Class A common stock, including sales by our executive officers, directors and significant stockholders;\n\u2022lawsuits threatened or filed against us;\n\u2022changes in laws or regulations applicable to our business;\n\u2022changes in our capital structure, such as future issuances of debt or equity securities, including in connection with an acquisition or upon conversion of some or all of our outstanding Notes;\n\u2022short sales, hedging and other derivative transactions involving our capital stock;\n\u2022general economic conditions in the U.S. and abroad; and\n\u2022other events or factors, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism or responses to these events.\nIn addition, stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies, including e-commerce companies. Stock prices of many technology companies, including e-commerce companies, have fluctuated in a manner unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. Volatility in our stock price could adversely affect our business and financing opportunities and expose us to litigation. Securities litigation can subject us to substantial costs, divert resources and the attention of management from our business and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nShort selling could increase the volatility of our stock price.\nWe believe our Class A common stock has been the subject of significant short selling efforts by certain market participants. Short sales are transactions in which a market participant sells a security that it does not own. To complete the transaction, the market participant must borrow the security to make delivery to the buyer. The market participant is then obligated to replace the security borrowed by purchasing the security at the market price at the time of required replacement. If the price at the time of replacement is lower than the price at which the security was originally sold by the market participant, then the market participant will realize a gain on the transaction. Thus, it is in the market participant\u2019s interest for the market price of the underlying security to decline as much as possible during the period prior to the time of replacement. Short selling may negatively affect the value of our stock to the detriment of our stockholders.\nIn addition, market participants with disclosed short positions in our stock have published, and may in the future continue to publish, negative information regarding us that we believe is inaccurate and misleading. We believe that the publication of this negative information may in the future lead to downward pressure on the price of our stock.\nSubstantial sales of shares of our Class A common stock could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our Class A common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of our Class A common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. We are unable to predict the effect that such sales may have on the prevailing market price of our Class A common stock.\nThe capped calls expose us to counterparty risk and may affect the value of our common stock.\nIn connection with the issuance of each series of Non-Accreting Notes, we entered into capped calls with certain financial institutions, which we refer to as the option counterparties. The capped calls are expected generally to reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the Notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted Notes, as the case may be, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap. From time to time, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivative transactions with respect to our Class A common stock and/or purchasing or selling our Class A common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions. This activity could cause a decrease in the market price of our Class A common stock.\nIn addition, the option counterparties are financial institutions, and we will be subject to the risk that one or more of the option counterparties may default or otherwise fail to perform, or may exercise certain rights to terminate, their obligations under the capped calls. Our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparties will not be secured by any collateral. If an option counterparty becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at the time under such transaction. Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, our exposure will increase if the market price or the volatility of our Class A common stock increases. In addition, upon a default or other failure to perform, or a termination of obligations, by an option counterparty, we may suffer more dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to our Class A common stock. We can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of the option counterparties.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or publish negative reports about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business, our market and our competitors. We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our shares or change their opinion of our shares, our share price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our share price or trading volume to decline.\nOur management has broad discretion over our existing cash resources and might not use such funds in ways that increase the value of your investment.\nOur management generally has broad discretion over the use of our cash resources, and you will be relying on the judgment of our management regarding the application of these resources. Our management might not apply these resources in ways that increase the value of your investment.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of our company more difficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management and limit the market price of our Class A common stock.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws include provisions that:\n\u2022permit the Board to establish the number of directors and fill any vacancies and newly created directorships;\n\u2022when the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than 10% of the then outstanding shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock, provide that the Board will be classified into three classes with staggered, three year terms and that directors may only be removed for cause;\n\u2022require super-majority voting to amend some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws;\n\u2022authorize the issuance of \"blank check\" preferred stock that the Board could use to implement a stockholder rights plan;\n\u2022eliminate the ability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022when the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock represent less than 10% of the then outstanding shares of Class A common stock and Class B common stock, prohibit stockholder action by written consent, which requires all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022provide that the Board is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws;\n\u2022restrict the forum for certain litigation against us to Delaware;\n\u2022reflect the dual class structure of our common stock, as discussed above; and\n\u2022establish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the Board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at annual stockholder meetings.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of the Board, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any holder of at least 15% of our capital stock for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became a 15% stockholder.", "PERMNO": 14983, "SIC": 5961, "TIC": "W"}
