If any of the following risks develop into actual events, our business, financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows could be materially adversely affected, the trading price of our securities could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nSubstantial declines in commodity prices or extended periods of low commodity prices adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and our ability to meet our capital expenditure needs and financial commitments.\nThe prices we receive for sales of our crude oil and natural gas production impact our revenue, profitability, cash flows, access to capital, capital budget, rate of growth, and carrying value of our properties. Crude oil and natural gas are commodities and prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand. Historically, the markets for crude oil and natural gas have been volatile and unpredictable. For example, during 2019 the NYMEX West Texas Intermediate (\u201cWTI\u201d) crude oil and Henry Hub natural gas spot prices ranged from approximately $46 to $66 per barrel and $1.75 to $4.25 per MMBtu, respectively. Commodity prices will likely remain volatile and unpredictable in 2020 and beyond. Our future crude oil and natural gas production is unhedged as of December 31, 2019 and is directly exposed to continued volatility in market prices, whether favorable or unfavorable.\nThe prices we receive for sales of our production depend on numerous factors beyond our control. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nworldwide, domestic, and regional economic conditions impacting the supply of, and demand for, crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids;\n\u2022\nthe actions of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other producing nations;\n\u2022\nthe nature and extent of domestic and foreign governmental laws, regulations, and taxation, including environmental laws and regulations governing the imposition of trade restrictions and tariffs;\n\u2022\ngeopolitical events and conditions, including domestic political uncertainty or foreign regime changes that impact government energy policies;\n\u2022\nthe level of global, national, and regional crude oil and natural gas exploration and production activities;\n\u2022\nthe level of global, national, and regional crude oil and natural gas inventories, which may be impacted by economic sanctions applied to certain producing nations;\n\u2022\nthe level and effect of speculative trading in commodity futures markets;\n\u2022\nthe relative strength of the United States dollar compared to foreign currencies;\n\u2022\nthe price and quantity of imports of foreign crude oil;\n\u2022\nthe price and quantity of exports of crude oil or liquefied natural gas from the United States;\n\u2022\nmilitary and political conditions in, or affecting other, crude oil-producing and natural gas-producing nations;\n\u2022\nlocalized supply and demand fundamentals;\n\u2022\nthe cost and availability, proximity and capacity of transportation, processing, storage and refining facilities for various quantities and grades of crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids;\n\u2022\nadverse weather conditions, natural disasters, and national and global health epidemics and concerns;\n\u2022\ntechnological advances affecting energy production and consumption;\n\u2022\nthe effect of worldwide energy conservation and environmental protection efforts; and\n\u2022\nthe price and availability of alternative fuels or other energy sources.\nSustained material declines in commodity prices reduce cash flows available for capital expenditures, repayment of indebtedness and other corporate purposes; may limit our ability to borrow money or raise additional capital; and may reduce our proved reserves and the amount of crude oil and natural gas we can economically produce.\nIn addition to reducing our revenue, cash flows and earnings, depressed prices for crude oil and/or natural gas may adversely affect us in a variety of other ways. If commodity prices decrease substantially, some of our exploration and development projects could become uneconomic, and we may also have to make significant downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves and our estimates of the present value of those reserves. If these price effects occur, or if our estimates of production or\neconomic factors change, accounting rules may require us to write down the carrying value of our crude oil and/or natural gas properties.\nLower commodity prices may also lead to reductions in our drilling and completion programs, which may result in insufficient production to satisfy our transportation and processing commitments. If production is not sufficient to meet our commitments we would incur deficiency fees that would need to be paid absent any cash inflows generated from the sale of production.\nLower commodity prices may also reduce our access to capital and lead to a downgrade or other negative rating action with respect to our credit rating. A downgrade of our credit rating could negatively impact our cost of capital, increase the borrowing costs under our revolving credit facility, and limit our ability to access capital markets and execute aspects of our business plans. As a result, substantial declines in commodity prices or extended periods of low commodity prices may materially and adversely affect our future business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity and ability to meet our capital expenditure needs and commitments.\nVolatility in the financial markets or in global economic factors, including consequences resulting from domestic political uncertainty, geopolitical events, international trade disputes and tariffs, and health epidemics could adversely impact our business.\nUnited States and global economies may experience periods of volatility and uncertainty from time to time, resulting in unstable consumer confidence, diminished consumer demand and spending, diminished liquidity and credit availability, and inability to access capital markets. In recent years, certain global economies have experienced periods of political uncertainty, slowing economic growth, rising interest rates, changing economic sanctions, health-related concerns, and currency volatility. These global macroeconomic conditions may have a negative impact on commodity prices and the availability and cost of materials used in our industry, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn recent years, the United States government has initiated new tariffs on certain imported goods and has imposed increases to certain existing tariffs on imported goods. In response, certain foreign governments, most notably China, imposed retaliatory tariffs on certain goods their countries import from the United States. These and other events, including the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union and the health epidemic originating in China, have contributed to increased uncertainty for domestic and global economies. Additionally, growing trends toward populism and political polarization globally and in the U.S. have resulted in uncertainty regarding potential changes in regulations, fiscal policy, social programs, domestic and foreign relations, and government energy policies, which could pose a potential threat to domestic and global economic growth.\nTrade restrictions or other governmental actions related to tariffs or trade policies have impacted, and have the potential to further impact, our business and industry by increasing the cost of materials used in various aspects of upstream, midstream, and downstream oil and gas activities. Furthermore, tariffs and any quantitative import restrictions, particularly those impacting the cost and availability of steel and aluminum, may cause disruption in the energy industry\u2019s supply chain, resulting in the delay or cessation of drilling and completion efforts or the postponement or cancellation of new pipeline transportation projects the U.S. industry is relying on to transport its increasing levels of onshore production to market, as well as endangering U.S. liquefied natural gas export projects resulting in negative impacts on natural gas production. Additionally, trade and/or tariff disputes have impacted, and have the potential to further impact, domestic and global economies overall, which could result in reduced demand for crude oil and natural gas. Any of the above consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur producing properties are located in limited geographic areas, making us vulnerable to risks associated with having geographically concentrated operations.\nA significant portion of our producing properties is located in the Bakken field of North Dakota and Montana, with that area comprising 57% of our crude oil and natural gas production and 68% of our crude oil and natural gas revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019. Approximately 52% of our estimated proved reserves were located in the Bakken as of December 31, 2019. Additionally, our properties in Oklahoma comprised 40% of our crude oil and natural gas production and 28% of our crude oil and natural gas revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019. Approximately 47% of our estimated proved reserves were located in Oklahoma as of December 31, 2019.\nBecause of this concentration in limited geographic areas, the success and profitability of our operations may be disproportionately exposed to regional factors compared to competitors having more geographically dispersed operations. These factors include, among others: (i) the prices of crude oil and natural gas produced from wells in the regions and other regional supply and demand factors, including gathering, pipeline and rail transportation capacity constraints; (ii) the\navailability of rigs, completion crews, waste water disposal wells, equipment, field services, water, supplies, and labor; (iii) the availability of processing and refining facilities; and (iv) infrastructure capacity. In addition, our operations in the Bakken field and Oklahoma may be adversely affected by severe weather events such as floods, blizzards, ice storms, drought, and tornadoes, which can intensify competition for the items and services described above and may result in periodic shortages. The concentration of our operations in limited geographic areas also increases our exposure to changes in local laws and regulations, certain lease stipulations designed to protect wildlife, and unexpected events that may occur in the regions such as natural disasters, seismic events (which may result in third-party lawsuits), industrial accidents, labor difficulties, civil disturbances, public protests, cyber attacks, or terrorist attacks. Any one of these events has the potential to cause producing wells to be shut-in, delay operations, decrease cash flows, increase operating and capital costs and prevent development of lease inventory before expiration. Any of the risks described above could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur exploration, development and exploitation projects require substantial capital expenditures. We may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on acceptable terms, which could lead to a decline in our crude oil and natural gas reserves, production and revenues.\nThe crude oil and natural gas industry is capital intensive. We make and expect to continue to make substantial capital expenditures in our business for the exploration, development, exploitation, production and acquisition of crude oil and natural gas reserves. We have budgeted $2.65 billion for capital expenditures in 2020 of which approximately $2.21 billion is allocated to exploration and development activities. We may adjust our 2020 capital spending plans upward or downward depending on market conditions. Our 2020 capital budget, based on our current expectations of commodity prices and costs, is expected to be funded from operating cash flows. However, the sufficiency of our cash flows from operations is subject to a number of variables, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe prices at which crude oil and natural gas are sold;\n\u2022\nthe volume of our proved reserves;\n\u2022\nthe volume of crude oil and natural gas we are able to produce and sell from existing wells; and\n\u2022\nour ability to acquire, locate and produce new reserves;\nIf oil and gas industry conditions weaken as a result of low commodity prices or other factors, we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows and may have limited ability to obtain the capital necessary to sustain our operations at current or planned levels. A decline in cash flows from operations may require us to revise our capital program or alter or increase our capitalization substantially through the issuance of debt or equity securities.\nWe have a revolving credit facility with lender commitments totaling $1.5 billion that matures in April 2023. In the future, we may not be able to access adequate funding under our revolving credit facility if our lenders are unwilling or unable to meet their funding obligations or increase their commitments under the credit facility. Our lenders could decline to increase their commitments based on our financial condition, the financial condition of our industry or the economy as a whole or for other reasons beyond our control. Due to these and other factors, we cannot be certain that funding, if needed, will be available to the extent required or on terms we find acceptable. If operating cash flows are insufficient and we are unable to access funding or execute capital transactions when needed on acceptable terms, we may not be able to fully implement our business plans, fund our capital program and commitments, complete new property acquisitions to replace reserves, take advantage of business opportunities, respond to competitive pressures, or refinance debt obligations as they come due. Should any of the above risks occur, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nDrilling for and producing crude oil and natural gas are high risk activities with many uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. We may not be insured for, or our insurance may be inadequate to protect us against, these risks.\nOur future financial condition and results of operations depend on the success of our exploration, development and production activities. Our crude oil and natural gas exploration and production activities are subject to numerous risks, including the risk that drilling will not result in commercially viable crude oil or natural gas production. Our decisions to purchase, explore, or develop prospects or properties will depend in part on the evaluation of data obtained through geophysical and geological analyses, production data, and engineering studies, the results of which are often inconclusive or subject to varying interpretations. Our cost of drilling, completing and operating wells may be uncertain before drilling commences.\nIn this report, we describe some of our current prospects and plans to develop our key operating areas. Our management has specifically identified prospects and scheduled drilling locations as an estimation of our future multi-year drilling activities on our existing acreage. Our ability to drill and develop these locations is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties as described herein. If future drilling results do not establish sufficient reserves to achieve an economic return, we may curtail our\ndrilling and completion activities. Prospects we decide to drill that do not produce crude oil or natural gas in expected quantities may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and rates of return on capital employed. The use of seismic data and other technologies and the study of producing fields in the same area will not enable us to know conclusively prior to drilling whether crude oil or natural gas will be present in expected or economically producible quantities. We cannot assure you the wells we drill will be as productive as anticipated or whether the analogies we draw from other wells, more fully explored prospects, or producing fields will be applicable to our drilling prospects. Because of these uncertainties, we do not know if our potential drilling locations will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce crude oil or natural gas from these or any other potential drilling locations in sufficient quantities to achieve an economic return.\nRisks we face while drilling include, but are not limited to, failing to place our well bore in the desired target producing zone; not staying in the desired drilling zone while drilling horizontally through the formation; failing to run our casing the entire length of the well bore; and not being able to run tools and other equipment consistently through the horizontal well bore. Risks we face while completing our wells include, but are not limited to, not being able to fracture stimulate the planned number of stages; failing to run tools the entire length of the well bore during completion operations; not successfully cleaning out the well bore after completion of the final fracture stimulation stage; increased seismicity in areas near our completion activities; unintended interference of completion activities performed by us or by third parties with nearby operated or non-operated wells being drilled, completed, or producing; and failure of our optimized completion techniques to yield expected levels of production.\nFurther, many factors may occur that cause us to curtail, delay or cancel scheduled drilling and completion projects, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nabnormal pressure or irregularities in geological formations;\n\u2022\nshortages of or delays in obtaining equipment or qualified personnel;\n\u2022\nshortages of or delays in obtaining components used in fracture stimulation processes such as water and proppants;\n\u2022\ndelays associated with suspending our operations to accommodate nearby drilling or completion operations being conducted by other operators;\n\u2022\nmechanical difficulties, fires, explosions, equipment failures or accidents, including ruptures of pipelines or storage facilities, or train derailments;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the use of underground injection wells for disposing of waste water from oil and gas activities;\n\u2022\npolitical events, public protests, civil disturbances, terrorist acts or cyber attacks;\n\u2022\ndecreases in, or extended periods of low, crude oil and natural gas prices;\n\u2022\ntitle problems;\n\u2022\nenvironmental hazards, such as uncontrollable flows of crude oil, natural gas, brine, well fluids, hydraulic fracturing fluids, toxic gas or other pollutants into the environment, including groundwater and shoreline contamination;\n\u2022\nadverse weather conditions and natural disasters;\n\u2022\nspillage or mishandling of crude oil, natural gas, brine, well fluids, hydraulic fracturing fluids, toxic gas or other pollutants by us or by third party service providers;\n\u2022\nlimitations in infrastructure, including transportation, processing, refining and exportation capacity, or markets for crude oil and natural gas; and\n\u2022\ndelays imposed by or resulting from compliance with regulatory requirements including permitting.\nAny of the above risks could adversely affect our ability to conduct operations or result in substantial losses to us as a result of:\n\u2022\ninjury or loss of life;\n\u2022\ndamage to or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment;\n\u2022\npollution and other environmental damage;\n\u2022\nregulatory investigations and penalties;\n\u2022\nsuspension of our operations;\n\u2022\nrepair and remediation costs; and\n\u2022\nlitigation.\nWe are not insured against all risks associated with our business. We may elect to not obtain insurance if we believe the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented or for other reasons. In addition, pollution and environmental risks are generally not fully insurable.\nLosses and liabilities arising from any of the above events could hinder our ability to conduct normal operations and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nReserve estimates depend on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. The present value of future net revenues from our proved reserves will not necessarily be the same as the current market value of our estimated crude oil and natural gas reserves. Any material inaccuracies in our reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves. The Company\u2019s current estimates of reserves could change, potentially in material amounts, in the future due to changes in commodity prices, business strategies, and other factors.\nThe process of estimating crude oil and natural gas reserves is complex and inherently imprecise. It requires interpretation of available technical data and many assumptions, including assumptions relating to current and future economic conditions, production rates, drilling and operating expenses, and commodity prices. Any significant inaccuracy in these interpretations or assumptions could materially affect our estimated quantities and present value of our reserves. See Part I, Item 1. Business-Crude Oil and Natural Gas Operations-Proved Reserves for information about our estimated crude oil and natural gas reserves, standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows, and PV-10 as of December 31, 2019.\nIn order to prepare reserve estimates, we must project production rates and the amount and timing of development expenditures. We must also analyze available geological, geophysical, production and engineering data in preparing reserve estimates. The extent, quality and reliability of this data can vary which in turn can affect our ability to model the porosity, permeability and pressure relationships in unconventional resources. The process also requires economic assumptions, based on historical data projected into the future, about crude oil and natural gas prices, drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes, and availability of funds.\nActual future production, crude oil and natural gas sales prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable crude oil and natural gas reserves will vary and could vary significantly from our estimates. Any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves, which in turn could have an adverse effect on the value of our assets. In addition, we may remove or adjust estimates of proved reserves, potentially in material amounts, to reflect production history, results of exploration and development activities, changes in business strategies, prevailing crude oil and natural gas prices and other factors, some of which are beyond our control.\nYou should not assume the present value of future net revenues from our proved reserves is the current market value of our estimated crude oil and natural gas reserves. We base the estimated discounted future net revenues from proved reserves on the 12-month unweighted arithmetic average of the first-day-of-the-month commodity prices for the preceding twelve months. Actual future prices may be materially higher or lower than the average prices used in the calculations. In addition, the use of a 10% discount factor, which is required by the SEC to be used to calculate discounted future net revenues for reporting purposes, may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with our reserves or the crude oil and natural gas industry. For the year ended December 31, 2019, average prices used to calculate our estimated proved reserves were $55.69 per Bbl for crude oil and $2.58 per MMBtu for natural gas ($51.95 per Bbl for crude oil and $2.02 per Mcf for natural gas adjusted for location and quality differentials). NYMEX WTI crude oil and Henry Hub natural gas first-day-of-the-month commodity prices for January 1, 2020 and February 1, 2020 averaged $56.31 per barrel and $1.95 per MMBtu, respectively. See Part I, Item 1. Business-Crude Oil and Natural Gas Operations-Proved Reserves-Proved Reserve, Standardized Measure, and PV-10 Sensitivities for proved reserve sensitivities under certain increasing and decreasing commodity price scenarios.\nIn addition, the development of our proved undeveloped reserves may take longer than anticipated and may not be ultimately developed or produced. At December 31, 2019, approximately 56% of our total estimated proved reserves (by volume) were undeveloped. Recovery of undeveloped reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations. Our reserve estimates assume we can and will make these expenditures and conduct these operations successfully. These assumptions may not prove to be accurate. Our reserve report at December 31, 2019 includes estimates of total future development costs over the next five years associated with our proved undeveloped reserves of approximately $10.0 billion. We cannot be certain the estimated costs of the development of these reserves are accurate, development will occur as scheduled, or the results of such development will be as estimated. If we choose not to spend the capital to develop these reserves, or if we are not otherwise able to successfully develop these reserves as a result of our inability to fund necessary capital expenditures or otherwise, we will be required to remove the associated volumes from our reported proved reserves. Proved undeveloped reserves generally must be drilled within five years from the date of initial booking under SEC reserve rules. Changes in the timing of development plans that impact our ability to develop such reserves in the required time frame have resulted, and will\nlikely in the future result, in fluctuations in reserves between periods as reserves booked in one period may need to be removed in a subsequent period. In 2019, 35 MMBoe of proved undeveloped reserves were removed from our year-end reserve estimates associated with locations no longer scheduled to be drilled within five years from the date of initial booking.\nAdditionally, unless production is established within the spacing units covering the undeveloped acres on which some of the locations are identified, the leases for such acreage will expire. If we are not able to renew leases before they expire, any proved undeveloped reserves associated with such leases will be removed from our proved reserves. The combined net acreage expiring in the next three years represents 55% of our total net undeveloped acreage at December 31, 2019. At that date, we had leases representing 105,551 net acres expiring in 2020, 79,419 net acres expiring in 2021, and 68,400 net acres expiring in 2022.\nUnless we replace our crude oil and natural gas reserves, our total reserves and production will decline, which could adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations.\nUnless we conduct successful exploration, development and exploitation activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves, our proved reserves will decline as those reserves are produced. Producing crude oil and natural gas reservoirs are generally characterized by declining production rates that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors. Our future crude oil and natural gas reserves and production, and therefore our cash flows and results of operations, are highly dependent on our success in efficiently developing our current reserves and economically finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves. We may not be able to develop, find or acquire sufficient additional reserves to replace our current and future production. If we are unable to replace our current and future production, the value of our reserves will decrease, and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nThe unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs, well completion crews, water, equipment, supplies, personnel and field services could adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans within budget and on a timely basis.\nIn the regions in which we operate, there have historically been shortages of drilling rigs, well completion crews, equipment, personnel, field services, and supplies, including key components used in fracture stimulation processes such as water and proppants, as well as high costs associated with these critical components of our operations. With current technology, water is an essential component of drilling and hydraulic fracturing processes. The availability of water sources and disposal facilities is becoming increasingly competitive, constrained, subject to social and regulatory scrutiny, and impacted by third-party supply chains over which we have limited control. Limitations or restrictions on our ability to secure, transport, and use sufficient amounts of water, including limitations resulting from natural causes such as drought, could adversely impact our operations. In some cases, water may need to be obtained from new sources and transported to drilling or completion sites, resulting in increased costs.\nThe demand for qualified and experienced field service providers and associated equipment, supplies, and materials can fluctuate significantly, often in correlation with commodity prices, causing periodic shortages and/or higher costs. Such shortages or higher costs could delay the execution of our drilling and development plans or cause us to incur expenditures not provided for in our capital budget or to not achieve the rates of return we are targeting for our development program, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business depends on crude oil and natural gas transportation, processing, refining, and export facilities, most of which are owned by third parties.\nThe value we receive for our crude oil and natural gas production depends in part on the availability, proximity and capacity of gathering, pipeline and rail systems and processing, refining, and export facilities owned by third parties. The inadequacy or unavailability of capacity on these systems and facilities could result in the shut-in of producing wells, the delay or discontinuance of development plans for properties, or higher operational costs associated with air quality compliance controls. Although we have some contractual control over the transportation of our products, changes in these business relationships or failure to obtain such services on acceptable terms could adversely affect our operations. If our production becomes shut-in for any of these or other reasons, we will be unable to realize revenue from those wells until other arrangements are made for the sale or delivery of our products and acreage lease terminations could result if production is shut-in for a prolonged period.\nThe disruption of transportation, processing, refining, or export facilities due to contractual disputes or litigation, labor disputes, maintenance, civil disturbances, international trade disputes, public protests, terrorist attacks, cyber attacks, adverse weather, natural disasters, seismic events, health epidemics and concerns, changes in tax and energy policies, federal, state and international regulatory developments, changes in supply and demand, equipment failures or accidents, including pipeline and gathering system ruptures or train derailments, and general economic conditions could negatively impact our ability to achieve\nthe most favorable prices for our crude oil and natural gas production. We have no control over when or if access to such facilities would be restored or the impact on prices in the areas we operate. A significant shut-in of production in connection with any of the aforementioned items could materially affect our cash flows, and if a substantial portion of the impacted production fulfills transportation or processing commitments or is hedged at lower than market prices, those commitments or financial hedges would have to be paid from borrowings in the absence of sufficient operating cash flows.\nOur operated crude oil and natural gas production is ultimately transported to downstream market centers in the United States primarily using transportation facilities and equipment owned and operated by third parties. See Part I, Item 1. Business-Regulation of the Crude Oil and Natural Gas Industry for a discussion of regulations impacting the transportation of crude oil and natural gas. From time to time we may sell our operated crude oil production at market centers in the United States to third parties who then subsequently export and sell the crude oil in international markets. We do not currently own or operate infrastructure used to facilitate the transportation and exportation of crude oil; however, third party compliance with regulations that impact the transportation or exportation of our production may increase our costs of doing business and inhibit a third party's ability to transport and sell our production, whether domestically or internationally, the consequences of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to complex federal, state and local laws and regulations that could result in increased costs, operating restrictions or delays, limitations or prohibitions on our ability to develop and produce reserves, or expose us to significant liabilities.\nOur crude oil and natural gas exploration and production operations are subject to complex and stringent federal, state and local laws and regulations. Following is a discussion of certain significant laws, rules and regulations that affect us in the areas in which we operate. See Part I, Item 1. Business-Regulation of the Crude Oil and Natural Gas Industry for further discussion of these and other regulations that affect us.\nAir emissions and climate change-Federal, state and local laws and regulations have been and may be enacted to address concerns about the potential effects of emissions of regulated air pollutants, including carbon dioxide, methane and other identified \u201cgreenhouse gas\u201d emissions on the environment and climate worldwide, generally referred to as \u201cclimate change.\u201d See Part I, Item 1. Business-Regulation of the Crude Oil and Natural Gas Industry-Environmental regulation-Air emissions and climate change for further discussion of the impact of regulated air pollutants including greenhouse gases on our operations. The implementation of, and compliance with, laws and regulations that impose more stringent standards for greenhouse gas emissions from the oil and natural gas sector or otherwise restrict the areas in which oil and natural gas may be produced could limit our ability to obtain permits in order to develop and produce our reserves and result in increased costs of compliance or costs of consuming hydrocarbons, and thereby reduce demand for the crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids we produce, which could lower the value of our reserves and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, political, litigation, and financial risks may result in our restricting or cancelling development or production activities, incurring liability for infrastructure damages as a result of climate changes, or impairing our ability to continue to operate in an economic manner, which also could reduce demand for our products. One or more of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nHydraulic fracturing-Hydraulic fracturing is an important and commonly used process in the completion of crude oil and natural gas wells in low-permeability formations. In recent years there has been public concern regarding an alleged potential for hydraulic fracturing to adversely affect drinking water supplies and to induce seismic events. As a result, several federal and state enacted and proposed laws and regulations have emerged which have increased, and have the potential to further increase, the regulatory burden imposed on hydraulic fracturing. While no federal legislation has been enacted to provide for regulation of hydraulic fracturing, certain candidates running for the office of President of the United States in 2020 have pledged to ban hydraulic fracturing and, on January 28, 2020, one of those candidates introduced Senate Bill 3247 that, if enacted as proposed, would ban hydraulic fracturing nationwide by 2025. States in which we operate have adopted laws and regulations imposing more stringent permitting, disclosure, and well construction and reclamation requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. Local governments also have sought to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating or prohibiting the time, place and manner of hydraulic fracturing activities. The adoption of any future federal, state or local law or implementing regulation imposing permitting or reporting obligations on, or otherwise limiting, the hydraulic fracturing process, or the discovery of groundwater contamination or other adverse environmental effects directly connected to hydraulic fracturing, could make it more difficult and more expensive to complete crude oil and natural gas wells in low-permeability formations and increase our costs of compliance and doing business, as well as delay, prevent or prohibit the development of natural resources from unconventional formations. In the event regulations are adopted to prohibit or significantly limit the use of hydraulic fracturing in states or federal lands in which we operate, it would have a material adverse effect on our ability to economically find and develop crude oil and natural gas reserves in our strategic plays. The inability to achieve a satisfactory economic return could\ncause us to curtail or discontinue our exploration and development plans, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWaste water disposal-Our business depends on the ability to dispose of waste water from oil and gas activities. We operate injection wells and utilize injection wells owned by third parties to dispose of waste water associated with our operations. Some states, including states in which we operate, have delayed permit approvals, mandated a reduction in injection volumes, or have shut down or imposed moratoria on the use of injection wells. In addition, concerns have been raised in recent years about the potential for seismic events to occur from the use of injection wells. Rules and regulations have been developed in Oklahoma to address these concerns by limiting or eliminating the ability to use disposal wells in certain locations or increasing the cost of disposal. Complying with existing or new laws, regulations, and permit requirements governing the disposal of waste water may increase our operating costs or may cause us to delay, curtail or discontinue our exploration and development plans, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nTaxation of oil and gas activities-In previous years, legislation has been proposed to eliminate or defer certain key U.S. federal income tax deductions historically available to oil and gas exploration and production companies. Such proposed changes have included: (i) a repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for crude oil and natural gas properties; (ii) the elimination of deductions for intangible drilling and exploration and development costs; (iii) the elimination of the deduction for certain production activities; and (iv) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. The enactment of legislation in the future that eliminates or defers these or other tax deductions utilized within our industry could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nDodd-Frank Act derivative regulations-From time to time, we may use derivative instruments to manage commodity price risk. In 2010, the U.S. Congress adopted the Dodd-Frank Act, which, among other provisions, established federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives market. If we do not qualify for an end user exemption from the Dodd-Frank Act requirements, the regulations could increase the cost of derivative contracts, reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks we encounter, reduce our ability to monetize or restructure existing derivative contracts, lead to fewer potential counterparties, and increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties, any of which could limit our desire and ability to implement commodity price risk management strategies. If our use of derivatives becomes limited as a result of the regulations, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable. Certain aspects of the Dodd-Frank rulemaking have been repealed or have not been finalized and the ultimate effect of the regulations on our business remains uncertain.\nFailure to comply with the above and other laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement investigations or actions, including investigatory actions, the assessment of monetary penalties, the imposition of remedial requirements, the issuance of orders or judgments limiting or enjoining future operations, criminal sanctions, or litigation. Strict liability or joint and several liability may be imposed under certain laws, which could cause us to become liable for the conduct of others or for consequences of our own actions. For instance, an accidental release from one of our wells could subject us to substantial liabilities arising from environmental cleanup and restoration costs, claims made by neighboring landowners and other third parties for personal injury and property damage and fines or penalties for related violations of environmental laws or regulations.\nMoreover, changes to existing laws or regulations or changes in interpretations of laws and regulations may unfavorably impact us or the infrastructure used for transporting our products. Similarly, changes in regulatory policies and priorities, including those in response to a change in U.S. presidential administrations, could result in the imposition of new laws or regulations that adversely impact us or our industry. Any such changes could increase our operating costs, delay our operations or otherwise alter the way we conduct our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nClimate change activism, energy conservation measures, or initiatives that stimulate demand for alternative forms of energy could reduce the demand for the crude oil and natural gas we produce.\nClimate change activism, fuel conservation measures, governmental requirements for renewable energy resources, increasing consumer demand for alternative forms of energy, and technological advances in fuel economy and energy generation devices may create new competitive conditions that result in reduced demand for the crude oil and natural gas we produce. The potential impact of changing demand for crude oil and natural gas services and products may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The lending and investment practices of institutional lenders have been the subject of intensive lobbying efforts in recent years, oftentimes public in nature, by environmental activists and foreign citizenry concerned about climate change. These lobbying efforts have resulted in, and may yet result in, financial institutions, funds, and other sources of capital restricting or eliminating their investment in crude oil and natural gas activities. Finally, some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, floods or other climatic events. If any such effects were to occur as a result of climate change or otherwise, they could have an adverse effect on our assets and operations.\nWe are involved in legal proceedings that could result in substantial liabilities.\nLike other similarly-situated oil and gas companies, we are, from time to time, involved in various legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business including, but not limited to, commercial disputes, claims from royalty and surface owners, property damage claims, personal injury claims, regulatory compliance matters, disputes with tax authorities, and other matters. The outcome of such legal matters often cannot be predicted with certainty. We vigorously defend ourselves in all such matters. However, if our efforts to defend ourselves are not successful, it is possible the outcome of one or more such proceedings could result in substantial liability, penalties, sanctions, judgments, consent decrees, or orders requiring a change in our business practices, which could have a material adverse on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Judgments and estimates to determine accruals related to legal and other proceedings could change from period to period, and such changes could be material.\nCompetition in the crude oil and natural gas industry is intense, making it more difficult for us to acquire properties, market crude oil and natural gas and secure trained personnel.\nOur ability to acquire additional prospects and find and develop reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment for acquiring properties, securing long-term transportation and processing capacity, marketing crude oil and natural gas, and securing trained personnel. Also, there is substantial competition for capital available for investment in the crude oil and natural gas industry. Our competitors may possess and employ financial, technical and personnel resources greater than ours. Those companies may be able to pay more for productive crude oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects and to evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or personnel resources permit. In addition, our competitors may be able to offer better compensation packages to attract and retain qualified personnel than we are able to offer. We may not be able to compete successfully in the future in acquiring prospective reserves, developing reserves, securing long-term transportation and processing capacity, marketing hydrocarbons, attracting and retaining quality personnel, and raising additional capital, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nSevere weather events and natural disasters could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nSevere weather events and natural disasters such as hurricanes, tornadoes, seismic events, floods, blizzards, drought, and ice storms affecting the areas in which we operate, including our corporate headquarters, could have a material adverse effect on our operations or the operations of third party service providers. Such events may result in significant destruction of infrastructure, businesses, and homes and could disrupt the distribution and supply of crude oil and natural gas products in the impacted regions. The consequences of such events may include the evacuation of personnel; damage to and disruption of drilling rigs or transportation, processing, storage, refining, and export facilities; the shut-in of production resulting from an inability to transport crude oil or natural gas products to market centers and other factors; an inability to access well sites; destruction of information and communication systems; and the disruption of administrative and management processes, any of which could hinder our ability to conduct normal operations and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nA cyber incident could result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption, and/or financial loss.\nOur business and industry has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct day-to-day operations including certain exploration, development and production activities. We rely heavily on digital technologies, including information systems and related infrastructure as well as cloud applications and services, to process and record financial and operating data; analyze seismic, drilling, completion and production information; manage production equipment; conduct reservoir modeling and reserves estimation; communicate with employees and business associates; perform compliance reporting and many other activities. The availability and integrity of these systems are essential for us to conduct our operations. Our business associates, including employees, vendors, service providers, financial institutions, and transporters, processors, and purchasers of our production are also heavily dependent on digital technology.\nAs dependence on digital technologies has increased, cyber incidents, including deliberate attacks or unintentional events, have also increased. Our technologies, systems, networks, and those of our business associates have been and continue to be the target of cyber attacks or information security breaches, which could lead to disruptions in critical systems, unauthorized release or theft of confidential or protected information, corruption of data or other disruptions of our business operations. In addition, certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance of our systems and those of our business associates, may remain undetected for an extended period.\nA cyber attack involving our information systems and related infrastructure, and/or that of our business associates, could disrupt our business and negatively impact our operations in a variety of ways, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nunauthorized access to or theft of seismic data, reserves information, strategic information, or other sensitive or proprietary information owned by us or by third parties could have a negative impact on our ability to compete for oil and gas resources;\n\u2022\ndata corruption, communication interruption, or other operational disruption during drilling activities could result in failure to reach the intended target or a drilling incident;\n\u2022\ndata corruption or operational disruption of production-related infrastructure could result in a loss of production or accidental discharge;\n\u2022\na cyber attack on third party transportation, processing, storage, refining, or export facilities could delay or prevent us from transporting and marketing our production, resulting in a loss of revenues;\n\u2022\na cyber attack on a vendor or service provider could result in supply chain disruptions which could delay or halt our major development projects;\n\u2022\na cyber attack involving commodity exchanges or financial institutions could slow or halt commodities trading, thus preventing us from marketing our production or engaging in hedging activities, resulting in a loss of revenues;\n\u2022\ncorruption of our financial or operating data could result in events of non-compliance which could lead to regulatory fines or penalties; and\n\u2022\na cyber attack could result in unauthorized access to and release of personal or confidential information maintained by the Company.\nAny of the above events could damage our reputation and lead to financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business, or potential liability, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe Company has established cyber security systems and controls intended to monitor threats, identify incidents and assess their impact, protect information, and mitigate data loss. The Company has also established disclosure controls and procedures in tandem with incident response protocols, including regular assessment of threats and incidents by a security oversight committee comprised of members of senior management and information technology personnel. These systems, controls, and procedures are intended to provide information about cyber security incidents so that such information can be timely processed and reported to the appropriate personnel; however, these systems, controls, and procedures may not identify all risks and threats we face, or may fail to protect data or mitigate the adverse effects of data loss. Our senior management makes materiality assessments and disclosure decisions and has implemented procedures to prohibit insider trading on the basis of material nonpublic information about cyber incidents; however, we cannot guarantee all of these efforts will be effective. Although we maintain systems, controls, and procedures to address cyber security risks, such measures cannot eliminate cyber security threats and incidents, and there remains a risk that we will experience a cyber breach, attack, or data loss incident and suffer adverse effects.\nTo our knowledge we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber attacks; however, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer material losses in the future either as a result of a breach of our systems or those of our business associates. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to\nmodify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. Additionally, the growth of cyber attacks has resulted in evolving legal and compliance matters which may impose significant costs that are likely to increase over time.\nTerrorist activities could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nTerrorist attacks and the threat of terrorist attacks, whether domestic or foreign attacks, as well as military or other actions taken in response to these acts, could cause instability in the global financial and energy markets. Continued hostilities abroad and the occurrence or threat of terrorist attacks in the United States or other countries could adversely affect the global economy in unpredictable ways, including the disruption of energy supplies and markets, increased volatility in commodity prices or the possibility that infrastructure we rely on could be a direct target or an indirect casualty of an act of terrorism. Any of these events could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe have limited control over the activities on properties we do not operate.\nSome of the properties in which we have an ownership interest are operated by other companies and involve third-party working interest owners. As of December 31, 2019, non-operated properties represented 16% of our estimated proved developed reserves, 13% of our estimated proved undeveloped reserves, and 14% of our estimated total proved reserves. We have limited ability to influence or control the operations or future development of non-operated properties, including the marketing of oil and gas production, compliance with environmental, safety and other regulations, or the amount of expenditures required to fund the development and operation of such properties. Moreover, we are dependent on other working interest owners on these projects to fund their contractual share of capital and operating expenditures. These limitations and our dependence on the operators and other working interest owners for these projects could cause us to incur unexpected future costs and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur revolving credit facility and indentures for our senior notes contain certain covenants and restrictions that may inhibit our ability to make certain investments, incur additional indebtedness and engage in certain other transactions, which could adversely affect our ability to meet our goals.\nOur revolving credit facility contains restrictive covenants that may limit our ability to, among other things, incur additional indebtedness, incur liens, engage in sale and leaseback transactions, and merge, consolidate or sell all or substantially all of our assets. Our revolving credit facility also contains a requirement that we maintain a consolidated net debt to total capitalization ratio of no greater than 0.65 to 1.00. This ratio represents the ratio of net debt (calculated as total face value of debt plus outstanding letters of credit less cash and cash equivalents) divided by the sum of net debt plus total shareholders\u2019 equity plus, to the extent resulting in a reduction of total shareholders\u2019 equity, the amount of any non-cash impairment charges incurred, net of any tax effect, after June 30, 2014. At December 31, 2019, we had $55 million of outstanding borrowings on our credit facility and our consolidated net debt to total capitalization ratio, as defined, was 0.40 to 1.00.\nThe indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to create liens securing certain indebtedness, enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions, and consolidate, merge or transfer certain assets.\nThe covenants in our revolving credit facility and senior note indentures may restrict our ability to expand or pursue our business strategies. Our ability to comply with the provisions of our revolving credit facility or senior note indentures may be impacted by changes in economic or business conditions, results of operations, or events beyond our control. The breach of any covenant could result in a default under our revolving credit facility or senior note indentures, in which case, depending on the actions taken by the lenders or trustees thereunder or their successors or assignees, could result in all amounts outstanding thereunder, together with accrued interest, to be due and payable. If our indebtedness is accelerated, our assets may not be sufficient to repay in full such indebtedness, which would have a material adverse effect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe may be adversely affected by changes in LIBOR reporting practices, the method in which LIBOR is determined, or the use of alternative reference rates.\nIt is expected the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) will be discontinued as a reference rate for financial contracts by the end of 2021. Financial regulators and institutions have proposed replacing the LIBOR reference rate with a Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\"). SOFR is a measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight, collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities, and is based on observable U.S. Treasury-backed repurchase transactions.\nCertain types of borrowings under our revolving credit facility, which matures in April 2023, are derived from the LIBOR reference rate. Our revolving credit agreement includes general provisions governing the establishment of an alternate rate of\ninterest to the LIBOR-based rate that gives consideration to the then prevailing market convention for determining a rate of interest for comparable syndicated loans. At this time, the impact on the Company's borrowing costs, if any, under an alternative reference rate scenario is uncertain. Additionally, it remains uncertain whether and to what extent banks will continue to provide LIBOR submissions, whether LIBOR rates will cease to be published or supported before or after 2021, or whether any additional reforms to LIBOR may be enacted.\nThe inability of joint interest owners, significant customers, and service providers to meet their obligations to us may adversely affect our financial results.\nOur principal exposure to credit risk is through the sale of our crude oil and natural gas production, which we market to energy marketing companies, crude oil refining companies, and natural gas gathering and processing companies ($727 million in receivables at December 31, 2019) and our joint interest and other receivables ($315 million at December 31, 2019). These counterparties may experience insolvency or liquidity issues and may not be able to meet their obligations and liabilities owed to us, particularly during a period of depressed commodity prices. Defaults by these counterparties could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, we rely on field service companies and midstream companies for services associated with the drilling and completion of wells and for certain midstream services. A worsening of the commodity price environment may result in a material adverse impact on the liquidity and financial position of the parties with whom we do business, resulting in delays in payment of, or non-payment of, amounts owed to us, delays in operations, loss of access to equipment and facilities and similar impacts. These events could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur derivative activities could result in financial losses or reduce our earnings.\nAlthough our future crude oil and natural gas production is unhedged as of December 31, 2019, from time to time we may enter into derivative instruments for a potentially significant portion of our production to achieve more predictable cash flows and reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in commodity prices. We do not designate our derivative instruments, if any, as hedges for accounting purposes and we record all derivatives on our balance sheet at fair value. Changes in the fair value of any such derivatives are recognized in earnings. Accordingly, our earnings may fluctuate materially as a result of changes in commodity prices and resulting changes in the fair value of any outstanding derivatives.\nDerivative instruments expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including when:\n\u2022\nproduction is less than the volume covered by the derivative instruments;\n\u2022\nthe counterparty to the derivative instrument defaults on its contractual obligations; or\n\u2022\nthere is an increase in the differential between the underlying price in the derivative instrument and actual prices received.\nIn addition, derivative arrangements limit the benefit we would otherwise receive from increases in commodity prices. Our decision on the quantity and price at which we choose to hedge our future production, if any, is based in part on our view of current and future market conditions and our desire to stabilize cash flows necessary for the development of our proved reserves. We may choose not to hedge future production if the pricing environment for certain time periods is deemed to be unfavorable. Additionally, we may choose to liquidate derivative positions prior to the expiration of their contractual maturities in order to monetize gain positions for the purpose of funding our capital program or other business opportunities.\nOur Executive Chairman beneficially owns approximately 77% of our outstanding common stock, giving him influence and control in corporate transactions and other matters, including a sale of our Company.\nAs of December 31, 2019, Harold G. Hamm, our Executive Chairman, beneficially owned approximately 77% of our outstanding common shares. As a result, Mr. Hamm has control over our Company and will continue to be able to control the election of our directors, determine our corporate and management policies and determine, without the consent of our other shareholders, the outcome of certain corporate transactions or other matters submitted to our shareholders for approval, including potential mergers or acquisitions, asset sales and other significant corporate transactions. Therefore, Mr. Hamm could cause, delay or prevent a change of control of our Company. The interests of Mr. Hamm may not coincide with the interests of other holders of our common stock.\nWe have historically entered into, and may enter into, transactions from time to time with companies or persons affiliated with Mr. Hamm if, after an independent review by our Audit Committee or by the independent members of our Board of Directors, it is determined such transactions are in the Company\u2019s best interests and are on terms no less favorable to us than could be achieved with an unaffiliated third party. These transactions may result in conflicts of interest between Mr. Hamm\u2019s affiliated parties and us.\nWe have been an early entrant into new or emerging plays. As a result, our drilling results in these areas are uncertain, and the value of our undeveloped acreage will decline if drilling results are unsuccessful.\nWhile our costs to acquire undeveloped acreage in new or emerging plays have generally been less than those of later entrants into a developing play, our drilling results in new or emerging areas are more uncertain than drilling results in developed and producing areas. Since new or emerging plays have limited or no production history, we are unable to use past drilling results in those areas to help predict our future drilling results. As a result, our cost of drilling, completing and operating wells in these areas may be higher than initially expected, and the value of our undeveloped acreage in the emerging areas may decline if drilling results are unsuccessful.\nWe may be subject to risks in connection with acquisitions, divestitures, and joint development arrangements.\nAs part of our business strategy, we have made and will likely continue to make acquisitions of oil and gas properties, divest of assets, and enter into joint development arrangements. Suitable acquisition properties, buyers of our assets, or joint development counterparties may not be available on terms and conditions we find acceptable or not at all.\nThe successful acquisition of producing properties requires an assessment of several factors, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nrecoverable reserves;\n\u2022\nfuture crude oil and natural gas prices and location and quality differentials;\n\u2022\nthe quality of the title to acquired properties;\n\u2022\nfuture development costs, operating costs and property taxes; and\n\u2022\npotential environmental and other liabilities.\nThe accuracy of these acquisition assessments is inherently uncertain. In connection with these assessments, we perform a review, which we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices, of the subject properties. Our review will not reveal all existing or potential problems nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and capabilities prior to acquisition. Inspections may not always be performed on every property, and environmental problems are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken. Even when problems are identified, the seller of the subject properties may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of the problems. We sometimes are not entitled to contractual indemnification for environmental liabilities and acquire properties on an \u201cas is\u201d basis.\nIn addition, from time to time we may sell or otherwise dispose of certain assets as a result of an evaluation of our asset portfolio or to provide cash flow for use in reducing debt and enhancing liquidity. Such divestitures have inherent risks, including possible delays in closing, the risk of lower-than-expected sales proceeds for the disposed assets, and potential post-closing adjustments and claims for indemnification. Additionally, volatility and unpredictability in commodity prices may result in fewer potential bidders, unsuccessful sales efforts, and a higher risk that buyers may seek to terminate a transaction prior to closing. The occurrence of any of the matters described above could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.", "PERMNO": 91983, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "CLR"}
