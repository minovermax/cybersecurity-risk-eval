{"cik": "1679273", "company": "Lamb Weston Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-07-27", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur business is subject to various risks and uncertainties. Any of the risks and uncertainties described below could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations and should be considered in evaluating us. Although the risks are organized by heading, and each risk is described separately, many of the risks are interrelated. While we believe we have identified and discussed below the material risks affecting our business, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know or that we do not currently believe to be material that may adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations in the future.\nBusiness and Operating Risks\nPandemics or other contagious outbreaks and government actions taken in response thereto, may adversely impact, and in the case of the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely impacted and are likely to continue to adversely impact, our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe ultimate impact that the COVID-19 pandemic and any future pandemic or other contagious outbreak will have on our business, financial condition, and results of operations is uncertain. To date, the efforts by national, state and local governments worldwide to control the spread of COVID-19 have resulted in widespread measures aimed at containing the disease such as quarantines, travel bans, shutdowns, and shelter-in-place or stay-at-home orders, which have significantly restricted the movement of people and goods. These restrictions and measures, and our efforts to act in the best interests of our employees, customers, suppliers, vendors, and joint venture and other business partners, have affected and are continuing to affect our business and operations. Some of the impacts our business has experienced, is experiencing and may experience as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, or any future pandemic or other contagious outbreak, include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u25cf decreased sales to our foodservice customers resulting from the closure or reduction in capacity of many full-service restaurants and other commercial operations (e.g., hotels, schools and universities, sporting venues), which significantly reduced consumer traffic;\n\u25cf reduced demand at quick service restaurants and in particular, in our international markets where most consumption is dine-in or carry-out as drive-thru options are more limited;\n\u25cf modification of a number of our business practices, including instituting ongoing evaluation of our manufacturing employees\u2019 COVID-19 symptom status, higher costs associated with purchasing personal protection equipment and health screening equipment and services, and enhanced cleaning and sanitation protocols to protect our employees;\n\u25cf shutdowns of one or more of our manufacturing facilities or production lines due to illness and the continuous evaluation of the need for additional closures or temporary shutdowns to protect employee health;\n\u25cf disruptions in production timing and manufacturing operations, including adjusting schedules to accommodate higher than normal absenteeism among our hourly employees, shifting production from one facility to another, and hiring a significant number of new employees in our manufacturing facilities, which increased costs and inefficiencies;\n\u25cf continued commodity cost volatility, including higher edible oil costs, which may not be sufficiently offset by our commodity hedging activities;\n\u25cf increased transportation and warehousing costs, as well as disruptions in the transport of goods from our supply chain to us and from us to our customers, causing us to rely more heavily on higher cost transportation to maintain customer service levels;\n\u25cf disruptions to our distribution capabilities or to our distribution channels, including those of our suppliers, logistics service providers, or independent distributors;\n\u25cf failure of third parties on which we rely, including but not limited to, those that supply our packaging, ingredients, equipment and other necessary operating materials, co-manufacturers and independent contractors, to meet their obligations to us, or significant disruptions in their ability to do so;\n\u25cf reductions in the availability of one or more of our products as we prioritize the production of other products due to increased demand;\n\u25cf modifications of our business continuity plans;\n\u25cf changes to our existing manufacturing practices required by the implementation of social distancing measures and increased costs related to the payment of additional wage expenses, paid time off for employees who are not working for reasons related to COVID-19 and overtime expense to manage production schedules to offset the impact of closures at other plants;\n\u25cf disruptions in business travel;\n\u25cf disruptions in our ability to staff our on-site manufacturing and research and development facilities;\n\u25cf delay of our capital expansion projects and other capital expenditures; and\n\u25cf increased reliance on our information technology system as a result of work-from-home Company policies, causing us to be more vulnerable to cyberattacks or other disruptions as a result of team members accessing our networks and systems from off-site.\nThese impacts have caused, and are expected to continue to cause, changes in the mix of products sold, decreases in revenue, and increases in costs resulting in decreased profitability and cash flows from operations, which have caused, and are expected to continue to cause, an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations that may be material. Although government restrictions have been reduced or lifted, the negative impact on consumer traffic may continue to some degree because restaurants and other foodservice venues may be required to operate at reduced capacities and consumers may fear gathering in public places. In addition, resurgences of COVID-19 infections after restrictions are lifted could cause governments to impose new or stricter closures, limits on capacity or social distancing requirements. These restrictions could cause consumer demand for food away from home to decline. While we have experienced increased demand for our retail products, that increase in demand cannot entirely offset the decrease in demand from our foodservice customers. Further, retail demand may gradually decline as consumers begin to shift purchases of fries to dining at restaurants as governments lift social restrictions. We cannot predict whether and to what extent changes in consumer food purchasing behavior will persist even after the threat of the COVID-19 pandemic has been eliminated or how those changes would affect our business.\nCOVID-19 has disrupted, and the spread of pandemics or other contagious outbreaks may also disrupt, our customers, suppliers, vendors and joint venture and other business partners, and each of their financial conditions. Any material adverse effect on these parties could adversely impact us. In this regard, the potential duration and impacts of pandemics or other contagious outbreaks such as the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy and on our business, financial condition, and results of operations are difficult to predict and cannot be estimated with any degree of certainty, but the pandemic has resulted in significant disruption of global financial markets, increases in levels of unemployment and economic uncertainty, which has adversely impacted our business and may continue to do so. These developments have and may continue to lead to significant negative impacts on customer spending, demand for our products, the ability of our customers to pay, our financial condition and the financial condition of our suppliers.\nThe impact of COVID-19 may also exacerbate other risks discussed in this Form 10-K. The ultimate impact depends on the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response, each of which is uncertain, rapidly changing and difficult to predict. Any of these disruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected by increased costs, disruption of supply or interruptions or other constraints in the availability of key commodities and other necessary services.\nA significant portion of our cost of goods comes from commodities such as raw potatoes, edible oil, and energy. These commodities are subject to price volatility and fluctuations in availability caused by many factors, including changes in global supply and demand, weather conditions (including any potential effects of climate change), fire, natural disasters (such as a hurricane, tornado, earthquake, wildfire or flooding), disease or pests, agricultural uncertainty, water stress, health epidemics or pandemics or other contagious outbreaks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, governmental incentives and controls (including import/export restrictions, such as new or increased tariffs, sanctions, quotas or trade barriers), limited or sole sources of supply, political uncertainties, acts of terrorism, governmental instability, or currency exchange rates. Despite our ability to source raw materials necessary to meet demand for our products, certain ingredients and packaging, including edible oils and other commodities have been adversely impacted by shortages during the COVID-19 pandemic. Although we are unable to predict the impact to our ability to source these materials in the future, we expect these supply pressures to continue in the near future. In addition, we also incur expenses in connection with the transportation and delivery of our products. Due to disruptions related to COVID-19 in our production facilities, we have experienced increases in transportation and warehousing costs. Commodity price increases, or a sustained interruption or other constraints in the supply or availability of key commodities, including necessary services such as transportation and warehousing, have increased and may continue to increase our operating costs and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. During fiscal 2021, as a result of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, we were not able to, and in the future, we may not be able to, increase our product prices and achieve cost savings that fully offset these increased costs; and increasing prices may result in reduced sales volume and decreased profitability.\nThere is currently no active derivatives market for potatoes in the United States. Although we have experience in hedging against commodity price increases, these practices and experience reduce, but do not eliminate, the risk of negative profit impacts from commodity price increases. As a result, the risk management procedures that we use may not always work as we intend.\nOur future success and earnings growth depend in part on our ability to maintain the appropriate cost structure and operate efficiently in the highly competitive value-added frozen potato product category. We continue to implement profit-enhancing initiatives that improve the efficiency of our supply chain and general and administrative functions. These initiatives are focused on cost-saving opportunities in procurement, manufacturing, logistics, and customer service, as well as general and administrative functions. However, gaining additional efficiencies may become more difficult over time.\nIn addition, we may have significant supply chain disruptions due to a number of factors outside of our control, including public health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which has disrupted production and increased transportation and warehousing costs. These factors may lead to our inability to access or deliver products that meet requisite quality and safety standards in a timely and efficient manner, which have led and could lead to in the future increased warehouse and other storage costs. Our failure to reduce costs through productivity gains or the elimination of redundant costs, or the occurrence of a significant supply chain disruption or the inability to access or deliver products, could adversely affect our profitability and weaken our competitive position or otherwise harm our business.\nChanges in our relationships with our growers could adversely affect us.\nWe expend considerable resources to develop and maintain relationships with many potato growers. In some instances, we have entered into long-term agreements with growers; however, a large portion of our potato needs are typically sourced on an annual contracted basis. To the extent we are unable to maintain positive relationships with our long-term growers, contracted growers deliver less supply than we expect, or we are unable to secure sufficient potatoes from uncontracted growers in a given year, we may not have sufficient potato supply to satisfy our business opportunities. To obtain sufficient potato supply, we may be required to purchase potatoes at prices substantially higher than expected, or forgo sales to some market segments, which would reduce our profitability. If we forgo sales to such market segments, we may lose customers and may not be able to regain or replace them later.\nOur business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected by the political and economic conditions of the countries in which we conduct business and other factors related to our international operations, including foreign currency risks and trade barriers.\nWe conduct a substantial and growing amount of business with customers located outside the United States, including through our joint ventures. During each of fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, net sales outside the United States, primarily in Australia, Canada, China, Japan, Korea, Mexico, and Taiwan, accounted for approximately 20% of our net sales. These amounts do not include any impact of unconsolidated net sales associated with our joint ventures, which are also subject to risks associated with international operations.\nMany factors relating to our domestic and international sales and operations, many of which are outside of our control, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations, including:\n\u25cf pandemics and other public health crises, such as the flu, which may lead, and in the case of the COVID-19 pandemic, have led to measures that decrease revenues, disrupt our supply chain or otherwise increase our storage, production or distribution costs and adversely affect our workforce, local suppliers, customers and consumers of our products;\n\u25cf foreign exchange rates, foreign currency exchange and transfer restrictions, which may unpredictably and adversely impact our combined operating results, asset and liability balances, and cash flow in our consolidated financial statements, even if their value has not changed in their original currency;\n\u25cf our consolidated financial statements are presented in U.S. dollars, and we must translate the assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses into U.S. dollars for external reporting purposes;\n\u25cf changes in trade, monetary and fiscal policies of the United States and foreign governments, including modification or termination of existing trade agreements or treaties (e.g. the United States - Mexico - Canada\nAgreement), creation of new trade agreements or treaties, trade regulations, and increased or new tariffs, quotas, import or export licensing requirements, and other trade barriers imposed by governments. In particular, changes in U.S. trade programs and trade relations with other countries, including the imposition of trade protection measures by foreign countries in favor of their local producers of competing products, such as governmental subsidies, tax benefits, and other measures giving local producers a competitive advantage over Lamb Weston, may adversely affect our business and results of operations in those countries;\n\u25cf negative economic developments in economies around the world and the instability of governments, including the threat of wars, terrorist attacks, epidemics or civil unrest;\n\u25cf earthquakes, tsunamis, droughts, floods or other major disasters that may limit the supply of raw materials that are purchased abroad for use in our international operations or domestically;\n\u25cf increased costs, disruptions in shipping or reduced availability of freight transportation and warehousing;\n\u25cf differing employment practices and labor standards in the international markets in which we operate;\n\u25cf differing levels of protection of intellectual property across the international markets in which we operate;\n\u25cf difficulties and costs associated with complying with U.S. laws and regulations applicable to entities with overseas operations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act;\n\u25cf the threat that our operations or property could be subject to nationalization and expropriation;\n\u25cf varying regulatory, tax, judicial and administrative practices in the international markets in which we operate;\n\u25cf difficulties associated with operating under a wide variety of complex foreign laws, treaties and regulations;\n\u25cf potentially burdensome taxation; and\n\u25cf uncertainty regarding the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) as certain of our interest rates on debt obligations and investments are based on LIBOR, and a portion of our indebtedness bears interest at variable interest rates, primarily based on LIBOR. LIBOR is the subject of recent national, international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform, which may cause all LIBOR tenors to disappear entirely after June 30, 2023 or to perform differently than in the past. While we expect that reasonable alternatives to LIBOR will be implemented prior to the June 30, 2023 target date, we cannot predict the consequences and timing of these developments, and they could include an increase in our interest expense and/or a reduction in our interest income.\nAny of these factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nChanges in our relationships with significant customers could adversely affect us.\nWe maintain a diverse customer base across our four reporting segments. Customers include global, national and regional quick service and fast casual restaurants as well as small, independently operated restaurants, multinational, broadline foodservice distributors, regional foodservice distributors, and major food retailers. Some of these customers independently represent a meaningful portion of our sales. In addition, we depend on foodservice distributors to help us create end-customer demand, provide technical support and other value-added services to customers, fill customer orders, and stock our products. A material change in our relationship with one or more of these distributors or their failure to perform as expected could reduce our revenue. The foodservice distributors also sell products that compete with our products, and we sometimes need to reduce prices or provide rebates and other incentives to focus them on the sale of our products. While we contract annually or biannually with many of our foodservice customers, the loss of a significant customer or a material reduction in sales to a significant customer could materially impact our business.\nOur largest customer, McDonald\u2019s Corporation, accounted for approximately 11% of our consolidated net sales in fiscal 2021 and 10% of our consolidated net sales in both fiscal 2020 and 2019. There can be no assurance that our customers will continue to purchase our products in the same quantities or on the same terms as in the past. The loss of a significant customer or a material reduction in sales to a significant customer could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. In addition, the financial condition of our significant customers, including restaurants, distributors and retailers, are affected by events that are largely beyond our control, such as the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and possible future pandemics or other contagious outbreaks. Deterioration in the financial condition of significant customers could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nDisruption of our access to export mechanisms could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nTo serve our customers globally, we rely in part on our international joint venture partnerships, but also on exports from the United States. During fiscal 2021, 2020, and 2019, export sales from the United States accounted for approximately 13%, 16% and 16%, respectively, of our total net sales. Circumstances beyond our control, such as a labor dispute at a port or workforce disruption due to the COVID-19 pandemic or future pandemics or other contagious outbreaks, could prevent us from exporting our products in sufficient quantities to meet customer opportunities. We have access to production outside of the United States through our facilities in Australia, Canada and China and joint ventures in Argentina and Europe, but we may be unsuccessful in mitigating any future disruption to export mechanisms. If this occurs, we may be unable to adequately supply all of our existing customers\u2019 needs and new customer opportunities, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur operations are dependent on a wide array of third parties.\nThe success of our end-to-end supply chain relies on the continued performance of a wide array of third parties. Suppliers, co-packers, third-party outsourcers, warehousing partners, and transportation providers are among our critical partners. Although we take steps to qualify and audit third parties with whom we do business, we cannot guarantee that all third parties will perform dependably or at all. It is possible that events beyond our control, such as operational failures, labor issues, cybersecurity events, pandemics or other health issues, such as COVID-19, or other issues could impact our unaffiliated third parties. If our third parties fail to deliver on their commitments, introduce unplanned risk to our operations (e.g., through cyber activity), or are unable to fulfill their obligations, we could experience manufacturing challenges, shipment delays, increased costs, or lost revenue, which could also impact our relationships with customers and our brand image.\nIn addition to our own manufacturing facilities, we source a portion of our products under co-packing agreements. The success of our business depends, in part, on maintaining a strong sourcing and manufacturing platform. We believe that there are a limited number of competent, high-quality co-packers in the industry, and if we were required to obtain additional or alternative co-packing agreements or arrangements in the future, we can provide no assurance that we would be able to do so on satisfactory terms or in a timely manner. Our inability to enter into satisfactory co-packing agreements could limit our ability to implement our business plan or meet customer demand.\nA portion of our business is, and several of our growth strategies are, conducted through joint ventures that do not operate solely for our benefit.\nWe have built our company, in part, through the creation of joint ventures, some of which we do not control. In these relationships, we share ownership and management of a company that operates for the benefit of all owners, rather than our exclusive benefit. Through our extensive experience in operating a portion of our business through joint ventures, we understand that joint ventures often require additional resources and procedures for information sharing and decision-making. If our joint venture partners take actions that have negative impacts on the joint venture, or disagree with the strategies we have developed to grow these businesses, we may have limited ability to influence and mitigate those actions or decisions and our ability to achieve our growth strategies may be negatively impacted.\nDamage to our reputation as a trusted partner to customers and good corporate citizen could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur customers rely on us and our co-manufacturers to manufacture safe, high quality food products. Product contamination or tampering, the failure to maintain high standards for product quality, safety, and integrity, or allegations of product quality issues, mislabeling or contamination, even if untrue, may damage the reputation of our customers, and ultimately our reputation as a trusted industry partner. Damage to either could reduce demand for our products or cause production and delivery disruptions.\nOur reputation could also be adversely impacted by any of the following, or by adverse publicity (whether or not valid) relating thereto: the failure to maintain high ethical, social, and environmental standards for our operations and activities, including the health, safety and security of our employees; our research and development efforts; our\nenvironmental impact, including use of agricultural materials, packaging, energy use, and waste management; our failure to comply with local laws and regulations; our failure to maintain an effective system of internal controls; or our failure to provide accurate and timely financial information. Damage to our reputation or loss of customer confidence in our products for any of these or other reasons could result in decreased demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to rebuild our reputation.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain key personnel, our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur success depends on our ability to attract and retain personnel with professional and technical expertise, such as agricultural and food manufacturing experience, as well as finance, marketing, and other senior management professionals. The loss of the services of these persons could deplete our institutional knowledge and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The market for these employees is competitive, and we could experience difficulty from time to time in hiring and retaining the personnel necessary to support our business. If we do not succeed in retaining our current employees, attracting new high-quality employees, and developing adequate training and succession plans for leadership positions, our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to complete potential acquisitions that strategically fit our business objectives, integrate acquired businesses, or execute on large capital projects, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nFrom time to time, we evaluate acquisition candidates that may strategically fit our business objectives. Our acquisition activities may present financial, managerial, and operational risks. Those risks include: (i) diversion of management attention from existing businesses, (ii) difficulties integrating personnel and financial and other systems, (iii) difficulties implementing effective control environment processes, (iv) adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers, (v) inaccurate estimates of fair value made in the accounting for acquisitions and amortization of acquired intangible assets, which would reduce future reported earnings, (vi) potential loss of customers or key employees of acquired businesses, and (vii) indemnities and potential disputes with the sellers. If we are unable to complete acquisitions or successfully integrate and develop acquired businesses or execute on large capital projects, such as new production lines or facilities, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur results could be adversely impacted as a result of increased pension, labor and people-related expenses.\nInflationary pressures and any shortages in the labor market could increase labor costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our labor costs include the cost of providing employee benefits in the United States and foreign jurisdictions, including pension, health and welfare, and severance benefits. Changes in interest rates, mortality rates, health care costs, early retirement rates, investment returns, and the market value of plan assets can affect the funded status of our defined benefit plans and cause volatility in the future funding requirements of the plans. A significant increase in our obligations or future funding requirements could have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows from operations. Additionally, the annual costs of benefits vary with increased costs of health care and the outcome of collectively-bargained wage and benefit agreements.\nOur substantial debt may limit cash flow available to invest in the ongoing needs of our business and could prevent us from fulfilling our debt obligations.\nWe have incurred substantial indebtedness. As of May 30, 2021, we had $2,737.4 million of long-term debt, including current portion, recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. Our level of debt could have important consequences. For example, it could:\n\u25cf make it more difficult for us to make payments on our debt;\n\u25cf require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of debt service, reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes;\n\u25cf increase our vulnerability to adverse economic or industry conditions;\n\u25cf limit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future to enable us to react to changes in our business; or\n\u25cf place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to businesses in our industry that have less debt.\nThe agreements governing our debt contain various covenants that impose restrictions on us that may affect our ability to operate our business.\nThe credit agreements governing our term loans and revolving credit facility and the indentures governing our senior notes contain covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to:\n\u25cf borrow money or guarantee debt;\n\u25cf create liens;\n\u25cf pay dividends on or redeem or repurchase stock;\n\u25cf make specified types of investments and acquisitions;\n\u25cf enter into agreements that limit the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or other payments to us;\n\u25cf enter into transactions with affiliates; and\n\u25cf sell assets or merge with other companies.\nThese restrictions on our ability to operate our business could harm our business by, among other things, limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, merger and acquisition or other corporate opportunities.\nVarious risks, uncertainties and events beyond our control could affect our ability to comply with these covenants. Failure to comply with any of the covenants in our existing or future financing agreements could result in a default under those agreements and under other agreements containing cross-default provisions. A default would permit lenders to accelerate the maturity of the debt under these agreements and to foreclose upon any collateral securing the debt. Under these circumstances, we might not have sufficient funds or other resources to satisfy all of our obligations. Also, the limitations imposed by these financing agreements on our ability to incur additional debt and to take other actions might significantly impair our ability to obtain other financing.\nIn addition, the restrictive covenants in our credit agreements require us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests. We cannot provide assurance that we will continue to be in compliance with these ratios and tests. Our ability to continue to meet those financial ratios and tests will depend on our ongoing financial and operating performance, which, in turn, will be subject to economic conditions and to financial, market, and competitive factors, many of which are beyond our control. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under one or more of our debt instruments, including as a result of cross default provisions and, in the case of our revolving credit facility, permit the lenders thereunder to cease making loans to us. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under our credit facilities, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding thereunder to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. Such action by the lenders could cause cross-defaults under our senior notes indentures.\nAny failure to meet required payments on our debt, or failure to comply with any covenants in the instruments governing our debt, could result in a downgrade to our credit ratings. A downgrade in our credit ratings could limit our access to capital and increase our borrowing costs. Further, under the terms of the tax matters agreement we entered into with Conagra at the spinoff, we may not retire, repurchase, or significantly modify our senior notes due 2024 and 2026 during the five-year period following the spinoff, which period ends on November 9, 2021.\nTechnology Risks\nWe are significantly dependent on information technology, and we may be unable to protect our information systems against service interruption, misappropriation of data, or breaches of security.\nWe rely on information technology networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit, and store electronic and financial information, to manage and support a variety of business processes and activities, and to comply with regulatory, legal, and tax requirements. We also depend upon our information technology infrastructure for digital marketing activities and for electronic communications among our locations, personnel, customers, third-party manufacturers and suppliers. The importance of such networks and systems has increased due to many of our employees working remotely as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which in turn has heightened our vulnerability to cyberattacks or other disruptions. Despite careful security and controls design, implementation and updating, independent third-party verification and regular training of employees on information security and data protection, our information technology systems, some of which are dependent on services provided by third parties, may be vulnerable to, among other things, damage, invasions, disruptions, or shutdowns due to any number of causes such as catastrophic events, natural disasters, infectious disease outbreaks and other public health crises, fires, power outages, systems failures, telecommunications failures, security breaches, computer viruses, ransomware and malware, hackers, employee error or malfeasance, and other causes. While we have experienced threats to our data and systems, to date, we are not aware that we have experienced a material breach. However, over time, and particularly recently, the sophistication of these threats continues to increase. Sophisticated cybersecurity threats pose a potential risk to the security and viability of our information technology systems, as well as the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data stored on those systems, including cloud-based platforms. In addition, new technology that could result in greater operational efficiency may further expose our computer systems to the risk of cyber-attacks. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure and associated automated and manual control processes, we could be subject to billing and collection errors, business disruptions, or damage resulting from security breaches. If any of our significant information technology systems suffer severe damage, disruption, or shutdown and our business continuity plans do not effectively resolve the issues in a timely manner, our product sales, financial condition, and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected, and we could experience delays in reporting our financial results. Any interruption of our information technology systems could have operational, reputational, legal, and financial impacts that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn addition, if we are unable to prevent security breaches or unauthorized disclosure of non-public information, we may suffer financial and reputational damage, litigation or remediation costs, fines, or penalties because of the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our partners, customers or suppliers.\nMisuse, leakage, or falsification of information could result in violations of data privacy laws and regulations, potentially significant fines and penalties, damage to our reputation and credibility, loss of strategic opportunities, and loss of ability to commercialize products developed through research and development efforts and, therefore, could have a negative impact on net sales. In addition, we may face business interruptions, litigation, and financial and reputational damage because of lost or misappropriated confidential information belonging to us, our current or former employees, or to our suppliers or customers, and may become subject to legal action and increased regulatory oversight. We could also be required to spend significant financial and other resources to remedy the damage caused by a security breach or to repair or replace networks and information systems.\nProblems with the transition, design, or implementation of our new enterprise resource planning system could interfere with our business and operations and adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe are in the process of implementing a new ERP system to replace our existing operating and financial systems. The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain our financial records, enhance operational functionality, and provide timely information to our management team related to the operation of the business. The ERP system implementation process has required, and will continue to require, the investment of significant personnel and financial resources. While we have completed the first phase of our new ERP system implementation, we paused subsequent phases due to the uncertainty caused by COVID-19. We are preparing to resume the next phase of the ERP implementation in fiscal 2022. We have experienced, and may continue to experience, difficulties as we transition to new upgraded systems and processes.\nThese difficulties have and may include loss of data; difficulty in making payments to third-parties; difficulty in completing financial reporting and filing reports with the SEC in a timely manner; or challenges in otherwise running our business. We may also experience decreases in productivity as our personnel implement and become familiar with new systems and processes. Any disruptions, delays, or deficiencies in the transition, design, and implementation of a new ERP system, particularly any disruptions, delays, or deficiencies that impact our operations, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Even if we do not encounter adverse effects, the transition, design, and implementation of a new ERP system, may be much more costly than we anticipated.\nIndustry Risks\nOur business relies on a potato crop that has a concentrated growing region.\nIdeal growing conditions for the potatoes necessary for our value-added products (e.g., french fries) are concentrated in a few geographic regions globally. In the United States, most of the potato crop used in value-added products is grown in Washington, Idaho, and Oregon. European growing regions for the necessary potatoes are concentrated in Austria, Belgium, Germany, France, the Netherlands, Russia, and the United Kingdom. Recent agronomic developments have opened new growing regions, but the capital-intensive nature of our industry\u2019s production processes has kept production highly concentrated in the historical growing regions noted above. Unfavorable crop conditions in any one region could lead to significant demand on the other regions for production, which occurred in connection with the drought in Europe during fiscal 2019. Our inability to mitigate any such conditions by leveraging our production capabilities in other regions could negatively impact our ability to meet existing customers\u2019 needs and new customer opportunities and could decrease our profitability.\nOur business is affected by potato crop performance.\nOur primary input is potatoes and every year, we must procure potatoes that meet the quality standards for processing into value-added products. Environmental and climate conditions, such as soil quality, moisture, and temperature, affect the yield and quality of the potato crop on a year-to-year basis. As a result, we source potatoes from specific regions of the United States and specific countries abroad, including Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, China, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Russia, and the United Kingdom, where we believe the optimal potato growing conditions exist. However, severe weather conditions, including protracted periods of extreme heat or cold, during the planting and growing season in these regions can significantly affect potato crop performance, such as the drought in Europe during our fiscal year 2019 that resulted in poor crop and significantly limited supply. Potatoes are also susceptible to pest diseases and insects that can cause crop failure, decreased yields, and negatively affect the physical appearance of the potatoes. We have deep experience in agronomy and actively work to monitor the potato crop. However, if a weather or pest-related event occurs in a particular crop year, and our agronomic programs are insufficient to mitigate the impacts thereof, we may have insufficient potatoes to meet our existing customers\u2019 needs and new customer opportunities, and our competitiveness and profitability could decrease. Alternatively, overly favorable growing conditions can lead to high per acre yields and over-supply. An increased supply of potatoes could lead to overproduction of finished goods and associated increased storage costs or destruction of unused potatoes at a loss.\nThe sophistication and buying power of some of our customers could have a negative impact on profits.\nSome of our customers are large and sophisticated, with buying power and negotiating strength. These customers may be more capable of resisting price increases and more likely to demand lower pricing, increased promotional programs, or specialty tailored products. In addition, some of these customers (e.g., larger distributors and supermarkets) have the scale to develop supply chains that permit them to operate with reduced inventories or to develop and market their own brands. Shelf space at food retailers is not guaranteed, and large retail customers may choose to stock their own retailer and other economy brands that compete with some of our products. This could be exacerbated with a shift in consumer spending as a result of an economic downturn and consumers moving to private label or lower priced products. If the initiatives we undertake to counteract these pressures, including efficiency programs and investments in innovation and quality, are unsuccessful and we are unable to counteract the negotiating strength of these customers, our profitability could decline.\nIncreased competition may result in reduced sales or profits.\nOur business, value-added frozen potato products, is highly competitive. Competitors include large North American and European frozen potato product companies that compete globally, local and regional companies, and retailers and foodservice distributors with their own branded and private label products. Some of our competitors are larger and have substantial financial, sales and marketing, and other resources. We compete based on, among other things, customer service, value, product innovation, product quality, brand recognition and loyalty, price, and the ability to identify and satisfy customer preferences. A strong competitive response from one or more of our competitors to our marketplace efforts could result in us reducing pricing, increasing spend on promotional activity, or losing market share. For example, private label pricing has become more competitive recently as European competitors have increased their presence in the United States, as they leverage their excess production capacity due to decreased demand following government-imposed COVID-related social restrictions. Competitive pressures may restrict our ability to increase prices, including in response to commodity and other input cost increases or additional improvements in product quality. Our profits could decrease if a reduction in prices or increased costs are not counterbalanced with increased sales volume.\nIncreased industry capacity may result in reduced sales or profits.\nIn recent years, market demand for value-added frozen potato products has exceeded industry capacity to produce these products. As additional industry capacity comes online, or market demand otherwise decreases, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or future pandemics or other contagious outbreaks, we may face competitive pressures that would restrict our ability to increase or maintain prices, or we may lose market share. For example, during fiscal 2021, we faced increased pricing pressure for private label products due to excess production capacity in Europe that resulted from decreased demand following government-imposed COVID-related social restrictions. Our profits would decrease as a result of a reduction in prices or sales volume.\nWe must identify changing consumer preferences and consumption trends and develop and offer food products to our customers that help meet those preferences and trends.\nConsumer preferences evolve over time and our success depends on our ability to identify the tastes and dietary habits of consumers and offer products that appeal to those preferences. We need to continue to respond to these changing consumer preferences and support our customers in their efforts to evolve to meet those preferences. For example, as consumers focus on freshly prepared foods, some restaurants may choose to limit the frying capabilities of their kitchens. As a result, we must evolve our product offering to provide alternatives that work in such a preparation environment. In addition, our products contain carbohydrates, sodium, genetically modified ingredients, added sugars, saturated fats, and preservatives, the diet and health effects of which remain the subject of public scrutiny. We must continue to reformulate our products, introduce new products and create product extensions without a loss of the taste, texture, and appearance that consumers demand in value-added potato products. All of these efforts require significant research and development and marketing investments. If our products fail to meet consumer preferences or customer requirements, or we fail to introduce new and improved products on a timely basis, then the return on those investments will be less than anticipated, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn addition, we compete against branded products as well as private label products. Our products must provide higher value and/or quality to our customers and consumers than alternatives, particularly during periods of economic uncertainty. Consumers may not buy our products if relative differences in value and/or quality between our products and private label products change in favor of competitors\u2019 products or if consumers perceive this type of change. If consumers prefer private label products, which are typically sold at lower prices, then we could lose market share or sales volumes or shift our product mix to lower margin offerings. During an economic downturn, factors such as increased unemployment, decreases in disposable income and declines in consumer confidence could cause a decrease in demand for our overall product offerings, particularly higher priced products, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Distributors, restaurants and retailers may also become more conservative in response to these conditions and seek to reduce their inventories. A change in consumer preferences could also cause us to increase capital, marketing, and other expenditures, which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nWe may be subject to product liability claims and product recalls, which could negatively impact our relationships with customers and harm our business.\nWe sell food products for human consumption, which involves risks such as product contamination or spoilage, product tampering, other adulteration of food products, mislabeling, and misbranding. We may voluntarily recall or withdraw products from the market in certain circumstances, which would cause us to incur associated costs; those costs could be meaningful. We may also be subject to litigation, requests for indemnification from our customers, or liability if the consumption or inadequate preparation of any of our products causes injury, illness, or death. A significant product liability judgment or a widespread product recall may negatively impact our sales and profitability for a period of time depending on the costs of the recall, the destruction of product inventory, product availability, competitive reaction, customer reaction, and consumer attitudes. Even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness or injury could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential customers and our corporate and brand image.\nAdditionally, as a manufacturer and marketer of food products, we are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other national, state and local government agencies. The Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act, the Food Safety Modernization Act, other laws and their respective regulations govern, among other things, the manufacturing, composition and ingredients, packaging and safety of food products. Some aspects of these laws use a strict liability standard for imposing sanctions on corporate behavior, meaning that no intent is required to be established. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we may be subject to civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, recalls, or seizures, as well as criminal sanctions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nNew regulations imposed by the FDA or EFSA around acrylamide formation in potato products could adversely affect us.\nThe regulation of food products, both within the United States and internationally, continues to be a focus for governmental scrutiny. The presence and/or formation of acrylamide in potato products cooked at high temperatures has become a global regulatory issue as both the FDA and the European Food Safety Authority (\u2018\u2018EFSA\u2019\u2019) have issued guidance to the food processing industry to work to reduce conditions that favor the formation of this naturally occurring compound. Acrylamide formation is the result of heat processing reactions that give \u2018\u2018browned foods\u2019\u2019 their desirable flavor. Acrylamide formation occurs in many food types in the human diet, including but not limited to breads, toast, cookies, coffee, crackers, potatoes, and olives. The regulatory approach to acrylamide has generally been to encourage the industry to achieve as low as reasonably achievable content levels through process control (e.g., temperature) and material testing (e.g., low sugar and low asparagine). However, limits for acrylamide exposure have been established in the State of California, and point of sale consumer warnings are required if products exceed those limits. In addition, the EFSA has promulgated regulations establishing specific mitigation measures, sampling and analysis procedures and benchmark levels for acrylamide in certain food products. If the global regulatory approach to acrylamide becomes more stringent and additional legal limits are established, our manufacturing costs could increase. In addition, if consumer perception regarding the safety of our products is negatively impacted due to regulation, sales of our products could decrease.\nIf we fail to comply with the many laws and regulations applicable to our business, we may face lawsuits or incur significant fines and penalties.\nOur facilities and products are subject to many laws and regulations administered by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the FDA, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, and other federal, state, local, and foreign governmental agencies relating to the processing, packaging, storage, distribution, advertising, labeling, quality, and safety of food products, and the health and safety of our employees. Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to additional costs, product detentions, substantial delays or a temporary shutdown in manufacturing, lawsuits, administrative penalties, and civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, and recalls of our products.\nOur operations are also subject to extensive and increasingly stringent regulations administered by foreign government agencies, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and comparable state agencies, which pertain to the protection of human health and the environment, including, but not limited to, the discharge of materials into the environment and the handling and disposition of wastes. Failure to comply with these regulations can have serious consequences, including civil and administrative penalties and negative publicity. Changes in applicable laws or regulations or evolving interpretations thereof, including increased government regulations to limit the emissions of toxic air pollutants and carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions as a result of concern over climate change, may result in increased compliance costs, capital expenditures, and other financial obligations for us, which could affect our profitability or impede the production or distribution of our products, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nClimate change, or legal, regulatory, or market measures to address climate change, may negatively affect our business and operations.\nThere is growing concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns, the frequency and severity of extreme weather, and natural disasters. In the event that climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivity, we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products, such as potatoes and edible oils. In addition, water is an important part of potato processing. In times of water stress, we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for water, which could impact our manufacturing and distribution operations. Further, a decrease in the availability of water in certain regions caused by droughts or other factors could increase competition for land and resources in areas that have more favorable growing conditions, and thereby increase costs for such land and resources.\nThe increasing concern over climate change also may result in more regional, federal, and/or global legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of greenhouse gases, as well as more stringent regulation of water rights. In the event that such regulation is enacted and is more aggressive than the sustainability measures that we are currently undertaking to monitor our emissions, improve our energy efficiency, and reduce and reuse water, we may be subject to curtailment or reduced access to resources or experience significant increases in our costs of operation and delivery. As a result, climate change could negatively affect our business and operations.\nOur intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our products and brands.\nWe consider our intellectual property rights to be a significant and valuable aspect of our business. We attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through a combination of trademark, patent, copyright and trade secret protection, contractual agreements and policing of third-party misuses of our intellectual property. Our failure to obtain or adequately protect our intellectual property or any change in law that lessens or removes the current legal protections of our intellectual property may diminish our competitiveness and adversely affect our business and financial results. We also license certain intellectual property, most notably Grown in Idaho and Alexia, from third parties. To the extent that we are not able to contract with these third parties on favorable terms or maintain our relationships with these third parties, our rights to use certain intellectual property could be impacted.\nCompeting intellectual property claims that impact our brands or products may arise unexpectedly. Any litigation or disputes regarding intellectual property may be costly and time-consuming and may divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations. We also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development, launch and sale of certain products. Any of these occurrences may harm our business and financial results.\nLitigation could expose us to significant costs and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are, or may become, party to various lawsuits and claims arising in the ordinary course of business, which may include lawsuits or claims relating to commercial liability, product recalls, product liability, product claims,\nemployment matters, environmental matters, intellectual property, or other aspects of our business. Litigation is inherently unpredictable, and although we may believe we have meaningful defenses in these matters, we may incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The costs of responding to or defending litigation may be significant and may divert the attention of management away from our strategic objectives. There may also be adverse publicity associated with litigation that may decrease customer confidence in our business, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable. As a result, litigation may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nGeneral Risks\nThere are inherent limitations on the effectiveness of our controls.\nWe do not expect that our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system\u2019s objectives will be met. The design of a control system must reflect the fact that resource constraints exist, and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs. Further, because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, have been detected. For example, during fiscal 2019, we identified a material weakness in internal control related to information technology general controls and as a result, concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of May 26, 2019. Although we implemented remedial measures and concluded the material weakness had been remediated as of May 31, 2020, there is no assurance these remedial measures will continue to be effective or that we may not later identify other material weaknesses in internal controls. The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions. Projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of controls to future periods are subject to risks. Over time, controls may become inadequate due to changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures. If our controls become inadequate, we could fail to meet our financial reporting obligations, our reputation may be adversely affected, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely affected, and the market price of our stock could decline.", "PERMNO": 16431, "SIC": 2030, "TIC": "LW"}
