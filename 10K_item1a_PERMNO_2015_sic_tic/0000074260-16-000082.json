{"cik": "74260", "company": "OLD REPUBLIC INTERNATIONAL CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-29", "item_1A": "Item 1A - Risk Factors\nRisk factors are uncertainties and events over which the Company has limited or no control, and which can have a materially adverse effect on its business, results of operations or financial condition. The Company and its business segments are subject to a variety of such risk factors and, within individual segments, each type of insurance coverage may be exposed to risk factors specific to them. The following sections set forth management's evaluation of material risk factors for the Company as a whole and for each business segment. There may be risks which management does not presently consider to be material that may later prove to be material risk factors as well.\nParent Company\nDividend Dependence and Liquidity\nThe Company is an insurance holding company with no operations of its own. Substantially all of its assets consist of the business conducted by its insurance subsidiaries. It relies upon dividends from such subsidiaries in order to pay the interest and principal on its debt obligations, dividends to its shareholders, and corporate expenses. The extent to which the insurance subsidiaries are able to declare and pay dividends is subject to regulations under the laws of their states or foreign jurisdictions of domicile. The regulations limit dividends based on the amount of statutory adjusted unassigned surplus or statutory earnings, and require the insurance subsidiaries to maintain minimum amounts of capital, surplus and reserves. Dividends in excess of the ordinary limitations can only be declared and paid with prior regulatory approval, of which there can be no assurance. The inability of the insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends in an amount sufficient to meet the Company's debt service and cash dividends on stock, as well as other cash requirements could result in liquidity issues.\nCapitalization\nApart from dividends and interest on intercompany financing arrangements from its subsidiaries, the Company has access to various capital and liquidity resources including holding company investments and the public debt and equity capital markets. The availability of all such capital sources cannot, however, be assured and its cost could be significant at the time capital is raised. At December 31, 2015, the Company's consolidated debt to equity ratio was 24.8%.\nConvertible Senior Notes and Senior Notes\nOld Republic's 3.75% Convertible Senior Notes and 4.875% Senior Notes (\"the Notes\") contain provisions defining certain events of default, among them a court ordered proceeding due to the insolvency of a Significant Subsidiary. The Notes define Significant Subsidiary in accordance with paragraph (w) of Rule 1-02 of the SEC's Regulation S-X. The Company's flagship mortgage guaranty insurance carrier, RMIC qualifies as a Significant Subsidiary for purposes of the Notes. If RMIC were to become statutorily impaired, its insolvency could trigger a receivership proceeding which, in turn could ultimately result in an event of default. If this were to occur, the outstanding principal of the Notes could become immediately due and payable. Management believes the Final Order by the North Carolina Department of Insurance to RMIC has precluded such an event of default from occurring in the foreseeable future. Moreover, RMIC was statutorily solvent at December 31, 2015, and management has every expectation that its solvent state is likely to prevail. Moreover, RMIC is expected to be an increasingly less significant subsidiary over time as its in force business declines.\nRisk Factors Common to the Company and its Insurance Subsidiaries\nInvestment Risks\nThe Company\u2019s investment portfolio consists primarily of highly rated debt securities and large capitalization common stocks. Its investments are subject to market-wide risks and fluctuations, as well as to risks inherent in particular securities. Changing and unprecedented market conditions could materially impact the future valuation of securities in its investment portfolio. This could cause the Company to impair the carrying value of some portion of those securities in the future. Volatility or illiquidity in the markets in which the Company holds positions may cause certain other-than-temporary impairments within its portfolio and thus lead to potentially significant adverse effects on the Company\u2019s liquidity, financial condition and operating results.\nIncome from the Company\u2019s investment portfolio is one of its primary sources of cash flow to support operations and claim payments. Should the Company improperly structure its investment portfolio to meet those future liabilities or should it have unexpected losses, including losses resulting from the forced liquidation of investments before their maturity or under adverse securities markets conditions, the Company could be unable to meet those obligations. The Company\u2019s investments and investment policies are subject to the provisions of state insurance laws, which results in its portfolio\nbeing predominantly limited to highly rated fixed income securities. Interest rates on fixed income securities are near historical lows. In the event that interest rates should rise above those of the Company\u2019s fixed income securities, the market value of the Company\u2019s investment portfolio would decline. Any significant decrease in the value of the Company\u2019s investment portfolio could adversely impact its GAAP financial condition, but not necessarily the statutory financial condition of its insurance subsidiaries since their fixed maturities portfolio is generally stated at amortized cost from a regulatory standpoint.\nCompared to historical averages, interest rates and investment yields on highly rated investments have generally declined, which has the effect of limiting the investment income the Company can generate. The Company depends on its investments as a source of revenue, and a prolonged period of low investment yields would have an adverse impact on its revenues and could potentially adversely affect its operating results.\nThe Company may be forced to change its investments or investment policies depending upon regulatory, economic and market conditions, thus affecting the existing or anticipated financial condition and operating needs, including the tax position, of its business. In such circumstances, the Company\u2019s investment objectives may not be achieved. While the Company\u2019s portfolio consists mostly of highly-rated investments and complies with applicable regulatory requirements, the success of its investment activity is affected by general economic conditions, which may adversely affect the markets for credit and interest-rate-sensitive securities, including the extent and timing of investor participation in these markets, the level and volatility of interest rates and, consequently, the value of fixed-income securities.\nExcessive Losses and Loss Expenses\nAlthough the Company's business segments encompass different types of insurance, the greatest risk factor common to all insurance coverages is excessive losses due to unanticipated claims frequency, severity or a combination of both. Many of the factors affecting the frequency and severity of claims depend upon the type of insurance coverage, but others are shared in common. Severity and frequency can be affected by changes in national economic conditions, unexpectedly adverse outcomes in claims litigation, often as a result of unanticipated jury verdicts, changes in court made law, adverse court interpretations of insurance policy provisions resulting in increased liability or new judicial theories of liability, together with unexpectedly high costs of defending claims.\nInadequate Reserves\nReserves are the amounts that an insurance company sets aside for its anticipated policy liabilities. Claim reserves are an estimate of liability for unpaid claims and claims defense and adjustment expenses, and cover both reported as well as IBNR claims. It is not possible to calculate precisely what these liabilities will amount to in advance and, therefore, the reserves represent a best estimate at any point in time. Such estimates are based upon known historical loss data, certain assumptions and expectations of future trends in claim frequency and severity, inflation and other economic considerations. The latter are affected by a variety of factors over which insurers have little or no control and which can be quite volatile.\nReserve estimates are periodically reviewed in light of known developments and, where necessary, they are adjusted and refined as circumstances may warrant. Nevertheless, the reserve setting process is inherently uncertain. If for any of these reasons reserve estimates prove to be inadequate, the Company's subsidiaries can be forced to increase their reported liabilities; such an occurrence could result in a materially adverse impact on their results of operations and financial condition.\nInadequate Pricing\nPremium rates are generally determined on the basis of historical data for claim frequency and severity as well as related production and other expense patterns. In the event ultimate claims and expenses exceed historically projected levels, premium rates are likely to prove insufficient. Premium rate inadequacy may not become evident quickly, may require time to correct, and, much like excessive losses can affect adversely the Company's business, operating results and financial condition.\nLiquidity Risk\nAs indicated above, the Company manages its fixed-maturity investments with a view toward matching the maturities of those investments with the anticipated liquidity needs of its subsidiaries for the payment of claims and expenses. If a subsidiary suddenly experienced greater-than-anticipated liquidity needs for any reason, it could require an injection of funds that might not necessarily be available to meet its obligations at a point in time. Alternatively, invested securities may need to be sold at a loss and thus impact adversely both financial condition and operating results.\nRegulatory Environment\nThe Company's insurance businesses are subject to extensive governmental regulation under state laws in the U.S. and the laws of each of the few other jurisdictions outside the U.S. in which they operate. These regulations relate to such matters as licensing requirements, types of insurance products that may be sold, premium rates, marketing practices, capital and surplus requirements, investment limitations, underwriting limitations, dividend payment limitations, transactions with affiliates, accounting practices, taxation and other matters. While most of the regulation is at the state level in the U.S., the federal government has increasingly expressed an interest in regulating the insurance business and has injected itself through the Graham-Leach-Bliley Act, the Patriot Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and\nConsumer Protection Act of 2009. Moreover, changes in the Internal Revenue Code and other regulations bear directly on the costs of conducting an insurance business through increased compliance expenses.\nApart from the rising costs of compliance, as existing regulations evolve through administrative and court interpretations, and as new regulations are adopted, there is no basis for predicting the impact that changes could have on the Company's businesses in the future. The impact could have a material adverse effect on the manner in which the company's subsidiaries do business, and or their ability to compete, to continue offering their existing products, or to pursue acquisitions and growth opportunities.\nCompetition\nEach of the Company's lines of continuing insurance business is highly competitive and is likely to remain so for the foreseeable future. Moreover, existing competitors and the capital markets have from time to time brought an influx of capital and newly-organized entrants into the industry, and changes in laws have enabled financial institutions, like banks and savings and loans, to sell insurance products. Increases in competition threaten to reduce demand for the Company's insurance products, reduce its market share and growth prospects, and potentially reduce its profitability.\nExposure to Independent Rating Downgrades\nThe competitive positions of insurance companies in general have come to depend increasingly on independent ratings of their financial strength and claims-paying ability. The rating agencies base their ratings on criteria they establish regarding an insurer's financial strength, operating performance, strategic position and ability to meet its obligations to policyholders. A significant downgrade in the ratings of any of the Company's major policy-issuing subsidiaries could have a materially adverse effect on their ability to compete for new business and retain existing business and, as a result, their operating results and financial condition.\nFinancial Institutions Risk\nThe Company's subsidiaries have significant business relationships with financial institutions, particularly national banks. The subsidiaries are the beneficiaries of a considerable amount of security in the form of letters of credit which they hold as collateral securing the obligations of insureds and certain reinsurers. Some of the banks themselves have subsidiaries that reinsure the Company's business. Other banks are depositories holding large sums of money in escrow accounts established by the Company's title subsidiaries. There is thus a risk of concentrated financial exposures in one or more such banking institutions. If any of these institutions fail or are unable to honor their credit obligations, or if escrowed funds become lost or tied up due to the failure of a bank, the result could have a materially adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisk Management\nThe Company has established processes and procedures designed to identify, measure, analyze, monitor and report the types of risk the Company and its subsidiaries are subject to, including operational risk, market risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, investment risk, interest rate risk, legal risk and reputational risk, among others. There are inherent limitations in such processes and procedures, and as a result, there is always the possibility that the Company has not adequately identified or anticipated risks. Such inadequacies could lead to future unexpected losses or expenses.\nLegal Risks\nThe Company and certain of its subsidiaries are from time to time named defendants or otherwise involved in various legal proceedings, including class actions and other litigation or arbitration proceedings with third parties, as well as proceedings by regulatory agencies. Any of these actions could result in judgments, settlements, fines or penalties which could materially adversely affect the Company's or its subsidiaries' business, financial condition or results of operations.\nAcquisition Integration Risk\nThe Company has from time to time grown its business by acquisition and is likely to consider acquisitions in the future. There can never be any assurance that such acquisitions will have positive accretive results. Integration of an acquired business can be costly and complex. The integration of acquisitions already completed, as well as any that may be completed in the future could result in significant unanticipated costs or losses of one sort or another.\nAttracting and Retaining Qualified Employees\nThe Company's and its subsidiaries' employees at all levels are among their most important assets. Should the Company and its subsidiaries for any reason be unable to attract and retain qualified employees, their performance could be materially adversely affected.\nInformation Technology Systems\nThe Company is dependent to a large degree on the successful functioning and security of its information technology systems to conduct its varied business operations. These systems are relied upon to communicate with producers and insureds, underwrite business, issue policies and process premiums, adjust and pay claims, and prepare financial analysis and reporting. A significant interruption or inability to access these systems due to, among other events, system failure,\nnatural disaster, or cyber-attack could have a material effect on the Company's business and expose it to significant monetary and reputational damages.\nIn addition to the foregoing, the following are risk factors that are particular to each of the Company's three major business segments.\nGeneral Insurance Group\nCatastrophic Losses\nWhile the Company limits the property exposures it assumes, the casualty or liability insurance it underwrites creates an exposure to claims arising out of catastrophes. The two principal catastrophe exposures are earthquakes and acts of terrorism in areas where there are large concentrations of employees of an insured employer or other individuals who could potentially be injured and assert claims against an insured under workers' compensation policies. Collateral damage to property or persons from acts of terrorism and other calamities could also expose general liability policies.\nFollowing the September 11, 2001 terrorist attack, the reinsurance industry eliminated coverage from substantially all reinsurance contracts for claims arising from acts of terrorism. As discussed elsewhere in this report, the U.S. Congress subsequently passed TRIA, TRIREA, and TRIPRA legislation that required primary insurers to offer coverage for certified acts of terrorism under most commercial property and casualty insurance policies. Although these programs established a temporary federal reinsurance program through December 31, 2020, primary insurers like the Company's general insurance subsidiaries retain significant exposure for terrorist act-related losses.\nLong-Tailed Losses\nCoverage for general liability is considered long-tailed coverage. Written in most cases on an \"occurrence\" basis, it often takes longer for covered claims to be reported and become known, adjusted and settled than it does for property claims, for example, which are generally considered short-tailed. The extremely long-tailed aspect of such claims as pollution, asbestos, silicosis, manganism (welding rod fume exposure), black lung, lead paint and other toxic tort claims, coupled with uncertain and sometimes variable judicial rulings on coverage and policy allocation issues along with the possibility of legislative actions, makes reserving for these exposures highly uncertain. While the Company believes that it has reasonably estimated its liabilities for such exposures to date, and that its exposures are relatively modest, there is a risk of materially adverse developments in both known and as-yet-unknown claims.\nWorkers' Compensation Coverage\nWorkers' compensation coverage is the largest line of insurance written by the Company's insurance subsidiaries. The frequency and severity of claims, and the adequacy of reserves for workers' compensation claims and expenses can all be significantly influenced by such risk factors as future wage inflation in states that index benefits, the speed with which injured employees are able to return to work in some capacity, the cost and rate of inflation in medical treatments, the types of medical procedures and treatments, the cost of prescription medications, the frequency with which closed claims reopen for additional or related medical issues, the mortality of injured workers with lifetime benefits and medical treatments, the use of health insurance to cover some of the expenses, the assumption of some of the expenses by states' second injury funds, the use of cost containment practices like preferred provider networks, and the opportunities to recover against third parties through subrogation. Adverse developments in any of these factors, if significant, could have a materially adverse effect on the Company's operating results and financial condition.\nReinsurance\nReinsurance is a contractual arrangement whereby one insurer (the reinsurer) assumes some or all of the risk exposure written by another insurer (the reinsured). The Company depends on reinsurance to manage its risks both in terms of the amount of coverage it is able to write, the amount it is able to retain for its own account, and the price at which it is able to write it. The availability of reinsurance and its price, however, are determined in the reinsurance market by conditions beyond the Company's control.\nReinsurance does not relieve the reinsured company of its primary liability to its insureds in the event of a loss. It merely reimburses the reinsured company. The ability and willingness of reinsurers to honor their counterparty obligations to the Company represent credit risks. Old Republic has no practical basis for evaluating the risks assumed by a reinsurer from sources other than its own. Those risks could result in a significant deterioration of the reinsurer's ability to honor its obligations to the Company, thereby exacerbating credit risk exposure.\nOld Republic addresses these risks by limiting its reinsurance placements to those reinsurers it considers the best credit risks. In recent years, however, there has been an ever decreasing number of reinsurers so considered. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to find the desired or even adequate amounts of reinsurance at favorable rates from acceptable reinsurers in the future. If unable to do so, the Company would be forced to reduce the volume of business it writes or retain increased amounts of liability exposure. Because of the declining number of acceptable reinsurers, there is a risk that too much reinsurance risk may become concentrated in too few reinsurers. These concentrations of risk could adversely affect the Company's business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nInsureds as Credit Risks\nA significant amount of Old Republic's liability and workers' compensation business, particularly for large commercial insureds, is written on the basis of risk sharing underwriting methods utilizing large deductibles, captive insurance risk retentions, or other arrangements whereby the insureds effectively retain and fund varying and at times significant amounts of their losses. Their financial strength and ability to pay are carefully evaluated as part of the underwriting process and monitored periodically thereafter, and their retained exposures are estimated and collateralized based on pertinent credit analysis and evaluation. Because the Company is primarily liable for losses incurred under its policies, the possible failure or inability of insureds to honor their retained liability represents a credit risk. Any subsequently developing shortage in the amount of collateral held would also be a risk, as would the failure or inability of a bank to honor a letter of credit issued as collateral. These risk factors could have a materially adverse impact on the Company's results of operations and financial condition.\nGuaranty Funds and Residual Markets\nIn nearly all states, licensed property and casualty insurers are required to participate in guaranty funds through assessments covering a portion of insurance claims against impaired or insolvent property and casualty insurers. Any increase in the number or size of impaired companies would likely result in an increase in the Company's share of such assessments.\nMany states have established second injury funds that compensate injured employees for aggravation of prior injuries or conditions. These second injury funds are funded by assessments or premium surcharges.\nResidual market or pooling arrangements exist in many states to provide various types of insurance coverage to those that are otherwise unable to find private insurers willing to insure them. All licensed property and casualty insurers writing such coverage voluntarily are required to participate in these residual market or pooling mechanisms.\nA material increase in any of these assessments or charges could adversely affect the Company's results of operations and financial condition.\nPrior Approval of Rates\nMost of the lines of insurance underwritten by the Company are subject to prior regulatory approval of premium rates in a majority of the states. The process of securing regulatory approval can be time consuming and can impair the Company's ability to effect necessary rate increases in an expeditious manner. Furthermore, there is a risk that the regulators will not approve a requested increase, particularly in regard to workers' compensation insurance with respect to which rate increases often confront strong opposition from local business, organized labor, and political interests.\nTitle Insurance Group\nHousing and Mortgage Lending Markets\nThe tightening and collapse of credit markets, the collapse of the housing market, the general decline in the value of real property, the rise in unemployment, and the uncertainty and negative trends in general economic conditions that began in 2006 created a difficult operating environment for the Company's title insurance subsidiaries. While these conditions have since improved to varying degrees, any return of these recessionary conditions could have a materially adverse effect on these subsidiaries' financial condition and results of operation over the near and longer terms. The impact of these conditions was somewhat mitigated both by lower mortgage interest rates, which lead to an increase in mortgage refinancings and by a rise in the number of agents producing business for the Companies' title insurance subsidiaries. Future rises in mortgage interest rates, however, could result in a decline in refinancing activity which, in turn, may result in reduced title insurance business.\nCompetition\nBusiness comes to title insurers primarily by referral from real estate agents, lenders, developers and other settlement providers. The sources of business lead to a great deal of competition among title insurers. Although the top four title insurance companies during 2015 accounted for about 87% of industry-wide premium volume, there are numerous smaller companies representing the remainder at the regional and local levels. The smaller companies are an ever-present competitive risk in the regional and local markets where their business connections can give them a competitive edge. Moreover, there is always competition among the major companies for key employees, especially those engaged in business production. Among the four largest national title insurers, the Company\u2019s title insurance subsidiaries rely upon independent agencies to produce most of their business, whereas the other title insurers rely more on owned agencies. Independent agencies can direct business to any title insurer, whereas owned agencies will only direct business to their parent or affiliated title insurers. The Company\u2019s title subsidiaries are therefore more vulnerable to a loss of business than are the other largest title companies.\nRegulation and Litigation\nRegulation is also a risk factor for title insurers. The title insurance industry has recently been, and continues to be, under regulatory scrutiny in a number of states with respect to pricing practices, and alleged RESPA violations and\nunlawful rebating practices. The regulatory investigations could lead to industry-wide reductions in premium rates and escrow fees, the inability to get rate increases when necessary, as well as to changes that could adversely affect the Company's ability to compete for or retain business or raise the costs of additional regulatory compliance.\nFrom time to time the Company's title insurance subsidiaries are named as defendants or are otherwise involved in various legal proceedings, including class actions and other litigation,disputes with third parties, and proceedings or civil investigations brought by regulatory agencies. Any resulting adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties or other rulings could have, directly or indirectly, a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition, results of operations or business reputation. Litigation or other disputes between the Company\u2019s mortgage insurance subsidiaries and insured mortgage lenders could also have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s title insurance subsidiaries if, as a result, the lenders threatened to or discontinued accepting title insurance or title related services from the Company\u2019s title insurers.\nOther Risks\nInadequate title searches are among the risk factors faced by the entire industry. If a title search is conducted thoroughly and accurately, there should theoretically never be a claim. When the search is less than thorough or complete, title defects can go undetected and claims result.\nTo a lesser extent, fraud is also a risk factor for all title companies -- sometimes in the form of an agent's or an employee's defalcation of escrowed funds, sometimes in the form of fraudulently issued title insurance policies.\nRFIG Run-off Business\nMortgage Guaranty Business in Run-off; Possible Material Losses, Statutory Capital Impairment, and Receivership\nThe material increases in mortgage guaranty insurance claims and loss payments that began in 2007 gradually depleted RMIC's statutory capital base and forced it to discontinue writing new business. The insurance laws of 16 jurisdictions, including RMIC and RMICNC\u2019s domiciliary state of North Carolina, require a mortgage insurer to maintain a minimum amount of statutory capital relative to risk in force (or a similar measure) in order to continue to write new business. The formulations currently allow for a maximum risk-to-capital ratio of 25 to 1, or alternatively stated, a \u201cminimum policyholder position\u201d (\u201cMPP\u201d) of one-twenty-fifth of the total risk in force. The failure to maintain the prescribed minimum capital level in a particular state generally requires a mortgage insurer to immediately stop writing new business until it reestablishes the required level of capital or receives a waiver of the requirement from a state's insurance regulatory authority. RMIC breached the minimum capital requirement during the third quarter of 2010. RMIC had previously requested and, subsequently received waivers or forbearance of the minimum policyholder position requirements from the regulatory authorities in substantially all affected states. Following several brief extensions, the waiver from its domiciliary state of North Carolina expired on August 31, 2011, and RMIC and its sister company, RMICNC, discontinued writing new business in all states and limited themselves to servicing the run-off of their existing business. They were placed under the North Carolina Department of Insurance's (\"NCDOI\") administrative supervision the following year and ultimately ordered to defer the payment of 40% of all settled claims as a deferred payment obligation (\"DPO\").\nOn July 1, 2014, the NCDOI issued a Final Order approving an Amended and Restated Corrective Plan (the \"Amended Plan\") submitted jointly on April 16, 2014, by RMIC and RMICNC. Under the Amended Plan, RMIC and RMICNC were authorized to pay 100% of their DPOs accrued as of June 30, 2014, and to settle all subsequent valid claims entirely in cash, without establishing any DPOs. In anticipation of receiving this Final Order, ORI contributed $125.0 million in cash and securities to RMIC in June 2014. In mid-July 2014, in furtherance of the Final Order, RMIC and RMICNC processed payments of their accumulated DPO balances of approximately $657.0 million relating to fully settled claims charged to periods extending between January 19, 2012 and June 30, 2014. Both subsidiaries remain under the supervision of the NCDOI as they continue to operate in run-off mode. The approval of the Amended Plan notwithstanding, the NCDOI retains its regulatory supervisory powers to review and amend the terms of the Amended Plan in the future as circumstances may warrant.\nRMIC has continually evaluated the potential long-term underwriting performance of the run-off book of business based on various modeling techniques. The resulting models take into account actual premium and paid claim experience of prior periods, together with a large number of assumptions and judgments about future outcomes that are highly sensitive to a wide range of estimates. Many of these estimates and underlying assumptions relate to matters over which the Company has no control, including: 1) The conflicted interests, as well as the varying mortgage servicing and foreclosure practices of a large number of insured lending institutions; 2) General economic and industry-specific trends and events; and 3) The evolving or future social and economic policies of the U.S. Government vis-\u00e0-vis such critical sectors as the banking, mortgage lending, and housing industries, as well as its policies for resolving the insolvencies and assigning a possible future role to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\nThere can be no assurance that RMIC and RMICNC will emerge from the run-off as solvent companies or that the conditions or the duration of the run-off of their business will remain unchanged or that they will remain under supervision rather than receivership.\nPremium Income and Long-Term Claim Exposures\nMortgage insurers such as the Company issue long duration, guaranteed renewable policies covering multi-year periods during which exposure to loss exists. Loss exposures typically manifest themselves as recurring losses usually concentrated between the second and fifth year following issuance of any one year's new policies. Additionally, the policies cover catastrophic aggregations of claims such as those that occurred during the Great Recession of 2007 to 2012 which was engendered by substantial market dislocations in the housing and mortgage lending industries.\nThe Company's mortgage guaranty premiums stem principally from monthly installment policies. Substantially all such premiums are generally written and earned in the month coverage is effective. Recognition of claim costs, however, occurs only after an insured mortgage loan has missed two or more consecutive monthly payments. Accordingly, GAAP revenue recognition is not appropriately matched to the risk exposure and the consequent recognition of both normal and, most significantly, future catastrophic loss occurrences. As a result, mortgage guaranty GAAP earnings for any individual year or series of years may be materially adversely affected, particularly by cyclical catastrophic loss events such as the mortgage insurance industry experienced between 2007 and 2012. Reported GAAP earnings and financial condition form, in part, the basis for significant judgments and strategic evaluations made by management, analysts, investors, and other users of the financial statements issued by mortgage guaranty companies. The risk exists that such judgments and evaluations are at least partially based on GAAP financial information that does not match revenues and expenses and is not reflective of the long-term normal and catastrophic risk exposures assumed by mortgage guaranty insurers at any point in time. This risk is inherent in the models on which the run-off of RMIC's and RMICNC's business is based.\nInadequate Loss Reserves\nThe Company establishes reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses for its mortgage and consumer credit indemnity insurance coverages based upon loans reported to be in default, as well as estimates of those in default but not yet reported. The reserves are best estimates by management and take into consideration its judgments and assumptions regarding the housing and mortgage markets, unemployment rates and economic trends in general. During the ongoing sustained economic downturn, loss reserve estimates have become subject to even greater uncertainty and volatility. The rate and severity of actual losses could prove to be greater than expected and require the Company to effect substantial increases in its loss reserves. Depending upon the magnitude, such increases could have a materially adverse impact on the Company's mortgage insurance and consumer credit indemnity insurance run-off business and the Company's consolidated results of operations and financial condition. There can be no assurance that the actual losses for the mortgage insurance and consumer credit indemnity coverages will not be materially greater than previously established loss reserves.\nFewer Coverage Rescissions\nThe Company may rescind its mortgage guaranty and consumer credit indemnity coverages whenever it finds evidence that a loan did not qualify for insurance coverage in the first instance, or that a material misrepresentation had been made in the loan application by the borrower, the lender, and/or its agent. During the past several years, the rate of rescissions rose dramatically. As a result, rescissions reduced materially the percentage of approved claims, and loss reserving estimates have reflected assumptions about the levels of rescission activity.\nCertain policyholders who have experienced high rates of coverage rescission instituted litigation or arbitration proceedings challenging the Company's position on rescissions. Whether the current rescission rates continue or decline, it is possible that further litigation or arbitral challenges to the Company's rescissions of coverage could arise. If any of the challenges are successful, they could have a materially adverse effect on the Company's mortgage guaranty and/or consumer credit indemnity run-off insurance business and consolidated operating results and financial position. Even if such challenges should prove unsuccessful, the costs of addressing them through litigation could be substantial.", "PERMNO": 59396, "SIC": 6331, "TIC": "ORI"}
