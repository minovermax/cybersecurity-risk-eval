{"cik": "819050", "company": "VICAL INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-01", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nYou should consider carefully the risks described below, together with all of the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and in our other filings with the SEC, before deciding whether to invest in or continue to hold our common stock. The risks described below are all material risks currently known, expected or reasonably foreseeable by us. If any of these risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow could be seriously harmed. This could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline, resulting in a loss of all or part of your investment.\nWe are reviewing strategic alternatives and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying or completing any strategic transaction, that any such strategic transaction will result in additional value for our stockholders or that the process will not have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe have announced that our board of directors is conducting a review of strategic alternatives and we have retained MTS Health Partners, L.P. as our financial advisor to assist in the review process. These alternatives could include, but are not limited to, merger or acquisition transactions, issuing or transferring shares of our common stock, or the license, purchase or sale of specific assets, in addition to other potential actions aimed at increasing stockholder value. There can be no assurance that the review of strategic alternatives will result in the identification or consummation of any transaction. Our board of directors may also determine that our most effective strategy is to continue to execute on our current development strategy or to cease our current drug development activities altogether. The process of reviewing strategic alternatives may be time consuming and disruptive to our business operations and, if we are unable to effectively manage the process, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. We could incur substantial expenses associated with identifying, evaluating and negotiating potential strategic alternatives. There can be no assurance that any potential transaction or other strategic alternative, if consummated, will provide greater value to our stockholders than that reflected in the current price of our common stock. Until the review process is concluded, perceived uncertainties related to our future may result in the loss of potential business opportunities and volatility in the market price of our common stock and may make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners.\nIf we do not successfully consummate a strategic transaction, our board of directors may decide to pursue a dissolution and liquidation of our company. In such an event, the amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders will depend heavily on the timing of such liquidation as well as the amount of cash that will need to be reserved for commitments and contingent liabilities.\nThere can be no assurance that the process to identify a strategic transaction will result in a successfully consummated transaction. If no transaction is completed, our board of directors may decide to pursue a dissolution and liquidation of our company. In such an event, the amount of cash available for distribution to our stockholders, if any, will depend heavily on the timing of such decision and, ultimately, such liquidation, since the amount of cash available for distribution continues to decrease as we fund our operations and evaluate our strategic alternatives. In addition, if our board of directors were to approve and recommend, and our stockholders were to approve, a dissolution and liquidation of our company, we would be required under Delaware corporate law to pay our outstanding obligations, as well as to make reasonable provision for contingent and unknown obligations, prior to making any distributions in liquidation to our stockholders. As a result of this requirement, a portion of our assets may need to be reserved pending the resolution of such obligations. In addition, we may be subject to litigation or other claims related to a dissolution and liquidation of our company. If a dissolution and liquidation were pursued, our board of directors, in consultation with its advisors, would need to evaluate these matters and make a determination about a reasonable amount to reserve. Accordingly, holders of our common stock could lose all or a significant portion of their investment in the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our company.\nIf we are successful in completing a strategic transaction, we may be exposed to other operational and financial risks.\nAlthough there can be no assurance that a strategic transaction will result from the process we have undertaken to identify and evaluate strategic alternatives, the negotiation and consummation of any such transaction will require significant time on the part of our management, and the diversion of management\u2019s attention may disrupt our business.\nThe negotiation and consummation of any such transaction may also require more time or greater cash resources than we anticipate and expose us to other operational and financial risks, including:\n\u2022\nincreased near-term and long-term expenditures;\n\u2022\nexposure to unknown liabilities;\n\u2022\nhigher than expected acquisition or integration costs;\n\u2022\nincurrence of substantial debt or dilutive issuances of equity securities to fund future operations;\n\u2022\nwrite-downs of assets or goodwill or incurrence of non-recurring, impairment or other charges;\n\u2022\nincreased amortization expenses;\n\u2022\ndifficulty and cost in combining the operations and personnel of any acquired business with our operations and personnel;\n\u2022\nimpairment of relationships with key suppliers or customers of any acquired business due to changes in management and ownership; and\n\u2022\ninability to retain key employees of our company or any acquired business.\nAny of the foregoing risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and prospects.\nNone of our product candidates has been approved for sale, and we have a limited number of product candidates in development. If we do not develop commercially successful products, we may be forced to curtail or cease operations.\nWe must conduct a substantial amount of additional research and development before any U.S. or foreign regulatory authority will approve any of our product candidates. Results of our research and development activities may indicate that our product candidates are unsafe or ineffective. In this case, we may stop development and regulatory authorities will not approve them. For example, we have previously terminated numerous development programs following negative results from preclinical studies or clinical trials.\nEven if we complete clinical development, the results of clinical trials may not support approval by the FDA or comparable foreign agencies or, if approved, our products may not be commercially successful, particularly if they do not gain market acceptance among physicians, patients, healthcare payers and relevant medical communities. If we fail to develop and commercialize our product candidates, we may be forced to curtail or cease operations.\nOur clinical trials may fail to demonstrate adequately the safety and efficacy of our product candidate, which would prevent or delay regulatory approval and commercialization.\nBefore obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of our product candidates, we must demonstrate through lengthy, complex and expensive preclinical testing and clinical trials that our product candidates are both safe and effective for use in each target indication. Clinical testing is expensive and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. Failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process. The results of preclinical studies and early clinical trials of our product candidates may not be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical trials. There is typically an extremely high rate of attrition from the failure of product candidates proceeding through clinical trials. Product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy profile despite having progressed through preclinical studies and initial clinical trials. We and our licensees have in the past suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials due to lack of efficacy, notwithstanding promising results in earlier trials. Most product candidates that commence clinical trials are never approved as products.\nThere are a number of factors that could cause a clinical study to fail or be delayed, including:\n\u2022\nthe clinical study may not be designed properly or may produce negative or inconclusive results;\n\u2022\nregulators, monitoring boards or other entities may not grant permission to start a clinical study or require that we hold, suspend or terminate clinical research for safety, ethical or regulatory reasons, including adverse events, or AEs, reported during the trial;\n\u2022\nwe may encounter delays in reaching agreement with regulators on final clinical study design;\n\u2022\nwe may decide, or regulators may require us, to conduct additional preclinical testing or clinical studies;\n\u2022\nenrollment in our clinical studies may be slower than we anticipate;\n\u2022\nwe may encounter delays in engaging prospective clinical research organizations and clinical trial sites to conduct our clinical studies or may have disagreements with these entities;\n\u2022\nthe cost of our clinical studies may be greater than we anticipate;\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to raise funding necessary to initiate or complete our clinical studies; and\n\u2022\nthe supply or quality of our product candidates or other materials necessary to conduct our clinical studies may be insufficient, inadequate or delayed.\nIf initiation or completion of our clinical studies or those of our collaborators are delayed, our development costs may increase, the approval process for our product candidates would be delayed, any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidates may be reduced and our competitors may have more time to bring products to market or establish market positions.\nIn addition, even if clinical trials are successfully completed, we cannot guarantee that the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities will interpret the results as sufficient to demonstrate that a product is safe and efficacious, and more trials could be required before we submit our product candidates for approval. To the extent that the results of the trials are not satisfactory to the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities for support of a marketing application, approval of our product candidates may be significantly delayed, or we may be required to expend significant additional resources, which may not be available to us, to conduct additional trials in support of potential approval of our product candidates.\nOur product candidates may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval, limit the commercial profile of the approved labeling, or result in significant negative consequences following marketing approval, if any.\nThere is risk that our product candidates may induce AEs, many of which may be unknown at this time. If an unacceptable frequency and/or severity of AEs are reported in clinical studies for our product candidates, our ability to obtain regulatory approval for may be negatively impacted. Even if we receive regulatory approval, AEs associated with any approved products could have significant negative consequences, including:\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may approve the product only with a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS), potentially with restrictions on distribution and other elements to assure safe use (ETASU);\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of the product or impose restrictions on its distribution in a form of a modified REMS;\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements, such as warnings or contraindications;\n\u2022\nwe may be required to change the way the product is administered or to conduct additional clinical studies;\n\u2022\nwe could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients; and\n\u2022\nour reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining regulatory approvals or market acceptance of the affected product candidate and could substantially increase the costs of commercializing our product candidates.\nOur revenues have depended on the development and commercialization of products in collaboration with others to whom we have licensed our technologies. If we are unable to find additional collaborators or licensees, or if future collaborators or licensees do not successfully develop and commercialize products covered by such arrangements, we may not be able to derive collaboration and licensing revenues, we may lose opportunities to validate our technologies, or we may be forced to curtail our development and commercialization efforts in these areas.\nWe have licensed, and may continue to license, our technologies to corporate collaborators and licensees for the research, development and commercialization of specified product candidates. Our revenues have partially depended upon the ability of these collaborators and licensees to successfully develop and commercialize products covered by these arrangements. For example, we previously entered into license agreements with Astellas related to ASP0113, an investigational CMV therapeutic vaccine, and these agreements were subsequently terminated following negative results from a Phase 3 clinical trial. Prior to the termination, the revenue received by us under this collaboration accounted for a significant amount of our revenue generated over the prior two years. During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and\n2016, we recognized $0.0 million, $0.3 million and $1.5 million, respectively, of revenue related to license fees, and $1.2 million, $12.9 million and $12.5 million, respectively, of revenue related to contract services and product supply. If we are unable to enter into new collaboration or licensing arrangements with third parties, we will not receive additional revenues from these sources and our financial results will be negatively impacted. The development and commercialization efforts of our collaborators and licensees are subject to the same risks and uncertainties described above with respect to our independently developed product candidates.\nSome collaborators or licensees may not succeed in their product development efforts. It is possible that our collaborators or licensees may be unable to obtain regulatory approval of product candidates using our technologies or successfully market and commercialize any such products for which regulatory approval is obtained. Other collaborators or licensees may not devote sufficient time or resources to the programs covered by these arrangements, and we may have limited or no control over the time or resources allocated by these collaborators or licensees to these programs. The occurrence of any of these events may cause us to derive little or no revenue from these arrangements, lose opportunities to validate our technologies, or force us to curtail or cease our development and commercialization efforts in these areas.\nOur collaborators and licensees may breach or terminate their agreements with us, including some that may terminate their agreements without cause at any time subject to certain prior written notice requirements, and we may be unsuccessful in entering into and maintaining other collaborative arrangements for the development and commercialization of products using our technologies. If we are unable to maintain existing collaboration arrangements or enter into new ones, our ability to generate licensing, milestone or royalty revenues would be materially impaired.\nSome of our independent product candidates and some of those under development by our sublicensees incorporate technologies we have licensed from others. If we are unable to retain rights to use these technologies, we or our sublicensees may not be able to market products incorporating these technologies on a commercially feasible basis, if at all.\nWe have licensed certain technologies from corporate collaborators and research institutions, and sublicensed certain of such technologies to others, for use in the research, development and commercialization of product candidates. Our product development efforts and those of our sublicensees partially depend upon continued access to these technologies. For example, we or our licensors may breach or terminate our agreements, or disagree on interpretations of those agreements, which could prevent continued access to these technologies. If we were unable to resolve such matters on satisfactory terms, or at all, we or our sublicensees may be unable to develop and commercialize our products, and we may be forced to curtail or cease operations.\nWe licensed rights to patents and know-how for VL-2397 from Astellas pursuant to an in-license agreement that contains obligations to pay Astellas regulatory and sales milestone payments relating to VL-2397, as well as royalties on net sales of VL-2397. If we fail to make a required payment to Astellas or otherwise materially breach our in-license agreement with Astellas, including our obligation to use commercially reasonable efforts to advance development of VL-2397, and do not cure the failure within the required time period, Astellas may be able to terminate the license to the VL-2397 patents and know-how, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have a history of net losses. We expect to continue to incur net losses and we may not achieve or maintain profitability.\nTo date, we have not sold, or received approval to sell, any pharmaceutical products. We do not expect to sell any pharmaceutical products for at least the next several years. Our net losses were approximately $16.3 million, $13.0 million and $9.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. As of December 31, 2018, we had incurred cumulative net losses totaling approximately $442.1 million. Moreover, we expect that our net losses will continue and may increase for the foreseeable future. We may not be able to achieve projected results if we generate lower revenues or receive lower investment income than expected, or we incur greater expenses than expected, or all of the above. Over the past several years our revenues were largely dependent on manufacturing and research services performed under our license agreement with Astellas. In February 2018, Astellas exercised its rights to terminate the ASP0113 license agreements, and we will therefore not receive any further payments under these agreements. We may never generate sufficient product revenue to become profitable. We also expect to have quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in revenues, expenses, and losses, some of which could be significant.\nWe may need additional capital in the future. If additional capital is not available, we may have to curtail or cease operations.\nWe may need to raise more money to continue the research and development necessary to bring our products to market and to establish marketing and additional manufacturing capabilities. We may seek additional funds through public and private stock offerings, government contracts and grants, arrangements with corporate collaborators, borrowings under lines of credit or other sources. We currently have on file a shelf registration statement that allows us to raise up to an aggregate of $40.0 million from the sale of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities and/or warrants, subject to limitations on the amount of securities we may sell under the registration statement in any 12-month period. However, we may not be able to raise additional funds on favorable terms, or at all. Conditions in the credit markets and the financial services industry may make equity and debt financing more difficult to obtain, and may negatively impact our ability to complete financing transactions. To the extent that we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience significant dilution. Any debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional indebtedness and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business.\nIf we are unable to obtain additional funds, we may have to scale back our development of new products, reduce our workforce or license to others products or technologies that we otherwise would seek to commercialize ourselves. The amount of money we may need would depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022\nThe progress of our research and development programs;\n\u2022\nThe scope and results of our preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n\u2022\nThe amount of our legal expenses and any settlement or damages payments associated with litigation; and\n\u2022\nThe time and costs involved in: obtaining necessary regulatory approvals; filing, prosecuting and enforcing patent claims; scaling up our manufacturing capabilities; and the commercial arrangements we may establish.\nIf we do not realize the expected benefits and successfully manage the transition from our restructuring our operations and financial condition may be negatively impacted.\nIn January 2018, we implemented a restructuring designed to conserve capital and focus our efforts on our VL-2397 antifungal drug product candidate. In addition, in July 2018, we entered into an agreement with Genopis, Inc., or Genopis, to sell our idle manufacturing assets and sublease our manufacturing facilities space. In February 2019, in light of our decision to discontinue the Phase 2 clinical trial of our novel antifungal VL-2397, we plan to restructure our operations to conserve capital. If we are unable to realize the expected operational efficiencies and cost savings from our restructuring activities and sale of our manufacturing assets, our operating results and financial condition would be adversely affected. We cannot guarantee that we will not have to undertake additional restructuring activities or that any of our restructuring efforts will be successful.\nWe will also need to effectively manage our operations and facilities in order to advance our drug development programs and support our collaboration arrangements. Following our January 2018 restructuring and July 2018 sale of our manufacturing assets, it is possible that our infrastructure may be inadequate to support our future efforts and business strategy or to maintain effective operational, financial and management controls and reporting systems and procedures. If we cannot successfully manage the transition of our restructured operations, we may be unsuccessful in executing our business strategy.\nThe regulatory approval process is expensive, time consuming and uncertain, which may prevent us and our collaborators and licensees from obtaining required approvals for the commercialization of our products.\nOur product candidates under development and those of our collaborators and licensees are subject to extensive and rigorous regulations by numerous governmental authorities in the United States and other countries. The regulatory approval process takes many years and will require us to expend substantial resources.\nU.S. or foreign regulations evolve and could prevent or delay regulatory approval of our products or limit our and our collaborators and licensees\u2019 ability to develop and commercialize our products. Delays could:\n\u2022\nImpose costly procedures on our activities and those of our collaborators and licensees;\n\u2022\nDelay or prevent our receipt of developmental or commercial milestones from our collaborators and licensees;\n\u2022\nDiminish any competitive advantages that we or our products attain; or\n\u2022\nOtherwise negatively affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have no experience in submitting a BLA or an NDA to the FDA. Because these applications must be submitted to and approved by the FDA before any of our product candidates may be commercialized, our lack of experience may impede our ability to obtain FDA approval in a timely manner, if at all, which in turn would delay or prevent us from commercializing those products. Similarly, our lack of experience with respect to obtaining regulatory approvals in countries other than the United States may impede our ability to commercialize our products in those countries.\nPresently, to commercialize any product we and our collaborators and licensees must file a regulatory application for each proposed use. We and our collaborators and licensees must conduct clinical studies to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the product necessary to obtain FDA or foreign regulatory authority approval. The results obtained so far in our clinical trials and those of our collaborators and licensees may not be replicated in ongoing or future trials, or the results may be subject to varying interpretation on whether they are sufficient to support approval for commercialization. This may prevent any of our product candidates from receiving approval for commercial sale.\nIf any of our product candidates receive regulatory approval, the FDA or other foreign regulatory agencies may still impose significant restrictions on the indicated uses or marketing of our product candidates or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post-approval studies. In addition, regulatory agencies subject a product, its manufacturer and the manufacturer\u2019s facilities to continual review and periodic inspections. If a regulatory agency discovers previously unknown problems with a product or a product class, including AEs of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, a regulatory agency may impose restrictions on that product or product class, our collaborators and licensees or us, including requiring withdrawal of a product from the market. Our product candidates will also be subject to ongoing FDA and other foreign regulatory agency requirements for the labeling, packaging, storage, advertising, promotion, record-keeping and submission of safety and other post-market information on the product. If we or our collaborators and licensees fail to maintain regulatory compliance after receiving marketing approval, we or our collaborators and licensees may be unable to market our products and our business could suffer.\nAdverse events or the perception of adverse events in the biotechnology industry, or with respect to our product candidates, may negatively impact regulatory approval or public perception of our products.\nFuture AEs in the biotechnology industry could result in greater governmental regulation, stricter labeling requirements and potential regulatory delays in the testing or approval of our potential products. Any increased scrutiny could delay or increase the costs of our product development efforts or clinical trials. In addition, any AEs that may occur in our clinical trials and any resulting publicity may cause regulatory delays or otherwise affect our product development efforts or clinical trials.\nSome of our potential products may be administered to patients who are suffering from, or are vulnerable to, serious diseases or other conditions which can themselves be life-threatening and often result in the death of the patient. Patient deaths in our clinical trials, even if caused by pre-existing diseases or conditions, could negatively affect the perception of our product candidates. In addition, although we do not believe our potential product candidates could cause the diseases they are designed to protect against, a temporal relationship between the potential product and the disease onset could be perceived as causal.\nOur patents and proprietary rights may not provide us with any benefit and the patents of others may prevent us from commercializing our products.\nAs of December 31, 2018, we were the assignee or co-assignee of 30 issued U.S. and foreign patents. We maintain our issued patents by paying maintenance fees to the patent office in each country when due. Where appropriate, we participate in legal proceedings to vigorously defend against the revocation or withdrawal of our patents. The scope and nature of these proceedings generally differ depending on the country in which they are initiated. If we are not successful in defending our patents, we may lose all or part of our proprietary rights related to those patents in these geographic regions.\nWe may not receive any patents from our current patent applications. Issued patents provide exclusivity for only a limited time period, after which they no longer serve to protect proprietary technologies or to provide any commercial advantage. Moreover, if patents are issued to us, governmental authorities may not allow claims sufficient to protect our technologies and products. Others may also challenge or seek to circumvent or invalidate our patents. In that event, the\nrights granted under our patents may be inadequate to protect our proprietary technologies or to provide any commercial advantage.\nAn inability to obtain, enforce, and defend patents covering our proprietary technologies would materially and adversely affect our business prospects and financial condition.\nSome components of our product candidates are, or may become, patented by others. As a result, we may be required to obtain licenses to conduct research, to manufacture, or to market such products. Licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, which may impede our ability to commercialize our products.\nThe legal proceedings to obtain and defend patents, and litigation of third-party claims of intellectual property infringement, could require us to spend money and could impair our operations.\nOur and our collaborators\u2019 success will depend in part on our, or our collaborators\u2019, ability to obtain patent protection for our products and processes, both in the United States and in other countries. The patent positions of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, however, can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. Therefore, it is difficult to predict the breadth of claims allowed in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical fields.\nWe also rely on confidentiality agreements with our corporate collaborators, employees, consultants and certain contractors to protect our proprietary technologies. However, these agreements may be breached and we may not have adequate remedies for such breaches. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or independently discovered by our competitors.\nProtecting intellectual property rights can be very expensive. Litigation may be necessary to enforce patents issued to us or to determine the scope and validity of third-party proprietary rights. If we or, as applicable, our commercialization partners, including Astellas pursuant to its first right to enforce patents licensed to it under our license agreements, choose to go to court to stop someone else from using our inventions, that individual or company has the right to ask the court to rule that the underlying patents are invalid and/or should not be enforced against that third party. Moreover, if a competitor were to file a patent application claiming technology also invented by us or our collaborators or licensees, we would have to participate in an interference proceeding before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to determine the priority of the invention. We or our collaborators or licensees may be drawn into interferences with third parties or may have to provoke interferences ourselves to unblock third-party patent rights to allow us or our collaborators or licensees to commercialize products based on our technologies. Litigation could result in substantial costs and the diversion of management\u2019s efforts regardless of the results of the litigation. An unfavorable result in litigation could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require disputed rights to be licensed or require us to cease using some technologies.\nOur products and processes may infringe, or be found to infringe, patents not owned or controlled by us. Patents held by others may require us to alter our products or processes, obtain licenses, or stop activities. If relevant claims of third-party patents are upheld as valid and enforceable, we or our collaborators or licensees could be prevented from practicing the subject matter claimed in the patents, or may be required to obtain licenses or redesign our products or processes to avoid infringement. In addition, we or our collaborators or licensees could be required to pay money damages. A number of genetic sequences or proteins encoded by genetic sequences that we are investigating are, or may become, patented by others. As a result, we or our collaborators or licensees may have to obtain licenses to test, use or market these products. Our business will suffer if we or our collaborators or licensees are not able to obtain licenses at all or on terms commercially reasonable to us or them and we or they are not able to redesign our products or processes to avoid infringement.\nWe have incurred costs in several legal proceedings involving our intellectual property rights in Europe, Japan and Canada. We may continue to incur costs to defend and prosecute patents and patent applications in these and other regions.\nCompetition and technological change may make our product candidates and technologies less attractive or obsolete.\nWe compete with companies, including major pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms that are pursuing other forms of treatment or prevention for diseases that we target. We also may experience competition from companies that have acquired or may acquire technologies from universities and other research institutions. As these companies develop their technologies, they may develop proprietary positions which may prevent us from successfully commercializing products.\nSome of our competitors are established companies with greater financial and other resources than we have. Other companies may succeed in developing products and obtaining regulatory approval from the FDA or comparable foreign agencies faster than we do, or in developing products that are more effective than ours. Research and development by others may seek to render our technologies or products obsolete or noncompetitive or result in treatments or cures superior to any therapeutics developed by us.\nThe internet site ClinicalTrials.gov provides public access to information on clinical trials and their results for a wide range of diseases and conditions. Future disclosures of such confidential commercial information may result in loss of advantage of competitive secrets.\nIf we conduct clinical trials or manufacture our product candidates, we expect to depend on third parties.\nIf we conduct clinical trials, we expect to rely on third parties, including clinical research organizations, medical institutions and contract laboratories, to perform critical services for us in connection with such clinical trials. These third parties would be responsible for many aspects of the trials, including finding and enrolling subjects for testing and administering the trials. Even if we rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials, we will be responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with its protocol and applicable regulations, including good clinical practices established by the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities, which govern the conduct, monitoring, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to ensure that the data and results are scientifically credible and accurate, and that trial subjects are adequately informed of the potential risks associated with participating in clinical trials. Even if we rely on third parties, this will not relieve us of the responsibility to ensure these requirements are met. It is possible that these third parties will not comply with all regulatory and contractual requirements or will not otherwise perform their services in a timely or acceptable manner, and we may need to enter into new arrangements with alternative third parties and our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated. In addition, if such third parties fail to perform their obligations in compliance with our clinical trial protocols or applicable good clinical practice regulations, our clinical trials may not meet regulatory requirements or may need to be repeated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize the product candidate being tested in such trials. These risks also apply to the development activities of our collaborators and licensees, and we do not control our collaborators\u2019 and licensees\u2019 research and development, clinical trials or regulatory activities.\nIf we manufacture our product candidates, we expect to depend on collaborators, licensees or other third parties to manufacture our product candidates, and this reliance has increased following the sale of our manufacturing assets in July 2018. There are a limited number of third parties that could manufacture our product candidates. We may be unable to enter into any arrangement for the manufacture of our product candidates, and any arrangement we secure may not meet our requirements for manufacturing quality or quantity. If we manufacture our product candidates, we expect that our dependence on third parties for the manufacture of our product candidates may also reduce our profit margins and our ability to develop and deliver products in a timely manner.\nWe have no marketing or sales experience, and if we are unable to develop our own sales and marketing capability, we may not be successful in commercializing our products.\nOur current strategy is to market our proprietary products directly in the United States, but we currently do not possess pharmaceutical marketing or sales capabilities. To market and sell our proprietary products, we will need to develop a sales force and a marketing group with relevant pharmaceutical industry experience, or make appropriate arrangements with strategic partners to market and sell these products. Developing a marketing and sales force is expensive and time-consuming and could delay any product launch. If we are unable to successfully employ qualified marketing and sales personnel or develop other sales and marketing capabilities, we may not be able to generate sufficient product revenue to become profitable.\nIf we fail to comply with federal and state healthcare laws, including fraud and abuse, transparency, and health information privacy and security laws, we could face substantial penalties and our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects could be adversely affected.\nOur business operations and current and future arrangements with investigators, healthcare professionals, consultants, third-party payors and customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations. These laws may constrain the business or financial arrangements and relationships through which we conduct our operations, including how we research, market, sell and distribute any product for which we obtain marketing approval. Such laws include:\n\u2022\nthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons and entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid;\n\u2022\nthe federal false claims and civil monetary penalties laws, including the civil False Claims Act and its qui tam or whistleblower provisions, which impose criminal and civil penalties against individuals or entities for, among other things, knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government, claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;\n\u2022\nthe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, which imposes criminal and civil liability for, among other things, executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;\n\u2022\nHIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, or HITECH, and its implementing regulations, which imposes obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, on certain types of individuals and entities and their respective business associates with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n\u2022\nthe federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program, with specific exceptions, to report annually to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, information related to payments or other transfers of value made to physicians and teaching hospitals, and applicable manufacturers and applicable group purchasing organizations to report annually to CMS ownership and investment interests held by the physicians and their immediate family members; and\n\u2022\nanalogous state and foreign laws and regulations, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by third-party payors, including private insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government; state laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians, other healthcare providers, and healthcare entities, or marketing expenditures; and state and foreign laws governing the privacy and security of health information in some circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nEfforts to ensure that our current and future business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations, agency guidance or case law involving applicable healthcare laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these or any other health regulatory laws that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant penalties, including the imposition of significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, disgorgement, individual imprisonment, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, additional integrity obligations, such as additional reporting and/or oversight requirements if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement with a governmental authority, and curtailment of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. Defending against any such actions can be costly, time-consuming and may require significant financial and personnel resources. Therefore, even if we are successful in defending against any such actions that may be brought against us, our business may be impaired.\nHealthcare reform and restrictions on reimbursement may limit our returns on potential products.\nOur ability to earn sufficient returns on our products will depend in part on how much, if any, reimbursement for our products and related treatments will be available from:\n\u2022\nGovernment health administration authorities;\n\u2022\nGovernment agencies procuring biodefense products for military or public use, including some for which we may become a sole-source vendor;\n\u2022\nPrivate health coverage insurers;\n\u2022\nManaged care organizations; and\n\u2022\nOther organizations.\nSuch third-party payers decide which drugs and treatments they will cover and the amount of reimbursement, and no uniform policy exists. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for products can differ significantly from payer to payer. Further, the coverage determination process is a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payer separately. Patients rely on third-party payers to reimburse all or part of the cost associated with treatment. If we fail to obtain adequate reimbursement, we could be prevented from successfully commercializing our potential products.\nThere are ongoing efforts by governmental and third-party payers to contain or reduce the costs of healthcare through various reform measures. For example, in the United States, the Federal government passed comprehensive healthcare reform legislation, the ACA, in 2010. With respect to pharmaceutical products, the ACA, among other things, expanded and increased industry rebates for drugs covered by Medicaid and made changes to the coverage requirements under Medicare Part D, Medicare\u2019s prescription drug benefits program. Since its enactment there have been judicial and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA, as well as recent efforts by the Trump administration to repeal or replace certain aspects of the ACA. Since January 2017, President Trump has signed two Executive Orders and other directives designed to delay the implementation of any certain provisions of the ACA or otherwise circumvent some of the requirements for health insurance mandated by the ACA. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, two bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the ACA have been signed into law, including the repeal, effective January 1, 2019, of the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the ACA on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year that is commonly referred to as the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d. Additionally, on January 22, 2018, President Trump signed a continuing resolution on appropriations for fiscal year 2018 that delayed the implementation of certain fees mandated by the ACA, including the so-called \u201cCadillac\u201d tax on certain high cost employer-sponsored insurance plans, the annual fee imposed on certain health insurance providers based on market share, and the medical device excise tax on non-exempt medical devices. Moreover, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, among other things, amends the ACA, effective January 1, 2019, to increase from 50% to 70% the point-of-sale discount that is owed by pharmaceutical manufacturers who participate in Medicare Part D and to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the \u201cdonut hole\u201d. Congress may consider other legislation to repeal or repeal and replace elements of the ACA. We continue to evaluate the effect that the ACA and its possible repeal and replacement has on our business.\nIn addition, drug pricing by pharmaceutical companies has recently come under increased scrutiny. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries and proposed federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug pricing, reduce the out-of-pocket cost of prescription drugs, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, reduce the cost of drugs under Medicare, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies. At the federal level, the Trump administration\u2019s budget proposal for fiscal year 2019 contains additional drug price control measures that could be enacted during the 2019 budget process or in other future legislation, including, for example, measures to permit Medicare Part D plans to negotiate the price of certain drugs under Medicare Part B, to allow some states to negotiate drug prices under Medicaid and to eliminate cost sharing for generic drugs for low-income patients. While any proposed measures will require authorization through additional legislation to become effective, Congress and the Trump administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. At the state level, legislatures are increasingly passing legislation and implementing regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate\nrevenue, attain profitability, or commercialize our current product candidates and those for which we may receive regulatory approval in the future.\nFurther, third-party payers are increasingly challenging the price of medical products and services. If purchasers or users of our products are not able to obtain adequate reimbursement for the cost of using our products, they may forego or reduce their use. Significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products, and whether adequate third-party coverage will be available.\nOur internal computer systems, or those used by our contractors or consultants, may fail or suffer security breaches.\nWe are dependent upon our own or third-party information technology systems, infrastructure and data, including mobile technologies, to operate our business. The multitude and complexity of our computer systems may make them vulnerable to service interruption or destruction, malicious intrusion, or random attack. Likewise, data privacy or security breaches by employees or others may pose a risk that sensitive data, including our clinical trial data, intellectual property, trade secrets or personal information of our employees, patients, customers or other business partners may be exposed to unauthorized persons or to the public. Cyber-attacks are increasing in their frequency, sophistication and intensity. Cyber-attacks could include the deployment of harmful malware, denial-of-service, social engineering and other means to affect service reliability and threaten data confidentiality, integrity and availability. Third party sites that take part in clinical trials we or our collaborators sponsor face similar risks and any security breach of their systems could adversely affect us. A security breach or privacy violation that leads to disclosure or modification of or prevents access to patient information, including personally identifiable information or protected health information, could harm our reputation, compel us to comply with federal and/or state breach notification laws and foreign law equivalents, subject us to mandatory corrective action, require us to verify the correctness of database contents and otherwise subject us to litigation or other liability under laws and regulations that protect personal data, any of which could disrupt our business and/or result in increased costs or loss of revenue. Moreover, the prevalent use of mobile devices that access confidential information increases the risk of data security breaches, which could lead to the loss of confidential information, trade secrets or other intellectual property. While we have invested, and continue to invest, in the protection of our data and information technology infrastructure, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent service interruptions, or identify breaches in our systems, that could adversely affect our business and operations and/or result in the loss of critical or sensitive information, which could result in financial, legal, business or reputational harm to us. In addition, our liability insurance may not be sufficient in type or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches, cyber-attacks and other related breaches.\nWe use hazardous materials in our business. Any claims relating to improper handling, storage or disposal of these materials could be time consuming and costly.\nOur research and development processes involve the controlled storage, use and disposal of hazardous materials and biological materials. Our hazardous materials include certain compressed gases, flammable liquids, acids and bases, and other toxic compounds. We are subject to federal, state and local regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of materials and waste products. Although we believe that our safety procedures for handling and disposing of these hazardous materials comply with the standards prescribed by law and regulation, the risk of accidental contamination or injury from hazardous materials cannot be completely eliminated. In the event of an accident, we could be held liable for any damages that result. We could incur significant costs to comply with current or future environmental laws and regulations.\nWe may have significant product liability exposure.\nWe face an inherent business risk of exposure to product liability and other claims in the event that our technologies or products are alleged to have caused harm. We also have potential liability for products manufactured by us on a contract basis for third parties. Although we currently maintain product liability insurance in the amount of $10 million in the aggregate plus additional coverage specific to the foreign countries where our clinical trials are being conducted, this insurance coverage may not be sufficient, and we may not be able to obtain sufficient coverage in the future at a reasonable cost. Our inability to obtain product liability insurance at an acceptable cost or to otherwise protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of any products developed by us or our collaborators, or our ability to manufacture products for third parties. If we are sued for any injury caused by our technologies or products, or by third-party products that we manufacture, our liability could exceed our insurance coverage and total assets.\nThe recently passed comprehensive tax reform bill could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nOn December 22, 2017, President Trump signed into law new legislation that significantly revises the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. The newly enacted federal income tax law, among other things, contains significant changes to corporate taxation, including reduction of the corporate tax rate from a top marginal rate of 35% to a flat rate of 21%, limitation of the tax deduction for interest expense to 30% of adjusted earnings (except for certain small businesses), limitation of the deduction for net operating losses to 80% of current year taxable income and elimination of net operating loss carrybacks, one time taxation of offshore earnings at reduced rates regardless of whether they are repatriated, elimination of U.S. tax on foreign earnings (subject to certain important exceptions), immediate deductions for certain new investments instead of deductions for depreciation expense over time, and modifying or repealing many business deductions and credits. Notwithstanding the reduction in the corporate income tax rate, the overall impact of the new federal tax law is uncertain and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected. In addition, it is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the newly enacted federal tax law. The impact of this tax reform on holders of our common stock is also uncertain and could be adverse. We urge our stockholders to consult with their legal and tax advisors with respect to this legislation and the potential tax consequences of investing in or holding our common stock.\nOur stock price could continue to be highly volatile and you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you pay for them.\nThe market price of our common stock, like that of many other life sciences companies, has been and is likely to continue to be highly volatile. From January 1, 2016, to December 31, 2018, our stock price has ranged from $1.00 to $4.80. The following factors, among others, could have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock:\n\u2022\nThe results of our on-going review of strategic alternatives;\n\u2022\nThe results of our preclinical studies and clinical trials or announcements regarding our plans for future studies or trials, or those of our collaborators, licensees or competitors;\n\u2022\nEvidence or lack of evidence of the safety or efficacy of our potential products or those of our collaborators, licensees or competitors;\n\u2022\nOur ability to enter into new collaboration and licensing agreements and the success of any collaborators and licensees in the development or commercialization of our product candidates;\n\u2022\nThe announcement by us or our collaborators, licensees or competitors of technological innovations or new products;\n\u2022\nDevelopments concerning our patent or other proprietary rights or those of our collaborators, licensees or competitors, including litigation and challenges to our proprietary rights;\n\u2022\nOther developments with our collaborators or licensees, including our entry into new collaborative or licensing arrangements;\n\u2022\nGeopolitical developments, natural or man-made disease threats, or other events beyond our control;\n\u2022\nU.S. and foreign governmental regulatory actions;\n\u2022\nChanges or announcements in reimbursement policies;\n\u2022\nPeriod-to-period fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nMarket conditions for life science stocks in general;\n\u2022\nChanges in the collective short interest in our stock;\n\u2022\nChanges in estimates of our performance by securities analysts; and\n\u2022\nOur cash balances, need for additional capital, and access to capital.\nWe are at risk of future securities class action litigation due to our past and expected stock price volatility.\nIn the past, stockholders have brought securities class action litigation against a company following a decline in the market price of its securities. This risk is especially acute for us because life science companies have experienced greater than average stock price volatility in recent years and, as a result, have been subject to, on average, a greater number of securities class action claims than companies in other industries. Even if such claims are not successful, any litigation could\nresult in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws include anti-takeover provisions, such as a classified board of directors, a prohibition on stockholder actions by written consent, the authority of our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval, and supermajority voting requirements for specified actions. In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits stockholders owning in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years. These provisions may delay or prevent an acquisition of us, even if the acquisition may be considered beneficial by some stockholders. In addition, they may discourage or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management.\nIn addition, in August 2016, we completed a private placement of 1,841,420 shares of common stock to AnGes. In connection with the private placement, AnGes agreed to vote all of its shares in accordance with the recommendations of our board of directors on any matter brought before our stockholders for a vote, subject to certain limitations. This voting provision may also discourage or prevent attempts by other stockholders to replace members of our board of directors or engage in acquisition activities that our board of directors does not determine to be in the best interests of our stockholders.\nThe issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect our common stockholders.\nWe currently have on file a shelf registration statement that allows us to raise up to an aggregate of $40.0 million from the sale of common stock, preferred stock, debt securities and/or warrants (subject to limitations on the amount of securities that we may sell under the registration statement in any 12-month period) and our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock. The issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect the voting power of holders of our common stock, and reduce the likelihood that our common stockholders will receive dividend payments and payments upon liquidation. The issuance of preferred stock could also decrease the market price of our common stock, or have terms and conditions that could discourage a takeover or other transaction that might involve a premium price for our shares or that our stockholders might believe to be in their best interests.", "PERMNO": 79022, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "BBI"}
