{"cik": "24491", "company": "COOPER TIRE & RUBBER CO", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-02-19", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nSome of the more significant risk factors related to the Company follow:\nPricing volatility for raw materials or commodities or an inadequate supply of key raw materials could result in increased costs and may significantly affect the Company\u2019s profitability.\nThe pricing volatility for natural rubber, petroleum-based materials and other raw materials contributes to the difficulty in managing the costs of raw materials. Costs for certain raw materials used in the Company\u2019s operations, including natural rubber, chemicals, carbon black, steel reinforcements and synthetic rubber remain highly volatile. Increasing costs for raw material supplies will increase the Company\u2019s production costs and affect its margins if the Company is unable to pass the higher production costs on to its customers in the form of price increases. Even if the Company is able to pass along these higher costs, its profitability may be adversely affected until it is able to do so. Decreasing costs for raw materials could also affect margins if the Company is unable to maintain its pricing structure due to the need to offer price reductions to remain competitive. Further, if the Company is unable to obtain adequate supplies of raw materials in a timely manner for any reason, its operations could be interrupted or otherwise adversely affected.\nThe Company is facing heightened risks due to the uncertain business environment.\nCurrent global economic conditions may affect demand for the Company\u2019s products, create volatility in raw material costs and affect the availability and cost of credit. These conditions also affect the Company\u2019s customers and suppliers as well as the ultimate consumer.\nDeterioration in the global macroeconomic environment or in specific regions could impact the Company and, depending upon the severity and duration of these factors, the Company\u2019s profitability and liquidity position could be negatively impacted.\nThe Company\u2019s competitors may also change their actions as a result of changes to the business environment, which could result in increased price competition and discounts, resulting in lower margins or reduced sales volumes for the business.\nIn addition, the bankruptcy, restructuring, consolidation or other cooperation of one or more of the Company\u2019s major customers or suppliers, as well as the strategic actions of competitors, could result in the write-off of accounts receivable, a reduction in purchases of the Company\u2019s products or a supply disruption to its facilities, which could harm the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nThe Company\u2019s results could be impacted by changes in tariffs, trade agreements or other trade restrictions imposed by the U.S. or other governments on imported tires, raw materials or equipment used in tire manufacturing.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to competitively source and sell tires can be significantly impacted by changes in tariffs, changes or repeals of trade agreements, including withdrawal from or material modifications to NAFTA, including the implementation of the USMCA, or certain other international trade agreements, or other trade restrictions or retaliatory actions imposed by various governments. Other effects, including impacts on the price of tires, responsive actions from governments and the opportunity for competitors to establish a presence in markets where the Company participates, could also have significant impacts on the Company\u2019s results.\nFor example, antidumping and countervailing duty investigations into certain passenger car and light truck tires imported from the PRC into the United States were initiated on July 14, 2014. The determinations announced in both investigations were affirmative and resulted in the imposition of significant additional duties from each.\nAntidumping and countervailing duty investigations into certain truck and bus tires imported from the PRC into the U.S. were initiated on January 29, 2016. The preliminary determinations announced in both investigations were affirmative and resulted in the imposition of significant additional duties from each. On February 22, 2017, the International Trade Commission (\"ITC\") made a final determination that the U.S. market had not suffered material injury because of imports of truck and bus tires from China. As a result of this decision, preliminary antidumping and countervailing duties from Chinese truck and bus tires imported subsequent to the preliminary determination were not collected and any amounts previously paid were refunded. On April 14, 2017, the United Steelworkers Union filed a civil action challenging the ITC's decision not to impose duties on truck and bus tires from China imported into the U.S. and that case is still pending. On November 1, 2018, the Court of International Trade (\u201cCIT\u201d) remanded the case back to the ITC for reconsideration. On January 30, 2019, the ITC reversed its earlier decision and made an affirmative determination of material injury, which started the process for the imposition of duties on Chinese truck and bus tire imports. Duties will be collected after the determination is published in the Federal Register. The ITC\u2019s re-determination, along with comments from the parties regarding the re-determination, are due to the CIT by April 15, 2019. The CIT will then make a final determination.\nPursuant to Section 301: China\u2019s Acts, Policies, and Practices Related to Technology Transfer, Intellectual Property, and Innovation, passenger, light truck and truck and bus tires, raw materials and tire-manufacturing equipment from the PRC imported into the U.S. became subject to additional 10 percent duties effective September 24, 2018. These duties are scheduled to increase to 25 percent effective March 2, 2019, unless the current negotiations between the U.S. and China result in a trade agreement, which could impact the future duty percentage. Retaliatory duties on U.S. products have been implemented in response to these additional duties by China. In addition, depending on the outcome of the Section 232 National Security Investigation of Automobiles, Including Cars, SUVs, Vans and Light Trucks, and Automotive Parts, passenger car and light truck tires imported into the U.S. may be subject to an additional duty.\nThe imposition of additional duties or other trade restrictions in the U.S. or elsewhere on raw materials or tire-manufacturing equipment used by the Company or on certain tires imported from the PRC or other countries will result in higher costs and potentially lower margins, or in the case of finished goods, in those tires being diverted to other regions of the world, such as Europe, Latin America or elsewhere in Asia, which could materially harm the Company\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nThe Company\u2019s industry is highly competitive, and the Company may not be able to compete effectively with lower-cost producers and larger competitors.\nThe tire industry is a highly competitive, global industry. Some of the Company\u2019s competitors are larger companies with greater financial resources. Intense competitive activity in the replacement tire industry, including consolidation or other cooperation by and among the Company's competitors, has caused, and will continue to cause, pressures on the Company\u2019s business, as well as pressure on certain of the Company's customers, suppliers or distribution network. As the Company increases its presence in the original equipment market, the demand for products by the OEM's will be impacted by automotive vehicle production. The Company\u2019s ability to compete successfully will depend in part on its ability to balance capacity with demand, leverage global purchasing of raw materials, make required investments to improve productivity, eliminate redundancies and increase production at low-cost, high-quality supply sources. If the Company is unable to offset continued pressures with improved operating efficiencies, its sales, margins, operating results and market share would decline and the impact could become material on the Company\u2019s earnings.\nThe Company is facing supply risks related to certain tires it purchases from PCT.\nIn 2014, the Company sold its ownership interest in PCT and entered into off-take agreements with PCT to provide the continuous supply of certain TBR and passenger car tires for the Company through mid-2018. The agreements have been extended and now expire in mid-2020. If there are any disruptions in or quality issues with the supply of TBR products from PCT, it could have a material negative impact on the Company\u2019s business. The Company is actively pursuing options to ensure the uninterrupted supply of these tires to meet the demands of the business beyond the terms of the PCT off-take agreements, including sourcing through GRT, an off-take agreement with Sailun Vietnam and the recently announced joint venture between Cooper Vietnam and Sailun Vietnam, which is expected to begin producing tires in 2020, but there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to do so in a timely manner.\nIf the Company fails to develop technologies, processes or products needed to keep up with rapidly evolving distribution channels and to support consumer demand or, changes in consumer behavior, it may lose significant market share or be unable to recover associated costs.\nThe Company\u2019s tire sales, margins and profitability may be significantly impacted if it does not develop or have available technologies, processes, including distribution methods, or products that competitors may be developing and consumers or dealers are demanding. This includes, but is not limited to, changes in the design of and materials used to manufacture tires, changes in the types of tires consumers desire and changes in the vehicles consumers are purchasing. Additionally, the Company is also impacted by changes in the way consumers buy tires and failure to effectively compete in various sales and marketing channels, including digital channels and others in which the Company has been less active in the past, such as through mass merchandisers, which have negotiating leverage and costs associated with their operating procedures that are unique to their needs.\nTechnologies or processes may also be developed by competitors that better distribute tires to consumers, including through wholly-owned distributors, which could affect the Company\u2019s customers and implementation of its strategic plan.\nAn increase in consumer preference for car- and ride-sharing services, as opposed to automobile ownership, may result in a long term reduction in the number of vehicles per capita. Additionally, refreshing existing products and developing new products and technologies requires significant investment and capital expenditures, is technologically challenging and requires extensive testing and accurate anticipation of technological and market trends. If the Company fails to develop new products that are appealing to its customers, or fails to develop products on time and within budgeted amounts, the Company may be\nunable to recover its product development and testing costs. If the Company cannot successfully use new production or equipment methodologies it invests in, it may also not be able to recover those costs.\nIf assumptions used in developing the Company\u2019s strategic plan are inaccurate or the Company is unable to execute its strategic plan effectively, its profitability and financial position could be negatively impacted.\nThe Company faces both general industry and company-specific challenges. These include volatile raw material costs, increasing product complexity and pressure from competitors with greater resources or manufacturing in lower-cost regions. To address these challenges and position the Company for future success, the Company continues to execute towards strategic imperatives outlined in its Strategic Plan. The three strategic imperatives are building a sustainable cost competitive position, driving top-line profitable growth and building organizational capabilities and enablers to support strategic goals.\nThe Company continually reviews and updates its business plans to achieve these imperatives. If the assumptions used in developing the Company\u2019s business plans vary significantly from actual conditions, the Company\u2019s sales, margins and profitability could be harmed. If the Company is unsuccessful in implementing the tactics necessary to execute its business plans, it may not be able to achieve or sustain future profitability, which could impair its ability to meet debt and other obligations and could otherwise negatively affect its operating results, financial condition and liquidity.\nThe Company may not be successful in executing and integrating investments and acquisitions into its operations, which could harm its results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company routinely evaluates potential investments and acquisitions and may pursue additional investment and acquisition opportunities, some of which could be material to its business. The Company cannot provide assurance whether it will be successful in pursuing and integrating any investment or acquisition opportunities or what the consequences of any investment or acquisition would be. The Company may encounter various risks in any investment or acquisition, including:\n\u2022\nthe possible inability to integrate an acquired business into its operations;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention;\n\u2022\nloss of key management personnel;\n\u2022\nunanticipated problems or liabilities;\n\u2022\npotential asset impairment charges, including goodwill, due to inability to meet operating plans; and\n\u2022\nincreased labor and regulatory compliance costs of acquired businesses.\nSome or all of those risks could impair the Company\u2019s results of operations and impact its financial condition. The Company may finance any future investments or acquisitions from internally generated funds, bank borrowings, public offerings or private placements of equity or debt securities, or a combination of the foregoing. Investments and acquisitions may involve the expenditure of significant funds and management time.\nInvestments and acquisitions may also require the Company to increase its borrowings under its bank credit facilities or other debt instruments, or to seek new sources of liquidity. Increased borrowings would correspondingly increase the Company\u2019s financial leverage, and could result in lower credit ratings and increased future borrowing costs. These risks could also reduce the Company\u2019s flexibility to respond to changes in its industry or in general economic conditions.\nIn addition, the Company\u2019s business plans call for growth. If the Company is unable to identify or execute on appropriate opportunities for acquisition, investment or growth, its business could be materially adversely affected.\nThe Company has and could in the future incur restructuring charges and other costs as it continues to execute actions in an effort to improve future profitability and competitiveness and may not achieve the anticipated savings and benefits from these actions.\nThe Company has and may in the future initiate restructuring actions designed to improve future profitability and competitiveness, and enhance the Company\u2019s flexibility, including the outcome of the recently announced restructuring in the U.K., as well as potential future outcomes from the Company's ongoing region by region global footprint assessment. The Company may not realize anticipated savings or benefits from the U.K. action, or future actions, in full or in part or within the time periods it expects. The Company is also subject to the risks of labor unrest, negative publicity and business disruption in connection with these actions. Failure to realize anticipated savings or benefits from the Company\u2019s actions could have an adverse effect on the business and could result in potential unexpected costs or other impacts. Such restructuring actions and impairments or other charges could have a significant negative effect on the Company\u2019s earnings or cash flows in the short-term.\nAny interruption in the Company\u2019s skilled workforce, or that of its suppliers or customers, including labor disruptions, could impair its operations and harm its earnings and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s operations depend on maintaining a skilled workforce and any interruption of its workforce due to shortages of skilled technical, production or professional workers, work disruptions, or other events could interrupt the Company\u2019s operations and affect its operating results. Competition for these employees is intense and the Company could experience difficulty in hiring and retaining the personnel necessary to support its business. Further, a significant number of the Company\u2019s employees are currently represented by unions. If the Company is unable to resolve any labor disputes or if there are work stoppages or other work disruptions at the Company or any of its suppliers or customers, the Company\u2019s business and operating results could suffer. See also related comments under \u201cThe Company is facing supply risks related to certain tires it purchases from PCT.\u201d\nIf the Company is unable to attract and retain key personnel, its business could be materially adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s business depends on the continued service of key members of its management. The loss of the services of a significant number of members of its management team could have a material adverse effect on its business. The Company\u2019s future success will also depend on its ability to attract, retain and develop highly skilled personnel, such as engineering, marketing, information technology and senior management professionals. Competition for these employees is intense and the Company could experience difficulty in hiring and retaining the personnel necessary to support its business. If the Company does not succeed in retaining its current employees and attracting new high-quality employees, its business could be materially adversely affected.\nThe Company has a risk due to volatility of the capital and financial markets.\nThe Company periodically requires access to the capital and financial markets as a significant source of liquidity for maturing debt payments, including the Company's unsecured notes due in December 2019, or working capital needs or investments in the business that it cannot satisfy by cash on hand or operating cash flows. Substantial volatility in world capital markets and the banking industry may make it difficult for the Company to access credit markets and to obtain financing or refinancing, as the case may be, on satisfactory terms or at all. In addition, various additional factors, including a deterioration of the Company\u2019s credit ratings or its business or financial condition, could further impair its access to the capital markets and bank financings. Additionally, any inability to access the capital markets or bank financings, including the ability to refinance existing debt when due, could require the Company to defer critical capital expenditures, reduce or not pay dividends, reduce spending in areas of strategic importance, suspend stock repurchases, sell important assets or, in extreme cases, seek protection from creditors. See also related comments under \u201cThere are risks associated with the Company\u2019s global strategy, which includes using joint ventures and partially-owned subsidiaries.\u201d\nThe Company\u2019s operations in Asia have been or will be financed in part using multiple loans from several lenders to finance working capital needs. These loans are generally for terms of one year or less. Therefore, debt maturities occur frequently and access to the capital markets and bank financings is crucial to the Company\u2019s ability to maintain sufficient liquidity to support its operations in Asia.\nIncreases in interest rates or changes in credit ratings may negatively impact the Company.\nCertain of the Company's variable rate debt, including its revolving credit facility, currently uses LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate. LIBOR is the subject of recent proposals for reform. These reforms and other pressures may cause LIBOR to disappear entirely or to perform differently than in the past. The consequences of these developments with respect to LIBOR cannot be entirely predicted but could result in an increase in the cost of variable rate debt. The interest rates under on the Company's term loans and revolving credit facilities can vary based on the Company's credit ratings. The Company's policy is to manage interest rate risk by entering into both fixed and variable rate debt arrangements. Interest rate swaps are also used to minimize worldwide financing cost and to achieve a desired mix of fixed and variable rate debt. The Company utilizes derivative financial instruments to enhance its ability to manage risk, including interest rate exposures that exist as part of ongoing business operations. The company does not enter into contracts for trading purposes, nor is it a party to any leveraged derivative instruments. The use of derivative financial instruments is monitored through regular communication with senior management and the utilization of written guidelines. However, the Company's use of these instruments may not effectively limit or eliminate exposure to changes in interest rates. Therefore, the Company cannot provide assurance that future credit rating or interest rate changes will not have a material negative impact on its business, financial position or operating results.\nA disruption in, or failure of, the Company\u2019s information technology systems, including those related to cybersecurity, could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business operations and financial performance.\nThe Company relies on the accuracy, capacity and security of its information technology systems across all of its major business functions, including its research and development, manufacturing, sales, financial and administrative functions. While the Company maintains some of its critical information technology systems, it is also dependent on third parties to provide important information technology services relating to, among other things, human resources, electronic communications and certain finance functions. Additionally, the Company collects and stores sensitive data, including intellectual property,\nproprietary business information and the proprietary business information of its customers and suppliers, as well as personally identifiable information of the Company\u2019s customers and employees, in data centers and on information technology networks. In addition, the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which came into effect in May 2018, creates a range of new compliance obligations for companies that process personal data of European Union residents, and increases financial penalties for non-compliance. As a company that processes personal data of European Union residents, we bear the costs of compliance with the GDPR and are subject to the potential for fines and penalties in the event of a breach of the GDPR. Aside from the European Union, other jurisdictions have enacted, or are considering, regulations regarding data privacy. Despite the security measures that the Company has implemented, including those related to cybersecurity, its systems could be breached or damaged by computer viruses, natural or man-made incidents or disasters or unauthorized physical or electronic access. Furthermore, the Company may have little or no oversight with respect to security measures employed by third-party service providers, which may ultimately prove to be ineffective at countering threats. A system failure, accident or security breach could result in business disruption, theft of its intellectual property, trade secrets or customer information and unauthorized access to personnel information. To the extent that any system failure, accident or security breach results in disruptions to its operations or the theft, loss or disclosure of, or damage to, its data or confidential information, the Company\u2019s reputation, business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. In addition, the Company may be required to incur significant costs to protect against and, if required, remediate the damage caused by such disruptions or system failures in the future.\nThe Company may be adversely affected by legal actions, including product liability claims which, if successful, could have a negative impact on its financial position, cash flows and results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s operations expose it to legal actions, including potential liability for personal injury or death as an alleged result of the failure of or conditions in the products that it designs, manufactures and sells. Specifically, the Company is a party to a number of product liability cases in which individuals involved in motor vehicle accidents seek damages resulting from allegedly defective tires that it manufactured. Product liability claims and lawsuits, including possible class action, may result in material losses in the future and cause the Company to incur significant litigation defense costs. The Company is largely self-insured against these claims. These claims and related reserves could have a significant effect on the Company\u2019s financial position, cash flows and results of operations.\nFrom time to time, the Company is also subject to audits, litigation or other commercial disputes and other legal proceedings relating to its business. Due to the inherent uncertainties of any litigation, commercial disputes or other legal proceedings, the Company cannot accurately predict their ultimate outcome, including the outcome of any related appeals. An unfavorable outcome could materially adversely impact the Company\u2019s financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nThe Company conducts its manufacturing, sales and distribution operations on a worldwide basis and is subject to risks associated with doing business outside the U.S.\nThe Company has affiliate, subsidiary and joint venture operations worldwide, including in the U.S., Europe, Mexico and the PRC. The Company has a wholly-owned manufacturing entity, Cooper Kunshan Tire, and is the majority owner of GRT, both in the PRC. The Company also is the majority owner of COOCSA, a manufacturing entity in Mexico, and has established operations in Serbia and the U.K. PCT, located in the PRC, is currently a supplier of TBR tires for the Company and the Company entered into an off-take agreement with Sailun Vietnam, located in Vietnam, for the supply of TBR tires. Additionally, the Company recently announced a joint venture between Cooper Vietnam and Sailun Vietnam, which is expected to begin producing tires in 2020. There are a number of risks in doing business abroad, including political and economic uncertainty, social unrest, sudden changes in laws and regulations, ability to enforce existing or future contracts, shortages of trained labor and the uncertainties associated with entering into joint ventures or similar arrangements in foreign countries. These risks may impact the Company\u2019s ability to expand its operations in different regions and otherwise achieve its objectives relating to its foreign operations, including utilizing these locations as suppliers to other markets. In addition, compliance with multiple and potentially conflicting foreign laws and regulations, import and export limitations and exchange controls is burdensome and expensive. For example, the Company could be adversely affected by violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws as well as export controls and economic sanction laws. The FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government officials and, in some cases, other persons, for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or obtaining another improper benefit. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in civil and criminal fines, penalties and sanctions against the Company, its officers or its employees, prohibitions on the conduct of the Company\u2019s business and on its ability to offer products and services in one or more countries, and could also harm the Company\u2019s reputation, business and results of operations. The Company\u2019s foreign operations also subject it to the risks of international terrorism and hostilities and to foreign currency risks, including exchange rate fluctuations and limits on the repatriation of funds. See also related comments under \"The Company\u2019s results could be impacted by changes in tariffs, trade agreements or other trade restrictions imposed by the U.S. or other governments on imported tires or raw materials\", \"There are risks associated with the Company\u2019s\nglobal strategy, which includes using joint ventures and partially-owned subsidiaries\" and \"The results of the United Kingdom\u2019s referendum on withdrawal from the European Union may have a negative effect on global economic conditions, financial markets or the Company\u2019s business.\"\nThere are risks associated with the Company\u2019s global strategy, which includes using joint ventures and partially-owned subsidiaries.\nThe Company\u2019s strategy includes the use of joint ventures and other partially-owned subsidiaries, including the recently announced Vietnam joint venture with Sailun Vietnam. These entities operate in countries outside of the U.S., are generally less well capitalized than the Company and bear risks similar to the risks of the Company. In addition, there are specific risks applicable to these subsidiaries and these risks, in turn, add potential risks to the Company. Such risks include greater risk of joint venture partners or other investors failing to meet their obligations under related stockholders\u2019 agreements; conflicts with joint venture partners; the possibility of a joint venture partner taking valuable knowledge from the Company; and risk of being denied access to the capital markets, which could lead to resource demands on the Company in order to maintain or advance its strategy. The Company\u2019s outstanding notes and primary credit facility contain cross default provisions in the event of certain defaults by the Company under other agreements with third parties. For further discussion of access to the capital markets, see also related comments under \u201cThe Company has a risk due to volatility of the capital and financial markets.\u201d\nThe results of the United Kingdom\u2019s referendum on withdrawal from the European Union may have a negative effect on global economic conditions, financial markets or the Company\u2019s business.\nIn June 2016, a majority of voters in the United Kingdom elected to withdraw from the European Union in a national referendum. The U.K. is currently negotiating the terms of its exit from the European Union (\u201cBrexit\u201d) is currently scheduled for March 29, 2019. In November 2018, the U.K. and the European Union agreed upon a draft Withdrawal Agreement that sets out the terms of the U.K.\u2019s departure, including commitments on citizen rights after Brexit, a financial settlement from the U.K., and a transition period from March 29, 2019 through December 31, 2020 to allow time for a future trade deal to be agreed. On January 15, 2019, the draft Withdrawal Agreement was rejected by the U.K. Parliament creating significant uncertainty about the terms and timing under which the U.K. will leave the European Union.\nIf the U.K. leaves the European Union with no agreement, it will likely have an adverse impact on labor and trade in addition to creating further short-term uncertainty and currency volatility. In the absence of a future trade deal, the U.K.\u2019s trade with the European Union and the rest of the world would be subject to tariffs and duties set by the World Trade Organization. Additionally, the movement of goods between the U.K. and the remaining member states of the European Union will be subject to additional inspections and documentation checks, leading to possible delays at ports of entry and departure. These changes to the trading relationship between the U.K and European Union would likely result in increased cost of goods imported into and exported from the U.K. and may decrease the profitability of the Company's U.K. and other operations. Additional currency volatility could drive a weaker British pound, which increases the cost of goods imported into the U.K. operations and may decrease the profitability of the U.K. operations. A weaker British pound versus the U.S. dollar also causes local currency results of U.K. operations to be translated into fewer U.S. dollars during a reporting period. With a range of outcomes still possible, the impact from Brexit remains uncertain and will depend, in part, on the final outcome of tariff, trade, regulatory and other negotiations.\nCompliance with legal and regulatory initiatives could increase the cost of operating the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company is subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations. Compliance with those laws now in effect, or that may be enacted, could require significant capital expenditures, increase the Company\u2019s production costs and affect its earnings and results of operations. Periodic changes as the result of elections in the U.S. and worldwide make it difficult to predict the legislative and regulatory changes that may occur.\nSeveral countries have or may implement labeling requirements for tires. This legislation could cause the Company\u2019s products to be at a disadvantage in the marketplace resulting in a loss of market share or could otherwise impact the Company\u2019s ability to distribute and sell its tires.\nIn addition, while the Company believes that its tires are free from design and manufacturing defects and comply with all applicable regulations and standards, it is possible that a recall of the Company\u2019s tires could occur in the future. A recall could harm the Company\u2019s reputation, operating results and financial position.\nThe Company is also subject to legislation governing labor, environmental, privacy and data protection, occupational safety and health both in the U.S. and other countries. The related legislation can change over time making it more expensive for the Company to produce its products.\nThe Company could also, despite its best efforts to comply with these laws and regulations, be found liable and be subject to additional costs because of these laws and regulations.\nThe Company may fail to successfully develop or implement information technologies or related systems, resulting in a significant competitive disadvantage.\nSuccessfully competing in the highly competitive tire industry can be impacted by the successful development of information technology. If the Company fails to successfully develop or implement information technology systems, it may be at a disadvantage to its competitors resulting in lost sales and negative impacts on the Company\u2019s earnings.\nThe Company has implemented Enterprise Resource Planning systems in the United States and other locations. The Company is evaluating its available options for integrating information technology solutions outside of the United States, which will require significant amounts of capital and human resources to deploy. These requirements may be significant and exceed Company projections. Throughout integration of the systems, there are also risks created to the Company\u2019s ability to successfully and efficiently operate.\nThe Company\u2019s expenditures for pension and other postretirement obligations could be materially higher than it has predicted if its underlying assumptions prove to be incorrect.\nThe Company provides defined benefit and hybrid pension plan coverage to union and non-union U.S. employees and a contributory defined benefit plan in the U.K. The Company\u2019s pension expense and its required contributions to its pension plans are directly affected by the value of plan assets, the projected and actual rates of return on plan assets and the actuarial assumptions the Company uses to measure its defined benefit pension plan obligations, including the discount rate at which future projected and accumulated pension obligations are discounted to a present value and the inflation rate. The Company could experience increased pension expense due to a combination of factors, including the decreased investment performance of its pension plan assets, decreases in the discount rate, changes in its assumptions relating to the expected return on plan assets, updates to mortality tables and the impact of changes to the Company\u2019s pension strategy. The Company could also experience increased other postretirement expense due to decreases in the discount rate, increases in the health care trend rate and changes in the health care environment.\nIn the event of declines in the market value of the Company\u2019s pension assets or lower discount rates to measure the present value of pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, the Company could experience changes to its Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheet or significant cash requirements.\nIf the price of energy sources increases, the Company\u2019s operating expenses could increase significantly or the demand for the Company\u2019s products could be affected.\nThe Company\u2019s manufacturing facilities rely principally on natural gas, as well as electrical power and other energy sources. High demand and limited availability of natural gas and other energy sources can result in significant increases in energy costs increasing the Company\u2019s operating expenses and transportation costs. Higher energy costs would increase the Company\u2019s production costs and adversely affect its margins and results of operations. If the Company is unable to obtain adequate sources of energy, its operations could be interrupted.\nIn addition, if the price of gasoline increases significantly for consumers, it can affect driving and purchasing habits and impact demand for tires.\nThe realizability of deferred tax assets may affect the Company\u2019s profitability and cash flows.\nThe Company has significant net deferred tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and determines at each reporting period whether or not a valuation allowance is necessary based upon the expected realizability of such deferred tax assets. In the U.S., the Company has recorded deferred tax assets, the largest of which relate to product liability, pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, partially offset by deferred tax liabilities, the most significant of which relates to accelerated depreciation. The Company\u2019s non-U.S. deferred tax assets relate to pension, accrued expenses and net operating losses, and are partially offset by deferred tax liabilities related to accelerated depreciation. Based upon the Company\u2019s assessment of the realizability of its net deferred tax assets, the Company maintains a valuation allowance in the U.K., as well as a small valuation allowance for the portion of its U.S. deferred tax assets primarily associated with a loss carryforward. In addition, the Company has recorded valuation allowances for deferred tax assets primarily associated with other non-U.S. net operating losses.\nThe Company\u2019s assessment of the realizability of deferred tax assets is based in part on certain assumptions regarding future profitability, and potentially adverse business conditions could have a negative impact on the future realizability of the deferred tax assets and therefore impact the Company\u2019s future operating results or financial position.\nCompliance with and changes in tax laws, including recently enacted tax reform legislation in the United States, could materially and adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company is subject to extensive tax liabilities, including federal and state income taxes and transactional taxes such as excise, sales and use, payroll, franchise, withholding and property taxes. New tax laws and regulations and changes in existing tax laws and regulations could result in increased expenditures by the Company for tax liabilities in the future and could materially and adversely impact the Company's financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRecently enacted tax reform legislation has made substantial changes to U.S. tax law, including a reduction in the corporate tax rate, a limitation on deductibility of interest expense, a limitation on the use of net operating losses to offset future taxable income, the allowance of immediate expensing of capital expenditures and deemed repatriation of foreign earnings. The Company expects this legislation to have significant effects, some of which may be adverse. For example, the reduction in the corporate tax rate has resulted in a reduction in the value of the Company's existing deferred tax assets, and consequently was a charge to earnings in 2017.\nAdditionally, the Company\u2019s income tax returns are subject to examination by federal, state and local tax authorities in the U.S. and tax authorities outside the U.S. Based upon the outcome of tax examinations, judicial proceedings, or expiration of statutes of limitations, it is possible that the ultimate resolution of these unrecognized tax benefits may result in a payment that is materially different from the current estimate of the tax liabilities. Such factors could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s provision for income taxes and the cash outlays required to satisfy income tax obligations.\nEnvironmental issues, including climate change, or legal, regulatory or market measures to address environmental issues, may negatively affect the Company's business and operations and cause it to incur significant costs.\nThe Company\u2019s manufacturing facilities are subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations designed to protect the environment, including increased government regulations to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions as a result of concern over climate change, and the Company expects that additional requirements with respect to environmental matters will be imposed on it in the future.\nThere is also growing concern that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns, and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. In the event that issues related to such climate change have a negative effect on the Company's business, it may be subjected to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain raw materials, including natural rubber. Natural disasters and extreme weather conditions may also disrupt the productivity of the Company's facilities or the operation of its supply chain.\nIn addition, the Company has contractual indemnification obligations for environmental remediation costs and liabilities that may arise relating to certain divested operations. Material future expenditures may be necessary if compliance standards change, if material unknown conditions that require remediation are discovered, or if required remediation of known conditions becomes more extensive than expected. If the Company fails to comply with present and future environmental laws and regulations, it could be subject to future liabilities or the suspension of production, which could harm its business or results of operations. Environmental laws could also restrict the Company\u2019s ability to expand its facilities or could require it to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses in connection with its manufacturing processes.\nThe Company has been and may continue to be impacted by currency fluctuations, which may reduce reported results for the Company\u2019s international operations and otherwise adversely affect the business.\nBecause the Company conducts transactions in various non-U.S. currencies, including the Euro, Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Swiss franc, Swedish kronar, Norwegian krone, Mexican peso, Chinese yuan, Serbian dinar and Brazilian real, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may impact the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, despite currency hedging actions by the Company. The Company\u2019s operating results are subject to the effects of fluctuations in the value of these currencies and fluctuations in the related currency exchange rates. As a result, the Company\u2019s sales have historically been affected by, and may continue to be affected by, these fluctuations. Exchange rate movements between currencies in which the Company sells its products have been affected by and may continue to result in exchange losses that could materially affect results. During times of strength of the U.S. dollar, the reported revenues of the Company\u2019s international operations will be reduced because local currencies will translate into fewer dollars. In addition, a strong U.S. dollar may increase the competitiveness of competitors based outside of the United States. As a result, continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. A weak U.S. dollar could increase the cost of goods imported into the Company's U.S. operations and other goods imported in U.S. dollars at other locations and may decrease the profitability of the Company's operations. As a result, continued weakening of the U.S. dollar may have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Company may not be able to protect its intellectual property rights adequately.\nThe Company\u2019s success depends in part upon its ability to use and protect its proprietary technology and other intellectual property, which generally covers various aspects in the design and manufacture of its products and processes. The Company owns and uses tradenames and trademarks worldwide. The Company relies upon a combination of trade secrets, confidentiality policies, nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements and patent, copyright and trademark laws to protect its intellectual property rights. The steps the Company takes in this regard may not be adequate to protect its intellectual property or to prevent or deter challenges or infringement or other violations of its intellectual property, and the Company may not be able to detect unauthorized use or take appropriate and timely steps to enforce its intellectual property rights.\nIn addition, the laws of some countries may not protect and enforce the Company\u2019s intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. Further, while the Company believes it has rights to use all intellectual property in the Company\u2019s use, if the Company is found to infringe on the rights of others it could be adversely impacted.\nThe impact of proposed new accounting standards may have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s financial statements.\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board is considering or has issued for future adoption several projects which may result in the modification of accounting standards affecting the Company. Any such changes could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s financial statements.\nThe Company is facing risks relating to healthcare legislation.\nThe Company is facing risks emanating from legislation in the U.S., including the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the related Healthcare and Education Reconciliation Act, which are collectively referred to as healthcare legislation. The future of this major legislation and any replacement is now in question and the ultimate cost and the potentially adverse impact to the Company and its employees cannot be quantified at this time.", "PERMNO": 27430, "SIC": 3011, "TIC": "CTB"}
