Risk Factors\nForward-Looking Statements\nForward-looking statements (as such term is defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) contained in \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d as well as elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, involve risks and uncertainties and are subject to change based on various important factors, many of which may be beyond the Company\u2019s control.

Failure to consummate the Merger would prevent the Company\u2019s shareholders from realizing the anticipated benefits of the Merger. In addition, the consideration offered by JD Sports reflects a valuation of the Company in excess of the price at which the Company\u2019s common stock was trading prior to the public announcement of the entry into the Merger Agreement. The current market price of the Company\u2019s common stock may reflect a market assumption that the Merger will occur, and a failure to consummate the Merger could result in a significant decline in the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock and a negative perception of the Company generally. Any delay in the consummation of the Merger or any uncertainty about the consummation of the Merger could also negatively impact the share price and future business and financial results of the Company.\nThe Merger remains subject to conditions, some of which JD Sports and the Company cannot control, which could result in the Merger not being consummated or being delayed, either of which could negatively impact the share price and future business and operating results of the Company.\nThe Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions to closing, including, but not limited to, the approval of the Merger Agreement by the shareholders of both the Company and JD Sports; the absence of any orders, injunctions, or rulings that would have the effect of enjoining or preventing the consummation of the Merger; and the approval of the UK Listing Authority (UKLA) of a circular convening the JD Sports shareholders meeting. Certain conditions to the Merger may not be satisfied or, if they are, the timing of such satisfaction is uncertain. If any conditions to the Merger are not satisfied or, where waiver is permitted by applicable law, not waived, the Merger will not be consummated.\nThe Merger is not subject to a financing condition. While JD Sports has obtained debt financing commitments to finance, in part, the Merger Consideration under debt commitment letters to JD Sports (consisting of a \u00a3400 million unsecured revolving credit facility) and to the Company (consisting of a $315 million senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility to be provided to the Company as the surviving entity of the Merger), certain customary conditions precedent to funding must be satisfied in order for JD Sports and the Company to utilize these bank facilities, and if such conditions are not satisfied or if the lenders do not satisfy their funding commitment, JD Sports may be unable to obtain the funds necessary to consummate the Merger.\nIf for any reason the Merger is not completed, or the closing of the Merger is significantly delayed, the Company\u2019s share price and business and results of operations may be adversely affected. In addition, failure to consummate the Merger would prevent the Company\u2019s shareholders from realizing the anticipated benefits of the Merger. The Company has incurred, and expects to continue to incur, significant transaction fees, professional service fees, taxes, and other costs related to the Merger.\nFurther, if the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, the Company may be required to pay to JD Sports a termination fee of $28 million or pay JD Sports its reasonable and documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger and related transactions, as well as JD Sports\u2019 fees and expenses in connection with its financing of the transaction, in an aggregate amount up to $5.6 million (of which, any reimbursement could be credited against the termination fee, if applicable). Any fees and expenses paid by the Company will be credited against any termination fee that may become due and payable.\nThe directors and executive officers of the Company have interests in the Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, those of other Company shareholders.\nThe Company\u2019s shareholders should recognize that the directors and executive officers of the Company have interests in the Merger that may be different from, or in addition to, their interests as shareholders of the Company generally. Interests of executive officers and directors that may be different from or in addition to the interests of the Company\u2019s shareholders generally include, among other matters: (i) the acceleration and cash-out of all Company stock options, including options on Company common stock held by the Company's executive officers and directors, with exercise prices less than the Merger Consideration, as provided in the Merger Agreement; (ii) the acceleration of vesting of each award of Company restricted stock that is outstanding and unvested immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger, including restricted stock held by the Company's executive officers and directors, and the conversion of each such share of restricted stock into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (net of withholding taxes), pursuant to the Merger Agreement; (iii) cash payments, accelerated vesting of outstanding Company equity awards, and other benefits payable under severance arrangements, award agreements, and/or employment agreements with the Company's executive officers in the event of a qualifying termination of employment in connection with the Merger; and (iv) indemnification of the Company's directors and executive officers by the surviving corporation following the Merger.\nThe Merger Agreement contains provisions that restrict the Company\u2019s ability to pursue alternatives to the Merger and, in specified circumstances, could require the Company to pay JD Sports a termination fee or expense reimbursement.\nUnder the Merger Agreement, the Company is restricted from soliciting, encouraging, or discussing alternative acquisition proposals from third parties, and the directors are required to maintain its recommendation to its shareholders to approve the Merger with JD Sports. However, prior to the Merger Agreement being approved by the Company\u2019s shareholders, the Company may, if in receipt of an alternative acquisition proposal (obtained without breaching the foregoing restrictions) that is or is reasonably expected to lead to a \u201csuperior proposal\u201d (as defined in the Merger Agreement), provide information to and participate in discussions with such proposing party as provided in the Merger Agreement. In addition, prior to the Merger Agreement being approved by the Company\u2019s shareholders, solely if the failure to so change its recommendation would be a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable law, the directors would be permitted to change its recommendation with respect to the Merger in response to the receipt of a superior proposal that did not result from a breach of the no-solicitation covenants, and/or terminate the Merger Agreement (subject to the Company simultaneously paying to JD Sports a $28 million termination fee) in order to accept a superior proposal. If the directors make such a change in recommendation, JD Sports would also have the right to terminate the Merger Agreement and upon such termination receive the termination fee from the Company. These provisions could discourage a third party that may have an interest in acquiring all or a significant part of the Company from considering or proposing that acquisition, even if such third party were prepared to enter into a transaction that is more favorable to the Company or its shareholders than the Merger with JD Sports.\nUncertainties associated with the Merger may cause a loss of employees and may otherwise affect the future business and operations of the Company, JD Sports, and the combined company after the Merger.\nUncertainty about the effect of the Merger on employees and customers may have an adverse effect on the Company or JD Sports and, if the proposed combination with JD Sports is consummated, on the combined company following the Merger. These consequent uncertainties may impair the Company\u2019s and JD Sports\u2019 ability to retain and motivate key personnel and could also cause customers, suppliers, licensees, partners, and others that deal with the Company or JD Sports to defer entering into contracts with, making other decisions concerning, or seeking to change existing business relationships with the Company or JD Sports. Because the Company and JD Sports depend on the experience and industry knowledge of their executives and other key personnel to execute their business plans, the combined company may be unable to meet its strategic objectives.\nWhile the Merger is pending, the Company may not be able to hire qualified personnel to replace any key employees that may depart to the same extent that it has been able to in the past. In addition, if the Merger is not completed, the Company may also encounter challenges in hiring qualified personnel to replace key employees that may depart the Company subsequent to the Merger announcement.\nTwo lawsuits have been filed and additional lawsuits may be filed against the Company, JD Sports, and the Company\u2019s Board of Directors challenging the Merger. An adverse ruling in any such lawsuit may delay or prevent the completion of the Merger or result in an award of damages against the Company.\nIn each complaint, a purported shareholder of the Company has filed a lawsuit on behalf of themselves and a putative class of public Company shareholders, as well as on behalf of the Company derivatively, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana. The lawsuits, which are captioned Martinez v. Lyon, et al., Civil Action No. 1:18-cv-1342 and Franchi v. The Finish Line, Inc., Lyon, et al., Civil Action No. 1:18-cv-01434, names the Company as a nominal defendant and alleges, among other things, breach of fiduciary duty claims against the Company\u2019s Board of Directors (the \"Board\") in connection with the Board\u2019s consideration and approval of the Merger. The complaints also allege that the preliminary proxy statement that the Company submitted to the SEC in connection with the Merger was materially misleading and incomplete, purportedly violating Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act, and Rule 14a-9 promulgated thereunder. The lawsuits seek, among other things, to enjoin the consummation of the Merger and damages. The Company believes the lawsuits are without merit and intends to vigorously defend itself. In addition to the foregoing lawsuits, additional lawsuits arising out of or relating to the Merger Agreement or the Merger may be filed in the future.\nThe results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict and could delay or prevent the completion of the Merger. The existence of litigation relating to the Merger could impact the likelihood of obtaining the shareholder approvals from either the Company or JD Sports. Moreover, the pending litigation is, and any future additional litigation could be, time consuming and expensive and could divert the Company\u2019s and JD Sports\u2019 respective management\u2019s attention away from their regular business. One of the conditions to completion of the Merger is the absence of any pending action or proceeding challenging the Merger Agreement or the consummation of the Merger or seeking to compel the Company or any of its subsidiaries, or JD Sports or any of its subsidiaries, to take any action explicitly not required to be taken to obtain required approvals. In addition, another condition to the completion of the Merger is the absence of any law, action, order, or other legal restraint or prohibition, entered, enacted, promulgated, enforced or issued by any court or other governmental authority of competent jurisdiction, which prohibits, renders illegal, or enjoins the consummation of the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, whether temporarily, preliminarily or permanently. Accordingly, if a plaintiff is successful in obtaining a judgment prohibiting completion of the Merger, then such judgment may prevent the Merger from being completed, or from being completed within the expected time frame.\nThe following risk factors assume that the Company remains a stand-alone company except as otherwise noted.\nCurrent, recent past, and future economic and financial conditions have caused and/or in the future may cause a decline in consumer spending and may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, operations, liquidity, financial results, and stock price.\nThe Company\u2019s operating results are affected by the relative condition of the U.S. economy. Business and financial performance may be adversely affected by current, recent past, and future economic conditions that cause a decline in business and consumer spending, including a reduction in the availability of credit, increased unemployment levels, higher energy and fuel costs, rising interest rates, financial market volatility, and recession. Additionally, the Company may experience difficulties in operating and growing its operations to react to economic pressures in the U.S.\nAs a business that depends on consumer discretionary spending, the Company\u2019s customers may reduce their spending and purchases due to job losses or fear of job losses, foreclosures, bankruptcies, higher consumer debt and interest rates, reduced access to credit, falling home prices, increased taxes, and/or lower consumer confidence. Decreases in comparable store net sales, customer traffic, or average dollar per transaction negatively affect the Company\u2019s financial performance, and a prolonged period of depressed consumer spending could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and results. Promotional activities, product liquidation, and decreased demand for consumer products could affect profitability and margins. Customer traffic is difficult to forecast and mitigate. As a consequence, sales, operating, and financial results for a particular period are difficult to predict, and, therefore, it is difficult to forecast expected results for future periods. Any of the foregoing factors could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, and financial condition and could adversely affect the Company\u2019s stock price.\nAdditionally, many of the effects and consequences of U.S. and global financial and economic conditions could potentially have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s liquidity and capital resources, including the ability to raise additional capital, if needed, or the ability of banks to honor draws on the Company\u2019s credit facility, or could otherwise negatively affect the Company\u2019s business and financial results. Although the Company normally generates funds from operations to pay operating expenses and fund capital expenditures and has a revolving credit agreement in place until November 30, 2021 (which had no borrowings under it other than amounts used for stand-by letters of credit as of March 3, 2018), the ability to continue to meet these cash requirements over the long-term may require access to additional sources of\nfunds, including capital and credit markets. Continuing market volatility, the impact of government intervention in financial markets, and general economic conditions may adversely affect the ability of the Company to access capital and credit markets.\nGlobal economic conditions may also adversely affect the Company's suppliers\u2019 access to capital and liquidity with which to maintain their inventory, production levels, and product quality and to operate their businesses, all of which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s supply chain. Furthermore, the Company's suppliers might reduce their offerings of customer incentives and vendor allowances, cooperative marketing expenditures, and product promotions. Market instability could make it more difficult for the Company and its suppliers to accurately forecast future product demand trends, which could cause the Company to carry too much or too little merchandise in various product categories. Current, recent past, and future financial and economic conditions may also adversely affect landlords and real estate developers of retail space, which may limit the availability of attractive leased store locations. Current, recent past, and future conditions may also adversely affect the Company\u2019s pricing and liquidation strategy.\nThe Company\u2019s business faces a great deal of competitive pressure.\nThe athletic shoe, apparel, and accessory business is highly competitive. The Company competes for customers, customer service professionals, management and other qualified personnel, locations, merchandise, services, and other important aspects of its business with many other local, regional, and national retailers, as well as many of its own suppliers. Those competitors, some of whom have a greater market presence than the Company, include traditional brick and mortar store-based retailers, Internet and digital businesses, and other forms of retail commerce. A factor in the Company\u2019s success is its ability to differentiate itself from its competitors. Unanticipated changes in the pricing and other practices of those competitors may adversely affect the Company\u2019s performance. The Company cannot guarantee that it will be able to compete successfully against current and/or future companies within its industry and market space.\nThe Company may experience fluctuations in results of operations due to seasonality of the business.\nThe Company\u2019s business is subject to seasonal influences, with a major portion of sales and income historically realized during the second and fourth quarters of the fiscal year, which include the back-to-school and holiday seasons, respectively. This seasonality causes operating results to vary considerably from quarter to quarter and could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s results and stock price. In addition, comparable sales are subject to significant fluctuation, on a monthly, quarterly, and annual basis, and the Company anticipates this fluctuation to continue in the future.\nThe Company\u2019s business is dependent on consumer preferences, fashion trends, and successful management of inventory.\nThe athletic footwear and softgoods industry is subject to changing fashion trends and consumer preferences. The Company cannot guarantee that its merchandise selection will accurately reflect customer preferences when it is offered for sale or that the Company will be able to identify and respond quickly to fashion trends and changes, particularly given the long lead times for ordering much of the Company\u2019s merchandise from suppliers. For example, merchandise is generally ordered six to nine months prior to delivery to stores/shops. Sufficient inventory levels must be maintained for the Company to operate its business successfully. However, the Company must concurrently guard against accumulating excess or irrelevant inventory. If the Company fails to accurately anticipate either the market for merchandise or customers\u2019 purchasing habits, the Company may be forced to rely on markdowns, promotional sales, or product liquidation to dispose of excess, irrelevant, and/or slow moving inventory, which may adversely affect performance and results.\nThe Company\u2019s business may be adversely affected by changes in merchandise sourcing.\nThe Company\u2019s suppliers must comply with applicable laws and required standards of conduct. The ability to find qualified suppliers and access products in a timely and efficient manner can be a challenge, especially with respect to goods sourced outside the United States. Political or financial instability, supplier employment relations, trade restrictions, tariffs, currency exchange rates, transport capacity and costs, and other factors relating to foreign trade, and the ability to access suitable merchandise on acceptable terms, are beyond the Company\u2019s control and could adversely impact performance and results.\nChanges in relationships with any of the Company\u2019s key suppliers may have an adverse impact on future results.\nThe Company\u2019s business is dependent, to a significant degree, upon the ability to purchase premium brand-name merchandise at competitive prices, including the receipt of volume discounts, cooperative advertising, markdown allowances, and the ability to return merchandise to suppliers. The Company purchased approximately 94% of its merchandise in fiscal 2018 from its top five suppliers and expects to continue to obtain a significant percentage of its product from these suppliers in future periods. Approximately 66% of merchandise was purchased from one vendor (Nike). The inability to obtain merchandise in a timely manner from major suppliers (particularly Nike) as a result of business decisions by suppliers or disruptions in the\nglobal transportation network such as a port strike, weather conditions, work stoppages, or other labor unrest could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, and results of operations of the Company. Because of the strong dependence on Nike, any adverse development in Nike\u2019s distribution strategy, financial condition, or results of operations or the inability of Nike to develop and manufacture products that appeal to the Company\u2019s target customers could also have an adverse effect on the business, financial condition, and results of operations of the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are primarily dependent on a single distribution center, and the loss of, or disruption in, the distribution center and other factors affecting the distribution of merchandise could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and operations.\nThe distribution functions for the Company are primarily handled from a single facility in Indianapolis, Indiana. Any significant interruption in the operation of the distribution center due to natural disasters, accidents, system issues or failures, or other unforeseen causes could delay or impair the ability to distribute merchandise to stores/shops and/or fulfill orders originating from any of its e-commerce sites, which could cause sales to decline.\nThe Company depends upon third-party carriers for shipment of a significant amount of merchandise to both its stores/shops and directly to its consumers. An interruption in service by these third-party carriers for any reason could cause temporary disruptions in business, a loss of sales and profits, and other material adverse effects.\nFreight costs are impacted by changes in fuel prices through surcharges, among other factors. Fuel prices and surcharges affect freight costs both on inbound freight from suppliers to the distribution center as well as outbound freight from the distribution center to stores/shops, supplier returns and third party liquidators, and shipments of product to customers. Increases in fuel prices, surcharges, and other potential factors may increase freight costs.\nThe Company may need to record significant non-cash impairment charges if its long-lived assets become impaired.\nThe Company reviews its property and equipment, including software and software development costs, when events, which include making decisions that strategically change the intended use of such assets, indicate that their carrying value may be impaired. If an impairment trigger is identified, the carrying value is compared to its estimated fair value and provisions for impairment are recorded as appropriate.\nImpairment losses are significantly affected by estimates of future operating cash flows and estimates of fair value. Estimates of future operating cash flows are identified from strategic long-term plans, which are based upon experience, knowledge, and expectations; however, these estimates can be affected by such factors as future operating results, future store/shop profitability, and future economic conditions, all of which can be difficult to predict accurately. Any significant deterioration in macroeconomic conditions could affect the fair value of the Company's long-lived assets and could result in future impairment charges, which would adversely affect its results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s business may be adversely affected by the failure to identify and obtain suitable store locations and acceptable lease terms.\nTo take advantage of customer traffic and shopping preferences, the Company needs to obtain and retain stores in desirable locations, such as in regional and neighborhood malls anchored by major department stores. The Company cannot be certain that desirable mall or other locations will continue to be available. Several large landlords dominate the ownership of prime malls in the United States and because of the dependence upon these landlords for a substantial number of the Company\u2019s store locations, any significant erosion of the relationships with these landlords or their financial condition would negatively affect its ability to obtain and retain locations. Additionally, further landlord consolidation may negatively affect the Company's ability to obtain and retain store locations at acceptable lease terms. The Company\u2019s average remaining store lease term is relatively short. Due to the short-term nature, the Company is subject to potential market changes, which could increase occupancy costs and adversely affect profitability.\nThe Company\u2019s future results may be adversely affected if it is unable to implement its strategic plan and growth initiatives.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to succeed in its strategic plan and growth initiatives could require significant capital investment and management attention, which may result in the diversion of these resources from the core business and other business issues and opportunities. Additionally, any new initiative is subject to certain risks, including customer acceptance, competition, ramp up time, product differentiation, challenges to economies of scale in merchandise sourcing, and/or the ability to attract and retain qualified management and other personnel. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to develop and successfully implement its strategic plan and growth initiatives to a point where they will become and/or continue to be profitable or generate positive cash flow. If the Company cannot successfully execute its strategic plan and growth initiatives, the Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations may be adversely impacted.\nChanges in labor conditions, as well as the Company\u2019s inability to attract and retain the talent required for the business, may negatively affect operating results.\nFuture performance will depend upon the Company\u2019s ability to attract, retain, and motivate qualified employees, including store personnel, field management, senior management, and other key personnel. Many store/shop sales associates are in entry level or part-time positions with historically high rates of turnover. The ability to meet the Company\u2019s labor needs while controlling costs is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates, health care and minimum wage legislation, and changing demographics. If the Company is unable to attract and retain quality sales associates, management, and other key personnel, the ability to meet growth goals or to sustain expected levels of profitability may be compromised. In addition, a large number of the Company\u2019s store employees are paid the prevailing minimum wage, which if increased would negatively affect profitability and could, if the increase were material, require the Company to adjust its business strategy, which may include the closure of less profitable and/or under-performing stores. Although none of the Company\u2019s employees are currently covered under collective bargaining agreements, the Company cannot guarantee that employees will not elect to be represented by labor unions in the future. If some, or all, of the Company\u2019s workforce were to become unionized and collective bargaining agreement terms were significantly different from the Company\u2019s current compensation arrangements or work practices, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nBecause the Company\u2019s stock price may be volatile, it could experience substantial declines.\nThe market price of the Company\u2019s common stock has historically experienced and may continue to experience volatility. The Company\u2019s quarterly operating results, changes in general conditions in the economy or the financial markets, and other developments affecting the Company, its key suppliers, or competitors, could cause the market price of the Company\u2019s common stock to fluctuate substantially. Although the U.S. broader stock market has experienced sustained price increases in recent years, significant stock price and volume fluctuations may return depending on national and international macroeconomic factors, changes in monetary policy, or other factors. This volatility would likely affect the market prices of securities issued by many companies, often for reasons unrelated to their operating performance, and may adversely affect the price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThe Company cannot provide any guaranty of future dividend payments or that it will continue to repurchase stock pursuant to its share repurchase program.\nThe Board determines if it is in the best interest of the Company to pay a dividend to its shareholders and the amount of any dividend, and declares all dividend payments. There is no assurance that the Board will continue to declare dividends in the future or that the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition will allow for a dividend to be declared. The Company\u2019s current share repurchase program, as amended, authorizes the purchase of 5 million shares of the Company\u2019s common stock (of which 4.5 million shares were available as of March 3, 2018) through December 31, 2019. However, the Company is not obligated to make any purchases under the share repurchase program and the program may be discontinued at any time.\nA security breach of the Company\u2019s information technology systems could damage the Company\u2019s reputation and have an adverse effect on operations and results.\nThe Company accepts electronic credit and debit payment cards from customers. The Company also receives and maintains certain personal information about customers and employees. A number of retailers have experienced security breaches in which credit and debit card and other sensitive information has been stolen or compromised. While the Company has taken significant steps to prevent the occurrence of security breaches in this respect, the Company may, in the future, become subject to claims for purportedly fraudulent transactions arising out of the theft or compromise of credit or debit card or other information, and may also be subject to lawsuits or other proceedings in the future relating to these types of incidents. Any such proceeding could be a distraction to the Company and cause significant unplanned losses and expenses. If the Company\u2019s security and information systems are compromised, if computer and mobile telephone equipment is lost or stolen, or if employees fail to comply with the applicable laws and regulations and electronic payment card or personal information is obtained by unauthorized persons or used inappropriately or illegally, it could adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation, as well as results of operations, and could result in litigation, the imposition of penalties, or significant expenditures to remediate any damage to persons whose credit card, debit card, or personal information has been compromised. The Company is continuously working to install new, and upgrade its existing, information technology systems and provide employee awareness training around phishing, malware, and other cyber risks to ensure that the Company is protected, to the greatest extent possible, against cyber risks and security breaches. However, there is no guarantee that the Company will not be affected by cyber risks or security breaches.\nA major failure of technology and information systems could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nThe efficient operation of the Company\u2019s business is dependent on technology and information systems. In particular, the Company relies on information systems to effectively manage sales, distribution, supply chain, and merchandise planning and allocation functions. However, the failure of technology and information systems to perform as designed could disrupt the Company\u2019s business and adversely affect sales and profitability. There is the risk that the Company could experience challenges with its information systems due to system implementation issues, which include the replacement of certain management and merchandising systems now and over the next few years, system outages or failures, viruses, cyber extortion, which could lead to denial of service to customers, hackers, or other causes.\nVarious risks associated with digital sales may adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company sells merchandise digitally over the Internet through www.finishline.com and www.macys.com, as well as through mobile commerce at m.finishline.com. The digital operations are subject to numerous risks, including but not limited to, unanticipated operating problems, reliance on third party computer hardware, software, and service providers, system failures, and the need to invest in additional computer and other systems. The digital operations also involve other risks that could have an impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations, including hiring, retention, and training of personnel to conduct the digital operations, diversion of sales from the stores/shops, rapid technological changes, liability for online content, credit and debit card fraud, and risks related to the failure of the computer systems that operate the various websites and related support systems, such as computer viruses, cyber extortion, which could lead to denial of service to customers, telecommunication failures, break-ins, security breaches, and similar disruptions. There can be no assurance that the digital operations will continue to operate effectively, achieve sales and profitability growth, or remain at their current or any anticipated levels.\nThe Company\u2019s business may be adversely affected by regulatory and litigation developments.\nVarious aspects of the Company\u2019s operations are subject to federal, state, or local laws, rules, and regulations, any of which may change from time to time. Sales and results of operations may be adversely affected by new legal requirements, including but not limited to, comprehensive federal health care legislation enacted in 2010, the Fair Labor Standards Act, and attendant regulations. For example, new legislation or regulations may result in increased costs directly for compliance or indirectly to the extent that such requirements increase prices of goods and services because of increased compliance costs. Additionally, the Company is regularly involved in various litigation matters that arise in the ordinary course of doing business. Litigation or regulatory developments could adversely affect the business operations and financial performance of the Company.\nChanges in tax laws and interpretations may affect the Company's earnings negatively.\nOn December 22, 2017, H.R. 1, originally the Tax Cuts & Jobs Act (\u201cthe Tax Act\u201d), was signed into law making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code. Changes include a corporate rate decrease from 35% to 21%, effective January 1, 2018, as well as a variety of other changes including eliminating certain deductions for executive compensation and limiting the deduction for interest.\nIn applying the impacts of the Tax Act, the Company re-measured its deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, which is generally a 21% federal tax rate and its related impacts on the state tax rates. The resulting impact was the recognition of an income tax benefit of $10.1 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2018.\nThe Tax Act is unclear in many respects and could be subject to potential amendments and technical corrections, as well as interpretations and implementing regulations by the U.S. Treasury Department and U.S. Internal Revenue Service, any of which could lessen or increase certain adverse impacts of the legislation. In addition, it is unclear how these U.S. federal income tax changes will affect state and local taxation, which often uses federal taxable income as a starting point for computing state and local tax liabilities.\nAnti-takeover provisions under the Indiana Business Corporation Law and the Company\u2019s Restated Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws may render more difficult the accomplishment of mergers or the assumption of control by a principal shareholder, making more difficult the removal of management.\nCertain provisions of the Indiana Business Corporation Law, specifically the director standards of conduct provision in Section 23-1-35-1, the control share acquisitions provisions in Sections 23-1-42-1 to 23-1-42-11, and the business combination provisions in Sections 23-1-43-1 to 23-1-43-24, and certain provisions of the Company\u2019s Restated Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws, specifically the provisions regarding preferred stock, the provisions requiring a supermajority vote for certain business combinations and certain amendments to the Restated Articles of Incorporation, the provisions requiring approval of certain\ntransactions by the continuing directors, the provisions for a staggered board, and the provisions limiting removal of directors to removal for cause, may have the effect of discouraging an unsolicited attempt by another person or entity to acquire control of the Company. These provisions may make mergers, tender offers, the removal of directors or management, and certain other transactions more difficult or more costly and could discourage or limit shareholder participation in such types of transactions, whether or not such transactions are favored by the majority of the Company\u2019s shareholders. Such provisions also could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of the Company\u2019s common stock. Further, the existence of these anti-takeover measures may cause potential bidders to look elsewhere, rather than initiating merger or acquisition discussions with the Company. Any of these factors could reduce the price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\nThe Company\u2019s shops within department stores operations are reliant on Macy\u2019s.\nThe Company\u2019s shops within department stores use selling space within Macy\u2019s. These shops within department stores are dependent on the Macy\u2019s point of sale and other technological platforms, including those related to www.macys.com. In addition, the Macy\u2019s management team, corporate strategy, labor relations (including unionized Macy\u2019s labor in two large geographic metropolitan regions in the United States), and marketing and advertising campaigns have an effect on the success of the Company\u2019s shops within department stores. The Company has limited influence over these factors, so a strategic shift in any of these factors or a significant disruption in Macy\u2019s business, including Macy\u2019s store closures, could result in deterioration in the operations of the Company\u2019s shops within department stores.\nAdditionally, the Company needs to obtain and retain shops within department stores in desirable locations. The Company cannot be certain that desirable locations will continue to be available because of the dependence upon Macy\u2019s in negotiating the shop locations. Any significant erosion of the relationship with Macy\u2019s or its financial condition could negatively affect the Company's ability to obtain and retain shop locations.\nThe effects of natural disasters, terrorism, acts of war, and public health issues may adversely affect the Company's business.\nNatural disasters, including earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, and tornadoes, may affect the operations of the Company's stores/shops, information systems, and distribution center. In addition, acts of terrorism, acts of war, and military action both in the United States and abroad can have a significant effect on economic conditions and may negatively affect the Company's ability to purchase merchandise from suppliers for sale to its customers. Public health issues, such as the flu, viruses for which there is currently no known cure, or other pandemics, whether occurring in the United States or abroad, could disrupt the Company's operations and result in a significant part of its workforce being unable to operate or maintain its infrastructure or perform other tasks necessary to conduct its business. Additionally, public health issues may disrupt, or have an adverse effect on, the Company's suppliers\u2019 operations or its own operations, customers, and customer demand. The Company's ability to mitigate the adverse impact of these events depends, in part, upon the effectiveness of its disaster preparedness and response planning as well as business continuity planning. However, the Company cannot be certain that its plans will be adequate or implemented properly in the event of an actual disaster. The Company may be required to suspend operations in some or all of its locations, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition, and results of operations. Any significant declines in public safety or uncertainties regarding future economic prospects that affect customer spending habits could have a material adverse effect on customer purchases of the Company's products.\nPotential health care reform efforts under the new administration could significantly affect the Company's business.\nIn 2010, Congress enacted and the President signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the \u201cACA\u201d), which created comprehensive reform to the health care system in the United States. The ACA contains provisions which, among other things, includes guaranteed coverage requirements, establishes health insurance exchanges to facilitate the purchase of qualified health plans, eliminates pre-existing condition exclusions and annual and lifetime maximum limits, restricts the extent to which policies can be rescinded, imposes new and significant taxes on health insurers and health care benefits, and increases the reporting required to comply with the legislation. The ACA remains subject to continuing legislative scrutiny, including efforts by Congress and the new administration to amend or repeal a number of its provisions, as well as administrative actions delaying the effectiveness of key provisions. If the ACA is repealed or substantially modified, or if implementation of certain aspects of the ACA are delayed, such repeal, modification, or delay may impact the Company's business, financial condition, and results of operations. The Company is unable to predict the impact of any repeal, modification, or delay of the ACA at this time.\nLegislative or regulatory initiatives related to global warming and climate change concerns may negatively affect the Company's business.\nThere has been an increasing focus and significant debate on global climate change, including increased attention from regulatory agencies and legislative bodies. The increased focus may lead to new initiatives directed at regulating an array of environmental matters. Legislative, regulatory, or other efforts in the United States to address climate change could result in future increases in taxes or in the cost of transportation and utilities, which could decrease the Company's operating profits and could necessitate additional investments in facilities and equipment. The Company is unable to predict the potential effects that any such future environmental initiatives may have on its business.\nNew accounting guidance or changes in the interpretation or application of existing accounting guidance could adversely affect the Company's financial performance.\nThe implementation of new accounting standards could require certain systems, internal process and other changes that could increase the Company's operating costs, and also could result in changes to its financial statements. In particular, the implementation of accounting standards related to leases, as issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board are requiring the Company to make significant changes to its lease management and other accounting systems, and will result in a material impact to our consolidated financial statements.\nU.S. generally accepted accounting principles and related accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations with regard to a wide range of matters that are relevant to the Company's business involve many subjective assumptions, estimates and judgments by its management. Changes in these rules or their interpretation or changes in underlying assumptions, estimates or judgments by the Company's management could significantly change its reported or expected financial performance.\nOther factors may negatively affect the Company\u2019s business and results.\nThe foregoing list of risk factors is not exhaustive or exclusive. Other factors and unanticipated events could adversely affect the Company and its business and results. The Company does not undertake any obligation to revise any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances that occur after the date the statement is made.", "PERMNO": 77669, "SIC": 5661, "TIC": "FINL"}
