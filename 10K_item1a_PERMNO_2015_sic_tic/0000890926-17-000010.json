{"cik": "890926", "company": "RADIAN GROUP INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-02-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors.\nRadian Guaranty may fail to maintain its eligibility status with the GSEs.\nIn order to be eligible to insure loans purchased by the GSEs, mortgage insurers such as Radian Guaranty must meet the GSEs\u2019 eligibility requirements, or PMIERs, which became effective December 31, 2015. The PMIERs aim to ensure that approved insurers will possess the financial and operational capacity to serve as strong counterparties to the GSEs throughout various market conditions. As a consequence, the PMIERs are comprehensive, covering virtually all aspects of the business of a private mortgage insurer, including internal risk management and quality controls, the relationship between the GSEs and the approved insurer and the approved insurer\u2019s financial condition, as well as extensive requirements related to the conduct and operations of a mortgage insurer\u2019s business. In addition, the PMIERs require private mortgage insurers to obtain the prior consent of the GSEs before taking certain actions. The GSEs have significant discretion under the PMIERs and may amend the PMIERs at any time. If Radian Guaranty is unable to satisfy the requirements set forth in the PMIERs, Freddie Mac and/or Fannie Mae could restrict it from conducting certain types of business with them or take actions that may include not purchasing loans insured by Radian Guaranty.\nThe PMIERs Financial Requirements require that a mortgage insurer\u2019s Available Assets (as defined, these primarily include liquid assets and exclude Unearned Premium Reserves) meet or exceed its Minimum Required Assets (a risk-based minimum required asset amount calculated based on net RIF, and which is intended to approximate the loss exposure based on a variety of criteria that are indicative of credit quality). At December 31, 2016, Radian Guaranty was in compliance with the PMIERs Financial Requirements and had Available Assets under the PMIERs of approximately $4.0 billion, which resulted in an excess or \u201ccushion\u201d of approximately $210.0 million over its Minimum Required Assets of approximately $3.8 billion. Radian Guaranty\u2019s ability to continue to comply with the PMIERs Financial Requirements could be impacted by: (i) the product mix of our NIW and factors affecting the performance of our mortgage insurance business, including our level of defaults, prepayments, the losses we incur on new or existing defaults and the credit characteristics of our mortgage insurance; (ii) the amount of credit that we receive under the PMIERs Financial Requirements for our third-party reinsurance transactions, including our QSR Transactions and our Single Premium QSR Transaction, which credit is subject to periodic review by the GSEs; and (iii) the possibility that the GSEs will increase the capital requirements under the PMIERs Financial Requirements, given that the PMIERs provide for the factors used to determine a mortgage insurer\u2019s Minimum Required Assets to be updated every two years (with the next review scheduled to take place in 2017) or more frequently, as determined by the GSEs, to reflect changes in macroeconomic conditions or loan performance.\nIn December 2016, the GSEs issued interim guidance for the industry that had a negative impact on the amount of PMIERs credit that we receive for our Single Premium QSR Transaction, but also gave credit to certain liquid investments that are readily available to pay claims that previously were not permitted to be included in our Available Assets. Although this interim guidance did not impact Radian Guaranty\u2019s compliance with the PMIERs, there can be no assurance that Radian Guaranty\u2019s compliance with the PMIERs Financial Requirements will not be impacted by future changes in interpretation of the PMIERs.\nCompliance with the PMIERs Financial Requirements could impact our holding company liquidity. If additional cash from Radian Group is required to support Radian Guaranty\u2019s compliance with the PMIERs Financial Requirements, it will leave less liquidity to satisfy Radian Group\u2019s other obligations. Depending on the amount of liquidity that is utilized from Radian Group, we may be required (or may decide) to seek additional capital by incurring additional debt, issuing additional equity, or selling assets, which we may not be able to do on favorable terms, if at all.\nThe PMIERs Financial Requirements are more stringent than previous capital standards and have negatively impacted projected returns on capital throughout the industry. Compliance with the PMIERs Financial Requirements could impact our NIW and further impact our returns to the extent they are revised. In addition, under the PMIERs Financial Requirements there are increased financial requirements for loans with a higher likelihood of default and/or certain credit characteristics, as well as for loans originated after January 1, 2016 that are insured under lender-paid mortgage insurance policies not subject to automatic termination under the HPA. Therefore, if our mix of business includes more loans that are subject to these increased financial requirements, it would increase the amount of Available Assets that Radian Guaranty is required to hold. As a result, depending on the circumstances, we may limit the type and volume of business we are willing to write for certain of our products based on the increased financial requirements associated with certain loans. This could reduce the amount of NIW we write, which could reduce our revenues.\nPart 1 Item 1A. Risk Factors\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nCompliance with the PMIERs has resulted in additional expenses and has required significant time and attention. In addition to the PMIERs Financial Requirements, the PMIERs contain new requirements related to the operations of our mortgage insurance business, including extensive operational requirements in areas such as claim processing, loss mitigation, document retention, underwriting, quality control, reporting and monitoring, among others. These increased operational requirements have resulted in additional expenses and have required substantial time and effort from management and our employees, which we expect will continue.\nCompliance with the PMIERs requires us to seek GSE approval before taking many actions, such as paying dividends, entering into various inter-company agreements and commuting or reinsuring risk, among others. These restrictions could prohibit or delay Radian Guaranty from taking certain actions that would be advantageous to it or its affiliates.\nAlthough we expect Radian Guaranty to retain its eligibility status with the GSEs and to continue to comply with the PMIERs Financial Requirements, we cannot provide assurance that this will occur. Loss of Radian Guaranty\u2019s eligibility status with the GSEs would have an immediate and material adverse impact on the franchise value of our mortgage insurance business and our future prospects, as well as a material negative impact on our future results of operations and financial condition.\nOur insurance subsidiaries are subject to comprehensive state insurance regulations and other requirements, which we may fail to satisfy.\nWe and our insurance subsidiaries are subject to comprehensive, detailed regulation by the insurance regulators in the states where they are licensed to transact business. These regulations are principally designed for the protection of our insurance policyholders rather than for the benefit of investors. Insurance laws vary from state to state, but generally grant broad supervisory powers to examine insurance companies and enforce rules or exercise discretion affecting almost every significant aspect of the insurance business, including the power to revoke or restrict an insurance company\u2019s ability to write new business.\nAmong other matters, the state insurance regulators impose various capital requirements on our insurance subsidiaries. These include risk-to-capital ratios, other risk-based capital measures and surplus requirements that may limit the amount of insurance that our insurance subsidiaries write. Our failure to maintain adequate levels of capital, among other things, could lead to intervention by the various insurance regulatory authorities, which could materially and adversely affect our business, business prospects and financial condition.\nIf Radian Guaranty is not in compliance with a state\u2019s applicable Statutory RBC Requirement, it may be prohibited from writing new business in that state until it is back in compliance or it receives a waiver of, or similar relief from, the requirement. In those states that do not have a Statutory RBC Requirement, it is not clear what actions the applicable state regulators would take if a mortgage insurer fails to meet the Statutory RBC Requirement established by another state. As of December 31, 2016, Radian Guaranty was in compliance with all applicable Statutory RBC Requirements; however, if Radian Guaranty were to fail to meet the Statutory RBC Requirement in one or more states, it could be required to suspend writing business in some or all of the states in which it does business. In addition, the GSEs and our mortgage lending customers may decide not to conduct new business with Radian Guaranty (or may reduce current business levels) or impose restrictions on Radian Guaranty while it was not in compliance. The franchise value of our mortgage insurance business likely would be significantly diminished if we were prohibited from writing new business or restricted in the amount of new business we could write in one or more states.\nRadian Group also may be required to provide capital support for Radian Guaranty and its affiliated insurers if additional capital is required by those subsidiaries pursuant to future changes to insurance laws and regulations. The NAIC is in the process of reviewing the minimum capital and surplus requirements for mortgage insurers and considering changes to the Model Act. While the timing and outcome of this process is not known, in the event the NAIC adopts changes to the Model Act, we expect that the capital requirements in states that adopt the new Model Act may increase as a result of the changes. Although the outcome of this process remains uncertain, we believe that if changes are made to the Model Act it will not result in financial requirements that require greater capital than the level currently required under the PMIERs Financial Requirements.\nPart 1 Item 1A. Risk Factors\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nOur insurance subsidiaries\u2019 premium rates and policy forms are generally subject to regulation in every state in which they are licensed to transact business. These regulations are intended to protect policyholders against the adverse effects of excessive, inadequate or unfairly discriminatory rates and to encourage competition in the insurance marketplace. In most states where our insurance subsidiaries are licensed, premium rates and policy forms must be filed with the state insurance regulatory authority and, in some states, must be approved, before their use. The mortgage insurance industry has always been highly competitive with respect to pricing. In the recent past, the willingness of mortgage insurers to offer reduced pricing (whether through filed or customized rates) led to an increased demand from certain lenders for reduced rate products. We and other mortgage insurers have been subject to inquiries from the Wisconsin Department of Insurance and examination by the California Department of Insurance regarding customized insurance rates and policy form filings. In 2016, the California Department of Insurance issued guidance to the mortgage insurance industry stating that under California law, permissible discounting of mortgage insurance rates must be applied to all similarly situated customers. The current regulatory environment could increase the likelihood that additional regulatory inquiries or examinations may be initiated. The limited flexibility currently provided under existing regulatory requirements with respect to insurance rates makes it more difficult to respond to competitor pricing actions and customer demands in a timely fashion. We could lose business opportunities if we are unable to respond to competitor pricing actions and our customers\u2019 demands in a timely and acceptable manner.\nThe credit performance of our insured portfolio is impacted by macroeconomic conditions and specific events that affect the ability of borrowers to pay their mortgages.\nAs a seller of mortgage credit protection and mortgage and real estate products and services, our results are subject to macroeconomic conditions and specific events that impact the mortgage origination environment and the credit performance of our underlying insured assets. Many of these conditions are beyond our control, including national and regional economic conditions, housing prices, unemployment levels, interest rate changes, the availability of credit and other factors. In general, a deterioration in economic conditions increases the likelihood that borrowers will be unable to satisfy their mortgage obligations and can also adversely affect housing values, which in turn can influence the willingness of borrowers to continue to make mortgage payments despite having the financial resources to do so.\nMortgage defaults also can occur due to a variety of specific events affecting borrowers, including death or illness, divorce or other family problems, unemployment, increases in the interest rates of adjustable rate mortgages, changes in regional economic conditions, a borrower choosing not to pay due to housing value changes that cause the outstanding mortgage amount to exceed the value of a home, or other events. In addition, natural disasters, acts of terrorism, war or other severe conflicts, event-specific economic depressions or other catastrophic events could result in increased defaults due to the impact of such events on the ability of borrowers to satisfy their mortgage obligations and the value of affected homes.\nUnfavorable macroeconomic developments and the other factors cited above could have a material negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe length of time that our mortgage insurance policies remain in force could decline and result in a decrease in our revenue.\nAs of December 31, 2016, 68% of our total primary IIF consists of policies for which we expect to receive premiums in the future, typically through Monthly Premium Policies. As a result, most of our earned premiums are derived from insurance that was written in prior years. The length of time that this insurance remains in force, which we refer to as the Persistency Rate, is a significant determinant of our future revenues. A lower Persistency Rate could reduce our future revenues. The factors affecting the length of time that our insurance remains in force include:\n\u2022\nprevailing mortgage interest rates compared to the mortgage rates on our IIF, which affects the incentive for borrowers to refinance (i.e., lower current interest rates make it more attractive for borrowers to refinance and receive a lower interest rate);\n\u2022\napplicable policies for mortgage insurance cancellation, along with the current value of the homes underlying the mortgages in our IIF;\n\u2022\nthe mix of business we write between Single Premium Policies (for which a lower Persistency Rate has a positive effect on future revenues) and those policies that provide for a premium stream in the future, such as our Monthly Premium Policies (for which a lower Persistency Rate has a negative effect on future revenues);\n\u2022\nthe credit policies of lenders, which may make it more difficult for homeowners to refinance loans; and\n\u2022\neconomic conditions that can affect a borrower\u2019s decision to pay-off a mortgage earlier than required.\nPart 1 Item 1A. Risk Factors\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nIf these or other factors cause the length of time that our policies remain in force to decline, our future revenues could be negatively impacted, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur Loss Mitigation Activity is not expected to mitigate losses to the same extent as in prior years; Loss Mitigation Activity could continue to negatively impact our customer relationships.\nAs part of our claims management process we pursue opportunities to mitigate losses both before and after we receive claims. Following the financial crisis, our Loss Mitigation Activities, such as Rescissions, Claim Denials and Claim Curtailments, increased significantly in response to the poor underwriting, servicer negligence and general non-compliance with our insurance policies that was prevalent in the period leading up to the financial crisis. These Loss Mitigation Activities materially mitigated our paid losses during this period and resulted in a significant reduction in our loss reserves. As our Legacy Portfolio has become a smaller percentage of our overall insured portfolio and mortgage underwriting and servicing have generally improved, there has been a decrease in the amount of Loss Mitigation Activity required with respect to the claims we receive, and we expect this trend to continue. As a result, our future Loss Mitigation Activity is not expected to mitigate our paid losses to the same extent as in prior years.\nIn addition, under the new, uniform master policies developed with the GSEs in 2014, including our 2014 Master Policy for NIW after October 1, 2014, with only limited exceptions, the potential for Loss Mitigation Activity generally is more limited throughout the private mortgage insurance industry. Radian Guaranty also now offers 12-month and 36-month rescission relief programs in accordance with the specified terms and conditions set forth in the new 2014 Master Policy. Further, the FHFA and GSEs have initiated a process to revise the minimum standards for mortgage insurer master policies, including with respect to rescission relief, which we expect may be finalized during the second half of 2017. We expect that these factors will continue to contribute to a reduction in Loss Mitigation Activity.\nOur Loss Mitigation Activities and claims paying practices have resulted in disputes with our customers and in some cases, damaged our relationships with certain customers, resulting in a loss of business. While we have resolved many of these disputes, a risk remains that our Loss Mitigation Activities or claims paying practices could continue to have a negative impact on our relationships with customers or potential customers. Further, disputes with our customers that are not resolved could result in additional arbitration or judicial proceedings beyond those we are currently facing. See \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings.\u201d To the extent that past or future Loss Mitigation Activities or claims paying practices impact our customer relationships, our competitive position could be adversely affected, resulting in the potential loss of business and impacting our results of operations.\nForeclosure prevention and borrower relief programs may not continue to provide us with a material benefit.\nThe federal government and various lenders have adopted programs, such as HARP and HAMP, to modify loans to make them more affordable to borrowers with the goal of reducing the number of foreclosures. While the ultimate success of these loan modification programs will depend on the future re-default rates for loans that have been modified through these programs, we believe these programs have significantly benefited the composition and credit quality of our Legacy Portfolio. HAMP expired in December 2016 and was replaced with the \u201cFlex Modification\u201d program that is expected to become effective in October 2017 and will offer payment relief similar to HAMP. However, we do not expect to continue to materially benefit from these programs in the future because the number of loans remaining in our mortgage insurance portfolio that are eligible to complete a HARP refinance or other loan modification has substantially declined.\nChanges in the charters, business practices, or role of the GSEs in the U.S. housing market generally, could significantly impact our mortgage insurance business.\nOur current business model is highly dependent on the GSEs. The GSEs are the primary beneficiaries of most of our mortgage insurance policies, and they impose eligibility requirements that private mortgage insurers must satisfy to insure loans purchased by the GSEs. The GSEs\u2019 federal charters generally require credit enhancement for low down payment mortgage loans (i.e., a loan amount that exceeds 80% of a home\u2019s value) in order for such loans to be eligible for purchase by them. Lenders generally have used mortgage insurance to satisfy this credit enhancement requirement. As a result, low down payment mortgages purchased by the GSEs generally are insured with private mortgage insurance.\nPart 1 Item 1A. Risk Factors\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nThe GSEs\u2019 business practices may be impacted by their results of operations, as well as by legislative or regulatory changes. Since September 2008, the GSEs have been operating under the conservatorship of the FHFA. With respect to loans purchased by the GSEs, changes in the business practices of the GSEs which can be implemented by the GSEs acting independently or through the FHFA, could negatively impact our mortgage insurance business and financial performance, including changes to:\n\u2022\neligibility requirements for a mortgage insurer to become and remain an approved eligible insurer for the GSEs;\n\u2022\nthe underwriting standards on mortgages they purchase;\n\u2022\npolicies or requirements that may result in a reduction in the number of mortgages they acquire;\n\u2022\nthe national conforming loan limit for mortgages they acquire;\n\u2022\nthe level of mortgage insurance required, including expanding the loans that are eligible for reduced insurance coverage;\n\u2022\nthe terms on which mortgage insurance coverage may be canceled before reaching the cancellation thresholds established by law;\n\u2022\nthe requirements for terms required to be included in master policies for the mortgage insurance policies they acquire;\n\u2022\nthe process for claim payments and requirements for actions to be taken that are intended to avoid or mitigate loss on insured mortgages that are in default;\n\u2022\nthe amount of LLPAs or guarantee fees (which may result in a higher cost to borrowers) that the GSEs charge on loans that require mortgage insurance; and\n\u2022\nthe degree of influence that the GSEs have over a mortgage lender\u2019s selection of the mortgage insurer providing coverage.\nThe FHFA\u2019s 2017 strategic plan for the GSEs calls for the GSEs to transfer a meaningful portion of credit risk, known as \u201ccredit risk transfer,\u201d to the private sector. The mandate for meaningful credit risk transfer builds upon the goals set in each of the last three years for the GSEs to transfer portions of their mortgage credit risk to the private sector by experimenting with different forms of transactions and structures. Since 2013, the GSEs have engaged in roughly $1.3 trillion of risk transfer transactions that occurred after the acquisition of residential mortgage loans (i.e., back-end risk transfer programs). In 2016, we participated in new, front-end credit risk transfer pilot programs developed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. These pilot programs involve participation as part of a panel of mortgage insurance company affiliates in writing credit insurance policies on loans that are to be purchased by the GSEs in the future (i.e., front-end), subject to certain pre-established credit parameters. For additional information about these pilot programs see \u201cItem 1. Business-Mortgage Insurance-Mortgage Insurance Business Overview-Mortgage Insurance Products-Non-Traditional Risk.\u201d We may participate in other credit risk transfer transactions and structures used by the GSEs in the future. It is difficult to predict what other types of transactions and structures may be used. If any of the credit risk transfer transactions and structures were to displace primary loan level, standard levels of mortgage insurance, the amount of insurance we write may be reduced which could negatively impact our franchise value, results of operations and financial condition. As a result, the impact of any credit risk transfer products and transactions implemented by the GSEs is uncertain and hard to predict.\nSince the FHFA was appointed as conservator of the GSEs, there have been a wide range of legislative proposals to reform the U.S. housing finance market, including proposals for GSE reform ranging from some that advocate nearly complete privatization and elimination of the role of the GSEs to others that support a system that combines a federal role with private capital. The future structure of the residential housing finance system remains uncertain, including whether comprehensive housing reform legislation will be adopted and, if so, what form it may ultimately take, and the recent change in administration in the U.S. has increased this uncertainly. It is difficult to predict the impact of any changes on our business. See \u201cItem 1. Business-Regulation-Federal Regulation-Housing Finance Reform.\u201d Although we believe that traditional private mortgage insurance will continue to play an important role in any future housing finance structure, new federal legislation could reduce the level of private mortgage insurance coverage used by the GSEs as credit enhancement, or even eliminate the requirement, which would significantly reduce our available market, diminish the franchise value of our mortgage insurance business and materially and adversely affect our business prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nPart 1 Item 1A. Risk Factors\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nA decrease in the volume of home mortgage originations could result in fewer opportunities for us to write new insurance business.\nThe amount of new business we write depends, among other things, on a steady flow of low down payment mortgages that benefit from our mortgage insurance. The volume of low down payment mortgage originations is impacted by a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nrestrictions on mortgage credit due to changes in lender underwriting standards, more restrictive regulatory requirements such as the required ability-to-pay determination prior to extending credit, and the significantly reduced private securitization market;\n\u2022\nhome mortgage interest rates;\n\u2022\nthe health of the domestic economy generally, as well as specific conditions in regional and local economies;\n\u2022\nhousing affordability;\n\u2022\ntax laws and policies, including the deductibility of mortgage insurance premiums and mortgage interest payments;\n\u2022\npopulation trends, including the rate of household formation;\n\u2022\nthe rate of home price appreciation;\n\u2022\ngovernment housing policy encouraging loans to first-time homebuyers; and\n\u2022\nthe practices of the GSEs, including the extent to which the guaranty fees, LLPAs, credit underwriting guidelines and other business terms provided by the GSEs affect lenders\u2019 willingness to extend credit for low down payment mortgages.\nAlthough for the past several years, mortgage origination volumes have been supported by increased mortgage refinancings as a result of the low interest rate environment, as well as a recovery in the home purchase market, total domestic mortgage originations have decreased significantly from $2.7 trillion in 2006 (pre-dating the housing downturn) to approximately $1.9 trillion in 2016. Most industry experts are predicting that the overall mortgage origination market in 2017 will be lower compared to 2016, largely due to an expected decrease in refinancings as a result of higher interest rates, partially offset by an increase in mortgage origination volume from home purchases. If the overall volume of new mortgage originations continues to decline or remains at reduced levels for a prolonged period of time, we could experience a reduced opportunity to write new insurance business and likely will be subject to increased competition with respect to that opportunity, which could negatively affect our business prospects, results of operations and our financial condition.\nOur NIW and franchise value could decline if we lose business from significant customers.\nOur mortgage insurance business depends on our relationships with our customers. Our customers place insurance with us directly on loans that they originate and they also do business with us indirectly through purchases of loans that already have our mortgage insurance coverage. Our relationships with our customers may influence both the amount of business they do with us directly and also their willingness to continue to approve us as a mortgage insurance provider for loans that they purchase. The loss of business from significant customers could have an adverse effect on the amount of new business we are able to write, and consequently, our franchise value.\nDuring 2016, our top 10 mortgage insurance customers (measured by NIW) were responsible for 31.7% of our primary NIW, as compared to 28.0% in 2015. Although we have taken steps in recent years to diversify our customer base, if we were to lose a significant customer, it is unlikely that the loss could be completely offset by other customers in the near-term, if at all. Some of our lending customers may decide to write business only with a limited number of mortgage insurers or only with certain mortgage insurers, based on their views with respect to an insurer\u2019s pricing, service levels, underwriting guidelines, loss mitigation practices, financial strength or other factors. Alternatively, certain other lending customers have chosen for risk management purposes to diversify and expand the number of mortgage insurers with which they do business, which has negatively affected our level of NIW and market share with those customers. Given that many of our customers currently give us a significant portion of their total mortgage insurance business, it is possible that if there is further diversification it could have a negative impact on our NIW if we are unable to mitigate the market share loss through new customers or increases in business with other customers. Any significant loss in our market share could negatively impact our mortgage insurance franchise, results of operations and financial condition.\nPart 1 Item 1A. Risk Factors\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nOur mortgage insurance business faces intense competition.\nThe U.S. mortgage insurance industry is highly competitive. Our competitors include other private mortgage insurers and governmental agencies, principally the FHA and VA.\nWe compete with other private mortgage insurers that are eligible to write business for the GSEs on the basis of price, underwriting guidelines, customer relationships, reputation, perceived financial strength (including based on credit ratings) and overall service, including services and products that complement our mortgage insurance products and that are offered through our Services business. Overall service competition is based on, among other things, effective and timely delivery of products, timeliness of claims payments, timely and accurate servicing of policies, training, loss mitigation efforts and management and field service expertise.\nPricing has always been competitive in the mortgage insurance industry and, with newer entrants joining the industry, price competition has continued as these companies have sought to gain a greater presence in the market and more established industry participants seek to defend their market share and customer relationships. As a result of this competitive environment, recent pricing trends have included: (i) the use of a spectrum of filed rates to allow for formulaic, risk-based pricing (commonly referred to as \u201cblack-box\u201d pricing); (ii) the use of customized (often discounted) rates on lender-paid, Single Premium Policies and to a limited extent, on borrower-paid Monthly Premium Policies; and (iii) overall reductions in standard filed rates on borrower-paid Monthly Premium Policies. In the recent past, the willingness of mortgage insurers to offer reduced pricing (through filed or customized rates) led to an increased demand from certain lenders for reduced rate products. This further intensified the pricing environment and resulted in new pricing levels (whether through filed or customized rates) by private mortgage insurers in order to avoid risking a potential significant loss in NIW.\nWe monitor various competitive and economic factors while seeking to balance both profitability and market share considerations in developing our pricing and origination strategies. We have taken a disciplined approach to establishing our premium rates and writing a mix of business that we expect to produce our targeted level of returns on a blended basis and an acceptable level of NIW. See \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Results of Operations-Mortgage Insurance-NIW, IIF, RIF.\u201d Although we believe we are well-positioned to compete effectively, our pricing strategy may not be successful. Despite our pricing actions, we may experience returns below our targeted returns and we may lose business to other competitors. There can be no assurance that pricing competition will not intensify further, which could result in a decrease in projected returns for the industry and for Radian Guaranty.\nCertain of our competitors are subsidiaries of larger corporations that may have access to greater amounts of capital and financial resources than we do at a lower cost of capital (including, as a result of tax-advantaged, off-shore reinsurance vehicles) and have better financial strength ratings than we have. As a result, they may be better positioned to compete outside of traditional mortgage insurance, including if the GSEs expand their use of or pursue alternative forms of credit enhancement. In addition, because of the current tax-advantage of being off-shore, certain of our competitors are able to achieve higher rates of return on the NIW they write compared to on-shore mortgage insurers such as Radian Guaranty, which could allow these off-shore competitors to leverage reduced pricing to gain market share, while continuing to achieve acceptable returns on NIW.\nWe also compete with governmental entities, such as the FHA and VA, that typically do not have the same capital requirements or business objectives that we and other private mortgage insurance companies have, and therefore, may have greater financial flexibility in their pricing guidelines and capacity that could put us at a competitive disadvantage. If these entities lower their pricing or alter the terms and conditions of their mortgage insurance or other credit enhancement products in furtherance of political, social or other goals rather than a profit motive, we may be unable to compete in that market effectively, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nBeginning in 2008, the FHA, which historically had not been a significant competitor, substantially increased its share of the mortgage insurance market, including by insuring a number of loans that would meet our current underwriting guidelines, sometimes at a lower monthly cost to the borrower than a loan that carries our mortgage insurance. While the private mortgage insurance industry generally had been recapturing market share from the FHA, in January 2015, the FHA reduced its annual mortgage insurance premium by 50 basis points, which has impacted our competitiveness with respect to certain high-LTV loans to borrowers with FICO scores below 720. Further, on January 9, 2017, the FHA announced another reduction of its annual mortgage insurance premium by 25 basis points. However, before this reduction went into effect, the FHA announced that it was suspending the premium reduction indefinitely. It is unclear whether the reduction will ultimately be canceled or the suspension will be removed. If the suspension is removed it could have a negative effect on our ability to compete with the FHA.\nPart 1 Item 1A. Risk Factors\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nThe FHA may continue to maintain a strong market position and could increase its market position again in the future. Factors that could cause the FHA to remain a significant competitor include:\n\u2022\ngovernmental policy, including further decreases in the pricing of FHA insurance or changes in the terms of such insurance;\n\u2022\ncapital constraints of the private mortgage insurance industry;\n\u2022\nthe tightening by private mortgage insurers of underwriting guidelines based on risk concerns;\n\u2022\nincreases in the LLPAs charged by the GSEs on loans that require mortgage insurance and changes in the amount of guarantee fees for the loans that they acquire (which may result in higher cost to borrowers); and\n\u2022\nthe perceived operational ease of using FHA insurance compared to the products of private mortgage insurers.\nOther private mortgage insurers may seek to regain market share from the FHA or other mortgage insurers by reducing pricing, which could, in turn, improve their competitive position in the industry and negatively impact our level of NIW.\nWe have faced increasing competition from the VA. Based on publicly available information, the VA accounted for 28% of the insurable mortgage market in 2016. We believe that the VA\u2019s market share has generally been increasing because the VA offers 100% LTV loans and charges a one-time funding fee that can be included in the loan amount with no additional monthly expense, and because of an increase in the number of borrowers that are eligible for the VA\u2019s program.\nIn addition, as market conditions change, alternatives to traditional private mortgage insurance may become more prevalent, which could reduce the demand for private mortgage insurance, including:\n\u2022\nlenders and other investors holding mortgages in their portfolio and self-insuring;\n\u2022\nlenders using pass-through vehicles that take on the risk of loss for loans ultimately sold to the GSEs;\n\u2022\nengaging in credit-linked note transactions or other structured risk transfer transactions in the capital markets;\n\u2022\nrisk sharing, risk transfer or using other risk mitigation techniques in conjunction with reduced levels of private mortgage insurance coverage; and\n\u2022\nlenders originating mortgages using \u201cpiggyback\u201d structures to avoid private mortgage insurance, such as a first-lien mortgage with an 80% LTV and a second mortgage with a 10%, 15% or 20% LTV, which could become more attractive because the tax deduction for mortgage insurance premiums has not been renewed beyond the 2016 tax year.\nManaging the competitive environment is extremely challenging given the multitude of various factors discussed above. If we do not appropriately manage the strategic decisions required in this environment, our franchise value, business prospects, results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted.\nOur business depends, in part, on effective and reliable loan servicing.\nWe depend on third-party servicing of the loans that we insure. Dependable servicing is necessary for timely billing and effective loss mitigation opportunities for delinquent or near-delinquent loans. Challenging economic and market conditions following the financial crisis strained the resources of servicers and negatively affected the ability of many servicers to effectively service the loans that we insured. We believe that servicers have improved their operations and standards in recent years; however, it is possible that another period of economic stress and high mortgage defaults could again negatively impact the servicing of our insured loans. Further, servicers are now required to comply with new and more burdensome requirements, procedures and standards for servicing residential mortgages. While these new requirements, which have been instituted by the CFPB and others following the financial crisis, are intended to improve servicing performance, they also impose a high cost of compliance on servicers that may impact their financial condition and their operating effectiveness. If we experience a disruption in the servicing of mortgage loans covered by our insurance policies, this, in turn, could contribute to a rise in defaults and/or claims among those loans, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nPart 1 Item 1A. Risk Factors\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nAn extension in the period of time that a loan remains in our delinquent loan inventory may increase the severity of claims that we ultimately are required to pay.\nHigh levels of defaults and corresponding delays in foreclosures could delay our receipt of claims, resulting in an increase in the period that a loan remains in our delinquent loan inventory, and as a result, the severity of claims that we are ultimately required to pay. Following the financial crisis, the average time that it has taken for us to receive a claim has increased. This is, in part, due to loss mitigation protocols that were established by servicers and also to a significant backlog of foreclosure proceedings in many states, and especially in those states that impose a judicial process for foreclosures. Generally, foreclosure delays do not stop the accrual of interest or affect other expenses on a loan, and unless a loan is cured during such delay, once title to the property ultimately is obtained and a claim is filed, our paid claim amount may include additional interest and expenses, increasing the severity of claims we ultimately are required to pay. While foreclosure timelines have improved in recent years, a portion of our Legacy Portfolio consists of severely delinquent loans. Further, another period of significant economic stress and a high level of defaults could once again delay claims and result in higher levels of severity. Higher levels of severity would increase our incurred losses and could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur success depends on our ability to assess and manage our underwriting risks; the premiums we charge may not be adequate to compensate us for our liability for losses and the amount of capital we are required to hold against our insured risks. We expect to incur future provisions for losses beyond what we have reserved for in our financial statements.\nThe estimates and expectations we use to establish premium rates are based on assumptions made at the time our insurance is written. Our mortgage insurance premiums are based on, among other items, the amount of capital we are required to hold against our insured risks and our estimates of the long-term risk of claims on insured loans. Our premium rates take into account, among other factors, LTV, type (e.g., prime vs. non-prime or fixed vs. variable payments), premium structure (e.g., single lump sum, monthly or other variations), term, coverage percentage and whether there is a deductible in front of our loss position. These assumptions may ultimately prove to be inaccurate.\nWe generally cannot cancel or elect not to renew the mortgage insurance we provide, and because we generally fix premium rates for the life of a policy when issued, we cannot adjust renewal premiums or otherwise adjust premiums during the life of a policy. Therefore, if the risk underlying a mortgage loan we have insured develops more adversely than we anticipated, we generally cannot increase the premium rates on this in-force business, or cancel coverage or elect not to renew coverage, to mitigate the effects of such adverse developments. Similarly, if the amount of capital we are required to hold against our insured risks increases from the amount we were required to hold at the time a policy was written (as occurred when the PMIERs Financial Requirements became effective and could occur again if the GSEs impose more burdensome capital requirements as part of their periodic review of the PMIERs Financial Requirements), we cannot adjust the premiums to compensate for this. As a result, if we are unable to compensate for or offset the increased capital requirements in other ways, the returns on our business may be lower than we assumed or expected. Our premiums earned and the associated investment income on those premiums may ultimately prove to be inadequate to compensate for the losses that we may incur and may not provide an adequate return on increased capital that may be required. As a result, our results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted.\nAdditionally, in accordance with industry practice, we do not establish reserves in our mortgage insurance business until we are notified that a borrower has failed to make at least two monthly payments when due. Because our mortgage insurance reserving does not account for the impact of future losses that we expect to incur with respect to performing (non-defaulted) loans, our obligation for ultimate losses that we expect to incur at any period end is not reflected in our financial statements, except to the extent that a premium deficiency exists. As a result, our losses can be more severe in periods of high-defaults given that we generally are not permitted to establish reserves in anticipation of such defaults.\nIf the estimates we use in establishing loss reserves are incorrect, we may be required to take unexpected charges to income, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe establish loss reserves in our mortgage insurance business to provide for the estimated cost of future claims on defaulted loans. Setting our loss reserves requires significant judgment by management with respect to the likelihood, magnitude and timing of each potential loss, including an estimate of the impact of our Loss Mitigation Activities with respect to defaulted loans. The models, assumptions and estimates we use to establish loss reserves may not prove to be accurate, especially in the event of an extended economic downturn or a period of extreme market volatility and uncertainty. Because our reserves represent our best estimate of claims to be paid in the future, claims paid may be substantially different than our loss reserves and these reserves may be insufficient to satisfy the full amount of claims that we ultimately have to pay. Changes to our estimates could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nPart 1 Item 1A. Risk Factors\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nWe have a number of defaulted loans in our Legacy Portfolio that have been in default for an extended period of time. While these loans are generally assigned a higher loss reserve based on our belief that they are more likely to result in a claim, we also assume, based on historical trends, that a significant portion of these loans will cure or otherwise not result in a claim. Given the significant period of time that these loans have been in default, it is possible that the ultimate cure rate for these defaulted loans will be less than our current estimates of Cures for this inventory of defaults. If our estimates are inadequate, we may be required to increase our reserves, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur delegated underwriting program may subject our mortgage insurance business to unanticipated claims.\nIn our mortgage insurance business, we permit lenders to obtain mortgage insurance for residential mortgage loans originated and underwritten by them using Radian\u2019s pre-established underwriting guidelines. Once we accept a lender into our delegated underwriting program, we generally insure a mortgage loan originated by that lender based on our expectation that the lender has followed our specified underwriting guidelines in accordance with the endorsement. Under this program, a lender could commit us to insure a material number of loans with unacceptable risk profiles before we discover the problem and terminate that lender\u2019s delegated underwriting authority or pursue other rights that may be available to us, such as our rights to rescind coverage or deny claims.\nWe face risks associated with our contract underwriting business.\nWe provide third party contract underwriting services for both our mortgage insurance and Services customers. We provide these customers with limited indemnification rights with respect to those loans that we simultaneously underwrite for both secondary market compliance and for potential mortgage insurance eligibility. In addition, in certain limited circumstances, we may also offer limited indemnification when we underwrite a loan only for secondary market compliance. As a consequence, our results of operations could be negatively impacted if we are required to indemnify our customers for material underwriting errors in our contract underwriting services.\nOur current insurance financial strength ratings assigned to our mortgage insurance subsidiaries could weaken our competitive position.\nThe current financial strength ratings for Radian Guaranty are Baa3 by Moody\u2019s and BBB by S&P. Radian Guaranty\u2019s financial strength ratings currently are investment grade, and although they are below the ratings assigned to certain other private mortgage insurers, we have been successful in competing in the private mortgage insurance market, and we do not believe our ratings have had a material adverse effect on our relationships with existing customers. To the extent this changes, however, and financial strength ratings become a more prominent consideration for lenders, we may be competitively disadvantaged by customers choosing to do business with private mortgage insurers that have higher financial strength ratings. In addition, the current PMIERs do not include a specific ratings requirement, but if this were to change in the future or if the GSEs were to place an emphasis on ratings with respect to considering forms of credit enhancement other than traditional mortgage insurance, we may become subject to a ratings requirement in order to retain our GSE eligibility status or to compete effectively with respect to such other forms of execution.\nWe believe that financial strength ratings remain a significant consideration for participants seeking to secure credit enhancement in the non-GSE mortgage market, which includes most non-QM loans. While this market has remained limited since the financial crisis, we view this market as an area of potential future growth and our ability to participate in this market could depend on our ability to secure higher ratings for our mortgage insurance subsidiaries. In addition, if legislative or regulatory changes were to alter the current state of the housing finance industry such that the GSEs no longer operated in their current capacity, we may be forced to compete in a new marketplace in which financial strength ratings may play a greater role. If we are unable to compete effectively in the current or any future markets as a result of the financial strength ratings assigned to our mortgage insurance subsidiaries, the franchise value and future prospects for our mortgage insurance business could be negatively affected.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to manage risks in our investment portfolio.\nOur investment portfolio is an important source of revenue. Although our investment portfolio consists mostly of highly-rated investments, our investment strategy is affected by general economic conditions, which may adversely affect the markets for credit and interest-rate-sensitive securities, including the extent and timing of investor participation in these markets, the level and volatility of interest rates and, consequently, the value of our fixed-income securities, and as such, we may not achieve our investment objectives. Volatility or lack of liquidity in the markets in which we hold positions has at times reduced the market value of some of our investments, and if this worsens substantially it could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nPart 1 Item 1A. Risk Factors\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nCompared to historical averages, interest rates and investment yields on our investments generally have declined in recent years, which has reduced the investment income we generate. For the significant portion of our investment portfolio held by our insurance subsidiaries, to receive full capital credit under insurance regulatory requirements and under the PMIERs, we generally are limited to investing in highly-rated investments that are unlikely to increase our investment returns. Because we depend on our investments as a source of revenue, a prolonged period of lower than expected investment yields would have an adverse impact on our revenues and could potentially adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn addition, we structure our investment portfolio to satisfy our expected liabilities, including claim payments in our mortgage insurance business. If we underestimate our liabilities or improperly structure our investments to meet these liabilities, we could have unexpected losses resulting from the forced liquidation of investments before their maturity, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nRadian Group\u2019s sources of liquidity may be insufficient to fund its obligations.\nRadian Group serves as the holding company for our operating subsidiaries and does not have any significant operations of its own. As of December 31, 2016, Radian Group held, either directly or through unregulated subsidiaries, unrestricted cash and liquid investments of approximately $460 million, excluding certain additional cash and liquid investments that have been advanced from our subsidiaries for corporate expenses and interest payments. Of this amount, $110.1 million was used in January 2017 to redeem our remaining Convertible Senior Notes due 2019. See Note 21 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRadian Group\u2019s principal liquidity demands for the next 12 months are expected to include: (i) the payment of $22.2 million principal amount to settle our obligations under our Convertible Senior Notes due 2017 which must be settled in cash in November 2017, plus any related conversion premium which may, at our option, be settled in cash, common shares or a combination thereof; (ii) the payment of corporate expenses; (iii) interest payments on our outstanding long-term debt; and (iv) the payment of dividends on our common stock. Substantially all of Radian Group\u2019s obligations to pay corporate expenses and interest payments on outstanding debt are reimbursed to Radian Group through the expense-sharing arrangements currently in place with its subsidiaries.\nRadian Group\u2019s liquidity demands for the next 12 months could also include: (i) the repurchase of up to $125 million of Radian Group common stock pursuant to the existing share repurchase program; (ii) capital support for Radian Guaranty and our other mortgage insurance subsidiaries if additional capital is required pursuant to future changes to the PMIERs Financial Requirements or insurance laws and regulations, or reinterpretations of existing requirements; (iii) additional conversion settlements, repurchases or early redemptions of portions of our long-term debt; (iv) potential investments to support our strategy of growing our businesses; and (v) potential payments to the U.S. Treasury resulting from our ongoing dispute with the IRS relating to the examination of our 2000 through 2007 consolidated federal income tax returns.\nIn addition to existing available cash and marketable securities, Radian Group\u2019s principal sources of cash to fund future short-term liquidity needs include: (i) payments made to Radian Group under tax- and expense-sharing arrangements with our subsidiaries and (ii) to the extent available, potential dividends from our Services segment, if any, in excess of payments due under tax-and expense-sharing arrangements.\nThe Services segment did not generate sufficient cash flows to pay ordinary dividends to Radian Group in 2016. Additionally, while cash flow is expected to be sufficient to pay the Services segment\u2019s direct operating expenses, it has not been sufficient to satisfy its obligations to reimburse Radian Group its allocated operating expense and interest expense under tax- and expense-sharing arrangements. We expect the Services segment will be able to bring its reimbursement obligations current in the next four to five years. These reimbursement obligations and future potential dividend payments would be adversely affected if unanticipated events and circumstances were to result in lower earnings than expected. Further, in light of Radian Guaranty\u2019s negative unassigned surplus related to operating losses in prior periods, we do not anticipate that Radian Guaranty will be permitted under applicable insurance laws to pay ordinary dividends to Radian Group for the foreseeable future. The expense-sharing arrangements between Radian Group and our insurance subsidiaries, as amended, have been approved by the Pennsylvania Insurance Department, but such approval may be modified or revoked at any time.\nRadian Group\u2019s liquidity demands beyond the next 12 months are expected to include: (i) the repayment of our outstanding long-term debt; and (ii) potential additional capital contributions to our subsidiaries. We expect to meet the long-term liquidity needs of Radian Group with a combination of: (i) available cash and marketable securities; (ii) private or public issuances of debt or equity securities, which we may not be able to do on favorable terms, if at all; (iii) cash received under tax- and expense-sharing arrangements with our subsidiaries; and (iv) to the extent available, dividends from our subsidiaries.\nPart 1 Item 1A. Risk Factors\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nIn light of Radian Group\u2019s long- and short-term needs, it is possible that our sources of liquidity could be insufficient to fund our obligations and could exceed currently available holding company funds. If this were to occur, we may need or otherwise may decide to increase our available liquidity by incurring additional debt, by issuing additional equity or by selling assets, any of which we may be unable to do on favorable terms, if at all.\nOur reported earnings are subject to fluctuations based on changes in our trading securities and short-term investments that require us to adjust their fair market value.\nWe have significant holdings of trading securities and short-term investments that we carry at fair value. Because the changes in fair value of these financial instruments are reflected on our statements of operations each period, they affect our reported earnings and can create earnings volatility. Among other factors, interest rate changes, market volatility and declines in the value of underlying collateral will impact the value of our investments, potentially resulting in unrealized losses that could negatively impact our results of operations.\nOur information technology systems may fail or become outmoded, be temporarily interrupted or otherwise cause us to be unable to meet our customers\u2019 demands.\nOur business is highly dependent on the effective operation of our information technology systems, which are vulnerable to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, cyber-attacks, security breaches, catastrophic events and errors in usage. Although we have disaster recovery and business continuity plans in place, we may not be able to adequately execute these plans in a timely fashion.\nAdditionally, our ability to meet the needs of our customers depends on our ability to keep pace with technological advances and to invest in new technology as it becomes available or otherwise upgrade our technological capabilities. Participants in the mortgage insurance industry rely on e-commerce and other technologies to provide their products and services, and our customers generally require that we provide an increasing number of our products and services electronically. Accordingly, we may not satisfy our customers\u2019 requirements if we fail to invest sufficient resources or are otherwise unable to maintain and upgrade our technological capabilities. Further, customers may choose to do business only with mortgage insurers with which they are technologically compatible and may choose to retain existing mortgage insurance providers rather than invest the time and resources to on-board new providers. As a result, technology can represent a potential barrier to signing new customers.\nBecause we rely on our information technology systems for many critical functions, including connecting with our customers, if such systems were to fail, experience a prolonged interruption, or become outmoded, we may experience a significant disruption in our operations and in the business we receive, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIn addition, we are in the process of implementing a major technology project to improve our operating systems, including a new platform for our mortgage insurance underwriting, policy administration, claims management and billing processes. The implementation of these technological improvements is complex, expensive, time consuming and, in certain respects, depends on the ability of third parties to perform their obligations in a timely manner. If we fail to timely and successfully implement the new technology systems and business processes, or if the systems do not operate as expected, it could have an adverse impact on our business, business prospects and results of operations.\nThe security of our information technology systems may be compromised and confidential information, including non-public personal information that we maintain, could be improperly disclosed.\nOur information technology systems may be vulnerable to physical or electronic intrusions, computer viruses or other attacks. As part of our business, we, and certain of our subsidiaries and affiliates, maintain large amounts of confidential information, including non-public personal information on consumers and our employees. Breaches in security could result in the loss or misuse of this information, which could, in turn, result in potential regulatory actions or litigation, including material claims for damages, as well as interruption to our operations and damage to our reputation. While we have information security policies and systems in place in order to attempt to prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential information, including non-public personal information, there can be no assurance that such use or disclosure will not occur. Any compromise of the security of our information technology systems, or unauthorized use or disclosure of confidential information, could subject us to liability, regulatory scrutiny and action, damage to our reputation and customer relationships and could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nPart 1 Item 1A. Risk Factors\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nWe are subject to the risk of litigation and regulatory proceedings.\nWe operate in highly regulated industries that are subject to a heightened risk of litigation and regulatory proceedings. We often are a party to material litigation and also are subject to legal and regulatory proceedings and other actions, reviews, audits, inquiries and investigations. Increased scrutiny in the current regulatory environment could lead to new regulations and practices, new interpretations of existing regulations, as well as additional regulatory proceedings. Additional lawsuits, legal and regulatory proceedings and other matters may arise in the future. The outcome of these legal and regulatory proceedings and other matters could result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, injunctions, restitutions or other relief which could require significant expenditures or have a material adverse effect on our business prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nResolution of our dispute with the IRS could adversely affect us.\nWe are contesting adjustments resulting from the examination by the IRS of our 2000 through 2007 consolidated federal income tax returns. The IRS opposes the recognition of certain tax losses and deductions that were generated through our investment in a portfolio of non-economic REMIC residual interests and has proposed denying the associated tax benefits of these items. We appealed these proposed adjustments to Appeals and made \u201cqualified deposits\u201d with the U.S. Treasury of $89 million relating to the 2000 through 2007 tax years to avoid the accrual of incremental above-market-rate interest with respect to the proposed adjustments.\nIn September 2014, we received Notices of Deficiency covering the 2000 through 2007 tax years that assert unpaid taxes and penalties of $157 million. The Deficiency Amount has not been reduced to reflect our NOL carryback ability. As of December 31, 2016, there also would be interest of approximately $136 million related to these matters. Depending on the outcome, additional state income taxes, penalties and interest (estimated in the aggregate to be approximately $35 million as of December 31, 2016) also may become due when a final resolution is reached. The Notices of Deficiency also reflected additional amounts due of $105 million, which are primarily associated with the disallowance of the previously filed carryback of our 2008 NOL to the 2006 and 2007 tax years. We believe that the disallowance of our 2008 NOL carryback is a precautionary position by the IRS and that we will ultimately maintain the benefit of this NOL carryback claim.\nOn December 3, 2014, we petitioned the Tax Court to litigate the Deficiency Amount. During 2016, we held several meetings with the IRS in an attempt to reach a compromised settlement on the issues presented in our dispute. In January 2017, the parties informed the Tax Court that they believe they have reached a basis for a compromised settlement on the primary issues present in the case. The resolution must be reported to the JCT for review and cannot be finalized until the IRS considers the views, if any, expressed by the JCT about the matter. If we are unable to complete a compromised settlement, then the ongoing litigation could take several years to resolve and may result in substantial legal expenses. We can provide no assurance regarding the outcome of any such litigation or whether a compromised settlement with the IRS will ultimately be reached. We currently believe that an adequate provision for income taxes has been made for the potential liabilities that may result from this matter. However, if the ultimate resolution of this matter produces a result that differs materially from our current expectations, there could be a material impact on our effective tax rate, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nOur ability to recognize benefits from our NOLs and other tax attributes may be limited.\nWe have generated substantial NOLs and other tax attributes for tax purposes that can be used to reduce our future income tax obligations. Our ability to utilize these tax assets (including federal NOL carryforwards of approximately $653.8 million as of December 31, 2016) on a timely basis (i.e., to offset operating income as generated) will be adversely affected if we have an \u201cownership change\u201d within the meaning of Section 382. An ownership change is generally defined as a greater than 50 percentage point increase in equity ownership by \u201cfive-percent shareholders\u201d (as that term is defined for purposes of Section 382) over a rolling three-year period. While we have adopted the tax benefit preservation measures described below to protect our ability to use our NOLs and other tax assets, these measures may not prevent us from experiencing an ownership change, including as a result of the issuance of our common stock. If we experience an ownership change, we may not be able to fully utilize our NOLs and other tax assets, resulting in additional income taxes.\nPart 1 Item 1A. Risk Factors\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nIn 2009, we adopted a Tax Benefit Preservation Plan (the \u201cPlan\u201d), which, as amended, was approved by our stockholders at our 2010, 2013 and 2016 annual meetings. We also adopted certain amendments to our amended and restated bylaws (the \u201cBylaw Amendment\u201d) and at our 2010, 2013 and 2016 annual meetings, our stockholders approved certain amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (the \u201cCharter Amendment\u201d). These steps were taken to protect our ability to utilize our NOLs and other tax assets and to attempt to prevent an \u201cownership change\u201d under U.S. federal income tax rules by discouraging and in most cases restricting certain transfers of our common stock that would: (i) create or result in a person becoming a five-percent shareholder under Section 382 or (ii) increase the stock ownership of any existing five-percent shareholder under Section 382. The continued effectiveness of the Plan, the Bylaw Amendment and the Charter Amendment are subject to periodic examination by the Board and the reapproval of the Plan and the Charter Amendment by our stockholders every three years. There can be no assurance that our stockholders will reapprove the Plan and the Charter Amendment if we elect to present them to our stockholders again in the future.\nThere is no guarantee that our tax benefit preservation strategy will be effective in protecting our NOLs and other tax assets. The amount of our NOLs has not been audited or otherwise validated by the IRS. The IRS, or other tax authorities, could challenge the amount of our NOLs and other tax assets, which could result in an increase in our liability in the future for income taxes. In addition, determining whether an \u201cownership change\u201d has occurred is subject to uncertainty, both because of the complexity and ambiguity of Section 382 and because of limitations on a publicly traded company\u2019s knowledge as to the ownership of, and transactions in, its securities. Therefore, even though we currently have several measures in place to protect our NOLs (such as the Plan, the Bylaw Amendment and the Charter Amendment), we cannot provide any assurance that the IRS or other taxing authority will not claim that we have experienced an \u201cownership change\u201d and attempt to reduce the benefit of our tax assets.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our net DTA is $411.8 million. A significant portion of our net DTA relates to the future tax effects of our prior year net operating losses expected to be carried forward to offset future taxable income. A decrease in the federal statutory income tax rate would result in a one-time reduction in the amount at which our DTA is recorded, thereby reducing our net income and book value in that period. However, such a decrease would also reduce our effective income tax rate, thereby increasing net income in future periods. Similarly, changes to the current tax laws, other than a decrease in the federal statutory income tax rate, may also impact our net income and book value.\nLegislation and regulatory changes and interpretations could impact our businesses.\nOur businesses are subject to and may be impacted by many federal and state lending, insurance and consumer laws and regulations and may be affected by changes in these laws and regulations or the way they are interpreted. In particular, our businesses may be significantly impacted by the following:\n\u2022\nLegislation or regulatory action impacting the charters or business practices of the GSEs;\n\u2022\nLegislative reform of the U.S. housing finance system;\n\u2022\nLegislation and regulation impacting the FHA and its competitive position versus private mortgage insurers;\n\u2022\nState insurance laws and regulations that address, among other items, licensing of companies to transact business, claims handling, reinsurance requirements, premium rates, policy forms offered to customers and requirements for Risk-to-capital, minimum policyholder positions, reserves (including contingency reserves), surplus, reinsurance and payment of dividends;\n\u2022\nThe application of state, federal or private sector programs aimed at supporting borrowers and the housing market;\n\u2022\nThe application of RESPA, the FCRA and other laws to our businesses;\n\u2022\nThe amendments to Regulation AB (commonly referred to as Regulation AB II) that were adopted by the SEC and introduce several new requirements related to public offerings of ABS, including public offerings of RMBS for which our Services business traditionally has provided due diligence and servicer surveillance services and new credit rating agency reform rules (the \u201cNRSRO Rules\u201d) adopted by the SEC that include new requirements applicable to providers of third-party due diligence services, such as our Services business, for both publicly and privately issued ABS;\n\u2022\nThe interpretation and application of the TRID rules requiring enhanced disclosures to consumers in connection with the origination of residential mortgage loans;\n\u2022\nNew federal standards and oversight for mortgage insurers, including as a result of the recommendation of the Federal Insurance Office of the U.S. Treasury that federal standards and oversight for mortgage insurers be developed and implemented;\nPart 1 Item 1A. Risk Factors\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\u2022\nThe implementation of new regulations under, or the potential repeal or amendment of provisions of, the Dodd-Frank Act; and\n\u2022\nThe implementation in the U.S. of the Basel III capital adequacy guidelines.\nSee \u201cItem 1. Business-Regulation.\u201d\nAny of the items discussed above could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and business prospects. In addition, our businesses could be impacted by new legislation or regulations, as well as changes to existing legislation or regulations, that are not currently contemplated and which could occur at any time.\nThe implementation of the Basel III guidelines may discourage the use of mortgage insurance.\nOver the past few decades, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision has established international benchmarks for assessing banks\u2019 capital adequacy requirements. Included within those benchmarks are capital standards related to the residential lending and securitization activity and, importantly for mortgage insurance, the treatment of mortgage insurance on those loans. In July 2013, U.S. banking regulators promulgated regulations to implement significant elements of the Basel framework, referred to as \u201cBasel III.\u201d Today, the current capital regime under Basel III for U.S. banks assigns a 50% or 100% risk weight to one- to four-unit residential mortgage exposures. Generally, residential mortgage exposures that are prudently underwritten and performing receive a 50% risk weight, while all other residential mortgage exposures are assigned a 100% risk weight. In March 2015, the U.S. banking regulators clarified that LTV ratios can account for credit enhancement such as private mortgage insurance in determining whether a loan is made in accordance with prudent underwriting standards for purposes of receiving the preferred 50% risk weight.\nIn December 2014, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision issued a proposal for further revisions to Basel III. It proposed adjustments to the risk weights for residential mortgage exposures that take into account LTV and the borrower\u2019s ability to service a mortgage. The proposed LTV ratio did not take into consideration any credit enhancement, including private mortgage insurance. The comment period for this proposal closed in March 2015, and in December 2015, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision released a second proposal that retained the LTV provisions of the initial draft, but not the debt servicing coverage ratios. The comment period for the 2015 proposal closed in March 2016. Following consideration of the comments received, it is possible that newly revised risk weighting guidelines from the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision may be proposed and that the U.S. banking regulators may consider changes to the existing rules. While it remains unclear whether new guidelines will be proposed or finalized, if the federal bank regulators revise their rules to implement Basel III to reduce or eliminate the capital benefit banks receive from insuring low down payment loans with private mortgage insurance, our business and business prospects could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on our management team and our business could be harmed if we are unable to retain qualified personnel or successfully develop and/or recruit their replacements.\nOur success depends, in part, on the skills, working relationships and continued services of our management team and other key personnel, any of whom could terminate his or her relationship with us at any time. The unexpected departure of key personnel could adversely affect the conduct of our business. In such event, we would be required to obtain other personnel to manage and operate our business. In addition, we will be required to replace the knowledge and expertise of our workforce as our workers retire. In either case, there can be no assurance that we would be able to develop or recruit suitable replacements for the departing individuals, that replacements could be hired, if necessary, on terms that are favorable to us, or that we can successfully transition such replacements in a timely manner. Failure to effectively implement our succession planning efforts and to ensure effective transfers of knowledge and smooth transitions involving members of our management team and other key personnel could adversely affect our business and results of operations. Without a properly skilled and experienced workforce, our costs, including productivity costs and costs to replace employees may increase, and this could negatively impact our earnings.\nPart 1 Item 1A. Risk Factors\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________\nWe face risks associated with our acquisition of Clayton and we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the Clayton acquisition.\nAs a result of our acquisition of Clayton and our entry into our Services business, we are exposed to certain risks that may negatively affect our financial results, including, among others, the following:\n\u2022\nOur Services revenue is dependent on a limited number of large customers that represent a significant proportion of our Services total revenues. The loss or reduction of business from one or more of these significant customers could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations. In addition, Radian Guaranty does business with many of these significant customers. In the event of a dispute between a significant customer and either of our business segments, the overall customer relationship for Radian could be negatively impacted.\n\u2022\nWhile Clayton is not a defendant in litigation arising out of the financial crisis involving the issuance of RMBS in connection with which it has provided services, it has been in the past, and may again be in the future, subpoenaed by various parties to provide documents and information related to such litigation, and there can be no assurance that Clayton will not be subject to future claims against it, whether in connection with such litigation or otherwise. It is possible that our exposure to potential liabilities resulting from our Services business, some of which may be material or unknown, could exceed amounts we can recover through indemnification claims.\nAll of our goodwill and other intangible assets relate to our Services segment, as a result of our acquisition of Clayton in 2014 and its subsequent acquisitions of Red Bell and ValuAmerica in 2015. The goodwill in these acquisitions is an asset representing the estimated future economic benefits arising from the assets we have acquired that were not individually identified and separately recognized. Goodwill is deemed to have an indefinite useful life and is subject to review for impairment annually, or more frequently, whenever circumstances indicate potential impairment. The value of goodwill is primarily supported by revenue projections which are mostly driven by projected transaction volume and margins. The fair value of goodwill requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions that are highly subjective in nature, and include in particular, among other items, market-based discount rates, future expected cash flows from estimated transaction volumes that are not currently contracted, assumed potential revenues from new initiatives and business strategies as well as volume projections associated with non-agency RMBS securitizations, for which current market conditions are not favorable. Intangible assets, other than goodwill, primarily consist of customer relationships, technology, trade name and trademarks, client backlog and non-competition agreements.\nOur estimates are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. If actual results differ from our assumptions, we may not realize the full value of our goodwill and other intangible assets. For these and other reasons there can be no assurance that the anticipated benefits from the our acquisition of Clayton will be realized fully or at all. If we fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the Clayton acquisition and its subsequent acquisitions of Red Bell and ValuAmerica, we may not realize the full value of our goodwill and other intangible assets, in which case we may be required to write down or write off all such goodwill and other intangible assets. Such an impairment of our goodwill or intangible assets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 78038, "SIC": 6351, "TIC": "RDN"}
