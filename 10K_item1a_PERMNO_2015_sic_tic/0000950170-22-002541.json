These risk factors could negatively affect our operations, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, and as a result, holders and purchasers of our securities could lose part or all of their investments. It is possible that additional risks relating to our securities may be described in a prospectus if we issue securities in the future.\nRisk Factors Summary\nRisks Related to Our Relationship with Hess\n\u2022We are substantially dependent on Hess and subject to many of the same risks facing Hess.\n\u2022Hess may suspend, reduce or terminate its obligations under our commercial agreements if we fail to perform or if a force majeure event prevents us from performing required services under the applicable agreement.\n\u2022Our success depends, in part, on Hess replacing declining production, and if Hess does not maintain its drilling activities, or if we do not pursue third-party customer contracts, the demand for our services could be reduced.\n\u2022We may not be able to significantly increase our third-party revenues, which could limit our ability to grow and extend our dependence on Hess.\n\u2022The level and terms of Hess\u2019 indebtedness and any reduction in Hess\u2019 credit ratings could adversely affect our business and our ability to obtain credit in the future.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\n\u2022Our business and operations have been and may continue to be adversely affected by COVID-19 and any related reduced demand for oil and natural gas.\n\u2022Any decrease in the volumes of natural gas or crude oil that we handle, including due to competition and seasonal weather conditions in our limited geographic areas, could adversely affect our business.\n\u2022Our operations and Hess\u2019 Bakken production operations are subject to many risks and operational hazards as well as commodity price risks.\n\u2022We do not own all of the land on which certain of the pipelines connecting our facilities are located and utilize contract operator services, which may result in disruptions and increased costs in the future.\n\u2022We have a significant amount of consolidated indebtedness with terms that may restrict our business.\n\u2022We may be unable to make acquisitions on economically acceptable terms from third parties and the completion of capital projects by us are subject to risks and may not result in revenue increases.\n\u2022Terrorist or cyber-attacks and threats could have a material adverse effect on us.\nRegulatory, Legal and Environmental Risks\n\u2022Our assets and operations are subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and safety, including those relating to pipeline integrity, and may become subject to FERC regulation.\n\u2022Evolving environmental laws and regulations, including on crude oil stabilization, transportation, hydraulic fracturing and climate change, could have an adverse effect on our business.\n\u2022Climate change and sustainability initiatives may result in significant operational changes and expenditures, reduced demand for our services and adversely affect our business.\n\u2022We or Hess may be unable to obtain or renew permits or approvals necessary for our respective operations, including our produced water facilities.\n\u2022Certain plant or animal species could be designated as endangered or threatened, which could limit our ability to expand some or limit our customers\u2019 ability to develop new crude oil and natural gas wells.\nRisks Inherent in an Investment in Us\n\u2022We may not generate sufficient distributable cash flow to support the payment of the minimum quarterly distribution to our shareholders.\n\u2022Our general partner and its affiliates, including our Sponsors, have conflicts of interest with us and limited fiduciary duties and they may favor their own interests to our detriment.\n\u2022Our partnership agreement requires that we distribute all of our available cash, which could limit our ability to grow.\n\u2022Our partnership agreement designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for certain types of actions by our shareholders for disputes with us or our general partner\u2019s directors, officers or other employees.\n\u2022Our partnership agreement provides that our shareholders irrevocably waive the right to trial by jury.\n\u2022Our general partner and its affiliates, including our Sponsors, may compete with us and have no obligation to present business opportunities to us.\n\u2022Holders of our Class A Shares have very limited voting rights.\n\u2022Our general partner can transfer its interests and may require our shareholders to sell their Class A Shares at an undesirable time or price.\n\u2022Our partnership agreement restricts the remedies available to shareholders for actions taken by our general partner.\n\u2022Our Sponsors may sell Class A Shares in the public or private markets, and such sales could have an adverse impact on the trading price of the Class A Shares.\n\u2022We may issue an unlimited number of additional equity interests without shareholder approval, including equity interests with preferences senior to the Class A Shares.\n\u2022The NYSE does not require us to comply with certain of its corporate governance requirements.\n\u2022We are treated as a corporation for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes.\nRisks Related to Our Relationship with Hess\nHess currently accounts for substantially all of our revenues. If Hess changes its business strategy, is unable for any reason, including financial or other limitations, to satisfy its obligations under our commercial agreements, our revenues would decline and our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to make distributions to our shareholders could be materially and adversely affected.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, substantially all of our revenues were attributable to our fee-based commercial agreements with Hess, including revenues from third-party volumes delivered under these agreements. We expect that we will continue to derive substantially all of our revenues in the near term under multiple commercial agreements with Hess. Any event, whether in our areas of operation or elsewhere, that materially and adversely affects Hess\u2019 financial condition, results of operations or cash flows may adversely affect its ability to deliver its nominated volumes to us and our ability to sustain or increase cash distributions to our shareholders. Accordingly, we are indirectly subject to the operational and business risks of Hess, the most significant of which include the following:\n\u2022adverse effects of COVID-19;\n\u2022the effects of changing commodity prices and production margins;\n\u2022Hess\u2019 ability to successfully increase its Bakken production;\n\u2022the inherent uncertainties in estimating quantities of proved reserves and the possibility that actual Bakken production may be lower than estimated;\n\u2022Hess\u2019 ability to control decisions made under joint operating agreements and failure of the parties under such agreements to meet their obligations;\n\u2022changing laws and regulations and other governmental actions;\n\u2022substantial capital requirements and Hess\u2019 ability to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms, if at all;\n\u2022political instability in areas where Hess operates that can adversely affect Hess\u2019 business;\n\u2022environmental risks and environmental laws and regulations that can result in significant costs and liabilities;\n\u2022climate change initiatives and changes in attitudes may result in significant operational changes and expenditures, reduced demand for Hess\u2019 products or increased cost of capital for Hess, and adversely affect Hess\u2019 business;\n\u2022highly competitive environment where many of Hess\u2019 competitors are larger and have greater resources and a more diverse portfolio than Hess;\n\u2022catastrophic and other events, whether naturally occurring or man-made, may materially affect Hess\u2019 operations and financial condition;\n\u2022significant time delays between the estimated and actual occurrence of critical events associated with Hess\u2019 development projects may result in material negative economic consequences;\n\u2022departure of key members from Hess\u2019 senior management team, and/or difficulty in recruiting and retaining adequate numbers of experienced technical personnel, could negatively impact Hess\u2019 ability to deliver on its strategic goals;\n\u2022Hess\u2019 dependency on oilfield service companies for items including drilling rigs, equipment, supplies and skilled labor and its ability to secure these services, or a high cost thereof, may result in material negative economic consequences; and\n\u2022disruption, failure or cyber security breaches affecting or targeting computer, telecommunication systems, and infrastructure used by Hess or its business partners that may materially impact Hess\u2019 business and operations.\nHess may suspend, reduce or terminate its obligations under our commercial agreements in certain circumstances, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to make distributions to our shareholders.\nOur commercial agreements with Hess include provisions that permit Hess to suspend or terminate its obligations under the applicable agreement if certain events occur. These events include our failure to perform or comply with a material warranty, covenant or obligation under the applicable commercial agreement following the expiration of a specified cure period. In addition, Hess may suspend or reduce its obligations under our commercial agreements if a force majeure event prevents us from performing required services under the applicable agreement. Hess has the ability to make such decisions notwithstanding the fact that they may significantly and adversely affect us. Any such reduction or suspension or termination of Hess\u2019 obligations would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to make distributions to our shareholders.\nBecause of the natural decline in production from existing wells in our areas of operation, our success depends, in part, on Hess and other producers replacing declining production and also on our ability to secure new sources of natural gas and crude oil. Any decrease in the volumes of natural gas or crude oil that we handle could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nThe natural gas and crude oil volumes that support our business depend on the level of production from natural gas and crude oil wells connected to our facilities, which may be less than expected and will naturally decline over time. As a result, our cash flows associated with these wells will also decline over time. In order to maintain or increase throughput levels at our facilities, Hess and other producers for which we currently or in the future may handle volumes at our facilities must replace declining production, or we must obtain new sources of natural gas and crude oil. The primary factors affecting our ability to obtain non-dedicated sources of natural gas and crude oil include (i) the level of successful drilling activity in our areas of operation, (ii) our ability to compete for volumes from successful new wells and (iii) our ability to compete successfully for volumes from sources connected to other pipelines.\nWe have no control over the level of drilling activity in our areas of operation, the amount of reserves associated with wells connected to our systems or the rate at which production from a well declines. In addition, we have no control over Hess or other producers or their drilling or production decisions, which are affected by, among other things:\n\u2022the availability and cost of capital;\n\u2022prevailing and projected crude oil, natural gas and NGL prices;\n\u2022demand for crude oil, natural gas and NGLs;\n\u2022levels of reserves;\n\u2022geological considerations;\n\u2022environmental or other governmental regulations, including the timely availability of drilling permits and the regulation of hydraulic fracturing and flaring; and\n\u2022the availability of drilling rigs and other costs of production and equipment.\nFluctuations in commodity prices can also greatly affect the development of crude oil and natural gas reserves. Drilling and production activity generally decreases as crude oil and natural gas prices decrease. Declines in crude oil and natural gas prices could have a negative impact on exploration, development and production activity, and if sustained, could lead to a material decrease in such activity. For example, in the second quarter of 2020, as a result of COVID-19 and sharp decline in crude oil prices, Hess reduced its rig count from 6 rigs to 1 rig in the Bakken. In addition, third parties in the Bakken also curtailed production and reduced drilling activity. Hess operated 3 rigs in the Bakken at the end of 2021; however, total Bakken rig count continues to fluctuate. Sustained reductions in exploration or production activity in our areas of operation could lead to reduced utilization of our assets.\nBecause of these and other factors, even if crude oil and natural gas reserves are known to exist in areas served by our assets, producers may choose not to develop those reserves. If reductions in drilling activity result in our inability to maintain the current levels of throughput on our systems, those reductions could reduce our revenues and cash flow and adversely affect our ability to make cash distributions to our shareholders.\nFurthermore, produced water disposal services that we provide to Hess and any other customers assist in their drilling activities. If Hess does not maintain its drilling activities, its demand for our produced water disposal services will be reduced regardless of whether we continue to provide other midstream services for their production, and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to significantly increase our third-party revenues due to competition and other factors, which could limit our ability to grow and extend our dependence on Hess.\nPart of our growth strategy includes diversifying our customer base by identifying opportunities to offer services to third parties with our existing assets or by constructing or acquiring new assets independently from Hess. Our ability to increase our third-party revenues is subject to numerous factors beyond our control, including prevailing commodity prices, competition from third parties and the extent to which we lack available capacity when third-party customers require it. For example, the decline in crude oil prices in the second quarter of 2020 as a result of COVID-19 caused producers to reduce exploration, development and production activities, which resulted in a decrease in third-party volumes available to be handled by our assets. In addition, our natural gas and crude oil gathering systems and processing plants are subject to competition from existing and future third-party natural gas and crude oil gathering systems and natural gas processing and fractionation plants in the Bakken, while our terminals and crude oil rail cars compete with third-party terminals, pipelines and crude oil rail cars for available third-party volumes. To the extent that we have available capacity on our gathering systems, at TGP or LM4 for third-party volumes, we may not be able to compete effectively with third-party gathering systems or processing plants for additional natural gas production in the area. To the extent that we have available capacity at our terminals or crude oil rail cars for third-party volumes, competition from other existing or future terminals or crude oil rail cars owned by third parties may limit our ability to utilize this available capacity.\nWe have historically provided midstream services to third parties on only a limited basis, and we can provide no assurance that we will be able to attract any material third-party service opportunities. Our efforts to attract new unaffiliated customers may be adversely affected by our relationship with Hess and our desire to provide services pursuant to fee-based contracts. Our potential customers may prefer to obtain services under other forms of contractual arrangements under which we would be required to assume direct commodity exposure.\nThe level and terms of our and Hess\u2019 indebtedness and any reduction in Hess\u2019 credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to grow our business and our ability to make cash distributions to our shareholders. Our ability to obtain credit in the future may also be adversely affected by the credit ratings of Hess.\nWe and Hess must devote a portion of our cash flows from operating activities to service our respective indebtedness, and therefore cash flows may not be available for use in pursuing our and Hess\u2019 growth strategy. Furthermore, a higher level of indebtedness at Hess in the future would increase the risk that it may default on its obligations to us under our commercial agreements. As of December 31, 2021, Hess had total consolidated indebtedness of approximately $8.5 billion, including our indebtedness of $2.6 billion, which is non-recourse to Hess.\nTwo of the three major credit rating agencies that rate Hess\u2019 debt have assigned Hess an investment grade rating. If these credit ratings are lowered in the future, the interest rate and fees Hess pays on its credit facilities may increase. Credit rating agencies may consider Hess\u2019 debt ratings when assigning ours because of its ownership interest in us, the significant commercial relationships between Hess and us, and our reliance on commercial agreements with Hess for substantially all of our revenues. If one or more credit rating agencies were to downgrade the outstanding indebtedness of Hess, we could experience an increase in our borrowing costs or difficulty accessing the capital markets. Such a development could adversely affect our ability to grow our business and to make cash distributions to our shareholders.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nOur business and operations have been and may continue to be adversely affected by COVID-19 or other similar public health developments and related changes to demand for oil and natural gas.\nSince 2020, COVID-19 and related actions taken by governments and businesses, including voluntary and mandatory quarantines and travel and other restrictions, have significantly impacted economic activity. As a result of COVID-19, our operations, and those of our business partners, suppliers and customers, including Hess, have experienced and may continue to experience further adverse effects, including disruptions, delays or temporary suspensions of operations and supply chains; temporary inaccessibility or closures of facilities; and workforce impacts from illness, school closures and other community response measures. We have implemented a variety of health and safety measures including enhanced cleaning procedures and modified work practices such as travel restrictions, health screenings, vaccination policies, reduced personnel at work sites wherever this can be done safely, and remote working arrangements for office workers. There is no certainty that these or any other future measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus and its variants, including the risk of infection of key employees, and our ability to perform certain functions could be impaired by these new business practices. For example, our reliance on technology has necessarily increased due to our use of remote communications and other work-from-home practices, which could make us more vulnerable to cyber-attacks. To the extent we or our business partners, suppliers or customers continue to experience restrictions or other effects, our financial condition, results of operations and future expansion projects may be adversely affected.\nIn addition to the global health concerns, COVID-19 has negatively affected the United States and global economy and the demand for oil and natural gas. The prolonged continuation or amplification of the outbreak of COVID-19 could result in further economic downturn that may affect our operating results in the long-term. Furthermore, the effects of COVID-19 and concerns regarding the global spread of its variants have negatively impacted the domestic and international demand for crude oil and natural gas, which has contributed to price volatility and adversely affected the demand for and marketability of the crude oil, natural gas and NGLs that we gather, process and terminal for Hess and other third-party producers. Containment measures implemented to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and its variants could continue to be widespread and lead to sustained adoption of certain behavioral changes, such as reduced travel and enhanced work from home policies, which could result in further reductions in demand for and consumption of energy commodities and further curtailments and shut-ins of production by our customers.\nThe timeline and potential magnitude of COVID-19 remains unknown and will depend on future developments, including, among others, the global availability of vaccines, the efficacy of vaccines against variants and the extent to which normal economic and operating conditions resume. In the event one or more of our business partners is adversely affected by COVID-19 or the current market environment, that may impact our costs and ability to conduct business with them. In addition, we may face an increased risk of changes in the regulations related to our business, such as the imposition of limitations on our workforce\u2019s ability to access our facilities. We also are subject to litigation risk and possible loss contingencies related to COVID-19, including with respect to commercial contracts, employee matters and insurance arrangements. A sustained extension of the current market environment may make it more difficult to comply with covenants and other restrictions in agreements governing our debt, and a lack of confidence in our industry on the part of the financial markets may result in a lack of access to capital, any of which could lead to reduced liquidity.\nAs the impact from COVID-19 remains difficult to predict, the extent to which it may negatively affect our operating results is uncertain. Any impact will depend on future developments and new information that may emerge regarding the severity and duration of COVID-19 and the actions taken by authorities to contain it or treat its impact, all of which are beyond our control.\nOur industry is highly competitive and increased competitive pressure could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe compete with other midstream companies in our areas of operation. In addition, some of our competitors have assets in closer proximity to crude oil and natural gas supplies and have available idle capacity in existing assets that would not require new capital investments for use. Some of our competitors are large companies that have greater financial, managerial and other resources than we do. Our competitors may expand or construct gathering systems, processing plants, terminals or storage facilities that would create additional competition for the services we provide to our customers. Our ability to renew or replace existing contracts with our customers at rates sufficient to maintain current revenue and cash flow could be adversely affected by the activities of our competitors and our customers. All of these competitive pressures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and our ability to make cash distributions to our shareholders.\nSeasonal weather conditions, which may be impacted by climate change, may adversely affect our customers\u2019 ability to conduct drilling activities in some of the areas where we operate and our ability to operate our assets and to construct additional facilities.\nCrude oil and natural gas operations in North Dakota are adversely affected by seasonal weather conditions. In the Bakken, drilling and other crude oil and natural gas activities can be adversely affected during the winter months. Severe winter weather conditions limit and may reduce or temporarily halt our customers\u2019 ability to operate during such conditions, leading to the decrease in drilling activity and the potential shut-in of producing wells which the producers are unable to service. This could result in a decrease in the volumes of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs supplied to our assets. In addition, seasonal weather conditions during the winter months may adversely impact the operations of our assets and our ability to construct additional facilities, by causing temporary delays and shutdowns. The frequency and severity of severe winter weather conditions which impact our and our customers\u2019 business activities may also be impacted by the effects of climate change. Energy needs could increase or decrease as a result of extreme weather conditions depending on the duration and magnitude of any such climate changes. Increased energy use due to weather changes may require us to invest in order to serve increased demand. A decrease in energy use due to weather changes may affect our financial condition through decreased revenues. To the extent the frequency of extreme weather events increases, this could increase our cost of providing service. If any of these results occur, it could have an adverse effect on our assets and operations and cause us to incur costs in preparing for and responding to them. To the extent any such effects were to occur, the resulting impacts could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and our ability to make cash distributions to our shareholders.\nOur success depends on our ability to attract and maintain customers in a limited number of geographic areas.\nSubstantially all of our assets are located in the Bakken, and we intend to focus our future capital expenditures largely on developing our business in that area. As a result, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows are significantly dependent upon the demand for our services in that area. Due to our focus on the Bakken, an adverse development in crude oil or natural gas production from that area would have a significantly greater impact on our financial condition and results of operations than if we spread expenditures more evenly over a wider geographic area. For example, a change in the rules and regulations governing operations in or around the Bakken could cause Hess or other producers to reduce or cease drilling or to permanently or temporarily shut-in their production within the area, which could lead to a decrease in the volumes of natural gas and crude oil that we handle and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and our ability to make cash distributions to our shareholders.\nOur operations and Hess\u2019 Bakken production operations are subject to many risks and operational hazards, some of which may result in business interruptions and shutdowns of our or Hess\u2019 operations and damages for which may not be fully covered by insurance. If a significant accident or event occurs that results in a business interruption or shut down for which we are not adequately insured, our operations and financial results could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur operations are subject to all of the risks and operational hazards inherent in gathering, compressing, processing, fractionating, terminaling, storing, loading and transporting crude oil, natural gas and NGLs and gathering and disposing of produced water, including:\n\u2022damages to pipelines, terminals and facilities, related equipment and surrounding properties caused by earthquakes, tornados, floods, fires, severe weather, explosions and other natural disasters, the frequency and severity of which may be impacted by climate change, and acts of terrorism;\n\u2022maintenance, repairs, mechanical or structural failures at our or Hess\u2019 facilities or at third-party facilities on which our or Hess\u2019 operations are dependent, including electrical shortages, power disruptions and power grid failures;\n\u2022damages to and loss of availability of interconnecting third-party pipelines, railroads, terminals and other means of delivering crude oil, natural gas and NGLs;\n\u2022crude oil rail car derailments, fires, explosions and spills;\n\u2022disruption or failure of information technology systems and network infrastructure due to various causes, including unauthorized access or attack;\n\u2022curtailments of operations due to severe seasonal weather;\n\u2022protests, riots, strikes, lockouts or other industrial disturbances; and\n\u2022other hazards.\nThese risks could result in substantial losses due to personal injury and/or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment and pollution or other environmental damage, as well as business interruptions or shutdowns of our facilities. Any such event or unplanned shutdown could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, Hess\u2019 Bakken production operations, on which our operations are substantially dependent, are subject to similar operational hazards and risks inherent in producing crude oil and natural gas. A serious accident at our facilities or at Hess\u2019 facilities could result in serious injury or death to our employees or contractors or those of Hess or its affiliates and could expose us to significant liability for personal injury claims and reputational risk. We have no control over the operations at Hess\u2019 Bakken operations and their associated facilities.\nWe do not maintain insurance coverage against all potential losses and could suffer losses for uninsurable or uninsured risks or in amounts in excess of existing insurance coverage. We carry insurance coverage for certain property damage and third-party liabilities, which includes sudden and accidental pollution liabilities. We are also insured under certain of Hess\u2019 liability policies and are subject to Hess\u2019 policy limits under these policies. The occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance or failure by one or more insurers to honor its coverage commitments for an insured event could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur exposure to direct commodity price risk may increase in the future.\nWe generate substantially all of our revenues under fee-based commercial agreements with Hess under which we are paid based on the volumes of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs that we handle and the ancillary services we provide, rather than the value of the commodities themselves. As a result, our operations and cash flows generally have minimal direct exposure to commodity price risk. While the initial term of our commercial agreements provides for an annual fee recalculation mechanism to target a return on capital deployed, the secondary term of our commercial agreements changes to an inflation-based fee structure, which may provide greater exposure to price volatility. In addition, we may acquire or develop additional assets in the future or enter into transactions that have a greater exposure to fluctuations in commodity prices than our current operations. Our efforts to negotiate contractual arrangements to minimize our direct exposure to commodity price risk in the future may not be successful. Increased exposure to the volatility of crude oil, natural gas and NGL prices in the future could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and cash flow and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders.\nWe do not own all of the land on which certain of the pipelines connecting our facilities are located, which could result in disruptions to our operations.\nWe do not own all of the land on which our pipelines are located, and we are, therefore, subject to the possibility of more onerous terms and increased costs to retain necessary land use if we do not have valid leases or rights-of-way or if such rights-of-way lapse or terminate. We obtain the rights to construct and operate our pipelines on land owned by third parties and governmental agencies, and some of our agreements may grant us those rights for only a specific period of time. Our loss of these rights, through our inability to renew right-of-way contracts or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and ability to make cash distributions to our shareholders.\nWe utilize contract operator services at certain of our assets, and we may face higher costs associated with terminal services in the future.\nWe utilize contract operator services at certain of our assets. For example, we utilize contract operator services at our Tioga Rail Terminal under a rail and transload services agreement with a third-party operator that may be terminated by us with 90-day notice. Under the terms of the agreement, third-party contract personnel supervised by Hess employees control, monitor, record and report on the operation of the Tioga Rail Terminal. Contract personnel also provide inspection, crude oil loading, railroad consulting, inventory management, repair, data reporting, general maintenance and technical support and safety compliance services. Under this agreement, we are liable for any losses resulting from actions of the third-party operator unless such losses result from the negligence of the third-party operator. If disputes arise over the operation of the terminal, or if the third-party operator fails to provide the services contracted under contract operator services agreements, our business, results of operation, and financial condition could be adversely affected. We previously extended the term of this agreement and expanded services to include rail car qualification and maintenance management and we expect to renew the agreement before it expires. Costs of these services under a negotiated renewal of the existing agreement or a similar agreement may increase relative to historical costs. Any such increased costs associated with terminal operation services will decrease the amount of cash available for distribution to our shareholders.\nRestrictions in our credit facilities could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, ability to make cash distributions to our shareholders and the value of our Class A Shares.\nWe are dependent upon the earnings and cash flow generated by our operations in order to meet any debt service obligations and to allow us to make cash distributions to our shareholders. In December 2019, we entered into senior secured credit facilities consisting of a $1.0 billion 5-year revolving credit facility and a fully drawn $400.0 million 5-year Term Loan A facility, which contain various operating and financial restrictions and covenants. The operating and financial restrictions and covenants in our credit facilities restrict, and any future financing agreements could similarly restrict, our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or to expand or pursue our business activities, which may, in turn, limit our ability to make cash distributions to our shareholders.\nThe provisions of our credit facilities could affect our ability to obtain future financing and pursue attractive business opportunities and our flexibility in planning for, and reacting to, changes in business conditions. In addition, a failure to comply with the provisions of our credit facilities would result in an event of default which would enable our lenders to declare the outstanding principal of that debt, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. If the payment of our debt is accelerated, defaults under our other debt instruments, if any, may be triggered, and our assets may be insufficient to repay such debt in full, and the holders of our shares could experience a partial or total loss of their investment. Please read \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Capital Resources and Liquidity\u201d for additional information about our credit facilities.\nThe alteration or discontinuation of LIBOR may adversely affect our borrowing costs.\nCertain borrowings on our credit facilities and term loan may use the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) as a benchmark for establishing the rate. LIBOR is the subject of recent national, international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. These reforms and other pressures are expected to cause LIBOR to be discontinued after June 30, 2023 or to perform differently than in the past. In the United States, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, which was convened by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, has proposed the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) as an alternative to LIBOR. At this time, the consequences of these developments cannot be entirely predicted, but could include fluctuations in interest rates or an increase in the cost of our credit facility borrowings.\nWe have a significant amount of consolidated indebtedness that may adversely affect our business, results of operations and ability to make quarterly distributions.\nWe have a significant amount of consolidated indebtedness. As of December 31, 2021, we had $2,073.0 million carrying value of outstanding senior notes of the Partnership, $104.0 million carrying value of borrowings outstanding under the Partnership\u2019s senior secured revolving credit facility and $386.5 million carrying value of borrowings outstanding under the Partnership\u2019s senior secured term loan facility.\nThe degree to which we are leveraged, combined with lease and other financial obligations and contractual commitments, could have important consequences to us, including the following:\n\u2022our ability to obtain additional financing, if necessary, for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or other purposes may be impaired or such financing may not be available on favorable terms;\n\u2022satisfying our obligations with respect to indebtedness may be more difficult and any failure to comply with the obligations of any debt instruments could result in an event of default under the agreements governing such indebtedness;\n\u2022we will need a portion of cash flow to make interest payments on debt, reducing the funds that would otherwise be available for operations, future business opportunities or making cash distributions;\n\u2022our debt level will make us more vulnerable to competitive pressures or a downturn in our business or the economy generally; and\n\u2022our debt level may limit flexibility in planning for, or responding to, changing business and economic conditions.\nOur ability to service our indebtedness will depend upon, among other things, our future financial and operating performance, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business, regulatory and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. If our operating results are not sufficient to service our current or future indebtedness, we will be forced to take actions such as reducing or delaying business activities, acquisitions, investments or capital expenditures, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing debt, or seeking additional equity capital, and such results may adversely affect our ability to make cash distributions.\nRestrictions in the terms of our consolidated indebtedness could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and ability to make quarterly cash distributions.\nThe terms of our consolidated indebtedness limit our ability to conduct our business, including our ability to:\n\u2022incur certain liens or permit them to exist;\n\u2022transfer, sell or otherwise dispose of certain assets;\n\u2022merge or consolidate with another company;\n\u2022make certain loans and investments;\n\u2022incur or guarantee additional debt;\n\u2022enter into certain types of transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022redeem or repurchase units or make distributions under certain circumstances; and\n\u2022enter into certain restrictive agreements and certain derivative contracts.\nOur consolidated indebtedness also contains covenants requiring us to maintain certain financial ratios. Our ability to meet those financial ratios and tests can be affected by events beyond our control, and there can be no assurance that we will meet any such ratios or tests.\nIf we are unable to make acquisitions on economically acceptable terms from third parties, our future growth could be limited, and any acquisitions we may make may reduce, rather than increase, our cash flows and ability to make distributions to shareholders.\nPart of our strategy to grow our business is dependent on our ability to make acquisitions. The acquisition component of our growth strategy is based, in large part, on our expectation of ongoing divestitures of midstream assets by industry participants.\nIf we are unable to make acquisitions from third parties, because (i) there is a material decrease in divestitures of midstream assets, (ii) we are unable to identify attractive acquisition candidates or negotiate acceptable purchase contracts, (iii) we are unable to obtain financing or to access the capital markets for future debt or equity offerings on economically acceptable terms, (iv) we are outbid by competitors or (v) for any other reason, our future growth and ability to increase our distributions will be limited. Our partnership agreement requires that we distribute all of our available cash to our shareholders. As a result, we expect to rely primarily upon external financing sources, including borrowings under our revolving credit facility and the issuance of debt and equity securities, to fund future acquisitions. Even if we are successful in obtaining funds for acquisitions through equity or debt financings, the terms thereof could limit our ability to pay distributions to our shareholders. In addition, issuing additional partner interests may result in significant shareholder dilution and increase the aggregate amount of cash required to maintain the then-current distribution rates, which could materially decrease our ability to pay distributions at the then-current distribution rates. If funding is not available to us when needed, or is available only on unfavorable terms, we may be unable to execute our business strategy, complete acquisitions or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and ability to make quarterly cash distributions to our shareholders.\nFurthermore, even if we do consummate acquisitions that we believe will be accretive, they may in fact result in a decrease in distributions as a result of incorrect assumptions in our evaluation of such acquisitions or unforeseen consequences or other external events beyond our control. If we consummate any future acquisitions, shareholders will not have the opportunity to evaluate the economic, financial and other relevant information that we will consider in evaluating any such acquisitions.\nThe completion of capital projects by us may not result in revenue increases and will be subject to regulatory, environmental, political, legal and economic risks, which could adversely affect our operations and financial condition.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we intend to increase utilization of our existing asset base and increase revenue at our facilities by handling additional volumes of natural gas and crude oil resulting from the completion of various capital projects by us. For example, we recently completed a construction and reconfiguration of facilities and pipelines in McKenzie and Williams Counties that increased our throughput capacity for crude oil and natural gas originating from south of the Missouri River and moving northward to our natural gas processing and crude oil and NGL terminaling assets in Tioga and Ramberg. We also invested in construction of the LM4 gas processing plant south of the Missouri River as part of our joint venture with Targa and we expanded natural gas processing capacity at TGP by 150 MMcf/d for total processing capacity of 400 MMcf/d.\nThere are inherent risks associated with undertaking these and other capital projects, including numerous regulatory, environmental, political and legal uncertainties, most of which are beyond our control. If we undertake these projects, they may not be completed on schedule or at all or at the budgeted cost, limiting our capacity until completion, or their completion may not result in the anticipated increase in volumes at our facilities, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and our ability in the future to make distributions to our shareholders.\nTerrorist or cyber-attacks and threats, or escalation of military activity in response to these attacks, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nTerrorist attacks and threats, cyber-attacks, escalation of military activity or acts of war may have significant effects on general economic conditions, fluctuations in consumer confidence and spending and market liquidity, each of which could materially and adversely affect our business. Strategic targets, such as energy-related assets and transportation assets, may be at greater risk of future terrorist attacks than other targets in the United States. There is no guarantee that our insurance policies will be sufficient to cover our losses resulting from a terrorist attack or cyber attack on our assets that may shut down all or part of our business. It is possible that any of these occurrences, or a combination of them, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nComputers and telecommunication systems have become an integral part of our business. We use these systems to analyze and store financial and operating data and to communicate within our company and with outside business partners. Our reliance on technology has increased due to our use of remote communications and other work-from-home practices in response to COVID-19. Cyber-attacks or phishing-attacks, unauthorized access, malicious software, data privacy breaches by employees or others with authorized access, ransomware, and other cyber security issues could compromise our computer and telecommunications systems and result in disruptions to our business operations, the loss or corruption of our data and proprietary information and communications interruptions. In addition, computers control oil and gas distribution systems globally and are necessary to deliver our customers\u2019 products to market. A cyber-attack impacting these distribution systems, or the networks and infrastructure on which they rely, could damage critical production, processing, distribution and/or storage assets, delay or prevent delivery to markets and make it difficult or impossible to accurately account for our services and settle transactions. As a result, a cyber breach of these operating systems, or of the networks and infrastructure on which they rely and any resulting investigation or remediation costs, litigation or regulatory action could have a material adverse impact on our cash flows and results of operations, reputation and competitiveness. We routinely experience attempts by external parties to penetrate and attack our networks and systems. Although such attempts to date have not resulted in any material breaches, disruptions, financial loss, or loss of business-critical information, our systems and procedures for protecting against such attacks and mitigating such risks may prove to be insufficient in the future and such attacks could have an adverse impact on our business and operations, including damage to our reputation and competitiveness, remediation costs, litigation or regulatory actions. In addition, as technologies evolve and these cyber security attacks become more sophisticated, we may incur significant costs to upgrade or enhance our security measures to protect against such attacks and we may face difficulties in fully anticipating or implementing adequate preventive measures or mitigating potential harm.\nRegulatory, Legal and Environmental Risks\nOur assets and operations are subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations relating to environmental protection and safety that could require us to make substantial expenditures.\nCertain of our assets and operations are subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations, which impose numerous obligations on our and our customers\u2019 operations, including: the acquisition of permits to conduct regulated activities; the incurrence of capital or operating expenditures to limit or prevent releases of materials from our or our customers\u2019 operations; the imposition of specific standards addressing worker protection, and the imposition of substantial liabilities and remedial obligations for pollution or contamination resulting from our and our customers\u2019 operations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in joint and several or strict liability and the assessment by governmental authorities of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of remedial obligations, and the issuance of injunctions limiting or preventing some or all of our operations. In addition, we may experience a delay in obtaining or be unable to obtain required permits, which may cause us to lose potential and current customers, interrupt operations, and limit growth and revenues. Private parties may also have the right to pursue legal actions to enforce compliance, as well as to seek damages for non-compliance, with environmental and safety laws and regulations or for personal injury or property damage.\nThe handling of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs involves inherent risks of spills and releases. We have contracted with various spill response service companies in the areas in which we gather, load, transport or store crude oil and NGLs; however, these companies may not be able to adequately contain a discharge in all instances, and we cannot ensure that all of their services would be available at any given time. Should these parties not be able to adequately contain such a discharge, we may face substantial liabilities and remedial obligations depending on the size and scope of any such discharge.\nWe may incur significant costs and liabilities as a result of pipeline integrity management program testing and any related pipeline repair or preventative or remedial measures.\nDOT, through PHMSA, has adopted regulations requiring pipeline operators to develop integrity management systems. PHMSA regularly proposes revisions to existing regulations as well as new pipeline safety regulations. For example, in October 2019, PHMSA submitted three major rules to the Federal Register, including rules focused on: the safety of gas transmission pipelines, the safety of hazardous liquid pipelines, and enhanced emergency order procedures. In November 2021, PHMSA issued a final rule that expands certain federal pipeline safety requirements to all onshore gas gathering pipelines, regardless of size or location. The final rule establishes two new types of onshore gas gathering pipelines subject to varying degrees of regulation: all onshore gathering line operators are now subject to PHMSA\u2019s annual reporting and incident reporting requirements, and certain previously unregulated rural gas gathering lines must now comply with PHMSA damage prevention and, depending on the size of the pipeline, construction and operational requirements. The rule is set to take effect May 15, 2022. The extent and magnitude of costs to comply with this new rule cannot currently be reliably or accurately estimated due to the uncertainty regarding the additional measures to be taken and how they will be implemented. We expect that such costs will include initial expenses for compliance, and lower on-going expenses that are not expected to be material to our overall financial results.\nIn addition, the Protecting Our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety Act of 2020 was signed into law on December 27, 2020. Among other things, the act requires PHMSA to issue regulations addressing idled pipelines, the safety of gas gathering pipelines, minimum performance standards for methane leak detection and repair and gas distribution pipelines\u2019 emergency response plans, responses to over pressurization events, and maintenance of maps and records of critical pressure control infrastructure. In addition, the act includes the adoption of due process improvements related to PHMSA enforcement, requires routine reporting to Congress regarding outstanding pipeline rulemaking, and an independent study regarding the cost-benefit of automated shut-off valves.\nThe adoption of these and other laws or regulations could require us to install new or modified safety controls, pursue new capital projects, or conduct maintenance programs on an accelerated basis, all of which could require us to incur increased operational costs that could be significant. While we cannot predict the outcome of legislative or regulatory initiatives, such legislative and regulatory changes could have a material effect on our cash flow.\nIn addition, if we fail to comply with applicable PHMSA regulations, rules, or orders, this could result in the imposition of civil penalties. Pursuant to the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty and Job Creation Act of 2011, or 2011 Pipeline Safety Act, PHMSA finalized rules that increased the maximum administrative civil penalties for violations of the pipeline safety laws and regulations to $200,000 per violation per day, with a maximum of $2,000,000 for a related series of violations. Effective January 11, 2021, those maximum civil penalties were increased by PHMSA to $222,504 per violation per day, with a maximum of $2,225,034 for a series of violations, to account for inflation.\nIf our assets become subject to FERC regulation, or if federal, state or local regulations or policies change, or if we fail to comply with such regulations, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nAlthough the FERC has not made any formal determinations with respect to our natural gas gathering facilities upstream of the Tioga Gas Plant and LM4, we believe that the natural gas pipelines in our gathering systems meet the traditional tests FERC has used to establish whether a pipeline is unregulated under the NGA. Similarly, we believe that the crude oil and NGL pipelines in our gathering system are not subject to FERC tariff requirements under the ICA, because they fall outside FERC\u2019s tariff jurisdiction. However, the classification and regulation of our gathering facilities may be subject to change based on future determinations by FERC, the courts, or Congress. If it is subsequently determined that an individual facility is not exempt from FERC regulation under the NGA or ICA, such determination could decrease revenue, increase operating costs, and, depending upon the facility in question, adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. In addition, if any of our facilities were found to have violated the NGA or the Natural Gas Policy Act, or the NGPA, FERC has civil penalty authority under the NGA and NGPA to impose penalties for current violations of up to $1,307,164 per day for each violation and disgorgement of profits associated with any violation. In addition, state regulation of gathering facilities and intrastate transportation pipelines generally include various safety, environmental, and in some circumstances, nondiscriminatory take and common purchaser requirements, as well as complaint-based rate regulation.\nEvolving environmental laws and regulations on crude oil, including stabilization and transportation, could have an effect on our financial performance.\nIn December 2014, the North Dakota Industrial Commission, (\u201cNDIC\u201d), issued Order No. 25417, which requires producers in the Bakken, among other fields, effective April 1, 2015, to heat their produced fluids to a specified minimum temperature or demonstrate that crude oil has a vapor pressure no greater than 13.7 psi prior to separation. In January 2019, the NDIC issued revisions to the order giving operators more flexibility for evaluating and demonstrating compliance with the state\u2019s vapor pressure requirements.\nGiven the volume of tight crude oil like Bakken crude that was then being shipped by rail, the U.S. Department of Energy, (\u201cDOE\u201d), tasked Sandia National Laboratories to study the properties of tight crude oils as they relate to potential combustion events in the rail transport environment. On August 23, 2019, Sandia released its report \u201cPool Fire and Fireball Experiments in Support of the U.S. DOE/DOT/TC Crude Oil Characterization Research Study\u201d (the \u201cSandia Study\u201d). After studying the thermal hazard characteristics of crude oil samples from the Bakken System in comparison to crude oils from the Permian Basin in Texas and the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, Sandia concluded that \u201call the oils have comparable thermal hazard distances\u201d and \u201cnone of the oils studied indicate outlier behavior.\u201d Additionally, the Sandia Study found that \u201cthe results from this work do not support creating a distinction for crude oils based on vapor pressure.\u201d Despite the conclusions of the Sandia Study, some federal, state or local regulators may continue to pursue regulation of crude oil vapor pressure for transportation purposes.\nFurthermore, rail car derailments in Canada and the United States several years ago led to increased regulatory scrutiny over the safety of transporting Bakken crude oil by rail. The Federal Railroad Administration, (\u201cFRA\u201d) of the DOT and PHMSA issued several Safety Advisories and Emergency Orders directing offerors and rail carriers to take additional precautionary measures to enhance the safe shipment of bulk quantities of crude oil. Currently, all of the rail cars in our fleet are DOT 117 rail cars that meet the requirements of the final DOT rule. In addition, the adoption of additional federal, state or local laws or regulations, including any new voluntary measures by the rail industry regarding rail car design or crude oil and liquid hydrocarbon rail transport activities, or efforts by local communities to restrict or limit rail traffic involving crude oil, could increase compliance costs and decrease demand for our services, which could adversely affect our financial position and cash flows. Moreover, any disruptions in the operations of railroads, including those due to shortages of rail cars, locomotives or labor, weather related problems, or other force majeure events could adversely impact our customers\u2019 ability to move their product and, as a result, could affect our business.\nIf new or more stringent federal, state or local legal restrictions relating to the quality specification of crude oil or to crude oil transportation are adopted in areas where Hess and our other customers operate, Hess and our other customers could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements and experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of production or development activities, which could reduce demand for our midstream services.\nEvolving environmental laws and regulations on hydraulic fracturing could have an effect on our financial performance.\nWe do not conduct hydraulic fracturing operations, but Hess\u2019 and our other customers\u2019 crude oil and natural gas production operations often require hydraulic fracturing as part of the completion process. While hydraulic fracturing is typically regulated by state agencies, federal agencies have also asserted regulatory authority over the process. In addition, Congress may in the future further consider legislation giving the EPA, direct authority to regulate hydraulic fracturing under the Safe Drinking Water Act.\nMany states have already adopted laws and/or regulations that require disclosure of the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing and are considering legal requirements that could impose more stringent permitting, disclosure and well construction requirements on crude oil and/or natural gas drilling activities.\nIf new or more stringent federal, state or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where Hess and our other customers operate, Hess and our other customers could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements and experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of production or development activities, which could reduce demand for our midstream services.\nEvolving environmental laws and regulations on climate change could adversely affect our financial performance.\nPotential regulations regarding climate change could affect our operations. Currently, various federal and state legislative and regulatory bodies are considering measures to address greenhouse gas emissions. These measures include the EPA, programs that require the crude oil and natural gas industry to report and to control greenhouse gas emissions, and states to develop statewide or regional programs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. These actions could result in increased (i) costs to operate and maintain our facilities, (ii) capital expenditures to install new emission controls on our facilities and (iii) costs to administer and manage any potential greenhouse gas emissions regulations or carbon trading or tax programs. These developments also could have an indirect effect on our business if Hess\u2019 Bakken operations are adversely affected due to increased regulation of Hess\u2019 facilities or reduced demand for crude oil, natural gas and NGLs. For example, in November 2021, the EPA proposed new regulations to establish comprehensive standards of performance and emission guidelines for methane and volatile organic compound emissions from existing operations in the oil and gas sector, including the exploration and production, transmission, processing, and storage segments. The EPA is currently seeking public comments on its proposal, which the EPA hopes to finalize by the end of 2022. Congress continues to periodically consider legislation on greenhouse gas emissions, which may include a delay in the implementation of greenhouse gas regulations by the EPA or a limitation on the EPA\u2019s authority to regulate greenhouse gases, although the ultimate adoption and form of any federal legislation cannot presently be predicted.\nIn an executive order issued on January 20, 2021, the Biden administration asked the heads of all federal agencies to review and take action to address any federal regulations, orders, guidance documents, policies and any similar agency actions promulgated during the prior administration that may be inconsistent with the current administration\u2019s policies. The executive order specifically identified certain of the regulations discussed herein, including the EPA\u2019s methane emission standards for oil and natural gas facilities. The Biden administration issued a separate executive order on January 27, 2021, focused on addressing climate change, which, among other things, directed the Secretary of the Interior to pause new oil and natural gas leases on public lands or in offshore waters pending completion of a comprehensive review and reconsideration of federal oil and gas permitting and leasing practices. In response to this, in November 2021, the Department of the Interior released a report on the federal oil and gas leasing program that included several recommendations for how to reform the program. These recommended reforms included, among other items, raising royalty rates and current minimum levels for bids, rentals, royalties and bonds; revising bidding practices to avoid leasing of low potential lands; and performing more meaningful public and tribal consultations regarding the leasing and permitting processes. In November 2021, the Department of the Interior entered into two Memoranda of Understanding with various federal agencies that focused on sacred sites and treaty rights, respectively, and entered into a Joint Order with the U.S. Department of Agriculture regarding stewardship of federal lands.\nThese developments may result in increased tribal consultation relating to oil and gas permitting and leasing on federal lands. In May 2021, the Biden administration issued an executive order requiring federal agencies, including financial regulators, to develop steps towards the mitigation of climate-related financial risk and its drivers and on October 14, 2021, issued a roadmap which sets out a climate risk accountability framework. Such federal regulation, as well as uncertainty regarding the future course of federal regulation, could indirectly affect our business and our results of operations by reducing demand for our services.\nAt both the federal and state-level, there are also an increasing number of legislative initiatives and proposals that may lead to reduced demand for fossil fuels such as oil and gas. These include certain tax advantages and other subsidies to support alternative energy sources or that mandate the use of specific fuels or technologies, in addition to the promotion of research into new technologies to reduce the cost and increase the scalability of alternative energy sources. Such regulations and initiatives, as well as uncertainty regarding the future success of such regulations and initiatives in reducing demand for oil and gas, could indirectly affect our business and our results of operations by reducing demand for our services.\nIn addition to potential domestic regulation of greenhouse gases, there continues to be international interest in a global framework for greenhouse gas reductions. For example, the Paris Agreement, which went into effect in November 2016, seeks to combat climate change through the establishment of nationally-determined greenhouse gas emissions reduction goals. President Biden has recommitted the United States to the Paris Agreement and, in April 2021, announced a goal of reducing the United States\u2019 emissions by 50-52% below 2005 levels by 2030. In November 2021, the international community gathered again in Glasgow at COP26, during which multiple announcements were made, including a call for parties to eliminate certain fossil fuel subsidies and pursue further action on non-carbon dioxide GHGs. Relatedly, the United States was a signatory to the Global Methane Pledge in November 2021, by which signatory countries commit to reducing global methane emissions by at least 30% from 2020 levels by 2030. While significant uncertainty exists as to the specifics on any future regulation of methane or other greenhouse gas emissions under federal regulations such as the Clean Air Act or other local, regional, or international regulatory regimes, their impact, if enacted, is likely to result in increased compliance costs, increased utility costs, additional operating restrictions on our business and an increase in the cost of products generally. However, the extent and magnitude of that impact cannot currently be reliably or accurately estimated.\nClimate change and sustainability initiatives may result in significant operational changes and expenditures, reduced demand for our services and adversely affect our business.\nWe recognize that climate change and sustainability are growing global environmental concerns. We are prioritizing sustainable energy practices to further reduce our carbon footprint while at the same time remaining a successfully operating public company. However, various key stakeholders, including our stockholders, employees, suppliers, customers, local communities and others, may have differing approaches to climate change initiatives. If we do not successfully manage expectations across these varied stakeholder interests, it could erode our stakeholder trust and thereby affect our reputation. As a result of heightened public awareness and attention to climate change and sustainability as well as continued regulatory initiatives, demand for crude oil and other hydrocarbons may be reduced, which may have an adverse effect on our customers and our business. The imposition and enforcement of stringent greenhouse gas emissions reduction requirements could severely and adversely impact the oil and gas industry and therefore significantly reduce the value of our business. Shareholder activism in relation to climate change and sustainability issues has been increasing in our industry in recent times, and shareholders may attempt to effect changes to our business or governance. In addition, certain financial institutions, institutional investors and other sources of capital have begun to limit or eliminate their investment in oil and gas activities due to concerns about climate change, which could make it more difficult to finance our business. Furthermore, increasing attention to climate change risks and sustainability has resulted in governmental investigations, and public and private litigation, which could increase our costs or otherwise adversely affect our business. For example, beginning in 2017, certain states, municipalities and private associations in California, Delaware, Maryland, Rhode Island and South Carolina separately filed lawsuits against oil, gas and coal producers, including Hess, for alleged damages purportedly caused by climate change. Such actions could adversely impact our business by distracting management and other personnel from their primary responsibilities, require us to incur increased costs, and/or result in reputational harm.\nWe or Hess may be unable to obtain or renew permits or approvals necessary for our respective operations, which could inhibit our ability to do business and adversely affect our financial performance.\nOur facilities and Hess\u2019 and our other customers\u2019 facilities that provide volumes to our facilities operate under federal, state and local permits, licenses and approvals with terms and conditions containing a significant number of prescriptive limits and performance standards that require a significant amount of monitoring, record keeping and reporting in order to demonstrate compliance. A decision by a government agency to deny or delay issuing a new or renewed permit or approval, or to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit or approval, could have an adverse impact on Hess\u2019 ability to produce crude oil and natural gas or on our ability to handle volumes of crude oil, natural gas, NGLs or produced water at our facilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, noncompliance or incomplete documentation of our compliance status with respect to our existing permits or approvals may result in the imposition of fines, penalties and injunctive relief.\nIn April 2020, a federal district court vacated Nationwide Permit (\u201cNWP\u201d) 12, the general permit issued by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (\u201cCorps\u201d) for pipelines and utility projects. In May 2020, the court narrowed its ruling, vacating and enjoining the use of NWP 12 only as it relates to construction of new oil and gas pipelines. In July 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court stayed the lower court order except as it applies to the Keystone XL pipeline. In January 2021, the Corps released the final version of a rule renewing twelve of its NWPs, including NWP 12. The new rule splits NWP 12 into three parts; NWP 12 will continue to be available for oil and gas pipelines, while new NWP 57 will be available for electric utility line and telecommunications activities, and a new NWP 58 will be available for utility line activities for water and other substances. The new rule also eliminates preconstruction notice requirements for NWP 12 for several conditions that used to require such notice, but also now requires new oil and gas pipeline projects that exceed 250 miles in length to give preconstruction notice and obtain approval before proceeding. If new oil and gas pipeline projects are unable to utilize NWP 12 or identify an alternate means of CWA compliance, such projects could be significantly delayed, which could have an adverse impact on our operations.\nIn the future we may face increased obligations relating to our produced water facilities and may be required to provide an increased level of financial assurance to guarantee the appropriate closure activities occur for our produced water facilities.\nObtaining a permit to own or operate produced water facilities generally requires us to establish performance bonds, letters of credit or other forms of financial assurance to address clean-up and closure obligations. As we acquire additional produced water facilities or expand our existing produced water facilities, these obligations will increase. Additionally, in the future, regulatory agencies may require us to increase the amount of our closure bonds at existing produced water facilities. Actual costs could exceed our current expectations, as a result of, among other things, federal, state or local government regulatory action, increased costs charged by service providers that assist in closing produced water facilities and additional environmental remediation requirements. The obligation to satisfy increased regulatory requirements associated with our produced water facilities could result in an increase of our operating costs and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nCertain plant or animal species could be designated as endangered or threatened, which could limit our ability to expand some of our existing operations or limit our customers\u2019 ability to develop new crude oil and natural gas wells.\nThe federal Endangered Species Act, (\u201cESA\u201d), restricts activities that may affect endangered or threatened species or their habitats. Many states have analogous laws designed to protect endangered or threatened species. The designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species under such laws may affect our and our customers\u2019 operations.\nRisks Inherent in an Investment in Us\nWe may not generate sufficient distributable cash flow to support the payment of the minimum quarterly distribution to our shareholders.\nIn order to support the payment of the minimum quarterly distribution of $0.30 per Class A Share per quarter, or $1.20 per Class A Share on an annualized basis, we must generate distributable cash flow of approximately $76.0 million per quarter, or approximately $304.0 million per year, based on Hess\u2019 and GIP\u2019s noncontrolling interest in us and the number of Class A Shares outstanding as of December 31, 2021. We may not generate sufficient distributable cash flow each quarter to support the payment of the minimum quarterly distribution. The amount of cash we can distribute on our Class A Shares principally depends upon the amount of cash we generate from our operations, which will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on, among other things:\n\u2022the volumes of crude oil, natural gas, NGLs and produced water that we handle on our assets;\n\u2022the fees with respect to volumes that we handle on our assets;\n\u2022the level of competition from other midstream energy companies in our geographic markets; and\n\u2022outages at our facilities caused by mechanical failure, maintenance, construction and other similar activities.\nIn addition, the actual amount of distributable cash flow we generate will also depend on other factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022the amount of our operating expenses and general and administrative expenses, including reimbursements to Hess, which are not subject to any caps or other limits, in respect of those expenses;\n\u2022the level of capital expenditures we make;\n\u2022the cost of acquisitions, if any;\n\u2022fluctuations in our working capital needs;\n\u2022our ability to borrow funds and access capital markets;\n\u2022restrictions contained in our credit facilities and other debt instruments;\n\u2022our debt service requirements and other liabilities;\n\u2022the amount of cash reserves established by our general partner;\n\u2022federal and state income taxes;\n\u2022changes in commodity prices; and\n\u2022other business risks affecting our cash levels.\nOur general partner and its affiliates, including our Sponsors, have conflicts of interest with us and limited fiduciary duties to us and our shareholders, and they may favor their own interests to our detriment and that of our shareholders. Additionally, we have no control over the business decisions and operations of our Sponsors, and none of the Sponsors is under any obligation to adopt a business strategy that favors us.\nThe Sponsors indirectly own and control our general partner. Although our general partner has a duty to manage the Company in a manner that is in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders, the Company\u2019s directors and officers also have a duty to manage our general partner in a manner that is in the best interests of its owner, HIP GP LLC, which is owned by the Sponsors. Conflicts of interest may arise between the Sponsors and their respective affiliates, including our general partner, on the one hand, and the Company and the Company\u2019s shareholders, on the other hand. In resolving these conflicts, our general partner may favor its own interests and the interests of its affiliates, including the Sponsors, over the interests of the Company\u2019s shareholders. These conflicts include, among others, the following situations:\n\u2022neither our partnership agreement nor any other agreement requires the Sponsors to pursue a business strategy that favors the Company or utilizes the Company\u2019s assets, which could involve decisions by Hess to increase or decrease production, shut down or reconfigure its assets, pursue and grow particular markets or undertake acquisition opportunities for itself. Hess\u2019 directors and officers have a fiduciary duty to make these decisions in the best interests of the stockholders of Hess;\n\u2022our partnership agreement replaces the fiduciary duties that would otherwise be owed by our general partner with contractual standards governing its duties, limiting our general partner\u2019s liabilities and restricting the remedies available to the shareholders of the Company for actions that, without the limitations, might constitute breaches of fiduciary duty;\n\u2022except in limited circumstances, our general partner has the power and authority to conduct the Company\u2019s business without shareholder approval;\n\u2022our general partner determines the amount and timing of asset purchases and sales, borrowings, issuance of additional partnership securities and the creation, reduction or increase of cash reserves, each of which can affect the amount of cash that is distributed to the shareholders of the Company;\n\u2022our general partner determines which costs incurred by it are reimbursable by the Company;\n\u2022our general partner may cause the Company to borrow funds in order to permit the payment of cash distributions;\n\u2022our partnership agreement does not restrict our general partner from causing the Company to pay it or its affiliates for any services rendered to the Company or entering into additional contractual arrangements with any of these entities on behalf of the Company;\n\u2022our general partner intends to limit its liability regarding the Company\u2019s contractual and other obligations;\n\u2022our general partner may exercise its right to call and purchase all of the Company\u2019s shares not owned by it and its affiliates if it and its affiliates own sufficient shares to exercise the call right;\n\u2022our general partner controls the enforcement of obligations owed to the Company by our general partner and its affiliates, including the commercial agreements between the Company and Hess; and\n\u2022our general partner decides whether to retain separate counsel, accountants or others to perform services for the Company.\nUnder the terms of our partnership agreement, the doctrine of corporate opportunity, or any analogous doctrine, does not apply to our general partner or any of its affiliates, including the Sponsors, HIP GP LLC or the executive officers and directors of the Company. Any such person or entity that becomes aware of a potential transaction, agreement, arrangement or other matter that may be an opportunity for the Company will not have any duty to communicate or offer such opportunity to the Company. Any such person or entity will not be liable to the Company or to any limited partner for breach of any fiduciary duty or other duty by reason of the fact that such person or entity pursues or acquires such opportunity for itself, directs such opportunity to another person or entity or does not communicate such opportunity or information to the Company. This may create actual and potential conflicts of interest between the Company and affiliates of our general partner and result in less than favorable treatment of the Company and its shareholders.\nOur partnership agreement requires that we distribute all of our available cash, which could limit our ability to grow and make acquisitions.\nOur partnership agreement requires that we distribute all of our available cash to our shareholders. As a result, we expect to rely primarily upon external financing sources, including borrowings under our revolving credit facility and the issuance of debt and equity securities, to fund our acquisitions and expansion capital expenditures. Therefore, to the extent we are unable to finance our growth externally, our cash distribution policy will significantly impair our ability to grow. In addition, because we will distribute all of our available cash, our growth may not be as fast as that of businesses that reinvest their available cash to expand ongoing operations. To the extent we issue additional shares in connection with any acquisitions or expansion capital expenditures, the payment of distributions on those additional shares may increase the risk that we will be unable to maintain or increase our per share distribution level. There are no limitations in our partnership agreement on our ability to issue additional shares, including shares ranking senior to our Class A Shares as to distributions or in liquidation or that have special voting rights and other rights, and our shareholders will have no preemptive or other rights (solely as a result of their status as shareholders) to purchase any such additional shares. The incurrence of additional commercial borrowings or other debt to finance our growth strategy would result in increased interest expense, which, in turn, may reduce the amount of cash that we have available to distribute to our shareholders.\nOur partnership agreement designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by the Company\u2019s shareholders, which would limit such shareholders\u2019 ability to choose the judicial forum for disputes with us or our general partner\u2019s directors, officers or other employees.\nOur partnership agreement provides that, with certain limited exceptions, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall be the exclusive forum for, any claims, suits, actions or proceedings (i) arising out of or relating in any way to our partnership agreement (including any claims, suits or actions to interpret, apply or enforce the provisions of our partnership agreement or the duties, obligations or liabilities among partners or of partners to the Company, or the rights or powers of, or restrictions on, the partners or the Company), (ii) brought in a derivative manner on behalf of the Company, (iii) asserting a claim of breach of a duty (including any fiduciary duty) owed by any director, officer, or other employee of the Company or our general partner, or owed by our general partner, to the Company or its partners, (iv) asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act (the \u201cDelaware Act\u201d) or (v) asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. However, the exclusive forum provision would not apply to suits brought to enforce any liability or duty created by the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d), or the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction. To the extent that any such claims may be based upon federal law claims, Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. Furthermore, Section 22 of the Securities Act creates concurrent jurisdiction for federal and state courts over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Securities Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in Class A Shares is deemed to have received notice of and consented to the foregoing provisions. Although we believe this choice of forum provision benefits the Company by providing increased consistency in the application of Delaware law in the types of lawsuits to which it applies, the provision may have the effect of discouraging lawsuits against the Company and our general partner\u2019s directors and officers. The enforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies\u2019 certificates of incorporation or similar governing documents has been challenged in legal proceedings and it is possible that in connection with any action a court could find the choice of forum provisions contained in our partnership agreement to be inapplicable or unenforceable in such action. If a court were to find this choice of forum provision inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to make cash distributions to our shareholders.\nOur partnership agreement provides that our shareholders irrevocably waive the right to trial by jury in any claim, suit, action or proceeding under either state or federal laws, including any claim under U.S. federal securities laws, which could result in less favorable outcomes to our shareholders in any such action.\nOur partnership agreement provides that our shareholders, including those who become our shareholders by purchasing shares in us in secondary transactions, irrevocably waive the right to trial by jury for any claims, suits, actions or proceedings (i) arising out of or relating in any way to our partnership agreement (including any claims, suits or actions to interpret, apply or enforce the provisions of our partnership agreement or the duties, obligations or liabilities among the Company\u2019s partners, or obligations or liabilities of the Company\u2019s partners to the Company, or the rights or powers of, or restrictions on, the Company\u2019s partners or the Company), (ii) brought in a derivative manner on the Company\u2019s behalf, (iii) asserting a claim of breach of a duty owed by any of the Company\u2019s, or our general partner\u2019s, directors, officers, or other employees, or owed by our general partner, to the Company or the Company\u2019s partners, (iv) asserting a claim against the Company arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware Act or (v) asserting a claim against the Company governed by the internal affairs doctrine, in each case pursuant to either state or federal laws, including U.S. federal securities law. Regardless, such waiver of the right to trial by jury does not impact the ability of a shareholder of the Company to make a claim under either federal or state law.\nThe waiver of the right to a jury trial is not intended to be deemed a waiver by any shareholder with respect to the Company\u2019s compliance with U.S. federal securities laws and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. If the Company or one of the Company shareholders opposed a jury trial demand based on the waiver, the applicable court would determine whether the waiver was enforceable based on the facts and circumstances of that case in accordance with applicable state and federal laws. To our knowledge, the enforceability of a contractual pre-dispute jury trial waiver in connection with claims arising under the U.S. federal securities laws has not been finally adjudicated by the United States Supreme Court. However, we believe that a contractual pre-dispute jury trial waiver provision is generally enforceable, including under the laws of the State of Delaware, which govern our partnership agreement.\nIf a shareholder brings a claim in connection with matters arising under our partnership agreement, including claims under U.S. federal securities laws, such Company shareholder may not be entitled to a jury trial with respect to such claims, which may have the effect of limiting and discouraging lawsuits. If a lawsuit is brought by a shareholder under our partnership agreement, it may be heard only by a judge or justice of the applicable trial court, which would be conducted according to different civil procedures and may result in a different outcome than a trial by jury, including results that could be less favorable to the Company shareholder(s) bringing such lawsuit.\nAffiliates of our general partner, including our Sponsors, may compete with us, and neither our general partner nor its affiliates have any obligation to present business opportunities to us.\nNeither our partnership agreement nor the partnership agreement of the Partnership prohibits the Sponsors or any other affiliates of our general partner from owning assets or engaging in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with the Company. Under the terms of our partnership agreement, the doctrine of corporate opportunity, or any analogous doctrine, does not apply to our general partner or any of its affiliates, including the Sponsors and the Company\u2019s executive officers and directors. Any such entity that becomes aware of a potential transaction, agreement, arrangement or other matter that may be an opportunity for the Company will not have any duty to communicate or offer such opportunity to the Company. Consequently, the Sponsors and other affiliates of our general partner, including HIP GP LLC, may acquire, construct or dispose of additional midstream assets in the future without any obligation to offer the Company the opportunity to purchase any of those assets. As a result, competition from the Sponsors and other affiliates of our general partner could materially and adversely impact the Company\u2019s results of operations and distributable cash flow.\nOur partnership agreement replaces our general partner\u2019s fiduciary duties to holders of the Company\u2019s shares with contractual standards governing its duties.\nDelaware law provides that Delaware limited partnerships may, in their partnership agreements, expand, restrict or eliminate the fiduciary duties otherwise owed by the general partner to limited partners and the partnership, provided that partnership agreements may not eliminate the implied contractual covenant of good faith and fair dealing. As permitted by Delaware law, our partnership agreement contains provisions that eliminate the fiduciary standards to which our general partner would otherwise be held by state fiduciary duty law and replaces those duties with several different contractual standards. For example, our partnership agreement permits our general partner to make a number of decisions in its individual capacity, as opposed to in its capacity as our general partner, free of any duties to us and our shareholders other than the implied contractual covenant of good faith and fair dealing. This provision entitles our general partner to consider only the interests and factors that it desires and relieves it of any duty or obligation to give any consideration to any interest of, or factors affecting, us, our affiliates or our limited partners. By purchasing a Class A Share, a shareholder is treated as having consented to the provisions in our partnership agreement, including the provisions discussed above.\nHolders of our Class A Shares have very limited voting rights and, even if they are dissatisfied, they cannot currently remove our general partner without its consent.\nUnlike the holders of common stock in a corporation, our shareholders have only limited voting rights on matters affecting our business and, therefore, limited ability to influence management\u2019s decisions regarding our business. For example, unlike holders of stock in a public corporation, our shareholders do not have \u201csay-on-pay\u201d advisory voting rights. Our shareholders did not elect our general partner and will not elect any of the members of our general partner\u2019s board of directors and have no right to elect our general partner or any of the members of our general partner\u2019s board of directors on an annual or other continuing basis. Our board of directors is chosen by HIP GP LLC, which is controlled by our Sponsors. Furthermore, if our shareholders are dissatisfied with the performance of our general partner, they have little ability to remove our general partner. As a result of these limitations, the price at which Class A Shares trade could be diminished because of the absence or reduction of a takeover premium in the trading price.\nOur shareholders are not able to remove our general partner without its consent because our general partner and its affiliates own sufficient shares to be able to prevent its removal. In addition, our general partner may only be removed for cause. \u201cCause\u201d is narrowly defined under our partnership agreement to mean that a court of competent jurisdiction has entered a final, non-appealable judgment finding our general partner liable for actual fraud or willful or wanton misconduct in its capacity as our general partner. Cause does not include most cases of charges of poor management of the business. Even if cause for removal exists, the vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of all of our outstanding shares voting together as a single class is required to remove our general partner. As of December 31, 2021, our general partner and its affiliates collectively owned approximately 87% of our Company shares.\nFurthermore, our shareholders\u2019 voting rights are further restricted by our partnership agreement, which provides that any shares held by a person that owns 20% or more of any class of shares then outstanding, other than our general partner, its affiliates, their transferees, and persons who acquired such shares with the prior approval of our board of directors, cannot vote on any matter.\nOur partnership agreement also contains provisions limiting the ability of our shareholders to call meetings or to acquire information about our operations, as well as other provisions limiting our shareholders\u2019 ability to influence the manner or direction of management.\nOur general partner interest or the control of our general partner may be transferred to a third party without shareholder consent.\nOur general partner may transfer its general partner interest to a third party in a merger or in a sale of all or substantially all of its assets without the consent of our shareholders. Furthermore, there is no restriction in our partnership agreement on the ability of HIP GP LLC to transfer all of the partnership interests in our general partner, or all of the membership interests in GP LLC, the general partner of our general partner, to a third party. The new owner of our general partner or the general partner of our general partner would then be in a position to replace our board of directors and officers with its own choices. As a result, we could lose the provision of certain operational support and administrative services by Hess and its affiliates and our license to use certain Hess trademarks.\nOur general partner has a limited call right that may require our shareholders to sell their Class A Shares at an undesirable time or price.\nIf at any time our general partner and its affiliates own more than a designated percentage of the issued and outstanding limited partner interests of any class, our general partner will have the right, but not the obligation, which it may assign to any of its affiliates or to us, to acquire all, but not less than all, of the limited partner interests of such class held by unaffiliated persons at a price not less than their then-current market price. This designated percentage is equal to (i) 80% with respect to all classes of limited partner interests other than Class A Shares and (ii) as of the consummation of the Restructuring, 97% of the Class A Shares and Class B Shares, taken together, which percentage is gradually adjusted downward in connection with decreases to the percentage of the limited partner interests held by our general partner and its affiliates. Generally, the designated percentage is three to five percent greater than the percentage of the limited partner interests owned by our general partner and its affiliates, until they own 75% of the limited partner interests, at which time the designated percentage will be fixed at 80%. As a result, our shareholders may be required to sell their Class A Shares at an undesirable time or price and may not receive any return on their investment. Our shareholders may also incur a tax liability upon a sale of their Class A Shares. For purposes of this calculation, the Class B Shares will be considered collectively with the Class A Shares as a single class. Our general partner and its affiliates currently own approximately 87% of the Class B Shares and the Class A Shares, considered as a single class.\nOur partnership agreement restricts the remedies available to shareholders for actions taken by our general partner that might otherwise constitute breaches of fiduciary duty.\nOur partnership agreement contains provisions that restrict the remedies available to shareholders for actions taken by our general partner that might otherwise constitute breaches of fiduciary duty under state fiduciary duty law. For example, our partnership agreement:\n\u2022provides that whenever our general partner makes a determination or takes, or declines to take, any other action in its capacity as our general partner, our general partner is required to make such determination, or take or decline to take such other action, in good faith, meaning that it subjectively believed that the determination or the decision to take or decline to take such action was in the best interests of us, and will not be subject to any other or different standard imposed by our partnership agreement, Delaware law, or any other law, rule or regulation, or at equity;\n\u2022provides that our general partner will not have any liability to us or our limited partners for decisions made in its capacity as a general partner so long as it acted in good faith;\n\u2022provides that our general partner and our officers and directors will not be liable for monetary damages to us or our limited partners resulting from any act or omission unless there has been a final and non-appealable judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction determining that our general partner or our officers and directors, as the case may be, acted in bad faith or engaged in fraud or willful misconduct or, in the case of a criminal matter, acted with knowledge that the conduct was criminal; and\n\u2022provides that our general partner will not be in breach of its obligations under our partnership agreement or its fiduciary duties to us or its limited partners if a transaction with an affiliate or the resolution of a conflict of interest is approved in accordance with, or otherwise meets the standards set forth in, our partnership agreement. In connection with a situation involving a transaction with an affiliate or a conflict of interest, our partnership agreement provides that any determination by our general partner must be made in good faith, and that the board of directors of our general partner and the conflicts committee thereof are entitled to a presumption that they acted in good faith. In any proceeding brought by or on behalf of any limited partner or the partnership, the person bringing or prosecuting such proceeding will have the burden of overcoming such presumption.\nThe market price of Class A Shares may fluctuate significantly.\nThe market price of Class A Shares may fluctuate significantly and holders of Class A Shares could lose some or all of the value of their investment. In addition, the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations in recent times which, if they continue to occur, could have a material adverse effect on the market for, or liquidity of, Class A Shares, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nOur Sponsors may sell Class A Shares in the public or private markets, and such sales could have an adverse impact on the trading price of the Class A Shares.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our Sponsors and their affiliates, including our general partner, collectively held 898,000 Class A Shares, 219,641,928 Class B Shares, and 219,641,928 Class B Units in the Partnership. The Class B Units in the Partnership are exchangeable, together with an equal number of Class B Shares, into Class A Shares on a one-to-one basis. We have agreed to provide our Sponsors with certain registration rights under applicable securities laws with respect to resales of the Class A Shares. The sale of these Class A Shares in the public or private markets could have an adverse impact on the price of the Class A Shares or any trading market that may develop.\nWe may issue an unlimited number of additional equity interests without shareholder approval, including equity interests with preferences senior to the Class A Shares, which would dilute shareholder interests.\nUnder our partnership agreement, we may, at any time, issue an unlimited number of general partner interests or limited partner interests of any type without the approval of our shareholders, and our shareholders will have no preemptive or other rights (solely as a result of their status as shareholders) to purchase any such general partner interests or limited partner interests. Further, there are no limitations in our partnership agreement on our ability to issue equity securities that rank equal or senior to the Class A Shares as to distributions or in liquidation or that have special voting rights and other rights.\nThe issuance by us of additional Class A Shares or other equity securities of equal or senior rank will have the following effects:\n\u2022our shareholders\u2019 proportionate ownership interest in us will decrease;\n\u2022the amount of cash we have available to distribute on each Class A Share may decrease;\n\u2022the relative voting strength of each previously outstanding Class A Share may be diminished; and\n\u2022the market price of our Class A Shares may decline.\nThe issuance by us of additional general partner interests may have the following effects, among others, if such general partner interests are issued to a person who is not an affiliate of our general partner:\n\u2022management of our business may no longer reside solely with our current general partner; and\n\u2022affiliates of the newly admitted general partner may compete with us, and neither that general partner nor such affiliates will have any obligation to present business opportunities to us.\nThe NYSE does not require a publicly traded limited partnership like us to comply with certain of its corporate governance requirements.\nOur Class A Shares are listed on the NYSE. Because we are a publicly traded limited partnership, the NYSE does not require us to have a majority of independent directors on our board of directors or to establish a compensation committee or a nominating and corporate governance committee. Additionally, any future issuances of additional Class A Shares or other securities, including to affiliates, are not subject to the NYSE\u2019s shareholder approval rules that apply to a corporation. Accordingly, our shareholders do not have the same protections afforded to certain shareholders of corporations that are subject to all of the NYSE corporate governance requirements.\nWe are treated as a corporation for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes.\nWe are subject to U.S. federal income tax as a corporation at the current corporate tax rate of 21% and to state income tax in various states at various rates. Government action could result in tax increases retroactively or prospectively through tax claims, changes to applicable statutory tax rates, modification of the tax base, or imposition of new tax types. Distributions on our Class A Shares are treated as distributions on corporate stock for U.S. federal income tax purposes and taxed again as corporate dividends (to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits). Because an entity-level tax is imposed on us due to our status as a corporation for U.S. federal and state income tax purposes, distributable cash flow will be reduced by any tax liabilities.", "PERMNO": 19098, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "HESM"}
