{"cik": "1341766", "company": "Celsius Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-30", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business faces certain risks. The risks described below may not be the only risks we face. Additional risks that we do not yet know of, or that we currently think as immaterial, may also impair our business. If any of the events anticipated by the risks described below or elsewhere in this report occur, our results of operations and financial conditions could be adversely affected.\nRisk Factors Relating to Our Business\nWe have a history of losses and we may experience additional losses in the futures.\nThe Company has a history of losses, including net losses available to common shareholders of $3,433,769 and $2,570,297 for the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, respectively. Our future operating results will depend on many factors, both in and out of our control, including the ability to increase and sustain demand for and acceptance of our products, the level of our competition, and our ability to attract and maintain key management and key employees. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we can attain consistent profitability.\nWe rely on third party co-packers to manufacture our products. If we are unable to maintain good relationships with our co-packers and/or their ability to manufacture our products becomes constrained or unavailable to us, our business could suffer.\nWe do not directly manufacture our products, but instead outsource such manufacturing to established third party co-packers. These third-party co-packers may not be able to fulfill our demand as it arises, could begin to charge rates that make using their services cost inefficient or may simply not be able to or willing to provide their services to us on a timely basis or at all. In the event of any disruption or delay, whether caused by a rift in our relationship or the inability of our co-packers to manufacture our products as required, we would need to secure the services of alternative co-packers. We may be unable to procure alternative packing facilities at commercially reasonable rates and/or within a reasonably short time period and any such transition could be costly. In such case, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nWe rely on distributors to distribute our products in the DSD sales channel and in international markets. If we are unable to secure such distributors and/or we are unable to maintain good relationships with our existing distributors, our business could suffer.\nWe distribute Celsius\u00ae in the DSD sales channel by entering into agreements with direct-to-store delivery distributors having established sales, marketing and distribution organizations. We similarly are seeking to expand our international distribution, particularly in the Far East and elsewhere in Asia by entering into agreements with large established distributors who service those markets. Many of our distributors are affiliated with and manufacture and/or distribute other beverage products. In many cases, such products compete directly with our products. The marketing efforts of our distributors are important for our success. If Celsius\u00ae proves to be less attractive to our distributors and/or if we fail to attract distributors, and/or our distributors do not market and promote our products with greater focus in preference to the products of our competitors, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur customers are material to our success. If we are unable to maintain good relationships with our existing customers, our business could suffer.\nUnilateral decisions could be taken by our distributors, grocery chains, convenience chains, drug stores, nutrition stores, mass merchants, club warehouses and other customers to discontinue carrying all or any of our products that they are carrying at any time, which could cause our business to suffer.\nTwo of our customers account for a significant portion of our revenues. If sales to either of those customers were to significantly decline or cease, our business could be significantly harmed.\nSales of our products to two customers, a foreign distributor of our products and a domestic retailer of vitamins and health products, accounted for 37% and 8% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2016, respectively and 50% and 12% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2015, respectively. Accordingly, if sales to either of these customers were to significantly decline or cease entirely, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be significantly harmed.\nIncreases in cost or shortages of raw materials or increases in costs of co-packing could harm our business.\nThe principal raw materials used by us are flavors and ingredient blends as well as aluminum cans, the prices of which are subject to fluctuations. We are uncertain whether the prices of any of the above or any other raw materials or ingredients we utilize will rise in the future and whether we will be able to pass any of such increases on to our customers. We do not use hedging agreements or alternative instruments to manage the risks associated with securing sufficient ingredients or raw materials. In addition, some of these raw materials, such as our distinctive sleek 12 ounce can, are available from a single or a limited number of suppliers. As alternative sources of supply may not be available, any interruption in the supply of such raw materials might materially harm us.\nOur failure to accurately estimate demand for our products could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nWe may not correctly estimate demand for our products. If we materially underestimate demand for our products and are unable to secure sufficient ingredients or raw materials, we might not be able to satisfy demand on a short-term basis, in which case our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe depend upon our trademarks and proprietary rights, and any failure to protect our intellectual property rights or any claims that we are infringing upon the rights of others may adversely affect our competitive position.\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to protect our current and future brands and products and to defend our intellectual property rights. We cannot be sure that trademarks will be issued with respect to any future trademark applications or that our competitors will not challenge, invalidate or circumvent any existing or future trademarks issued to, or licensed by, us.\nOur products are manufactured using our proprietary blends of ingredients. These blends are created by third-party suppliers to our specifications and then supplied to our co-packers. Although all of the third parties in our supply and manufacture chain execute confidentiality agreements, there can be no assurance that our trade secrets, including our proprietary ingredient blends will not become known to competitors.\nWe believe that our competitors, many of whom are more established and have greater financial and personnel resources than we do, may be able to replicate or reverse engineer our processes, brands, flavors, or our products in a manner that could circumvent our protective safeguards. Therefore, we cannot give you any assurance that our confidential business information will remain proprietary. Any such loss of confidentiality could diminish or eliminate any competitive advantage provided by our proprietary information.\nWe may incur material losses as a result of product recall and product liability.\nWe may be liable if the consumption of any of our products causes injury, illness or death. We also may be required to recall some of our products if they become contaminated or are damaged or mislabeled. A significant product liability judgment against us, or a widespread product recall, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The amount of the insurance we carry is limited, and that insurance is subject to certain exclusions and may or may not be adequate.\nOur lack of product diversification and inability to timely introduce new or alternative products could cause us to cease operations.\nOur business is centered on Celsius\u00ae. The risks associated with focusing on a limited product line are substantial. I Even though we recently announced our first product line extension, if consumers do not accept our products or if there is a general decline in market demand for, or any significant decrease in, the consumption of functional beverages, we are not financially or operationally capable of introducing alternative products within a short time frame. As a result, such lack of acceptance or market demand decline could cause us to cease operations.\nWe are dependent on our key executives and employees and the loss of any of their services could materially adversely affect us which may have a material adverse effect on our Company.\nOur future success will depend substantially upon the abilities of, and personal relationships developed by our key executives and employees. The sudden loss of the services of any key executive or employee could materially adversely affect our business and our prospects for the future. We do not have key person insurance on the lives of such individuals.\nWe are dependent on our ability to attract and retain qualified technical, sales and managerial personnel.\nOur future success depends in part on our continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical, sales and managerial personnel. Competition for such personnel in the beverage industry is intense and we may not be able to retain our key managerial, sales and technical employees or attract and retain additional highly qualified technical, sales and managerial personnel in the future. Any inability to attract and retain the necessary technical, sales and managerial personnel could materially adversely affect us.\nThe FDA has not passed on the efficacy of our products or the accuracy of any claim we make related to our products.\nAlthough six independent clinical studies have been conducted relating to the calorie-burning and related effects of our products, the results of these studies have not been submitted to or reviewed by the FDA. Further, the FDA has not passed on the efficacy of any of our products nor has it reviewed or passed on any claims we make related to our products, including the claim that our products aid consumers in burning calories or enhancing their metabolism.\nRisk Factors Relating to Our Industry\nWe are subject to significant competition in the beverage industry.\nThe beverage industry is highly competitive. The principal areas of competition are pricing, packaging, distribution channel penetration, development of new products and flavors and marketing campaigns. Our products compete with a wide range of drinks produced by a relatively large number of manufacturers, most of which have substantially greater financial, marketing and distribution resources and name recognition than we do.\nImportant factors affecting our ability to compete successfully include the taste and flavor of our products, trade and consumer promotions, rapid and effective development of new, unique cutting edge products, attractive and different packaging, branded product advertising and pricing. Our products compete with all liquid refreshments and with products of much larger and substantially better financed competitors, including the products of numerous nationally and internationally known producers, such as The Coca Cola Company, Dr. Pepper Snapple Group, PepsiCo, Inc., Nestle, Waters North America, Inc., Hansen Natural Corp. and Red Bull. We also compete with companies that are smaller or primarily local in operation. Our products also compete with private label brands such as those carried by supermarket chains, convenience store chains, drug store chains, mass merchants and club warehouses.\nThere can be no assurance that we will compete successfully in the functional beverage industry. The failure to do so would materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe compete in an industry that is brand-conscious, so brand name recognition and acceptance of our products are critical to our success and significant marketing and advertising could be needed to achieve and sustain brand recognition.\nOur business is substantially dependent upon awareness and market acceptance of our products and brands by our targeted consumers. Our business depends on acceptance by our independent distributors of our brand as one that has the potential to provide incremental sales growth rather than reduce distributors\u2019 existing beverage sales. The development of brand awareness and market acceptance is likely to require significant marketing and advertising expenditures. There can be no assurance that Celsius\u00ae will achieve and maintain satisfactory levels of acceptance by independent distributors and retail consumers. Any failure of Celsius\u00ae brand to maintain or increase acceptance or market penetration would likely have a material adverse effect on business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur sales are affected by seasonality.\nAs is typical in the beverage industry, our sales are seasonal. Our highest sales volumes generally occur in the second and third quarters, which correspond to the warmer months of the year in our major markets. Consumer demand for our products is also affected by weather conditions. Cool, wet spring or summer weather could result in decreased sales of our beverages and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur business is subject to many regulations and noncompliance is costly.\nThe production, marketing and sale of our beverage products are subject to the rules and regulations of various federal, state and local health agencies. If a regulatory authority finds that a current or future product or production run is not in compliance with any of these regulations, we may be fined, or production may be stopped, thus adversely affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations. Similarly, any adverse publicity associated with any noncompliance may damage our reputation and our ability to successfully market our products. Furthermore, the rules and regulations are subject to change from time to time and while we closely monitor developments in this area, we have no way of anticipating whether changes in these rules and regulations will impact our business adversely. Additional or revised regulatory requirements, whether labeling, environmental, tax or otherwise, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisk Factors Relating to our Status as a Fully Reporting Public Company\nWe recently became subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d) that require us to incur audit fees and legal fees in connection with the preparation of such reports. These additional costs could reduce or eliminate our ability to earn a profit.\nWe recently became subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Exchange Act and as a result, we are now required to file periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d) pursuant to the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. In order to comply with these requirements, our independent registered public accounting firm has to review our financial statements on a quarterly basis and audit our financial statements on an annual basis. Moreover, our legal counsel has to review and assist in the preparation of such reports. The costs charged by these professionals for such services cannot be accurately predicted at this time because factors such as the number and type of transactions that we engage in and the complexity of our reports cannot be determined at this time and will have a major effect on the amount of time to be spent by our auditors and attorneys. However, the incurrence of such costs will obviously be an expense to our operations and thus have a negative effect on our ability to meet our overhead requirements and earn a profit. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our business and operating results could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, and the trading price of our common stock, if a market ever develops, could drop significantly.\nOur internal controls may be inadequate, which could cause our financial reporting to be unreliable and lead to misinformation being disseminated to the public.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. As defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act, internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that:\n\u2022 pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company;\n\u2022 provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and/or directors of the Company; and\n\u2022 provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company\u2019s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nWe will be required to include a report of management on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in certain of our periodic filings. We expect to incur additional expenses and diversion of management\u2019s time as a result of performing the system and process evaluation, testing and remediation required in order to comply with the management certification requirements.\nWe do not have a sufficient number of employees to segregate responsibilities and may be unable to afford increasing our staff or engaging outside consultants or professionals to overcome our lack of employees. During the course of our testing, we may identify other deficiencies that we may not be able to timely remediate. Moreover, effective internal controls, particularly those related to revenue recognition, are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to help prevent financial fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our business and operating results could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, and the trading price of our common stock could drop significantly.\nThe Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the \u201cJobs Act\u201d) has reduced the information that the Company is required to disclose.\nUnder the Jobs Act, the information that the Company is required to disclose has been reduced in a number of ways.\nAs a company that had gross revenues of less than $1 billion during the Company\u2019s last fiscal year, the Company is an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jobs Act (an \u201cEGC\u201d). The Company will retain that status until the earliest of (a) the last day of the fiscal year which the Company has total annual gross revenues of $1,000,000,000 (as indexed for inflation in the manner set forth in the Jobs Act) or more; (b) the last day of the fiscal year of following the fifth anniversary of the date of the first sale of the common stock pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933 (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d); (c) the date on which the Company has, during the previous three year period, issued more than $1,000,000,000 in non-convertible debt; or (d) the date on which the Company is deemed to be a \u201clarge accelerated filer,\u201d as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act or any successor thereto. As an EGC, the Company is relieved from the following:\n\u2022 The Company is excluded from Section 404(b) of Sarbanes-Oxley Act (\u201cSarbanes-Oxley\u201d), which otherwise would have required the Company\u2019s auditors to attest to and report on the Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting. The Jobs Act also amended Section 103(a)(3) of Sarbanes-Oxley to provide that (i) any new rules that may be adopted by the PCAOB requiring mandatory audit firm rotation or changes to the auditor\u2019s report to include auditor discussion and analysis (each of which is currently under consideration by the PCAOB) shall not apply to an audit of an EGC; and (ii) any other future rules adopted by the PCAOB will not apply to the Company\u2019s audits unless the SEC determines otherwise.\n\u2022 The Jobs Act amended Section 7(a) of the Securities Act to provide that the Company need not present more than two years of audited financial statements in an initial public offering registration statement and in any other registration statement, need not present selected financial data pursuant to Item 301 of Regulation S-K for any period prior to the earliest audited period presented in connection with such initial public offering. In addition, the Company is not required to comply with any new or revised financial accounting standard until such date as a private company (i.e., a company that is not an \u201cissuer\u201d as defined by Section 2(a) of Sarbanes-Oxley) is required to comply with such new or revised accounting standard. Corresponding changes have been made to the Exchange Act, which relates to periodic reporting requirements, which would be applicable if the Company were required to comply with them.\n\u2022 As long as the Company is an EGC, the Company may comply with Item 402 of Regulation S-K, which requires extensive quantitative and qualitative disclosure regarding executive compensation, by disclosing the more limited information required of a \u201csmaller reporting company.\u201d\n\u2022 The Jobs Act also exempts the Company from the following additional compensation-related disclosure provisions that were imposed on U.S. public companies pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act: (i) the advisory vote on executive compensation required by Section 14A(a) of the Exchange Act; (ii) the requirements of Section 14A(b) of the Exchange Act relating to shareholder advisory votes on \u201cgolden parachute\u201d compensation; (iii) the requirements of Section 14(i) of the Exchange Act as to disclosure relating to the relationship between executive compensation and our financial performance; and (iv) the requirement of Section 953(b)(1)of the Dodd-Frank Act, which requires disclosure as to the relationship between the compensation of the Company\u2019s chief executive officer and median employee pay.\nIn addition to the foregoing, Section 107 of the Jobs Act provides that an EGC can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. An emerging growth company can therefore delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. However, we are choosing to \u201copt out\u201d of such extended transition period, and as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for companies that are not EGCs. Section 107 of the Jobs Act provides that our decision to \u201copt out\u201d of the extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards is irrevocable.\nRisk Factors Related to our Common Stock\nWe cannot guarantee the continued existence of an active established public trading market for our common stock.\nOur common stock currently is listed for trading on the OTCQX tier of the over-the-counter market operated by OTC Markets Group, Inc. Trading in stock quoted on the OTCQX is often thin and characterized by wide fluctuations in trading prices, due to many factors that may have little to do with our operations or business prospects. This volatility could depress the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to operating performance. Accordingly, OTCQX may provide less liquidity for holders of our common stock than a national securities exchange such as the Nasdaq Stock Market. Although we have applied to list our common stock for trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market, we have not as yet been approved for listing, there is no assurance that we can successfully do so or that in any event, we can maintain an active established trading market for our common stock.\nMarket prices for our common stock may also be influenced by a number of other factors, including:\n\u2022 the issuance of new equity securities pursuant to a public or private offering;\n\u2022 changes in interest rates;\n\u2022 competitive developments, including announcements by competitors of new products or services or significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u2022 variations in quarterly operating results;\n\u2022 change in financial estimates by securities analysts;\n\u2022 the depth and liquidity of the market for our common stock;\n\u2022 investor perceptions of Celsius and the functional beverage industry generally; and\n\u2022 general economic and other national conditions.\nOur common stock is currently deemed to be a \u201cpenny stock\u201d and is restricted by the SEC\u2019s penny stock regulations and FINRA\u2019s sales practice requirements, which may limit a shareholder\u2019s ability to buy and sell our common stock.\nOur common stock is currently classified as a \u201cpenny stock.\u201d The SEC has adopted Rule 15g-9 which generally defines \u201cpenny stock\u201d to be any equity security that has a market price (as defined) less than $5.00 per share or an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. Our common stock is covered by the penny stock rules, which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell to persons other than established customers and \u201caccredited investors.\u201d The term \u201caccredited investor\u201d refers generally to institutions with assets in excess of $5,000,000 or individuals with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000 or $300,000 jointly with their spouse. The penny stock rules require a broker-dealer, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, to deliver a standardized risk disclosure document in a form prepared by the SEC which provides information about penny stocks and the nature and level of risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction and monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer\u2019s account. The bid and offer quotations, and the broker-dealer and salesperson compensation information, must be given to the customer orally or in writing prior to effecting the transaction and must be given to the customer in writing before or with the customer\u2019s confirmation. In addition, the penny stock rules require that prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser and receive the purchaser\u2019s written agreement to the transaction. These disclosure requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity in the secondary market for the stock that is subject to these penny stock rules. Consequently, these penny stock rules may affect the ability of broker-dealers to trade our securities. We believe that the penny stock rules discourage investor interest in, and limit the marketability of, our common stock.\nIn addition to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules promulgated by the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (\u201cFINRA\u201d) has adopted rules that require that in recommending an investment to a customer, a broker-dealer must have reasonable grounds for believing that the investment is suitable for that customer. Prior to recommending speculative low priced securities to their non-institutional customers, broker-dealers must make reasonable efforts to obtain information about the customer\u2019s financial status, tax status, investment objectives and other information. Under interpretations of these rules, the FINRA believes that there is a high probability that speculative low-priced securities will not be suitable for at least some customers. FINRA\u2019s requirements make it more difficult for broker-dealers to recommend that their customers buy our common stock, which may limit your ability to buy and sell our stock.\nThe market for penny stocks has experienced numerous frauds and abuses that could adversely impact investors in our common stock.\nCompany management believes that the market for penny stocks has suffered from patterns of fraud and abuse. Such patterns include:\n\u2022 control of the market for the security by one or a few broker-dealers that are often related to a promoter or issuer;\n\u2022 manipulation of prices through prearranged matching of purchases and sales and false and misleading press releases;\n\u2022 \u201cboiler room\u201d practices involving high pressure sales tactics and unrealistic price projections by sales persons;\n\u2022 excessive and undisclosed bid-ask differentials and markups by selling broker-dealers; and\n\u2022 wholesale dumping of the same securities by promoters and broker-dealers after prices have been manipulated to a desired level, along with the inevitable collapse of those prices with consequent investor losses.\nOur board of directors has the authority, without shareholder approval, to issue preferred stock with terms that may not be beneficial to common shareholders and with the ability to affect adversely shareholder voting power and perpetuate their control over us.\nOur Articles of Incorporation allows our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock without any vote or further action by our shareholders. Our board of directors has the authority to fix and determine the relative rights and preferences of preferred stock. As a result, our board of directors could authorize the issuance of a series of preferred stock that would grant to holders the preferred right to our assets upon liquidation, the right to receive dividend payments before dividends are distributed to the holders of common stock and the right to the redemption of the shares, together with a premium, prior to the redemption of our common stock.\nThe ability of our principal shareholders to control our business may limit or eliminate minority shareholders\u2019 ability to influence corporate affairs.\nOur principal shareholders own common stock and/or preferred stock which holds a majority of the voting power of our issued and outstanding capital. Accordingly, they will be able to effectively control the election of directors, as well as all other matters requiring shareholder approval. The interests of our principal shareholders may differ from the interests of other shareholders with respect to the issuance of shares, business transactions with or sales to other companies, selection of other directors and other business decisions. The minority shareholders have no way of overriding decisions made by our principal shareholders. This level of control may also have an adverse impact on the market value of our shares because our principal shareholders may institute or undertake transactions, policies or programs that result in losses, may not take any steps to increase our visibility in the financial community and / or may sell sufficient numbers of shares to significantly decrease our price per share.\nWe do not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on our common stock. We do not expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock at any time in the foreseeable future. The future payment of dividends directly depends upon our future earnings, capital requirements, financial requirements and other factors that our board of directors will consider. Since we do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock, return on your investment, if any, will depend solely on an increase, if any, in the market value of our common stock.\nThe \u201cmarket overhang\u201d from our outstanding options, warrants and convertible securities could adversely impact the market price of our common stock.\nAs of the date of this Report, we have 13,638,895 shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding options and warrants and conversion of outstanding convertible securities. Such \u201cmarket overhang\u201d could adversely impact the market price of our common stock as a result of the dilution which would result if such securities were exercised for or converted into shares of common stock.", "PERMNO": 93263, "SIC": 2086, "TIC": "CELH"}
