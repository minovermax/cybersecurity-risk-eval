RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report, the following risks impact our business and operations. These risk factors are not exhaustive and all investors are encouraged to perform their own investigation with respect to our business, financial condition and prospects.\nRisks Related to our Business\nWe have substantial indebtedness and other obligations and any failure to meet our debt service obligations or restrictive covenants would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operation and could cause the market value of our Common Stock to decline.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $1.4 billion of long-term debt, excluding current maturities. In the fourth quarter of 2019, we announced a debt reduction and liquidity improvement initiative, which is part of the Company\u2019s strategic priority to position the Company to long-term success and increased stockholder value. As the first step of this initiative, the Company entered into a five year, $160.0 million accounts receivable securitization facility in January 2020, which has a lower cost of debt than the Company revolving credit facility. The Company is also pursuing the sale of certain non-core assets. While the Company seeks to repay and/or refinance a material portion of its indebtedness through this initiative, there can be no assurance that such plan will be successful in whole or in part and, even if the plan is successful, we will still have a substantial amount of indebtedness outstanding. On March 26, 2020, the Delaware Court of Chancery entered a judgment against one of our subsidiaries in the amount of $57,698,426 inclusive of costs and interest arising out of the Appraisal Action, which judgment will continue to accrue interest, until paid, at the legal rate, compounded quarterly. On May 7, 2020, we filed a motion for new trial in relation to share count. Following the Court\u2019s decision on the motion for new trial, SourceHOV has the right to appeal the judgment. However, at present the judgment has not been stayed, and we expect the petitioners to seek to enforce the judgment. If we are forced to pay the judgment (or bond the judgment pending an appeal, which will likely require cash collateral), such action could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and/or cause our lenders to take action adverse to us. Our indebtedness and other obligations could: require a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to servicing our indebtedness, thereby reducing our ability to use cash flow from operations to fund operations, capital expenditures, and future business opportunities; increase the risks of adverse consequences resulting from a breach of\nany indebtedness agreement, including, for example, a failure to make required payments of principal or interest due to failure of our business to perform as expected; decrease our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, general corporate or other purposes; limit our flexibility to make acquisitions; require non-strategic divestitures; increase our cash requirements to support the payment of interest; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and our industry; and increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions. Our ability to make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness and our ability to comply with financial covenants in our various debt agreements depends upon our future performance, which will be subject to general economic conditions and financial, business and other factors affecting our consolidated operations, many of which are beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt and meet our other cash requirements, we may be required, among other things: to seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets; to refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness; to sell certain of our assets, to the extent permitted under our indebtedness agreements; or to reduce or delay planned capital or operating expenditures. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. In addition, any such financing, refinancing or sale of assets might not be available at all or on economically favorable terms. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations and could cause the market value of our Common Stock to decline.\nOur future profitability and ability to sustain positive cash flow is uncertain.\nOur future profitability depends on, among other things, our ability to generate revenue in excess of our expenses. However, we have significant and continuing fixed costs relating to the maintenance of our assets and business, including debt service requirements, which we may not be able to reduce adequately to sustain our profitability if our revenue decreases. Our profitability also may be impacted by non-cash charges such as stock-based compensation charges and potential impairment of goodwill, which will negatively affect our reported financial results. Even if we achieve profitability on an annual basis, we may not be able to achieve profitability on a quarterly basis. You should not consider prior revenue growth as indicative of our future performance. In fact, in future quarters, we may not have any revenue growth or our revenue could decline. We may incur significant losses in the future for a number of reasons and risks described elsewhere herein and we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown events.\nOur ability to continue to generate positive cash flow depends on our ability to generate collections from sales in excess of our cash expenditures. Our ability to generate and collect on sales can be negatively affected by many factors, including but not limited to our inability to convince new customers to use our services or existing customers to renew their contracts or use additional services; the lengthening of our sales cycles and implementation periods; changes in our customer mix; a decision by any of our existing customers to cease or reduce using our services; failure of customers to pay our invoices on a timely basis or at all; a failure in the performance of our solutions or internal controls that adversely affects our reputation or results in loss of business; the loss of market share to existing or new competitors; the failure to enter or succeed in new markets; regional or global economic conditions or regulations affecting perceived need for or value of our services; or our inability to develop new offerings, expand our offerings or drive adoption of our new offerings on a timely basis and thus potentially not meeting evolving market needs.\nWe anticipate that we will incur increased sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses as we continue to diversify our business into new industries and geographic markets. Our business will also require significant amounts of working capital to support our growth. We may not achieve collections from sales to offset these anticipated expenditures sufficient to maintain positive future cash flow. In addition, we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown events that cause our costs to exceed our expectations. An inability to generate positive cash flow may decrease our long-term viability.\nOur results of operations could in the future be materially adversely impacted by the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19).\nOur results of operations could in the future be materially adversely impacted by the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19). We currently have two priorities: the safety and wellbeing of our employees and their families, and continuing to provide services to our customers in these unprecedented times. The global spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19) has created significant volatility and uncertainty and economic disruption. The extent to which the coronavirus pandemic impacts our business, operations and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict, including: the duration and scope of the pandemic; governmental, business and individuals\u2019 actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic; the impact of the pandemic on economic activity and actions taken in response; the effect on our customers and customer demand for our services and solutions; our ability to sell and provide our services and solutions, including as a result of travel restrictions and people working from home; the ability of our customers to pay for our services and solutions; and any closures of our and our customers' offices and facilities. The spread of the coronavirus has caused us to modify our business practices (including employee travel, employee work locations, and cancellation of physical participation in meetings, events and conferences), and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers and business partners.\nWe provide essential services including payment processing, bills and related exceptions for the financial sector, healthcare industry, and state, federal and local governments, and have accordingly been permitted to continue operating across most of our locations in the United States and across EMEA. The majority of our employees are located in the Americas and EMEA, representing 62% of our total headcount. Our locations in China are operating at full capacity and adding more volume and headcount. Close to two thirds of our India operations, totaling 4,900 employees, have transitioned to work from home and the remainder of volume is transitioning to work from home or is being routed to our other global sites, including China, Mexico and Poland. The closure of facilities, or restrictions inhibiting our employees\u2019 ability to access facilities, has disrupted, and could in the future disrupt our ability to provide our services and solutions and result in, among other things, terminations of customer contracts and losses of revenue. Customers may also slow down decision making, delay planned work or seek to modify existing agreements. Further, key personnel could contract the coronavirus hindering their ability to perform for us. One or more of our physical locations could become a cluster for the coronavirus, causing a large concentration of our employees to be adversely impacted and causing a significant disruption to our operations. Any of these events could cause or contribute to the risks and uncertainties enumerated in our filings with the SEC and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or stock price.\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected by economic and political conditions, creating complex risks, many of which are beyond our control.\nOur business depends on the continued demand for our services, and if current global economic conditions worsen, our business could be adversely affected by our customers\u2019 financial condition and level of business activity. Along with our customers we are subject to global political, economic and market conditions, including inflation, interest rates, energy costs, the impact of natural disasters, disease, military action and the threat of terrorism. In particular, we currently derive, and are likely to continue to derive, a significant portion of revenues from customers located in North America and EMEA. Any future decreases in the general level of economic activity in these markets, such as decreases in business and consumer spending and increases in unemployment rates as have begun to be experienced as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, could result in a decrease in demand for our services, thus reducing our revenue. For example, certain customers may decide to reduce or postpone their spending on the services we provide, and we may be forced to lower our prices. Other developments in response to economic events, such as consolidations, restructurings or reorganizations, particularly involving our customers, could also cause the demand for our services to decline, negatively affecting the amount of business that we are able to obtain or retain. We may not be able to predict the impact such conditions will have on the industries we serve and may be unable to plan effectively for or respond to such impact. In response to economic and market conditions, from time to time we have undertaken or may undertake initiatives to reduce our cost structure where appropriate, such as consolidation of resources to provide functional region-wide support to our international subsidiaries in a centralized fashion. These initiatives, as well as any future workforce and facilities reductions we may implement, may not be sufficient to meet current and future changes in economic and market conditions and allow us to continue to achieve the growth rates expected. In addition, costs actually incurred in connection with certain restructuring actions may be higher than our estimates of such costs and/or may not lead to the anticipated cost savings.\nAdditionally, major political events, including the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union on January 31, 2020 (\u201cBrexit\u201d), continue to create uncertainty on topics that are relevant to our operations in the United Kingdom, such as immigration laws and employment laws, trade agreements and privacy laws. While the United Kingdom has agreed to follow all EU rules until December 31, 2020, and their trading relationship will remain the same during this period, the United Kingdom and the EU are currently in negotiations on the final terms of the United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal. We are currently examining the various possible impacts Brexit may have on our business and operating model in an effort to develop solutions to address any of the potential outcomes. In addition, it is possible that Brexit may adversely affect global economic conditions and financial markets, to a greater extent than we have currently anticipated.\nIn addition, any future disruptions or turbulence in the global credit markets may adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition, and the liquidity and financial condition of our customers. Such disruptions may limit our ability to access financing, increase the cost of financing needed to meet liquidity needs and affect the ability of our customers to use credit to purchase our services or to make timely payments to us, adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have recorded significant goodwill impairment charges and may be required to record additional charges to future earnings if our goodwill or intangible assets become impaired.\nAs of December 31, 2019, our goodwill balance was $358.5 million which represented 28.0% of total consolidated assets. We are required under generally accepted accounting principles to review our intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. Goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our intangible assets and/or goodwill may not be recoverable include a decline in stock price and market capitalization, slower growth rates in our industry or our own operations, and/or other materially adverse events that have implications on the profitability of our business or business segments. We may be required to record additional charges to earnings during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or other intangible assets is determined which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. Even though these charges may be non-cash items and may not have an immediate impact on our liquidity, the fact that we report charges of this nature could contribute to negative market perceptions about us or our securities, including, without limitation, our Common Stock.\nCybersecurity issues, vulnerabilities, and criminal activity resulting in a data or security breach could result in risks to our systems, networks, products, solutions and services resulting in liability or reputational damage.\nWe collect and retain large volumes of internal and customer data, including personally identifiable information and other sensitive data both physically and electronically, for business purposes, and our various information technology systems enter, process, summarize and report such data. We also maintain personally identifiable information about our employees. Safeguarding customer, employee and our own data is a key priority for us, and our customers and employees have come to rely on us for the protection of their personal information. Augmented vulnerabilities, threats and more sophisticated and targeted cyber-related attacks pose a risk to our security and the security of our customers, partners, suppliers and third-party service providers, and to the confidentiality, availability and integrity of data owned by us or our customers. Despite our efforts to protect sensitive, confidential or personal data or information, we may be vulnerable to material security breaches, theft, misplaced or lost data, programming errors, employee errors and/or malfeasance that could potentially lead to the compromise of sensitive, confidential or personal data or information, improper use of our systems, software solutions or networks, unauthorized access, use, disclosure, modification or destruction of information, defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions. Despite protective measures, we may not be successful in preventing security breaches which compromise the confidentiality and integrity of this data. While an attempt is made to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures, including employee training, monitoring and testing, and maintenance of protective systems and contingency plans, we remain vulnerable to such threats. The risk of such threats may be heightened as a result of an extended period of remote work arrangements due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe sensitive, confidential or personal data or information that we have access to is also subject to privacy and security laws, regulations or customer-imposed controls. The regulatory environment, as well as the requirements imposed on us by the industries we serve governing information, security and privacy laws is increasingly demanding. Maintaining compliance with applicable security and privacy regulations may increase our operating costs and/or adversely impact our ability to provide services to our customers. Furthermore, a compromised data system or the intentional, inadvertent or negligent release or disclosure of data could result in theft, loss, fraudulent or unlawful use of customer, employee or our data which could harm our reputation or result in remedial and other costs, fines or lawsuits. In addition, a cyber-related attack could result in other negative consequences, including damage to our reputation or competitiveness, remediation or increased protection costs, litigation or regulatory action. Fraud, employee negligence, and unauthorized access, including, without limitation, malfunctions, viruses and other events beyond our control, may lead to the misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential information we process, store and transmit, including personal information, for our customers, failure to prevent or mitigate data loss or other security breaches, including breaches of our vendors\u2019 technology and systems, could expose us or our customers to a risk of loss or misuse of such information, adversely affect our operating results, result in litigation or potential liability for us and otherwise harm our business. As a result, we may be subject to monetary damages, regulatory enforcement actions or fines under federal legislation, such as, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and HIPAA, as well as various states\u2019 laws, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which became effective on January 1, 2020 or under the GDPR in Europe. Similarly, regulations such as the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 expand the obligations of \u201ccovered entities\u201d and their business associates, including certain mandatory breach notification requirements. In addition to any legal liability, data or security breaches may lead to negative publicity, reputational damage and otherwise adversely affect the results of our operations.\nOur industry may be adversely impacted by a negative public reaction in the U.S. and elsewhere to providing certain of our services from outside the U.S. and related legislation.\nWe have based our strategy of future growth on certain assumptions regarding our industry and future demand in the market for the provision of business process solutions in part using offshore resources. However, providing services from offshore locations is a politically sensitive topic in the U.S. and elsewhere, and many organizations and public figures have publicly expressed concern about a perceived association between offshore service providers and the loss of jobs in their home countries. In addition, there has been some publicity about the negative experience of certain companies that provide their services offshore, particularly in India. The trend of providing business process solutions offshore may not continue and could reverse if companies elect to develop and perform their business processes internally or are discouraged from transferring these services to offshore service providers. Any slowdown or reversal of existing industry trends could negatively affect the amount of business that we are able to obtain or retain.\nA variety of U.S. federal and state legislation has been proposed that, if enacted, could restrict or discourage U.S. companies from providing their services from outside the U.S., including proposals for providing tax and other economic incentives for companies that create jobs in the U.S. by reducing their reliance on offshore locations. Other state bills have proposed requiring offshore service providers to disclose their geographic locations, requiring notice to individuals whose personal information is disclosed to non-U.S. affiliates or subcontractors, requiring disclosures of companies\u2019 foreign outsourcing practices or restricting U.S. private sector companies that have government contracts, grants or guaranteed loan programs from providing their services. Because most of our customers are located in the U.S., any expansion of existing laws or the enactment of new legislation that constrains our ability to provide our solutions from offshore or otherwise makes using our services unappealing or impractical for our customers could have a material and adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe HGM Group has significant influence over us and our corporate governance.\nThe HGM Group has voting control of approximately 50% of our Common Stock. As long as the HGM Group owns or controls a significant percentage of outstanding voting power, it will have the ability to strongly influence all corporate actions requiring stockholder approval, including the election and removal of directors and the size of our board of directors, any amendment of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws, or the approval of any merger or other significant corporate transaction, including a sale of substantially all of our assets. In addition, pursuant to the terms of\nthe Director Nomination Agreement, the HGM Group has certain nomination rights with respect to our board of directors and consent rights over certain of our corporate actions.\nAdditionally, the HGM Group\u2019s interests may not align with the interests of our other stockholders. The HGM Group is in the business of making investments in companies and may acquire and hold interests in businesses that compete directly or indirectly with us. The HGM Group may also pursue acquisition opportunities that may be complementary to our business, and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us. In addition, our certificate of incorporation provides that we renounce any interest or expectancy in the business opportunities of the HGM Group and that it shall not have any obligation to offer to us those opportunities unless presented to one of our directors or officers in his or her capacity as a director or officer of Exela.\nCertain services we provide to customers in our public sector vertical may be subject to additional restrictions or limitations.\nOur engagements with entities in the public sector, may be subject to compliance with additional legislative or regulatory requirements. Certain state and local governments and agencies have adopted, or may in the future adopt, legislation or rules imposing additional requirements on services provided to the public sector, including restrictions as to where certain services can be performed or where certain data can be stored, even within the U.S. Additionally, our employees who are staffed on certain public sector engagements may be subject to strict background checks or other certifications. These additional requirements may make it more difficult to staff large public sector engagements, require us to turn down new engagements, affect our ability to meet customer expectations, deadlines or other specifications and otherwise increase our costs or decrease our revenues. Further, there can be no assurances that a public sector entity will not face funding shortages or reallocate funding for our services to other priorities, either prior to or after we have begun to perform our services, which could impact whether we are fully compensated for our services and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, the results of the 2020 U.S. presidential election could have further impacts on our work in the public sector if new policies or funding priorities are enacted.\nCertain of our contracts are subject to termination rights, audits and/or investigations, which, if exercised, could negatively impact our reputation and reduce our ability to compete for new contracts and have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nMany of our customer contracts may be terminated by our customers without cause and without any fee or penalty, with only limited notice. Any failure to meet a customer\u2019s expectations, as well as factors beyond our control, including a customer\u2019s financial condition, strategic priorities, or mergers and acquisitions, could result in a cancellation or non-renewal of such a contract or a decrease in business provided to us and cause our actual results to differ from our forecasts. We may not be able to replace any customer that elects to terminate or not renew its contract with us, which would reduce our revenues.\nIn addition, a portion of our revenues is derived from contracts with the U.S. federal and state governments and their agencies and from contracts with foreign governments and their agencies. Government entities typically finance projects through appropriated funds. While these projects are often planned and executed as multi-year projects, government entities usually reserve the right to change the scope of or terminate these projects for lack of approved funding and/or at their convenience. Changes in government or political developments, including budget deficits, shortfalls or uncertainties, government spending reductions (e.g., during a government shutdown) or other debt or funding constraints could result in lower governmental sales and in our projects being reduced in price or scope or terminated altogether, which also could limit our recovery of incurred costs, reimbursable expenses and profits on work completed prior to the termination. The public procurement environment is unpredictable and this could adversely affect our ability to perform work under new and existing contracts. Also, our government business is subject to the risk that one or more of our potential contracts or contract extensions may be diverted by the contracting agency to a small or disadvantaged or minority-owned business pursuant to set-aside programs administered by the Small Business Administration, or may be bundled into large multiple award contracts for very large businesses. These risks can potentially have an adverse effect on our revenue growth and profit margins.\nIf the government finds that it inappropriately charged any costs to a contract, the costs are not reimbursable or, if already reimbursed, the cost must be refunded to the government. Additionally, if the government discovers improper or illegal activities or contractual non-compliance (including improper billing), we may be subject to various civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, which may include termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions or debarment from doing business with the government. Any resulting penalties or sanctions could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, government contracts are generally subject to audits and investigations by government agencies. Further, the negative publicity that could arise from any such penalties, sanctions or findings in such audits or investigations could have an adverse effect on our reputation in the industry and reduce our ability to compete for new contracts and could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur services and facilities may be impacted by terrorism, natural disasters and other disruptions, resulting in an adverse effect on our profitability and financial condition.\nOur ability to provide services may be impacted or disrupted as a result of natural disasters, technical disruptions (including power outage and telecommunications failure), man-made events (including cyber-attacks, war and terrorist attacks), and global health risks or pandemics, including the coronavirus, as well as the threat or perceived threat of any of these events in the U.S. or any of the locations in which we operate. A significant portion of our employees and key operations centers are located in India and the Philippines, with, particularly in India, limited diversification or redundancy. India and the Philippines are particularly susceptible to natural disasters, including typhoons, tsunamis, floods and earthquakes, and the Philippines is additionally susceptible to volcanic eruptions. Our operations in these locations, as well as certain other countries outside of the U.S., are also at greater risk of disruptions in electricity, other public utilities or network services due to substandard infrastructure. Although all of our operations centers have disaster management plans, certain disaster management facilities, particularly in India, may not be adequate to protect against potential disruptions due to natural or other disasters. Damage, destruction or disruptions, including to our MegaCenters, could make it difficult or impossible for employees to reach our business locations or otherwise interrupt our ability to provide our services. Sustained periods of interruption in our services could adversely affect our reputation and relationships with our customers, cause us to incur substantial expenses and expose us to liability. Our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and our business, results of operation and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nAny disruption related to our U.S. data centers or MegaCenters due to any of the foregoing events may cause significant disruptions in our ability to provide our services to our customers and result in a material adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations and financial condition and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nAlthough we believe that our insurance coverage with respect to disruptive events is reasonable, significant events such as acts of war and terrorism, economic conditions, judicial decisions, legislation, natural disasters and large losses could materially affect our insurance obligations and future expense.\nOur executives, senior management team and other key personnel are critical to our continued success and the loss of such personnel, or an inability to attract, engage, retain and integrate our executives and other key employees could harm our business.\nOur future success substantially depends on the continued service and performance of our executives, senior management team, as well as other key individuals in senior leadership positions. These personnel possess business and technical capabilities that are difficult to replace. The loss of any of our key personnel, particularly to competitors, may adversely affect our ability to effectively manage our current operations or meet ongoing and future business challenges. Further, identifying, developing internally or hiring externally, training and retraining highly-skilled managerial, technical, sales and services, finance and marketing personnel are critical to our future. Failure to successfully hire executives and key employees or the loss of any executives and key employees could have a significant impact on our operations.\nOur business, financial position, and results of operations could be harmed by adverse rating actions by credit rating agencies.\nIf the credit ratings of our outstanding indebtedness are downgraded, or if rating agencies indicate that a downgrade may occur, our business, financial position, and results of operations could be adversely affected and perceptions of our financial strength could be damaged. A downgrade would have the effect of increasing our borrowing costs, and could decrease the availability of funds we are able to borrow, adversely affecting our business, financial position, and results of operations. In addition, a downgrade could adversely affect our relationships with our customers.\nOur current failure to meet the continued listing requirements of Nasdaq could result in a delisting of our Common Stock.\nOur Common Stock is currently listed for trading on The Nasdaq Capital Market, and the continued listing of our Common Stock on The Nasdaq Capital Market is subject to our compliance with a number of listing standards. In November 2019, we received a notice from Nasdaq that because the closing bid price for our Common Stock had fallen below $1.00 per share for 30 consecutive business days, we no longer complied with the $1.00 minimum bid price requirement for continued listing on The Nasdaq Capital Market under Rule 5550(a)(2) of the Nasdaq Listing Rules. Pursuant to Nasdaq Listing Rules, as tolled for the current COVID-19 pandemic, we have until August 10, 2020 to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. To regain compliance, the closing bid price of the Company\u2019s Common Stock must meet or exceed $1.00 per share for a minimum of 10 consecutive business days prior to August 10, 2020. In addition, in April 2020 we received an additional notice specifying that we are not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(b)(2) because for 30 consecutive business days our Market Value of Listed Securities (\u201cMVLS\u201d) was below the minimum requirement of $35 million. While we have since regained compliance with the MVLS requirement by having our MVLS close at or above $35 million for a minimum of ten consecutive business days, there can be no assurance that our MVLS will not again fall below $35 million for a period of 30 consecutive business days.\nIf we do not regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement by August 10, 2020, we may be eligible for an additional grace period. To qualify, we would be required to meet the continued listing requirements for MVLS and all other initial listing standards for The Nasdaq Capital Market, with the exception of the minimum bid price requirement, and provide written notice of our intention to cure the minimum bid price deficiency during the second compliance period. If we meet these requirements, the Nasdaq staff will grant an additional 180 calendar days for us to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement. If the Nasdaq staff determines that we will not be able to cure the deficiency, or if we are otherwise not eligible for such additional compliance period, Nasdaq will provide notice that our Common Stock will be subject to delisting. We would have the right to appeal a determination to delist our Common Stock, and the Common Stock would remain listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market until the completion of the appeal process. Separate from the bid price and MVLS issues, on April 2, 2020, the Company received a notice from Nasdaq notifying the Company that, as a result of its failure to timely file this Annual Report, it is not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5250(c)(1), which requires timely filing of periodic reports with the SEC. In the notice, Nasdaq indicated that the Company had 60 calendar days from the date of the notice (or until June 2, 2020) to submit a plan to regain compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s continued listing requirements. The Company submitted its plan on June 1, 2020 requesting that the Nasdaq staff grant the Company until September 28, 2020, to regain compliance by filing this Form 10-K. If our Common Stock were no longer listed on The Nasdaq Capital Market, investors might only be able to trade on one of the over-the-counter markets. This would impair the liquidity of our Common Stock not only in the number of shares that could be bought and sold at a given price, which might be depressed by the relative illiquidity, but also through delays in the timing of transactions and reduction in media coverage. In addition, we could face significant material adverse consequences, including:\n\u00b7\na limited availability of market quotations for our securities;\n\u00b7\na limited amount of news and analyst coverage for us; and\n\u00b7\na decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nWe may take actions to restore our compliance with Nasdaq's listing requirements, but we can provide no assurance that any such action taken by us would allow our Common Stock to become listed again, stabilize the market price or improve the liquidity of our Common Stock or prevent future non-compliance with Nasdaq's listing requirements.\nThe requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management\u2019s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the listing requirements of the Nasdaq and other applicable securities rules and regulations. Compliance with these rules and regulations will increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly, and increase demand on our systems and resources, particularly as we are no longer an emerging growth company. Among other things, the Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and operating results and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. In order to maintain and, if required, improve our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting to meet this standard, significant resources and management oversight may be required. As a result, management\u2019s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could harm our business and operating results. Although we have already hired additional employees to comply with these requirements, we may need to hire even more employees in the future, which will increase our costs and expenses.\nIn addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time consuming. These laws, regulations, and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expense and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be harmed.\nAs a result of being a public company and these new rules and regulations, it is more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and in the future we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our board of directors, particularly to serve on our audit committee and compensation committee, and qualified executive officers.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements or comply with applicable regulations could be impaired.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the \"Sarbanes-Oxley Act\"), and the listing standards of the Nasdaq Stock Market. We expect that the requirements of these rules and regulations will continue to increase our legal, accounting and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time consuming and costly, and place significant strain on our personnel, systems and resources.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. We are continuing to develop and refine our disclosure controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we will file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that information required to be disclosed in reports under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our principal executive and financial officers. We are also continuing to improve our internal control over financial reporting. In order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures\nand internal control over financial reporting, we have expended, and anticipate that we will continue to expend, significant resources, including accounting-related costs and significant management oversight.\nOur current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate because of changes in conditions in our business. Further, weaknesses in our disclosure controls or our internal control over financial reporting may be discovered in the future. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls, or any difficulties encountered in their implementation or improvement, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and may result in a restatement of our financial statements for prior periods. Any failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting also could adversely affect the results of management evaluations of our internal control over financial reporting that we are required to include in our periodic reports that we file with the SEC. Ineffective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial and other information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our Common Stock. In addition, if we are unable to meet these requirements, we may not be able to remain listed on the Nasdaq Stock Market.\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 and based on its assessment, our management, including our CEO and CFO, has concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2019 due to material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting.\nAny failure to maintain effective disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting could have a material and adverse effect on our business and operating results and cause a decline in the price of our Common Stock.\nInternal control matters are more fully discussed in Part II-Item 9A - Controls and Procedures of this Annual Report.\nDowngrades in our credit ratings could impact our ability to access capital and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCredit rating agencies continually review their ratings for the companies that they follow, including us. Credit rating agencies also evaluate the industries in which we and our affiliates operate as a whole and may change their credit rating for us based on their overall view of such industries. Both Moody\u2019s and Standard and Poor\u2019s downgraded our ratings during 2019. There can be no assurance that any rating assigned to our currently outstanding public debt securities will remain in effect for any given period of time or that any such ratings will not be further lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in that rating agency\u2019s judgment, circumstances so warrant.\nA further downgrade of our credit ratings could, among other things:\n\u00b7\nlimit our ability to access capital or otherwise adversely affect the availability of other new financing on favorable terms, if at all;\n\u00b7\nresult in more restrictive covenants in agreements governing the terms of any future indebtedness that we may incur;\n\u00b7\ncause us to refinance indebtedness with less favorable terms and conditions, which debt may require collateral and restrict, among other things, our ability to pay distributions or repurchase shares;\n\u00b7\nincrease our cost of borrowing;\n\u00b7\nadversely affect the market price of our outstanding debt securities; and\n\u00b7\nimpair our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nIf we are unable to attract, train and retain skilled professionals, including highly skilled technical personnel to satisfy customer demand and senior management to lead our business globally, our business and results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nOur success is dependent, in large part, on our ability to keep our supply of skilled professionals, including project managers, IT engineers and senior technical personnel, in balance with customer demand around the world and on our ability to attract and retain senior management with the knowledge and skills to lead our business globally. Each year, we must hire several hundred new professionals and retrain, retain, and motivate our workforce across the globe. Competition for skilled labor is intense and, in some jurisdictions in which we operate, there are more jobs for certain professionals than qualified persons to fill these jobs. Costs associated with recruiting and training professionals can be significant. If we are unable to hire or deploy employees with the needed skillsets or if we are unable to adequately equip our employees with the skills needed, this could materially adversely affect our business. Additionally, if we are unable to maintain an employee environment that is competitive and contemporary, it could have an adverse effect on engagement and retention, which may materially adversely affect our business. If more stringent labor laws become applicable to us or if a significant number of our employees unionize, our profitability may be adversely affected.\nIncreased labor costs due to competition, increased minimum wage or employee benefits costs (including various federal, state and local actions to increase minimum wages), unionization activity or other factors would adversely impact our cost of sales and operating expenses. For example, the State of California has passed regulations which increased minimum wage rates from $10.50 per hour to $15.00 per hour by 2022. In addition, the federal government and a number of other states are evaluating various proposals to increase their respective minimum wage. As minimum wage rates increase, we may need to increase not only the wages of our minimum wage employees but also the wages paid to employees at wage rates that are above minimum wage. As a result, we anticipate that our labor costs will continue to increase.\nWe are also subject to applicable rules and regulations relating to our relationship with our employees, including minimum wage and break requirements, health benefits, unemployment and sales taxes, overtime, and working conditions and immigration status. Legislated increases in the minimum wage and increases in additional labor cost components, such as employee benefit costs, workers\u2019 compensation insurance rates, compliance costs and fines, as well as the cost of litigation in connection with these regulations, would increase our labor costs. Unionizing and collective bargaining efforts have received increased attention nationwide in recent periods. While a small number of our employees belong to unions, should our employees become represented by unions, we would be obligated to bargain with those unions with respect to wages, hours, and other terms and conditions of employment, which is likely to increase our labor costs. Moreover, as part of the process of union organizing and collective bargaining, strikes and other work stoppages may occur, which would cause disruption to our business. Similarly, many employers nationally in similar environments have been subject to actions brought by governmental agencies and private individuals under wage-hour laws on a variety of claims, such as improper classification of workers as exempt from overtime pay requirements and failure to pay overtime wages properly, with such actions sometimes brought as class actions. These actions can result in material liabilities and expenses. Should we be subject to employment litigation, such as actions involving wage-hour, overtime, break, and working time, we may distract our management from business matters and result in increased labor costs. If costs of labor increase significantly, our business, results of operations, and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nWe may not always offset increased costs with increased fees under long-term contracts.\nThe pricing and other terms of our customer contracts, particularly our long-term contact center agreements, are based on estimates and assumptions we make at the time we enter into these contracts. These estimates reflect our best judgments regarding the nature of the engagement and our expected costs to provide the contracted services and could differ from actual results. Not all our larger long-term contracts allow for escalation of fees as our cost of operations increase and those that allow for such escalations do not always allow increases at rates comparable to increases that we experience. If and where we cannot negotiate long-term contract terms that provide for fee adjustments to reflect increases in our cost of service delivery, our business, financial conditions, and results of operation would be materially impacted.\nOur business process automation solutions often require long selling cycles and long implementation periods that may result in significant upfront expenses that may not be recovered.\nWe often face long selling cycles to secure new contracts for our business process automation solutions. If we are successful in obtaining an engagement, the selling cycle can be followed by a long implementation period during which we plan our services in detail and demonstrate to the customer our ability to successfully integrate our solutions with the customer\u2019s internal operations. Our customers may experience delays in obtaining internal approvals or delays associated with technology or system implementations which can further lengthen the selling cycle or implementation period, and certain engagements may also require a ramping up period after implementation before we can commence providing our services. Even if we succeed in developing a relationship with a potential customer and begin to discuss the services in detail, the potential customer may choose a competitor or decide to retain the work in-house prior to the time a contract is signed. In addition, once a contract is signed, we sometimes do not begin to receive revenue until completion of the implementation period and our solution is fully operational. The extended lengths of our selling cycles and implementation periods can result in the incurrence of significant upfront expenses that may never result in profits or may result in profits only after a significant period of time has elapsed, which may negatively impact our financial performance. For example, we generally hire new employees to provide services in connection with certain large engagements once a new contract is signed. Accordingly, we may incur significant costs associated with these hires before we collect corresponding revenues. Our inability to obtain contractual commitments after a selling cycle, maintain contractual commitments after the implementation period or limit expenses prior to the receipt of corresponding revenue may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe face significant competition from U.S.-based and non-U.S.-based companies and from our customers who may elect to perform their business processes in-house.\nOur industry is highly competitive, fragmented and subject to rapid change. We compete primarily against large multi-national information technology companies, focused BPO companies based in offshore locations, BPO divisions of information technology companies located in India, other BPO and consulting providers that focus on the legal sector and the in-house capabilities of our customers and potential customers. These competitors may include entrants from adjacent industries or entrants in geographic locations with lower costs than those in which we operate.\nWe believe that the principal competitive factors in our markets are breadth and depth of process expertise, knowledge of industries served, service quality, scalability of solutions, the ability to attract, train and retain qualified people, compliance rigor, global delivery capabilities, outcome-based pricing and sales and customer management capabilities. Some of our competitors have greater financial, marketing, technological or other resources, larger customer bases and more established reputations or brand awareness than we do. In addition, some of our competitors who do not have, or have limited, global delivery capabilities may expand their delivery centers to the countries in which we operate or increase their capacity in lower cost geographies, which could result in increased competition. Some of our competitors may also enter into strategic or commercial relationships among themselves or with larger, more established companies in order to benefit from increased scale and enhanced scope capabilities or enter into similar arrangements with potential customers. Further, we expect competition to intensify in the future as more companies enter our markets and customers consolidate the services they require among fewer vendors. Increased competition, our inability to compete successfully against competitors, pricing pressures or loss of market share could result in reduced operating margins, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur industry is characterized by rapid technological change and failure to compete successfully within the industry and address rapid technological change could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe process of developing new services and solutions is inherently complex and uncertain. It requires accurate anticipation of customers\u2019 changing needs and emerging technological trends. We must make long-term investments and commit significant resources before knowing whether these investments will eventually result in services that achieve customer acceptance and generate the revenues required to provide desired returns. If we fail to accurately anticipate and meet our customers\u2019 needs through the development of new technologies and service offerings or if our new services are not widely accepted, we could lose market share and customers to our competitors and that could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nMore specifically, the business process solutions industry is characterized by rapid technological change, evolving industry standards and changing customer preferences. The success of our business depends, in part, upon our ability to develop technology and solutions that keep pace with changes in our industry and the industries of our customers. Although we have made, and will continue to make, significant investments in the research, design and development of new technology and platforms-driven solutions, we may not be successful in addressing these changes on a timely basis or in marketing the changes we implement. In addition, products or technologies developed by others may render our services uncompetitive or obsolete. Failure to address these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, existing and potential customers are actively shifting their businesses away from paper-based environments to electronic environments with reduced needs for physical document management and processing. This shift may result in decreased demand for the physical document management services we provide such that our business and revenues may become more reliant on technology-based services in electronic environments, which are typically provided at lower prices compared to physical document management services. Though we have solutions for customers seeking to make these types of transitions, a significant shift by our customers away from physical documents to non-paper based technologies, whether now existing or developed in the future, could adversely affect our business, results of operation and financial condition.\nAlso, some of the large international companies in the industry have significant financial resources and compete with us to provide document processing services and/or business process services. We compete primarily on the basis of technology, performance, price, quality, reliability, brand, distribution and customer service and support. Our success in future performance is largely dependent upon our ability to compete successfully, to promptly and effectively react to changing technologies and customer expectations and to expand into additional market segments. To remain competitive, we must develop services and applications; periodically enhance our existing offerings; remain cost efficient; and attract and retain key personnel and management. If we are unable to compete successfully, we could lose market share and important customers to our competitors and that could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe rely, in some cases, on third-party hardware and software, which could cause errors or failures of our services and could also result in adverse effects for our business and reputation if these third-party services fail to perform properly or are no longer available.\nAlthough we developed our platform-driven solutions internally, we rely, in some cases, on third-party hardware and software in connection with our service offerings which we either purchase or lease from third-party vendors. We are generally able to select from a number of competing hardware and software applications, but the complexity and unique specifications of the hardware or software makes design defects and software errors difficult to detect. Any errors or defects in third-party hardware or software incorporated into our service offerings, may result in a delay or loss of revenue, diversion of resources, damage to our reputation, the loss of the affected customer, loss of future business, increased service costs or potential litigation claims against us.\nFurther, this hardware and software may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Any loss of the right to use any of this hardware or software could result in delays in the provisioning of our services, which could negatively affect our business until equivalent technology is either developed by us or, if available, is identified, obtained and integrated. In addition, it is possible that our hardware vendors or the licensors of third-party software could increase the prices they charge, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. Further, changing hardware vendors or software licensors could detract from management\u2019s ability to focus on the ongoing operations of our business or could cause delays in the operations of our business.\nSome of the work we do involves greater risks than other types of claims processing or document management engagements.\nWe provide certain business process solutions for customers that, for financial, legal or other reasons, may present higher risks compared to other types of claims processing or document management engagements. Examples of higher risk engagements include, but are not limited to:\n\u00b7\nclass action and other legal distributions involving significant sums of money;\n\u00b7\neconomic analysis and expert testimony in high stakes legal matters; and\n\u00b7\nengagements where we receive or process sensitive data, including personal consumer or private health information.\nWhile we attempt to identify higher risk engagements and customers and mitigate our exposure by taking certain preventive measures and, where necessary, turning down certain engagements, these efforts may be ineffective and an actual or alleged error or omission on our part, the part of our customer or other third parties or possible fraudulent activity in one or more of these higher-risk engagements could result in the diversion of management resources, damage to our reputation, increased service costs or impaired market acceptance of our services, any of which could negatively impact our business and our financial condition.\nWe encounter professional conflicts of interest.\nWe encounter professional conflicts of interest, particularly in our provision of expert witness testimony in certain of our legal engagement services. Although we have systems and procedures to identify potential conflicts of interest prior to accepting a new engagement, there is no guarantee that all potential conflicts of interest will be identified, and undetected conflicts may result in damage to our reputation and result in professional liability, which may adversely impact our business and results of operations. If we are unable to accept new engagements for any reason, including business and legal conflicts, our professionals may become underutilized or discontented, which may adversely affect our future revenues and results of operations, as well as our ability to retain these professionals.\nNew, more stringent privacy and data security regulations may have a negative impact on our business.\nAny inability to adequately address privacy and security concerns could result in expenses and liability, and adverse impact on us. Moreover, international privacy and data security regulations may become more complex and have greater consequences. For instance, as of May 25, 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, has replaced the Data Protection Directive with respect to the collection and use of personal data of data subjects in the EU. The GDPR applies extra territorially and imposes several stringent requirements for controllers and processors of personal data, including, for example, higher standards for obtaining consent from individuals to process their personal data, more robust disclosures to individuals and a strengthened individual data rights regime, shortened timelines for data breach notifications, limitations on retention of information, increased requirements pertaining to health data, other special categories of personal data and pseudonymised (i.e., key-coded) data and additional obligations when we contract third-party processors in connection with the processing of the personal data. The GDPR provides that EU member states may make their own further laws and regulations limiting the processing of personal data, including genetic, biometric or health data, which could limit our ability to use and share personal data or could cause our costs could increase, and harm our business and financial condition. Failure to comply with the requirements of GDPR and the applicable national data protection laws of the EU Member States may result in fines of up to \u20ac20,000,000 or up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher, and other administrative penalties.\nSimilar to the GDPR, the CCPA, which became effective January 1, 2020, grants California residents with several new rights relating to their personal information. The CCPA applies to businesses that conduct business in California and satisfies one of three financial conditions, including a business that has a gross revenue greater than $25 million. The CCPA sets forth several data protection obligations for applicable businesses, including, but not limited to\nthe obligations to inform a consumer, at or before collection, of the purpose and intended use of the collection; and to delete a consumer\u2019s personal information upon request. As for penalties and fines, the CCPA establishes a private right of action for serious data breaches, which allows consumers the right to seek damages. The CCPA also allows the California Attorney General to bring actions against non-compliant businesses with fines of $2,500 per violation or, if intentional, up to $7,500 per violation.\nAny future failure by us to comply with the GDPR and/or CCPA could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Further, as the GDPR and CCPA have recently come into effect, enforcement priorities and interpretation of certain provisions are still unclear. Industry groups also impose self-regulatory standards that bind us by their incorporation into the contracts we execute. For example, should we fail to be compliant with the PCIDSS we may be subject to fines and other penalties.\nOur business could be materially and adversely affected if we do not protect our intellectual property or if our services are found to infringe on the intellectual property of others.\nOur success depends in part on certain methodologies and practices we utilize in developing and implementing applications and other proprietary intellectual property rights. In order to protect such rights, we rely upon a combination of nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements, as well as trade secret, copyright, trademark and patent laws. We also generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, customers and potential customers and limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information. There can be no assurance that the laws, rules, regulations and treaties in effect in the U.S., India and the other jurisdictions in which we operate and the contractual and other protective measures we take are adequate to protect us from misappropriation or unauthorized use of our intellectual property, or that such laws will not change. There can be no assurance that the resources invested by us to protect our intellectual property will be sufficient or that our intellectual property portfolio will adequately deter misappropriation or improper use of our technology, and our intellectual property rights may not prevent competitors from independently developing or selling products and services similar to or duplicative of ours. We may not be able to detect unauthorized use and take appropriate steps to enforce our rights, and any such steps may be costly and unsuccessful. Infringement by others of our intellectual property, including the costs of enforcing our intellectual property rights, may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. We could also face competition in some countries where we have not invested in an intellectual property portfolio. If we are not able to protect our intellectual property, the value of our brand and other intangible assets may be diminished, and our business may be adversely affected. Further, although we believe that we are not infringing on the intellectual property rights of others, claims may nonetheless be successfully asserted against us in the future, and we may be the target of enforcement of patents or other intellectual property by third parties, including aggressive and opportunistic enforcement claims by non-practicing entities. Regardless of the merit of such claims, responding to infringement claims can be expensive and time-consuming. If we are found to infringe any third-party rights, we could be required to pay substantial damages or we could be enjoined from offering some of our products and services. The costs of defending any such claims could be significant, and any successful claim may require us to modify our services. The value of, or our ability to use, our intellectual property may also be negatively impacted by dependencies on third parties, such as our ability to obtain or renew on reasonable terms licenses that we need in the future, or our ability to secure or retain ownership or rights to use data in certain software analytics or services offerings. Any such circumstances may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe generate a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers, and any loss of business from these customers could materially reduce our revenues.\nWe have derived, and believe that in the foreseeable future we will continue to derive, a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers. While we have no one customer that accounts for more than 10% of our revenue, for each of the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 26% of our revenues.\nOur ability to maintain close relationships with these and other major customers is essential to the growth and profitability of our business. However, the volume of work performed for a specific customer is likely to vary from year to year. A major customer in one year may not provide the same level of revenues for us in any subsequent year and\nthere can be no assurance that any customer will extend or renew its contract with us. The business process solutions we provide to our customers, and the revenues and net income from those services, may decline or vary as the type and quantity of services we provide change over time. Furthermore, our reliance on any individual customer for a significant portion of our revenues may give that customer a certain degree of pricing leverage against us when negotiating contracts and terms of service.\nIn addition, a number of factors other than our performance could cause the loss of or reduction in business or revenues from a customer, and these factors are not predictable. For example, a customer may decide to reduce spending on business process solutions from us due to a challenging economic environment or other factors, both internal and external, relating to our business. These factors may include corporate restructuring, pricing pressure, changes to our outsourcing strategy, switching to another BPO provider or returning work in-house or other changes in a customer\u2019s prospects or profitability. The risk of customer loss may be heightened as a result of recent economic volatility due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The loss of any of our major customers, or a significant decrease in the volume of work they give to us or the price at which we are able to provide our services to them, could materially adversely affect our revenues and thus our results of operations.\nOur revenues are highly dependent on a limited number of industries, and any decrease in demand for business process solutions in these industries could reduce our revenues and adversely affect the results of operations.\nA substantial portion of our revenues are derived from three specific industry-based segments: ITPS, HS, and LLPS. Customers in ITPS accounted for 79.0% and 80.3% of our revenues in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Customers in HS accounted for 16.4% and 14.4% of our revenues in 2019 and 2018, respectively. Customers in LLPS accounted for 4.6% and 5.3% of our revenues in 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nOur success largely depends on continued demand for our services from customers in these segments, and a downturn or reversal of the demand for business process solutions in any of these segments, or the introduction of regulations that restrict or discourage companies from engaging our services, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, consolidation in any of these industries or combinations or mergers, particularly involving our customers, may decrease the potential number of customers for our services. We have been affected by the worsening of economic conditions and significant consolidation in the financial services industry and continuation of this trend may negatively affect our revenues and profitability. The COVID-19 pandemic, may lead to further increased consolidation in the financial services industry as larger, better capitalized competitors will be in a stronger position to withstand prolonged periods of economic downturn and sustain their business through the financial volatility.\nWe derive significant revenue and profit from commercial and government contracts awarded through competitive bidding processes, including renewals, which can impose substantial costs on us, and we will not achieve revenue and profit objectives if we fail to accurately and effectively bid on such projects.\nMany of these contracts are extremely complex and require the investment of significant resources in order to prepare accurate bids and proposals. Competitive bidding imposes substantial costs and presents a number of risks, including: (i) the substantial cost and managerial time and effort that we spend to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that may or may not be awarded to us; (ii) the need to estimate accurately the resources and costs that will be required to implement and service any contracts we are awarded, sometimes in advance of the final determination of their full scope and design; (iii) the expense and delay that may arise if our competitors protest or challenge awards made to us pursuant to competitive bidding and the risk that such protests or challenges could result in the requirement to resubmit bids and in the termination, reduction or modification of the awarded contracts; and (iv) the opportunity cost of not bidding on and winning other contracts we might otherwise pursue. If our competitors protest or challenge an award made to us on a government contract, the costs to defend such an award may be significant and could involve subsequent litigation that could take years to resolve.\nOur profitability is dependent upon our ability to obtain adequate pricing for our services and to improve our cost structure.\nOur success depends on our ability to obtain adequate pricing for our services. Depending on competitive market factors, future prices we obtain for our services may decline from previous levels. If we are unable to obtain adequate pricing for our services, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, our contracts are increasingly requiring tighter timelines for implementation as well as more stringent service level metrics. This makes the bidding process for new contracts much more difficult and requires us to adequately consider these requirements in the pricing of our services.\nWe regularly review our operations with a view towards reducing our cost structure, including, without limitation, reducing our employee base, exiting certain businesses, improving process and system efficiencies and outsourcing some internal functions. We, from time to time, engage in restructuring actions to reduce our cost structure. If we are unable to continue to maintain our cost base at or below the current level and maintain process and systems changes resulting from prior restructuring actions or to realize the expected cost reductions in the ongoing strategic transformation program, it could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, in order to meet the service requirements of our customers, which often includes 24/7 service, and to optimize our employee cost base, including our back-office support, we often locate our delivery service and back-office support centers in lower-cost locations, including several developing countries. Concentrating our centers in these locations presents a number of operational risks, many of which are beyond our control, including the risks of political instability, natural disasters, safety and security risks, labor disruptions, excessive employee turnover and rising labor rates. Additionally, a change in the political environment in the U.S. or the adoption and enforcement of legislation and regulations curbing the use of such centers outside of the U.S. could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. These risks could impair our ability to effectively provide services to our customers and keep our costs aligned to our associated revenues and market requirements.\nOur ability to sustain and improve profit margins is dependent on a number of factors, including our ability to continue to improve the cost efficiency of our operations through such programs as robotic process automation, to absorb the level of pricing pressures on our services through cost improvements and to successfully complete information technology initiatives. If any of these factors adversely materialize or if we are unable to achieve and maintain productivity improvements through restructuring actions or information technology initiatives, our ability to offset labor cost inflation and competitive price pressures would be impaired, each of which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to regular customer and third-party security reviews and failure to pass these may have an adverse impact on our operations.\nMany of our customer contracts require that we maintain certain physical and/or information security standards, and, in certain cases, we permit a customer to audit our compliance with these contractual standards. Any failure to meet such standards or pass such audits may have a material adverse impact on our business. Further, customers from time to time may require stricter physical and/or information security than they negotiated in their contracts, and may condition continued volumes and business on the satisfaction of such additional requirements. Some of these requirements may be expensive to implement or maintain, and may not be factored into our contract pricing. Further, on an annual basis we obtain third-party audits of certain of our locations in accordance with Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements No. 16 (SSAE 16) put forth by the Auditing Standards Board (ASB) of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA). SSAE 16 is the current standard for reporting on controls at service organizations, and many of our customers expect that we will perform an annual SSAE 16 audit, and report to them the results. Negative findings in such an audit and/or the failure to adequately remediate in a timely fashion such negative findings may cause customers to terminate their contracts or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our reputation, results of operation and financial condition.\nFailure to adhere to the regulations that govern our business could have an adverse impact on our operations.\nOur customers are often subject to regulations that may require that we comply with certain rules and regulations in performing services for them that would not otherwise apply to us. U.S. federal laws and regulations that apply to certain portions of our business include the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, HIPAA, and the HITECH Act of 2009. We must also comply with applicable regulations relating to healthcare and other personal information that we process as part of our services. Due to our global delivery model, we are also subject to the burden and expense of complying with the laws and regulations of various jurisdictions and changes thereto which are beyond our control. In addition, our contracts with some of our customers require us to remain knowledgeable about and comply with a number of additional relevant consumer protection laws and other regulatory requirements. Failure to perform our services in a manner that complies with any such requirement could result in breaches of contracts with our customers. Our failure to comply with any applicable laws and regulations could subject us to civil fines and criminal penalties.\nA significant portion of our assets and operations are located in India, the Philippines, China and Mexico, and we are subject to regulatory, economic and political uncertainties in those locations.\nA significant number of our operations centers are located in India, the Philippines and China and a majority of our assets and our professionals are located in those locations. We intend to continue to develop and expand our facilities in these areas. Our financial performance may be adversely affected by general economic conditions and economic and fiscal policy in these countries, including changes in exchange rates and controls, interest rates and taxation policies, as well as social stability and political, economic or diplomatic developments affecting those countries in the future. These countries have experienced significant economic growth over the last several years, but face major challenges in sustaining that growth in the years ahead. These challenges include the need for substantial infrastructure development and improving access to healthcare and education. Our ability to recruit, train and retain qualified employees, develop and operate our operations centers, and attract and retain customers could be adversely affected if these countries do not successfully meet these challenges.\nIn the early 1990s, India experienced significant inflation, low growth in gross domestic product and shortages of foreign currency reserves. The Indian government, however, has exercised and continues to exercise significant influence over many aspects of the Indian economy. India\u2019s government has provided significant tax incentives and relaxed certain regulatory restrictions in order to encourage foreign investment in specified sectors of the economy, including the BPO industry. Certain of those programs that have benefited us include tax holidays, liberalized import and export duties and preferential rules on foreign investment and repatriation. We cannot assure you that liberalization policies will continue. Various factors, such as changes in the current federal government, could trigger significant changes in India\u2019s economic liberalization and deregulation policies and disrupt business and economic conditions in India generally and our business in particular.\nThe Philippines has experienced significant inflation, currency declines and shortages of foreign exchange. In addition, the Philippines has experienced and may continue to experience civil unrest, terrorism and political turmoil, resulting in temporary work stoppages and technology outages. These instabilities and any adverse changes in the political environment in the Philippines could increase our operational costs, increase our exposure to legal and business risks and make it more difficult for us to operate our business in the Philippines.\nOur business operations in China may be adversely affected by our current and future political environment and the outbreak of the coronavirus. The Chinese government can exert substantial influence and control over the manner in which companies in China conduct business. Under the current government leadership, the government of China has been pursuing economic reform policies that encourage private economic activity and greater economic decentralization. There is no assurance, however, that the government of China will continue to pursue these policies, or that it will not significantly alter these policies from time to time without notice.\nOur ability to efficiently conduct our business activities in Mexico is subject to changes in government policy or shifts in political attitudes that are beyond our control. Government policy may change to discourage foreign investment, nationalization of industries may occur or other government limitations, restrictions or requirements not currently foreseen may be implemented. In addition, Mexico may experience political instability, which may result in\noutbreaks of civil unrest, drug-related violence, terrorist attacks or threats or acts of war in the affected areas, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nIntroduction of tax legislation and disputes with tax authorities may have an adverse effect on our operations and our overall tax rate.\nGovernments in countries in which we operate or provide services could enact new tax legislation that could have a material adverse effect on our overall effective tax rate. In addition, our ability to repatriate surplus earnings, if any, from our operations centers in a tax-efficient manner is dependent upon interpretations of local laws, possible changes in such laws and the renegotiation of existing double tax avoidance treaties. Changes to any of these may adversely affect our overall tax rate, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, the transfer pricing regulations of the U.S. and certain foreign jurisdictions, including India, require that any cross-border transaction involving related parties be at an arm\u2019s-length price. Accordingly, we base our pricing between our foreign subsidiaries and related parties on a functional and economic analysis involving benchmarking against transactions among entities that are not related. However, the tax authorities have jurisdiction to review our transfer-pricing policy. If they conclude the policy was not applied appropriately, we may incur additional tax liability, including accrued interest and penalties.\nSales tax laws in the U.S. may change resulting in service providers having to collect sales taxes in states where the current laws do not require us to do so. This could result in substantial tax liabilities.\nOur U.S. subsidiaries collect and remit sales tax in states in which the subsidiaries have physical presence or in which we believe sufficient nexus exists which obligates us to collect sales tax. Other states may, from time to time, claim that we have state-related activities constituting physical nexus to require such collection. Additionally, many other states seek to impose sales tax collection or reporting obligations on companies that sell goods to customers in their state, or directly to the state and its political subdivisions, regardless of physical presence. Such efforts by states have increased recently, as states seek to raise revenues without increasing the income tax burden on residents. We rely on U.S. Supreme Court decisions which hold that, without Congressional authority, a state may not enforce a sales tax collection obligation on a company that has no physical presence in the state. We cannot predict whether the nature or level of contacts we have with a particular state will be deemed enough to require us to collect sales tax in that state nor can we be assured that Congress or individual states will not approve legislation authorizing states to impose tax collection or reporting obligations on our activities. A successful assertion by one or more states that we should collect sales tax could result in substantial tax liabilities related to past sales and would result in considerable administrative burdens and costs for us.\nRestrictions on entry visas may affect our ability to compete for and provide services to customers in the U.S., which could have a material adverse effect on future revenues.\nA significant number of our employees are foreign nationals, including from India, the Philippines and China. Certain members of our development team based in India travel to the U.S. on a regular basis to facilitate new project development, including the implementation of new contracts and to meet our U.S. customers. The ability of these employees to travel to the U.S. and other countries in which we do business depends on the ability to obtain the necessary visas and entry permits.\nIn response to political forces, terrorist attacks, the global economic downturn, global disease, public sentiments of high unemployment rates in certain parts of the U.S. and other events, U.S. immigration authorities have increased the level of scrutiny in granting visas and applicable immigration laws may be subject to legislative change and varying standards of application and enforcement. We cannot predict the political or economic events that could affect immigration laws or any restrictive impact those events could have on obtaining or monitoring entry visas for our professionals.\nInvestors may have difficulty effecting service of process or enforcing judgments obtained in the U.S. against our non-U.S. subsidiaries.\nWe have significant operating subsidiaries that are organized outside the U.S. A portion of our assets are located in India, the Philippines, China, Mexico, and Canada. As a result, you may be unable to effect service of process upon our affiliates who reside in these jurisdictions. In addition, you may be unable to enforce against these persons outside the jurisdiction of their residence judgments obtained in U.S. courts, including judgments predicated solely upon U.S. federal securities laws.\nCurrency fluctuations among the Euro, British Pound, Indian rupee, the Philippine Peso, the Mexican Peso, the Canadian Dollar, the Chinese Yuan and the U.S. Dollar could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe operate internationally and as a result, are subject to risks associated with doing business globally, such as risks related to the differing legal, political and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many jurisdictions. Risks inherent to operating internationally include changes in a country\u2019s economic or political conditions, in foreign currency exchange rates, regulatory requirements and enforcement of intellectual property rights.\nThe functional currencies of our businesses outside of the U.S. are the local currencies. Changes in exchange rates between these foreign currencies and the U.S. Dollar will affect the recorded levels of our assets, liabilities, net sales, cost of goods sold and operating margins and could result in exchange gains or losses. The primary foreign currencies to which we have exposure are the European Union Euro, Swedish Krona, British Pound Sterling, Canadian Dollar and Indian rupees . Exchange rates between these currencies and the U.S. Dollar in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may do so in the future. Our operating results and profitability may be affected by any volatility in currency exchange rates and our ability to manage effectively currency transaction and translation risks. To the extent the U.S. Dollar strengthens against foreign currencies, our foreign revenues and profits will be reduced when translated into U.S. Dollars.\nAlthough the vast majority of our revenues are denominated in U.S. dollars, a significant portion of our expenses are incurred and paid in Euros, British Pound Sterling, Swedish Krona, Indian rupees, and to a lesser extent in other currencies, including the Philippine Peso, the Mexican Peso, the Canadian dollar and the Chinese Yuan . We report our financial results in U.S. Dollars. The exchange rate between the Indian rupee and the U.S. Dollar has changed substantially in recent years and may fluctuate substantially in the future. Our results of operations may be adversely affected if such fluctuations continue, or increase, or other currencies fluctuate significantly against the U.S. Dollar.\nAlthough we do not currently take steps to hedge our foreign currency exposures, should we choose in the future to implement a hedging strategy, there can be no assurance that our hedging strategy will be successful or that the hedging markets would have sufficient liquidity or depth to allow us to implement such a hedging strategy in a cost-effective manner. Further, the success of any potential hedging strategy could be impacted by any failure by the hedging counterparties to meet their contractual obligations.\nWe are subject to laws of the United States and foreign jurisdictions relating to processing certain financial transactions, including payment card transactions and debit or credit card transactions, and failure to comply with those laws could subject us to legal actions and materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe process, support and execute financial transactions, and disburse funds, on behalf of both government and commercial customers, often in partnership with financial institutions. This activity includes receiving debit and credit card information, processing payments for and due to our customers and disbursing funds on payment or debit cards to payees of our customers. As a result, the transactions we process may be subject to numerous United States (both federal and state) and foreign jurisdiction laws and regulations, including the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, as amended, the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act of 1970 (commonly known as the Bank Secrecy Act), as amended, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (including the so-called Durbin Amendment), as amended, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (also known as the Financial Modernization Act of 1999), as amended, and the\nUniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism (USA PATRIOT ACT) Act of 2001, as amended. Other United States (both federal and state) and foreign jurisdiction laws apply to our processing of certain financial transactions and related support services. These laws are subject to frequent changes, and new statutes and regulations in this area may be enacted at any time. Changes to existing laws, the introduction of new laws in this area or failure to comply with existing laws that are applicable to us may subject us to, among other things, additional costs or changes to our business practices, liability for monetary damages, fines and/or criminal prosecution, unfavorable publicity, restrictions on our ability to process and support financial transactions and allegations by our customers, partners and clients that we have not performed our contractual obligations. Any of these could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nFailure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, economic and trade sanctions, regulations, and similar laws could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.\nWe operate our business in several foreign countries with developing economies and have contracts with foreign governments, where companies often engage in business practices that are prohibited by U.S. and other regulations applicable to us. We are subject to anti-corruption laws and regulations, including the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act and other laws that prohibit the making or offering of improper payments to foreign government officials and political figures, including anti-bribery provisions enforced by the Department of Justice and accounting provisions enforced by the SEC. These laws prohibit improper payments or offers of payments to foreign governments and their officials and political parties by the U.S. and other business entities for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We have implemented policies to identify and address potentially impermissible transactions under such laws and regulations; however, there can be no assurance that all of our and our subsidiaries\u2019 employees, consultants, and agents, including those that may be based in or from countries where practices that violate U.S. or other laws may be customary, will not take actions in violation of our policies, for which we may be ultimately responsible.\nWe are also subject to certain economic and trade sanctions programs that are administered by the Department of Treasury\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, which prohibit or restrict transactions to or from or dealings with specified countries, their governments, and in certain circumstances, their nationals, and with individuals and entities that are specially-designated nationals of those countries, narcotics traffickers, and terrorists or terrorist organizations. Our subsidiaries may be subject to additional foreign or local sanctions requirements in other relevant jurisdictions.\nFluctuations in the costs of paper, ink, energy, by-products and other raw materials may adversely impact the results of our operations.\nPurchases of paper, ink, energy and other raw materials represent a large portion of our costs. Increases in the costs of these inputs may increase our costs and we may not be able to pass these costs on to customers through higher prices. In addition, we may not be able to resell waste paper and other print-related by-products or may be adversely impacted by decreases in the prices for these by-products. Increases in the cost of materials may adversely impact customers\u2019 demand for our printing and printing-related services.\nThe market for our securities remains volatile and may not continue, which would adversely affect the liquidity and price of our securities.\nThe price of our securities, including, without limitation, our Common Stock, may continue to fluctuate significantly. An active trading market for our securities may not further develop or be sustained. In addition, the price of our securities can fluctuate due to general economic conditions and forecasts, our general business condition and the release of our financial reports.\nChanges in laws or regulations, or a failure to comply with any laws and regulations, may adversely affect our business, investments and results of operations.\nWe are subject to laws, regulations and rules enacted by national, regional and local governments and Nasdaq. In particular, we are required to comply with certain SEC, Nasdaq and other legal or regulatory requirements.\nCompliance with, and monitoring of, applicable laws, regulations and rules may be difficult, time consuming and costly. Those laws, regulations and rules and their interpretation and application may also change from time to time and those changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, investments and results of operations. In addition, a failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations and rules, as interpreted and applied, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to successfully consummate acquisitions or experience delays in integrating acquisitions, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOne of our strategies to grow our business is to opportunistically acquire complementary businesses, technologies and services. This strategy depends in large part on our ability to find suitable acquisitions and finance them on acceptable terms. We may require additional debt or equity financing for future acquisitions, and doing so will be made more difficult by our indebtedness. Raising additional capital for acquisitions through debt financing could result in increased interest expense and may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take certain actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. .\nIf we are unable to identify and acquire suitable acquisition candidates, we may experience slower growth. Further, we may face challenges in integrating any acquired business. These challenges include eliminating redundant operations, facilities and systems, coordinating management and personnel, retaining key employees, managing different corporate cultures and achieving cost reductions and cross-selling opportunities. Additionally, the acquisition and integration processes may disrupt our business and divert management attention and our resources. If we fail to successfully integrate acquired businesses, products, technologies and personnel, it could impair relationships with employees, clients and strategic partners, distract management attention from our core businesses, result in control failures and otherwise disrupt our ongoing business, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We also may not be able to retain key management and other critical employees after an acquisition. In addition, we may be required to record future charges for impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets resulting from such acquisitions.", "PERMNO": 15271, "SIC": 7374, "TIC": "XELA"}
