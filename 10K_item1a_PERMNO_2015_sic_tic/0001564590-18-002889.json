{"cik": "1430592", "company": "Financial Engines, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-02-22", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur revenue and operating results can fluctuate from period to period, which could cause our share price to fluctuate.\nOur revenue and operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate from period-to-period in the future due to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. Factors relating to our business that may contribute to these fluctuations include the following factors, as well as other factors described elsewhere in this document:\n\u2022\na reduction of the assets we have under management;\n\u2022\nfailure of our growth strategy or marketing efforts to expand our services, or to retain or acquire clients;\n\u2022\ntermination, non-renewal, or renegotiation of an existing contract with a plan provider, and effects of competition with plan providers;\n\u2022\ndownward pressure on fees we charge for our services, contractual fee reductions, or changes in pricing policies;\n\u2022\nvariations in enrollment, contribution rates, cancellation or withdrawal rates for our discretionary portfolio management services;\n\u2022\nadverse effects from actual or perceived errors, breaches of contract, confidentiality, privacy, or fiduciary obligations;\n\u2022\nnegative public perception and reputation of our Company or the financial services industry;\n\u2022\nthe impact of any business acquisitions or dispositions we may make, or among plan providers, plan sponsors or competitors;\n\u2022\noperational, executive or regulatory changes; and\n\u2022\ngeopolitical and other economic factors.\nAs a result of these and other factors, the results of any prior quarterly or annual periods should not be relied upon as indications of our future revenue or operating performance.\nA substantial portion of our revenue is based on fees earned on the value of assets we manage. Our revenue and earnings could suffer if the financial markets experience a downturn or a slowdown in growth that reduces the value, or slows the growth, of our Assets Under Management.\nWe derive a significant and growing portion of our revenue from client fees based on the assets in the accounts we manage, which we refer to as AUM. The assets we manage include a wide variety of investment alternatives, the value of which can be affected by the performance of the financial markets globally, currency fluctuations, interest rate fluctuations and other factors. Our professional management revenue and fees are generally calculated quarterly using the value of AUM at the end of each month or calendar quarter. Our methodology may result in lower fees if the financial markets are down when fees are calculated, even if the market had performed well earlier in the month or the quarter. In addition, our business is highly concentrated in DC plans. An economic downturn, changes in tax laws, or slowdown in economic growth could cause plan participants or their employers to contribute less to their DC plans, cause fewer eligible employees to participate in DC plans, or cause employees or clients to withdraw funds from or close their DC or retail accounts, which could adversely affect the amount of AUM. If clients are not satisfied with our services or the performance of their portfolios due to a decline in the financial markets or otherwise, our cancellation or account withdrawal rates could increase, which in turn would cause our AUM to decline. Historically, client cancellations rates have typically increased during periods where there has been a significant decline in stock market performance. Any potential decline in AUM would not necessarily be proportional to, and, in total, could be greater than, the overall market decline. If any of these factors reduces the value of assets we have under management, the amount of fees we would earn for managing those assets would decline, and our revenue, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.\nOur revenue could be harmed if we fail to enroll new clients in our discretionary portfolio management services, if we experience increased cancellations or unsuccessful marketing results, or if we otherwise fail to increase usage of our services.\nOur revenue depends on clients enrolling in our discretionary portfolio management services or, in the case of a passive enrollment campaign, not declining, our services. Increasing client enrollment in our services increases the AUM on which we earn fees. If we are unable to continue to increase our enrollment, or if cancellations increase, our business may not grow as we anticipate. Unanticipated or unsuccessful results from our marketing campaigns, or our inability to successfully employ marketing techniques such as integration with provider websites or outbound calling, or other methods used to attract clients, could also affect our revenue for a particular period. For example, we have found that if plan sponsors do not use our standard marketing campaign, enrollment rates tend to be lower.\nAs we endeavor to find new ways to grow enrollment, we may introduce marketing strategies or customer experiences that are unsuccessful, in generating enrollment, produce higher cancellation rates, or harm our reputation and jeopardize future enrollment. Individual clients whose accounts we manage may choose at any time to stop having us manage those accounts. Historically, client cancellations rates have typically increased during periods where there has been a significant decline in stock market performance and, in addition, client cancellation rates are typically the highest in the three months immediately following the completion of a given promotional campaign. If we are unsuccessful in our enrollment campaigns, if we lose clients, or if we otherwise fail to increase enrollment rates, our revenue, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.\nOur revenue is highly dependent upon a small number of plan providers with whom we have relationships, and the renegotiation or termination of our relationship with any of these plan providers could significantly impact our business.\nOur relationships and data connections with plan providers allow us to effectively manage plan participant accounts and integrate our services into plan providers\u2019 current service platforms. These relationships also provide us with an advantage in trying to sign potential plan sponsors.\nWe refer to four of our nine primary DC plan provider relationships as subadvisory relationships, including one plan provider with whom we have a subadvisory relationship for some plan sponsors and a direct advisory relationship for other plan sponsors. Where we act as subadvisor, we do not have a direct relationship with the plan sponsors and therefore may be less able to influence decisions by those plan sponsors to use or continue to use our services or to add additional services. Where we act as subadvisor, we do not know and cannot control the exact terms of the contract between the plan provider and the plan sponsor, which vary on terms such as the length of the contract, renewal and cancellation provisions. We have historically earned, and expect to continue to earn on a combined basis, a significant portion of our revenue through subadvisory relationships with DC plan providers. The renegotiation or termination of our relationship with any of these plan providers could negatively impact our business. For the year ended December 31, 2017, 10%, 5%, 6% and 5% of our total revenue was attributable to the subadvisory fees paid to us by Alight (formerly Aon Hewitt), Empower RetirementTM, Vanguard and Voya, respectively, the four plan providers with whom we had subadvisory relationships as of December 31, 2017.\nOur contracts with our nine primary DC plan providers generally have terms ranging from three to five years, and have successive automatic renewal terms of one year unless terminated in accordance with prior notice requirements. A majority of these provider agreements are in renewal periods. A plan provider may also terminate its contract with us at any time for specified breaches. Further, either party may decide to renegotiate the terms of the contract. In addition, there are factors other than our performance which may be outside of our control (for example, provider data connectivity fee litigation) that could cause the loss of a plan provider. If we lose one of our plan providers with whom we have a relationship or if one of those plan providers significantly reduces its volume of business with us or renegotiates the economic terms of its contract with us, our revenue, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.\nOur growth strategy includes extending and expanding our services including entering new markets and we may not be able to develop a successful growth strategy, successfully implement new services, or accurately estimate the impact on our business of developing and introducing these services.\nOur strategy includes enhancing and expanding the functionality of our services with new features, offering new services within our existing market, expanding our business directly with clients beyond the workplace and continuing to evaluate new opportunities in markets adjacent to our existing market. For example, in 2016, we acquired the business of The Mutual Fund Store, which allows us to offer advice and portfolio management on IRA and taxable accounts. We may not be able to anticipate or manage new risks and obligations in these new markets outside of the workplace, or attract new clients on a cost-effective basis, or at all.\nIn furtherance of our strategy, we intend to invest significant resources in the research, development, sales and marketing of new services and features. A viable market for our new services or features may not exist or develop as we anticipated, and our offerings may not be well received by potential or current plan sponsor customers, individual plan participants, retail clients or investors. We may make incorrect decisions as we implement our strategy, such as decisions whether to design and build elements of our services in-house or procure them through third parties or through acquisition. We may not be able to accurately estimate the impact on our business of entering new markets and implementing new features or services. We may not be able to anticipate or manage new risks and obligations, or legal, compliance, operational or other requirements that may arise when entering new markets or offering new features and services. In addition, the anticipated benefits of these actions may not outweigh the resources and costs associated with their development or acquisition, or the liabilities associated with their operation. If we do not realize the anticipated benefits of our strategic actions, our revenue, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.\nOur workplace discretionary portfolio management services make up a significant and growing part of our revenue base. Our business could suffer if fees we can charge for these services decline.\nWe earn fees for our discretionary portfolio management services based on the value of AUM. We believe that these services will continue to make up a substantial and growing portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future. There are many investment advisory and management services and other financial products available in the marketplace, which puts downward pressure on fees for our discretionary portfolio management services, whether provided through or outside of the workplace. We have in the past made, and may in the future make, strategic decisions to lower our fees. As a result, our revenue growth may be slower than it would have been had we not reduced our fees, despite increasing AUM. Congressional, regulatory or industry attention focused on fees for financial services, such as legislative constraints on fees or rules requiring additional disclosure regarding fees, could result in downward pressure on fees or impose limits on the fees we can charge for our discretionary portfolio management services. If we lower the fees we charge for our discretionary portfolio management services, our revenue, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.\nSome plan providers with whom we have relationships also provide, or may provide, competing services or products, which may strain our relationship with these plan providers and could result in less favorable contract terms or contract cancellations, which in turn may harm our revenue, operating results and financial condition.\nSome plan providers with whom we have relationships, such as Fidelity offer or may offer directly competing investment guidance, retirement advice, portfolio management and retirement income services to DC plan participants. We currently have a relationship with Fidelity that allows us to provide our services to plan sponsors, for whom Fidelity is the plan provider, who elect to hire us. Retail competitors include financial institutions with whom we have relationships, such as Charles Schwab & Co., Inc., Fidelity, and Vanguard.\nWe also face indirect competition from products that could potentially substitute for our services, most notably target-date funds, which are offered by a number of plan providers with whom we have relationships, including Empower RetirementTM , Fidelity, T. Rowe Price, Vanguard, Voya, and Wells Fargo. Plan providers who offer competing services or products may be better positioned to promote or offer their services or products over ours in the sales process, or may prevent us from offering our services to their sponsors. Where we have a subadvisory relationship with the plan provider, the plan provider may compete with us for plan sponsors. Our expansion into the retail market, and our strategy to manage a client\u2019s total portfolio outside of the workplace, has increased this competitive dynamic.\nThis competition with companies with whom we have relationships can strain the relationship with plan providers and may result in less favorable contract terms or contract cancellation, in which event our revenue, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.\nCompetition could reduce our share of the portfolio management, investment advisory and DC planning market and harm our financial performance.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry, with many investment advice providers competing for business from individual investors, financial advisors and institutional customers. Direct competitors that offer independent portfolio management and investment advisory services to plan participants in the workplace include Morningstar and Guided Choice. Retail competitors include large broker/dealers that provide financial services, such as Charles Schwab & Co., Edward Jones, Fidelity, and Vanguard, insurance companies, such as MetLife and New York Life, and other registered investment advisors, such as Creative Planning, Edelman Financial Services, and Fisher Investments. Emerging competitors include firms that provide portfolio management services delivered primarily through online channels with minimal human interaction, such as Betterment, Personal Capital, and Wealthfront (some of which also provide bundled services to the small retirement plan market). We also face indirect competition from products that could potentially substitute for our portfolio management services, investment advice and retirement income, most notably target-date funds. Target-date funds are offered by multiple financial institutions, including Empower RetirementTM, Fidelity, T. Rowe Price, Wells Fargo, Vanguard, and Voya. In addition, competitors to our retirement income features include providers of retirement income products in the defined contribution market, such as AllianceBernstein, Prudential, and other providers of insurance products.\nMany of our competitors have larger customer bases and significantly greater resources than we do, or may have fewer regulatory or other constraints. This may allow our competitors to respond more quickly to new technologies and changes in demand for services, to devote greater resources to developing and promoting their services, and to make more attractive offers to potential plan providers, plan sponsors and plan participants. Industry consolidation may also lead to more intense competition. Increased competition could result in fee reductions or loss of market share, in which event our revenue, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.\nOur share price may be volatile, and the value of an investment in our common stock may decline.\nAn active, liquid and orderly market for our common stock may not be sustained, which could depress the trading price of our common stock. The price of our common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, volatile, and could decline substantially, including within a short period of time. For example, the 2017 range on intra-day sales prices for our common stock on The NASDAQ Global Select Market ranged from $24.45 to $45.75. The market price of shares of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations as a result of a wide variety of factors, including, but not limited to, those discussed in this report, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nour announcement of actual results for a fiscal period that are higher or lower than projected results or our announcement of revenue or earnings guidance that is higher or lower than expected;\n\u2022\nissuance of new or updated or negative research or reports by, or the reduction or cessation of research coverage by one or more, securities analysts;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our financial condition, operating results or growth rate;\n\u2022\nchanges in the economic performance or market valuations of our competitors or of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;\n\u2022\nthe amount, timing or frequency of any share repurchases;\n\u2022\nissuances, sales or expected sales of additional shares of common stock, including by any of our officers, directors, or other affiliates;\n\u2022\nshare price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares;\n\u2022\noperational, executive or regulatory changes;\n\u2022\nchanges in the amounts, timing or frequency of any cash dividends we may pay; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and market conditions.\nFurthermore, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations may be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political and market conditions such as recessions, interest rate changes or international currency fluctuations, may cause the market price of shares of our common stock to decline. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business.\nOur revenue is highly dependent upon the plan sponsors with whom we have relationships, our failure to maintain or grow sponsor relationships could significantly and negatively impact our business.\nA substantial portion of our revenue is generated as a result of contracts with plan sponsors. Under these contracts, where we are providing advisory services directly and not in a subadvisory capacity, we typically earn annual platform fees that are paid by the plan sponsor, plan provider or the DC plan itself as well as fees based on AUM that are generally paid by plan participants. These contracts with plan sponsors typically have initial terms of three or five years and continue thereafter unless terminated. At any time during the initial term or thereafter, a plan sponsor can cancel a contract for fiduciary reasons or breach of contract. A plan sponsor can generally terminate a contract after the initial term upon 90 days\u2019 notice. If a plan sponsor were to cancel or not renew a contract, we would no longer earn platform fees under that contract. In addition, we would no longer manage any assets in that plan and consequently would no longer earn fees based on AUM in that plan. A plan sponsor may also move to a record-keeper that does not offer our services, or determine to contract through a subadvisory relationship with a plan provider or change to a different record-keeper, which may result in lower revenues for our company due to the contract terms. The loss of one or more of our larger plan sponsors, or a reduction in fees could harm our revenue, operating results and financial condition.\nAny failure to protect the confidentiality of plan provider, plan sponsor, plan participant or individual investor data could lead to legal liability, adversely affect our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur services involve the exchange of information, including detailed information regarding individual investors or information regarding plan participants provided by plan providers, plan sponsors, and retirement account custodians through a variety of electronic and non-electronic means. In addition, plan participants and clients routinely provide confidential information and input personal investment and financial information, including portfolio holdings and, in some instances, credit card data, into our systems. Clients also provide confidential information to their advisors verbally and in written format, which is then input manually. Client records are maintained in our retail locations in paper files and local computers, and may be vulnerable to physical breaches. We rely on a complex network of process and software controls to protect the confidentiality of data provided to us, stored on our systems or on the systems of third-party vendors. If we do not maintain adequate internal controls or fail to implement new or improved controls, this data could be misappropriated or confidentiality could otherwise be breached. As we expand our business and increasingly integrate our services with and rely upon third parties we may be subject to increased risk and liability for security breaches. We must devote increasing management time and resources to monitoring third-party security controls. We could be subject to liability if any individual investor\u2019s personal information is inappropriately disclosed or altered, or if third parties are able to penetrate our network security or otherwise gain access to any plan participant\u2019s and client\u2019s name, address, portfolio holdings, credit card number or other personal information. Any such event could subject us to claims for unauthorized credit card purchases, identity theft or other similar fraud claims or claims for other misuses of personal information, such as unauthorized marketing or unauthorized access to personal information.\nMany of our agreements with plan sponsors, plan providers and clients do not limit our potential liability for breaches of confidentiality, and consequential damages. If any person, including any of our employees, contractors, or consultants, penetrates our network security, misappropriates or mishandles sensitive data, inadvertently or otherwise, we could be subject to significant liability from our plan sponsors, plan providers, participants and clients for breaching contractual confidentiality provisions or privacy laws. In addition, our agreements with plan sponsors and plan providers require us to meet specified minimum system security and privacy standards. Given the growing concern over privacy and identity theft, we have been and expect to continue to be subject to increased scrutiny by both plan providers and plan sponsors, which have increased the frequency and thoroughness of their audits. If we fail to meet these standards, our plan sponsors and plan providers may seek to limit or terminate their agreements with us. Regulations in some states and proposed federal regulations may require notification via the press or to customers in the event of security breaches, which could harm our reputation and increase our costs of doing business. Unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential data, whether through breach of our computer systems or third-party systems, systems failure or otherwise, could damage our reputation, expose us to litigation, cause us to lose business, harm our revenue, operating results or financial condition and subject us to regulatory action, which could include sanctions and fines.\nWe rely on plan providers, plan sponsors and custodians to provide us with accurate and timely plan and client data in order for us to provide our services, and we rely on plan providers and custodians to execute transactions in the accounts we manage.\nOur ability to provide high-quality services depends, in part, on plan sponsors, plan providers and third-party account custodians supplying us with accurate and timely data in a usable format. Data transmissions from our plan sponsors and providers routinely contain errors or are not supplied in a timely manner. Although we have processes in place to attempt to detect and correct such errors and to encourage timely transmissions, our efforts may not be sufficient. Errors or delays in the data we receive, missing data, data transmitted in a format that we cannot readily use, or miscommunication about what data should be transmitted or in what format, could lead us to make advisory, transaction, disbursement or communication errors that could harm our reputation or lead to financial liability, or may prevent us from providing our services to, or earning revenue from, otherwise eligible clients. In addition, when we make changes in an account we manage, or direct a disbursement, we instruct the plan provider or custodian to execute the transactions. If a plan provider or custodian fails to execute transactions in an accurate and timely manner, it could harm our reputation or lead to financial liability. In turn, our revenue, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.\nOur revenue could be harmed if we experience unanticipated delays in expected service availability.\nWe generally do not earn platform fees from a plan sponsor until our services are available to plan participants, and we do not earn fees for our Professional Management service until we begin to manage a participant\u2019s account. Service delays may impact many or all accounts at a new plan sponsor and delay our ability to manage participant accounts and collect fees. If service availability is delayed due to actions or inactions on our part or on the part of a plan sponsor, plan provider or other third party, or due to matters beyond our control, our revenue would be harmed. This in turn would negatively affect our anticipated operating results and financial condition for a particular period.\nWe may be liable for damages caused by errors, system failures, or unsatisfactory performance of services.\nIf we fail to prevent, detect or resolve errors in our services, including services offered through our subsidiaries or third-party providers, regardless of the cause of the errors, we could be liable for the harm caused. Errors in inputs or processing, such as plan set-ups, transaction instructions or plan participant data could be magnified across many accounts. We use an automated trading system for the workplace DC Professional Management service, and an error or failure of this system could result in widespread material trading errors, which could be exacerbated by financial market movement. Concentrated positions held by many plan participants, particularly in employer stock, could result in a large liability if a systematic input or processing error was to cause us to make errors in transactions relating to those positions. The manual and individual nature of our Personal Advisor service increases the risk of human error or malfeasance and could cause mistakes in client transactions. Our advisors servicing our Personal Advisor clients are able to move client assets and to make changes to client investment accounts directly. When managing taxable accounts, errors could affect client tax obligations and create liability for us. We could also face liability if we fail to process a client\u2019s instructions. We may not be able to identify or resolve these errors in a timely manner. In addition, failure to perform our services on a timely basis could result in liability. We may also have liability to the plan provider where we have a subadvisory relationship with the plan provider.\nIn the past, our company has reimbursed plan providers, sponsors, participants and clients for errors in our services, and we expect to do so in the future. After an error is identified, resolving the error and implementing remedial measures has at times diverted the attention and resources of our management, key technical personnel and internal resources from other business concerns. Any errors or poor execution in the performance of services could cause a plan sponsor, plan provider, or client to terminate their relationship with us. Although we attempt to limit our contractual liability for consequential damages in rendering our services, these limitations on liability may be unenforceable in some cases, or may be insufficient to protect us from liability for damages. ERISA and other applicable laws require that we meet a fiduciary obligation to plan participants. In the event of liability or claims against us for these errors or failures, insurance may be unavailable or insufficient, in which event our operating results and financial condition could be harmed.\nIf our reputation is harmed, we could suffer losses in our business and revenue.\nOur reputation, which depends on earning and maintaining the trust and confidence of plan providers, plan sponsors, plan participants and individual investors that are current and potential clients, is critical to our business. Our reputation is vulnerable to many threats that can be difficult or impossible to control, and costly or impossible to remediate. Regulatory inquiries or investigations, lawsuits initiated by plan fiduciaries, plan participants, such as the lawsuits challenging provider data connectivity fees filed in 2016, clients, current or former employees, or stockholders, employee misconduct, perceptions of conflicts of interest, rumors, communication errors, and transactional mistakes, among other developments, could substantially damage our reputation, even if they are baseless or satisfactorily addressed, or do not specifically name us as a party to the complaint.\nIn addition, any perception that the quality of our investment advice may not be the same or better than that of other providers could also damage our reputation. Any damage to our reputation could harm our ability to attract and retain plan providers, plan sponsor customers, individual investors and key personnel. This damage could also cause current or potential clients to stop using or enrolling in our discretionary portfolio management services, which would adversely affect the amount of AUM on which we earn fees, in which event our revenue, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.\nPrivacy concerns could require us to modify our operations.\nAs part of our business, we use plan participants\u2019 and clients\u2019 personal data. For privacy or security reasons, privacy groups, governmental agencies and individuals may seek to restrict or prevent our use of this data. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, expenses to comply with privacy and security standards and protocols imposed by law, regulation, industry standards or contractual obligations. Increased domestic or international regulation of data utilization and distribution practices, including self-regulation, could require us to modify our operations and incur significant additional expense, in which event our revenue, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.\nOur future success depends on our ability to recruit and retain qualified employees, including our executive officers and advisors.\nOur ability to provide our services and maintain and develop relationships with plan participants, plan providers, plan sponsors and individual investors depends largely on our ability to attract, train, motivate and retain highly skilled professionals, particularly professionals with backgrounds in sales, marketing, technology and financial and investment services. Consequently, we must hire and retain employees with the technical expertise and industry knowledge necessary to continue to develop our services and effectively manage our growing sales and marketing organization to assist the growth of our operations.\nWe believe there is significant competition for professionals with the skills necessary to perform the services we offer, particularly in the geographic area of our headquarters in Sunnyvale, California. We experience competition for analysts and other employees from financial institutions and financial services organizations such as hedge funds and investment management companies that generally have greater resources than we do and therefore may be able to offer higher compensation packages. Competition for these employees is intense, and we may not have sufficient human resources programs, practices and benefits to be able to retain our existing employees, or be able to recruit and retain other highly qualified personnel. If we cannot retain key employees in our retail advisor function, we may lose important knowledge and skills resident in that organization. In addition, many of the advisors employed in our advisor network have developed personal relationships with their clients. If we are not able to retain these advisors, their clients may close their accounts or leave to follow their advisor, which could reduce our AUM and revenue. If we cannot hire and retain qualified personnel, our ability to sustain and continue to expand our business would be impaired and our revenue, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.\nOur ability to compete, succeed and generate profits depends, in part, on our ability to obtain accurate and timely data from third-party vendors on commercially reasonable terms.\nWe currently obtain market and other financial data we use to generate our investment advice from a number of third-party vendors. Termination of one or more of these vendor agreements, exclusion from, or restricted use of a data provider\u2019s information could decrease the information available for us to use and offer our clients. We do not currently have secondary sources or other suppliers for some of these data items and the lack of these resources may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. If these data feed agreements were terminated, backup services would take time to set up and our business and results of operations could be harmed. We rely on these data suppliers to provide timely and accurate information, and their failure to do so could harm our business. In addition, some data suppliers may seek to increase licensing fees for providing content to us. If we are unable to renegotiate acceptable licensing arrangements with these data suppliers or find alternative sources of equivalent content, we may experience a reduction in our operating margins or market share, in which event our revenue, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.\nOur discretionary portfolio management and investment advisory operations may subject us to liability for losses that result from a breach of our fiduciary duties or other obligations.\nOur discretionary portfolio management and investment advisory operations involve fiduciary obligations that require us to act in the best interests of the plan participants to whom we provide advice or for whom we manage accounts. We may face liabilities for actual or claimed breaches of our fiduciary duties. We may not be able to prevent plan participants, plan sponsors or the plan providers to or through whom we provide investment advisory services from taking legal action against us for an actual or claimed breach of a fiduciary duty. Because we currently provide investment advisory services on substantial assets, we could face substantial liability to plan participants or plan sponsors if we breach our fiduciary duties. In addition, we may face liabilities for actual or claimed deficiencies in the quality or outcome of our investment advisory recommendations, investment management and other services, even in the absence of an actual or claimed breach of fiduciary duty. While we believe that we would have substantial and meritorious defenses against such a claim, we cannot predict the outcome or consequences of any such potential litigation.\nIf our intellectual property and technology are not adequately protected to prevent use or appropriation by our competitors, our business and competitive position could suffer.\nOur future success and competitive position depend in part on our ability to protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property. We rely and expect to continue to rely on a combination of trademark, copyright, patent and trade secret protection laws to protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property. We also require our employees, consultants, vendors, plan sponsors and plan providers to enter into confidentiality agreements with us. As of December 31, 2017, we have issued U.S. patents which relate to novel aspects of our financial advisory platform, including user interface features, our pricing module, load-aware optimization, tax-aware asset allocation, financial goal planning, advice palatability, and other key technologies of our outcomes-based investing methodologies. One or more of our issued patents or pending patent applications may be called into question on the basis of being directed to abstract ideas or methods of doing or conducting business. The general validity of software patents and so called \u201cbusiness method\u201d patents have been challenged in a number of jurisdictions, including the United States. Changes in patent laws or case law may impact the scope of patent-eligible subject matter by, for example, limiting what constitutes a patentable \u201cprocess.\u201d Our patents may become less valuable if software or business methods are found to be a non-patentable subject matter or if additional requirements are imposed that our patents do not meet.\nThe steps we have taken may be inadequate to prevent the misappropriation of our proprietary technology. There can be no assurance that others will not develop or patent similar or superior technologies, products or services, or that our patents, trademarks and other intellectual property will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by others. Unauthorized copying or other misappropriation of our proprietary technologies could enable third parties to benefit from our technologies without paying us for doing so, which could harm our business. Policing unauthorized use of proprietary technology is difficult and expensive and our monitoring and policing activities may not be sufficient to identify any misappropriation and protect our proprietary technology. In addition, third parties may knowingly or unknowingly infringe our patents, trademarks and other intellectual property rights, and litigation may be necessary to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights. If litigation is necessary to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights, any such litigation could be very costly and could divert management attention and resources.\nWe also expect that the more successful we are, the more likely it becomes that competitors will try to develop products that are similar to ours, which may infringe on our proprietary rights. If we are unable to protect our proprietary rights or if third parties independently develop or gain access to our or similar technologies, our business, revenue, operating results, financial condition, reputation and competitive position could be harmed.\nThird parties may assert intellectual property infringement claims against us, or our services may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may subject us to legal liability and harm our reputation.\nAssertion of intellectual property infringement claims against us, plan providers or plan sponsors could result in litigation. We might not prevail in any such litigation or be able to obtain a license for the use of any infringed intellectual property from a third party on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Even if obtained, we may be unable to protect such licenses from infringement or misuse, or prevent infringement claims against us in connection with our licensing efforts. We expect that the risk of infringement claims against us will increase if more of our competitors are able to obtain intellectual property protection for their technology and business processes, and if we hire employees who possess third-party proprietary information. Any such claims, regardless of their merit or ultimate outcome, could result in substantial cost to us, divert management\u2019s attention and our resources away from our operations and otherwise harm our reputation. If we are not successful in overcoming such claims and are required to pay damages, licensing fees or fines, or alter our services or business practices, our revenue, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.\nAny inability to manage our growth could disrupt our business and harm our operating results.\nWe expect our growth to place significant demands on our management and other resources. Our success will depend in part upon the ability of our senior management to execute on our growth strategy and to manage growth effectively. Our continued growth and expanded business model increases the challenges involved in developing, improving and scaling our internal administrative infrastructure, particularly our financial, operational, compliance, recordkeeping, communications and other internal systems; and maintaining high levels of satisfaction with our services among our business partners, employees and clients. We may make acquisitions in furtherance of our strategy, such as our acquisition of The Mutual Fund Store in 2016, and the success of any acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully integrate and realize the anticipated benefits from combining our businesses. We rely on proprietary and customized software, systems and reporting processes, which require experienced personnel to operate, maintain and expand, and which is made more complex by acquisition activity. Organic or acquisition-related growth may require additional capital, and there is no assurance that financing, if required, will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. We may not fully realize, in a timely manner or otherwise, the anticipated synergies and other potential benefits of an acquisition due to several factors, including: unanticipated costs, liabilities or expenses; harm to our existing business relationships or reputation; the loss of key employees in the acquired business; competitive responses; use of substantial amounts of cash, incurring additional debt, or potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities; exposure to potential unknown liabilities of the acquired business; or other factors. If we do not manage our growth appropriately, our revenue, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.\nWe are subject to regulatory compliance requirements as a result of being a public company, which causes additional expenses and challenges for our management team.\nWe are investing resources to comply with evolving laws and regulations, including the requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the Investor Protection and Securities Reform Act of 2010, as well as the rules and regulations implemented by the SEC and The NASDAQ Stock Market. We rely upon proprietary and customized software, systems and reporting processes, which increases the complexity of our internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting and introduces more opportunities for error. This compliance can require a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. For example, Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires that our management report on, and our independent auditors attest to, the effectiveness of our internal control structure and procedures for financial reporting in our annual report on Form 10-K. Any claim that our internal controls over financial reporting are not effective as defined under Section 404, or that we have failed to comply with other public company regulatory requirements, regardless of merit or ultimate outcome, could subject us to lawsuits, stockholder derivative demands, sanctions or investigations by The NASDAQ Stock Market, the SEC, or other regulatory authorities. This risk is increased significantly by the need to establish public-company levels of controls on the acquired business of The Mutual Fund Store. Furthermore, investor perceptions of our company may suffer, and this could cause a decline in the market price of our stock. Any failure of our internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our stated results of operations and harm our reputation. If we are unable to meet public company regulatory compliance requirements effectively or efficiently, or there are changes in the standards, methods, estimates and judgments used in applying our accounting policies, it could harm our operations, financial reporting or financial results and could result in an adverse opinion on internal controls from our independent auditors.\nWe could face liability for certain information we disclose, including information based on data we obtain from other parties.\nWe may be subject to claims for securities law violations, negligence, or other claims relating to the information we disclose. In addition, we provide information through newsletters and other topical communications to our clients and also host a regular radio program. Our businesses also communicate through social media and other online means. Individuals who use our services may take legal action against us if they rely on information that contains an error, or a company may claim that we have made a defamatory statement about it or its employees. We could also be subject to claims based upon the content that is accessible from our website through links to other websites. We rely on a variety of outside parties as the original sources for the information we use in our published data. These sources include securities exchanges, fund companies and transfer agents. Accordingly, in addition to possible exposure for publishing incorrect information that results directly from our own errors, we could face liability based on inaccurate data provided to us by others. Defending claims based on the information we publish could be expensive and time-consuming and could adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIf our operations are interrupted as a result of system failures or service downtime, our business and reputation could suffer.\nThe success of our business depends upon our ability to obtain and deliver time-sensitive, up-to-date data and information. Key portions of our services are delivered using proprietary and customized software, systems and reporting processes, which require experienced personnel and cannot be duplicated by outside vendors or off-the-shelf products. Our operations and those of our plan providers and plan sponsors are vulnerable to interruption by technical breakdowns, computer hardware and software malfunctions, software viruses, infrastructure failures, fire, earthquake, power loss, telecommunications failure, terrorist attacks, wars, Internet failures, Internet-based attacks and other events beyond our control. Any disruption in our services or operations could harm our ability to perform our services effectively which in turn could result in a reduction in revenue or a claim for substantial damages against us, regardless of whether we are responsible for that failure. We rely on our computer equipment, database storage facilities and other office equipment, which are located primarily in the seismically active San Francisco Bay area. We maintain off-site back-up facilities in Dulles, Virginia for our database and network equipment, but these facilities could be subject to the same interruptions that may affect our headquarters. If we suffer a significant database or network facility outage, our business could experience disruption until we fully implement our back-up systems, which may not provide full recovery. We also depend on third-party vendors to deliver key services and software for our offering, provide facility and cloud storage and related maintenance of our main technology equipment and data. Any failure by these vendors to perform those services, any temporary or permanent loss of our equipment or systems or any disruptions to basic infrastructure like power and telecommunications could impede our ability to provide services to our clients, harm our reputation, cause clients to stop using our investment advisory or discretionary portfolio management services, reduce our revenue and harm our business. Our agreements with our plan providers, plan sponsors, also require us to meet specified minimum system security and privacy standards. If we fail to meet these standards, our plan sponsors and plan providers, may seek to terminate their agreements with us. This in turn could damage our reputation and harm our market position and business.\nChanges in laws applicable to our services may adversely affect our business.\nWe may be adversely affected as a result of new or revised legislation or regulations promulgated by Congress, the SEC, Department of Labor or other U.S. regulatory authorities or self-regulatory organizations that supervise the financial markets and our industry. In addition, we may be adversely affected by changes in the interpretation of existing laws and rules by these governmental authorities and self-regulatory organizations. It is impossible to determine the extent of the impact of any new laws, regulations or initiatives that may be proposed, or whether any of the proposals will become law. It is difficult to predict the future impact of the broad and expanding legislative and regulatory requirements affecting our business. For example, additional requirements for fee disclosure have become effective in recent years and there is increased sponsor and consultant focus on the fees associated with all plan services, including our services. We may need to offer more or broader services to justify our fees or may need to lower our fees to retain or expand our existing business relationships. Legislation and regulation that changed certain existing restrictions relating to conflicts of interest, such as the February 2017 executive order directing the Department of Labor to review its conflict of interest rule and delaying implementation of such rule for six months, might lower the relative value of our independence, or allow for increased competition. Legislation may reduce or eliminate tax benefits associated with defined contribution plans or otherwise restructure defined contribution plans in a way that affects their use by plan sponsors or plan participants, which could cause a reduction in the number of plans where our services are offered or slow our AUM growth.\nFuture legislation or regulation could affect our ability to offer services for accounts other than 401(k) accounts or may impose requirements for retirement income forecasts and distribution that we might not be able to satisfy, or which might lower the relative value of our services or allow for increased competition. Changes to laws or regulations, or in their interpretation, or any change that results in our becoming subject to the jurisdiction of any additional regulator, such as a self-regulatory organization, could increase our potential liability for offering portfolio management services, investment advice and retirement income, affect our ability to offer our passive enrollment option or invalidate pre-dispute arbitration clauses in our agreements, leading to increased costs to litigate any claims against us. Changes to laws or regulations, or in their interpretation, could also increase our legal and compliance costs, divert internal resources and make some activities more time-consuming and costly. The laws, rules and regulations applicable to our business may change in the future, and we may not be able to comply with any such changes. If we fail to comply with any applicable law, rule or regulation, we could be fined, sanctioned or barred from providing investment advisory services in the future, which could materially harm our business and reputation.\nWe are subject to complex regulation, and any compliance failures or regulatory action could adversely affect our business.\nThe financial services industry is subject to extensive regulation at the federal and state levels. It is very difficult to predict the future impact of the legislative and regulatory requirements affecting our business. The securities laws and other laws that govern our activities as a registered investment advisor are complex and subject to rapid change. The activities of our investment advisory and management operations are subject primarily to provisions of the Investment Advisers Act and ERISA, as well as certain state laws, some of which may provide for private rights of action. We are a fiduciary under ERISA. Our investment advisory services are also subject to state laws including anti-fraud laws and regulations. The Investment Advisers Act addresses, among other things, fiduciary duties, recordkeeping and reporting requirements, advertising, and disclosure requirements and also includes general anti-fraud provisions. We rely on certain regulatory interpretations and guidance in connection with our current business model, including regulations and guidance relating to passive enrollment of participants into our Professional Management service. If we are found to have failed to comply with any applicable law, rule or regulation, we could be fined, sanctioned, required to disgorge fees we have previously collected, required to reimburse clients for any losses in their accounts, required to change our business practices or disclosure, or barred from providing investment advisory services in the future, or we may agree to one or more of such payments, sanctions or changes as part of a settlement agreement, which could materially harm our business and reputation.\nWe may also become subject to additional regulatory and compliance requirements as a result of any expansion or enhancement of our existing services or any services we may offer in the future. For example, we may be subject to insurance licensing or other requirements in connection with our DC retirement income planning services, even if our activities are limited to describing regulated products. One of our acquired subsidiaries is an insurance agency, which is an industry in which we have limited experience.\nCompliance with any new regulatory requirements may divert internal resources and take significant time and effort. Any claim of noncompliance, regardless of merit or ultimate outcome, could subject us to investigation by the SEC or other regulatory authorities. This in turn could result in additional claims or class-action litigation brought on behalf of our clients, any of which could result in substantial cost to us and divert management\u2019s attention and other resources away from our operations. Furthermore, investor perceptions of us may suffer, and this could cause a decline in the market price of our common stock. Our compliance processes may not be sufficient to prevent assertions that we failed to comply with any applicable law, rule or regulation.\nChanges in accounting principles or standards, or in the way they are applied, could result in unfavorable accounting charges or effects and unexpected financial reporting fluctuations, and could adversely affect our reported operating results even if there are no underlying changes in the economics of the business.\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (U.S. GAAP), which are subject to interpretation by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and other regulatory bodies. A change in existing principles, standards or guidance can have a significant effect on our reported results, may retroactively affect previously reported results, could cause unexpected financial reporting fluctuations, and may require us to make costly changes to our internal controls, operational and financial reporting processes.\nFor example, in February 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), issued ASU 2016-02, Leases, which requires that lessees recognize assets and liabilities for leases with lease terms greater than twelve months in the balance sheet. We plan to adopt this ASU on January 1, 2019 and we are evaluating the effect that ASU 2016-02 will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures. Adoption of the new requirements could have a significant impact on our financial statements and may impact our processes and our controls. In addition, changes in accounting principles to converge U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards may have a material impact on our financial statements and may retroactively affect the accounting treatment of previously reported transactions.\nWe face additional scrutiny when we act as subadvisor, and any failure to comply with regulations or meet expectations could harm our business.\nSome of the plan providers to whom we are subadvisors are broker/dealers registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, also referred to as the Exchange Act, and are subject to the rules of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. When we act as a subadvisor, we may be subject to the oversight by regulators of another advisor. We may be affected by any regulatory examination of that plan provider.\nIn addition, our subadvisory arrangements are structured to follow Advisory Opinion 2001-09A, a Department of Labor opinion provided to SunAmerica Retirement Markets. We could also be adversely affected if the Department of Labor increases examination of these subadvisory arrangements or changes the interpretive positions described in the Advisory Opinion. We could be adversely affected if ERISA is amended in a way that overturns or materially changes the Department of Labor\u2019s position in Advisory Opinion 2001-09A, such as the imposition of additional requirements relating to conflicts of interest on the plan providers to which we act as a subadvisor. Recent regulations imposed additional requirements relating to conflicts of interest on some of the plan providers to which we act as a subadvisor. If a plan provider(s) determines not to comply with these requirements, we may therefore not be able to continue to provide our services on a subadvisory basis. In such event, we could incur additional costs to transition our services for affected plan providers and their plan sponsors to another structure.\nWe are subject to risks associated with leasing space for our retail locations.\nWe operate over 140 retail locations located on leased premises. As leases underlying these locations expire, we may be unable to negotiate a new lease or lease extension, either on commercially acceptable terms or at all, which could cause us to close offices in desirable locations. As a result, our revenue and our brand building initiatives could be adversely affected. Current locations may become unattractive to us as demographic patterns change. We generally cannot cancel current leases. Therefore, if an existing or future retail location is not profitable, and we decide to close it, we may nonetheless be committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease including, among other things, paying the base rent for the balance of the lease term. If we are unable to manage these risks effectively, our business and financial results could be adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 93305, "SIC": 6282, "TIC": "FNGN"}
