{"cik": "1041379", "company": "POPEYES LOUISIANA KITCHEN, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-23", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nCertain statements we make in this filing, and other written or oral statements made by or on our behalf, may constitute \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of the federal securities laws. Words or phrases such as \u201cshould result,\u201d \u201care expected to,\u201d \u201cwe anticipate,\u201d \u201cwe estimate,\u201d \u201cwe project,\u201d \u201cwe believe,\u201d or similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements. These statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our historical experience and our present expectations or projections. We believe that these forward-looking statements are reasonable; however, you should not place undue reliance on such statements. Such statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of future events, new information or otherwise. The following risk factors and others that we may add from time to time, are some of the factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the expected results described in our forward-looking statements.\nIf we are unable to compete successfully against other companies in the QSR industry or develop new products that appeal to consumer preferences, we could lose customers and our revenues may decline.\nThe QSR industry is intensely competitive with respect to price, quality, brand recognition, menu offerings, service and location. If we are unable to compete successfully against other foodservice providers, we could lose customers and our revenues may decline. We compete against other QSRs, including chicken, hamburger, pizza, and sandwich restaurants, other purveyors of carry out food, convenience dining establishments and other home meal replacement alternatives, including national restaurant and grocery store chains. Many of our competitors possess substantially greater financial, marketing, personnel and other resources than we do. There can be no assurance that consumers will continue to regard our products favorably, that we will be able to develop new products that appeal to consumer preferences, or that we will be able to continue to compete successfully in the QSR industry.\nAdverse publicity related to food safety and quality could result in a loss of customers and reduce our revenues.\nWe and our franchisees are, from time to time, the subject of complaints or litigation from guests alleging illness, injury or other food quality, health or operational concerns. Adverse publicity resulting from these allegations may harm our reputation or our franchisees\u2019 reputation, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or not, whether we are found liable or not, or whether those concerns relate only to a single restaurant or a limited number of restaurants or many restaurants. We are also subject to potentially negative publicity from various sources, including television and social media sites, which are beyond the control of the Company. Additionally, some animal rights organizations have engaged in confrontational demonstrations at certain restaurant companies across the country. As a multi-unit restaurant company, we can be adversely affected by the publicity surrounding allegations involving illness, injury, or other food quality, health or operational concerns. Complaints, litigation or adverse publicity experienced by one or more of our franchisees could also adversely affect our business as a whole. If we have adverse publicity due to any of these concerns, we may lose customers and our revenues may decline.\nIf our franchisees are unable or unwilling to open a sufficient number of restaurants, our growth strategy could be at risk.\nAs of December 27, 2015, we franchised 1,900 restaurants domestically and 569 restaurants in Puerto Rico, Guam, the Cayman Islands and 27 foreign countries. Our growth strategy is significantly dependent on increasing the number of our franchised restaurants. If our franchisees are unable to open a sufficient number of restaurants, our growth strategy could be significantly impaired.\nOur ability to successfully open additional franchised restaurants will depend on various factors, including the availability of suitable sites, the negotiation of acceptable leases or purchase terms for new locations, permitting and regulatory compliance, the ability to meet construction schedules, the financial and other capabilities of our franchisees, and general economic and business conditions. Many of the foregoing factors are beyond the control of our franchisees. Further, there can be no assurance that our franchisees will successfully develop or operate their restaurants in a manner consistent with our concepts and standards, or will have the business abilities or access to financial resources necessary to open the restaurants required by their agreements. Historically, there have been many instances in which Popeyes franchisees have not fulfilled their obligations under their development agreements to open new restaurants.\nChanges in consumer preferences and demographic trends could result in a loss of customers and reduce our revenues.\nFood service businesses are often affected by changes in consumer tastes, national, regional and local economic conditions, discretionary spending priorities, demographic trends, traffic patterns and the type, number and location of competing restaurants. In addition, the restaurant industry is currently under heightened legal and legislative scrutiny related to menu labeling and resulting from the perception that the practices of restaurant companies have contributed to nutritional, caloric intake, obesity, or other health\nconcerns of their guests. If we are unable to adapt to changes in consumer preferences and trends, we may lose customers and our revenues may decline.\nBecause our operating results are closely tied to the success of our franchisees, the failure or loss of one or more franchisees, operating a significant number of restaurants, could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur operating results are dependent on our franchisees and, in some cases, on certain franchisees that operate a large number of restaurants. How well our franchisees operate their restaurants and their desire to maintain their franchise relationship with us is outside of our direct control. In addition, economic conditions and the availability of credit may have an adverse impact on our franchisees. Any failure of these franchisees to operate their restaurants successfully or the loss of these franchisees could adversely impact our operating results. As of December 27, 2015, we had 360 franchisees operating restaurants within the Popeyes system and several preparing to become franchisee operators. The largest of our domestic franchisees operates 143 Popeyes restaurants; and the largest of our international franchisees operates 144 Popeyes restaurants. Typically, each of our international franchisees is responsible for the development of significantly more restaurants than our domestic franchisees. As a result, our international operations are more closely tied to the success of a smaller number of franchisees than our domestic operations. There can be no assurance that our domestic and international franchisees will operate their franchises successfully or continue to maintain their franchise relationships with us.\nOur operating results and same-store sales may fluctuate significantly and could fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nOur operating results and same-store sales have fluctuated significantly in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. If our operating results or same-store sales fluctuate or fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, the market price of our common stock could decline.\nFactors that may cause our results or same-store sales to fluctuate include the following:\n\u2022\nthe opening of new restaurants by us or our franchisees;\n\u2022\nthe closing of restaurants by us or our franchisees;\n\u2022\nincreases in the number of restaurant properties leased or sub-leased to franchisees under percentage rent arrangements;\n\u2022\nvolatility of gasoline prices;\n\u2022\nincreases in labor costs;\n\u2022\nincreases in the cost of commodities and paper products;\n\u2022\ninclement weather patterns;\n\u2022\neconomic conditions generally, and in each of the markets in which we, or our franchisees, are located; and\n\u2022\nthe change in competitive factors.\nAccordingly, results for any one period are not indicative of the results to be expected for any other period or for the full year, and same-store sales for any future period may decrease.\nWe are subject to government regulation, and our failure to comply with existing regulations or increased regulations could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe are subject to numerous federal, state, local and foreign government laws and regulations, including those relating to:\n\u2022\nminimum wage, overtime, immigration, unions and other labor issues;\n\u2022\nfranchising and joint employer liability;\n\u2022\nthe preparation and sale of food;\n\u2022\nemployee healthcare legislation;\n\u2022\nbuilding and zoning requirements;\n\u2022\nenvironmental protection;\n\u2022\ninformation security and data protection;\n\u2022\ncompliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act; and\n\u2022\nworking and safety conditions.\nIf we fail to comply with existing or future regulations, we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions, or we could suffer business interruption or loss. In addition, our capital expenses could increase due to remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any of these laws or regulations.\nWe are also subject to regulation by the Federal Trade Commission and to state and foreign laws that govern the offer, sale and termination of franchises and the refusal to renew franchises. The failure to comply with these regulations in any jurisdiction or to obtain required approvals could result in a ban or temporary suspension on future franchise sales or fines or require us to make a rescission offer to franchisees, any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nFailure to protect our information systems against cyber attacks or information security breaches, including failure to protect the integrity and security of individually identifiable data of our customers, franchisees and employees, could expose us to litigation, damage our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe and our franchisees rely on computer systems and information technology to conduct our business. These systems are inherently vulnerable to disruption or failure, as well as internal and external security breaches, or other disruptive problems caused by hackers. A failure of these systems could cause an interruption in our business which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, we receive and maintain certain personal information about our customers, franchisees and employees. The use of this information by us is regulated by applicable law. If our or our franchisees' security and information systems are compromised or our business associates fail to comply with these laws and regulations and this information is obtained by unauthorized persons or used inappropriately, it could adversely affect our reputation, as well as our restaurant operations and results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, we could be subject to litigation or the imposition of penalties. As privacy and information security laws and regulations change, we may incur additional costs to ensure we remain in compliance.\nIf the cost of chicken increases, our cost of sales will increase and our operating results could be adversely affected.\nThe principal raw material for Popeyes is fresh chicken. Any material increase in the costs of fresh chicken could adversely affect our operating results. Our company-operated and franchised restaurants purchase fresh chicken from various suppliers who service us and our franchisees from various plant locations. These costs are significantly affected by increases in the cost of chicken, which can result from a number of factors, including increases in the cost of grain, disease, declining market supply of fast-food sized chickens and other factors that affect availability. Because our purchasing agreements for fresh chicken allow the prices that we pay for chicken to fluctuate, a rise in the prices of chicken products could expose us to cost increases. If we fail to anticipate and react to increasing food costs by adjusting our purchasing practices or increasing our sales prices, our cost of sales may increase and our operating results could be adversely affected.\nCurrency, economic, political and other risks associated with our international operations could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe face currency, economic, political, and other risks associated with our international operations. As of December 27, 2015, we had 569 franchised restaurants in Puerto Rico, Guam, the Cayman Islands and 27 foreign countries. Business at these operations is conducted in the respective local currency. The amount owed to us is based on a conversion of the royalties and other fees to U.S. dollars using the prevailing exchange rate. In particular, the royalties are based on a percentage of net sales generated by our foreign franchisees\u2019 operations. Consequently, our revenues from international franchisees are exposed to the potentially adverse effects of our franchisees\u2019 operations, currency exchange rates, local economic conditions, political instability and other risks associated with doing business in foreign countries. We expect that our franchise revenues generated from international operations will increase in the future, thus increasing our exposure to changes in foreign economic conditions and currency fluctuations.\nDisruptions in the financial markets may adversely affect the availability and cost of credit and changes in economic conditions may impact consumer spending patterns.\nThe ability of our franchisees and prospective franchisees to obtain financing for development of new restaurants or reinvestment in existing restaurants depends in part upon financial and economic conditions which are beyond their control. If our franchisees are unable to obtain financing on acceptable terms to develop new restaurants or reinvest in existing restaurants, our business and financial results could be adversely affected.\nDisruptions in the financial markets and adverse changes to economic conditions may also affect consumer spending patterns. There can be no assurances that governmental or other responses to economic challenges will restore or maintain consumer confidence, stabilize the markets or increase or maintain liquidity and the availability of credit. Declines in or displacement of our guests\u2019 discretionary spending could reduce traffic in our system\u2019s restaurants and/or limit our ability to raise prices.\nInstances of food-borne illness or avian flu could adversely affect the price and availability of poultry and other foods and create negative publicity which could result in a decline in our sales.\nInstances of food-borne illness or avian flu could adversely affect the price and availability of poultry and other foods. As a result, Popeyes restaurants could experience a significant increase in food costs if there are additional instances of avian flu or food-borne illnesses. In addition to losses associated with higher prices and a lower supply of our food ingredients, instances of food-borne illnesses could result in negative publicity for us. This negative publicity, as well as any other negative publicity concerning food products we serve, may reduce demand for our food and could result in a decrease in guest traffic to our restaurants and causing a decline in our sales.\nShortages or interruptions in the supply or delivery of fresh food products could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe and our franchisees are dependent on frequent deliveries of fresh food products that meet our specifications. Shortages or interruptions in the supply of fresh food products caused by unanticipated demand, natural disasters, problems in production or distribution, declining number of distributors, inclement weather or other conditions could adversely affect the availability, quality and cost of ingredients, which would adversely affect our operating results.\nIf any member of our senior management left us, our operating results could be adversely affected, and we may not be able to attract and retain additional qualified management personnel.\nWe are dependent on the experience and industry knowledge of the members of our senior management team. If, for any reason, our senior executives do not continue to be active in management or if we are unable to attract and retain qualified new members of senior management, our operating results could be adversely affected. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to attract and retain additional qualified senior executives as needed. We have employment agreements with certain executives; however, these agreements do not ensure their continued employment with us.\nInefficient restaurant technology or the failure to successfully implement technology initiatives in the future could adversely impact operating results.\nWe and our franchisees rely on technology in the restaurants not only to efficiently operate but also to drive sales growth and margin improvement. Our strategic technology initiatives may not be timely implemented or may not achieve the desired results. Certain technology systems may also be unreliable or inefficient, and the technology vendors may limit or terminate product support and maintenance, which could impact the reliability of critical systems supporting operations. Additionally, implementing the evolving technology demands of the consumer may place a significant financial burden on our restaurant operators. Any such deficiencies could impact sales and profitability by disrupting our operations, damaging our reputation or subjecting us to excessive costs and liabilities.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property, which could harm the value of our Popeyes brand and branded products and adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on a combination of trademarks, copyrights, service marks, trade secrets and similar intellectual property rights to protect our Popeyes brand and branded products. Our expansion strategy depends on our continued ability to use our intellectual property to increase brand awareness and further develop our branded products in both domestic and international markets. If our efforts to protect our intellectual property are not adequate, or if any third party misappropriates or infringes on our intellectual property, the value of our Popeyes brand may be harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, including the failure of our Popeyes brand and branded products to achieve and/or maintain market acceptance.\nAlso, certain branding names, phrases, and designs that we use have not been registered in all of the countries in which we do business and may never be registered in all of these countries. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S. We cannot be certain that we will be able to adequately protect our use of various marks or that their use will not result in liability for trademark infringement, trademark dilution or unfair competition.\nAs the franchisor of the Popeyes system, we try to ensure that the quality of our Popeyes brand and branded products is maintained by all of our franchisees, but cannot be certain that franchisees or others will not take actions that adversely affect the value of our intellectual property or reputation.\nThere can be no assurance that all of the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property in the U.S. and foreign countries will be adequate. Further, through acquisitions of third parties, we may acquire brands and related trademarks that are subject to the same risks as the brand and trademarks we currently own.\nOur credit facility may limit our ability to expand our business, and our ability to comply with the repayment requirements, covenants, tests and restrictions contained in the credit facility may be affected by events that are beyond our control.\nThe credit facility contains financial and other covenants, including covenants which require us to maintain various financial ratios, limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness, restrict the amount of capital expenditures that may be incurred, restrict the payment of cash dividends and limit the amount of debt which can be loaned to our franchisees or guaranteed on their behalf. This facility also limits our ability to engage in mergers or acquisitions, sell certain assets, repurchase our stock and enter into certain lease transactions. The credit facility includes customary events of default, including, but not limited to, the failure to maintain the financial ratios described above, the failure to pay any interest, principal or fees when due, the failure to perform certain covenant agreements, inaccurate or false representations or warranties, insolvency or bankruptcy, change of control, the occurrence of certain ERISA events and judgment defaults. The restrictive covenants in our credit facility may limit our ability to expand our business, and our ability to comply with these provisions may be impacted by events beyond our control. A failure to comply with any of the financial and operating covenants included in the credit facility would result in an event of default, permitting the lenders to accelerate the maturity of outstanding indebtedness. This acceleration could also result in the acceleration of other indebtedness that we may have outstanding at that time were we to default on the terms and conditions of the credit facility and the debt were accelerated by the facility\u2019s lenders, such developments would have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and our liquidity.", "PERMNO": 88940, "SIC": 6794, "TIC": "PLKI"}
