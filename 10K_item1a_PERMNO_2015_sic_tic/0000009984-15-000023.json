{"cik": "9984", "company": "BARNES GROUP INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-23", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of the following risks. Please note that additional risks not presently known to us may also materially impact our business and operations.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS\nWe depend on revenues and earnings from a small number of significant customers. Any bankruptcy of or loss, cancellation, reduction or delay in purchases by these customers could harm our business. In 2014, our net sales to General Electric and its subsidiaries accounted for 19% of our total sales and approximately 54% of Aerospace's net sales. Additionally, approximately 16% of Aerospace's sales in 2014 were to its next two largest customers. Approximately 10% of Industrial's sales in 2014 were to its three largest customers. Some of our success will depend on the business strength and viability of those customers. We cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our largest customers. A tightening in the credit markets may affect our customers\u2019 ability to raise debt or equity capital. This may reduce the amount of liquidity available to our customers which may limit their ability to purchase products. Some of our customers may in the future reduce their purchases due to economic conditions or shift their purchases from us to our competitors, in-house or to other sources. Some of our long-term sales agreements provide that until a firm order is placed by a customer for a particular product, the customer may unilaterally reduce or discontinue its projected purchases without penalty, or terminate for convenience. The loss of one or more of our largest customers, any reduction, cancellation or delay in sales to these customers (including a reduction in aftermarket volume in our RSPs), our inability to successfully develop relationships with new customers, or future price concessions we make to retain customers could significantly reduce our sales and profitability.\nWe have significant indebtedness that could affect our operations and financial condition. At December 31, 2014, we had consolidated debt obligations of $504.7 million, representing approximately 31% of our total capital (indebtedness plus stockholders\u2019 equity) as of that date. Our level of indebtedness, proportion of variable rate debt obligations and the significant debt servicing costs associated with that indebtedness may adversely affect our operations and financial condition. For example, our indebtedness could require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our debt, thereby reducing the amount of our cash flows available for working capital, capital expenditures, investments in technology and research and development, acquisitions, dividends and other general corporate purposes; limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the industries in which we compete; place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors, some of whom have lower debt service obligations and greater financial resources than we do; limit our ability to borrow additional funds; or increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions. In addition, conditions in the worldwide credit markets may limit our ability to expand our credit lines beyond current bank commitments.\nEconomic weakness and uncertainty could adversely affect our operations and financial condition. Prolonged slow growth or a downturn, worsening or broadening of adverse conditions in the worldwide and domestic economies could affect purchases of our products, and create or exacerbate credit issues, cash flow issues and other financial hardships for us and for our suppliers and customers. Depending upon their severity and duration, these conditions could have a material adverse impact on our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur failure to meet certain financial covenants required by our debt agreements may materially and adversely affect our assets, financial position and cash flows. A majority of our debt arrangements require us to maintain certain debt and interest coverage ratios and limit our ability to incur debt, make investments or undertake certain other business activities. These requirements could limit our ability to obtain future financing and may prevent us from taking advantage of attractive business opportunities. Our ability to meet the financial covenants or requirements in our debt arrangements may be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will satisfy such covenants and requirements. A breach of these covenants or our inability to comply with the restrictions could result in an event of default under our debt arrangements which, in turn, could result in an event of default under the terms of our other indebtedness. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under our debt arrangements, after the expiration of any grace periods, our lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under our debt arrangements, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. If this were to\nhappen, we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay in full the payments due under those arrangements or our other indebtedness or that we could find alternative financing to replace that indebtedness.\nOur operations depend on our manufacturing, sales, and service facilities and information systems in various parts of the world which are subject to physical, financial, regulatory, environmental, operational and other risks that could disrupt our operations. We have a significant number of manufacturing facilities and technical service, and sales centers both within and outside the U.S. The international scope of our business subjects us to increased risks and uncertainties such as threats of war, terrorism and instability of governments; compliance with U.S. laws affecting operations outside of the U.S., such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; and economic, regulatory and legal systems in countries in which we or our customers conduct business.\nSome of our facilities are located in areas that may be affected by natural disasters, including earthquakes or tsunamis, which could cause significant damage and disruption to the operations of those facilities and, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Additionally, some of our manufacturing equipment and tooling is custom-made and is not readily replaceable. Loss of such equipment or tooling could have a negative impact on our manufacturing business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAlthough we have obtained property damage and business interruption insurance, a major catastrophe such as an earthquake, hurricane, flood, tsunami or other natural disaster at any of our sites, or significant labor strikes, work stoppages, political unrest, or any of the events described above, in any of the areas where we conduct operations could result in a prolonged interruption of our business. Any disruption resulting from these events could cause significant delays in the manufacture or shipment of products or the provision of repair and other services that may result in our loss of sales and customers. Our insurance will not cover all potential risks, and we cannot assure you that we will have adequate insurance to compensate us for all losses that result from any insured risks. Any material loss not covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We cannot assure you that insurance will be available in the future at a cost acceptable to us or at a cost that will not have a material adverse effect on our profitability, net income and cash flows.\nAny disruption or failure in the operation of our information systems, including from conversions or integrations of information technology or reporting systems, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Our information technology (IT) systems are an integral part of our business. We depend upon our IT systems to help process orders, manage inventory and collect accounts receivable. Our IT systems also allow us to purchase, sell and ship products efficiently and on a timely basis, to maintain cost-effective operations, and to help provide superior service to our customers. We are currently in the process of implementing enterprise resource planning (ERP) platforms across certain of our businesses, and we expect that we will need to continue to improve and further integrate our IT systems, on an ongoing basis in order to effectively run our business. If we fail to successfully manage and integrate our IT systems, including these ERP platforms, it could adversely affect our business or operating results.\nFurther, in the ordinary course of our business, we store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, and personally identifiable information of our employees, in our data centers and on our networks. The secure maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our business operations. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, and regulatory penalties, disrupt our operations, and damage our reputation, which could adversely affect our business, revenues and competitive position.\nThe global nature of our business exposes us to foreign currency fluctuations that may affect our future revenues, debt levels and profitability. We have manufacturing facilities and technical service, sales and distribution centers around the world, and the majority of our foreign operations use the local currency as their functional currency. These include, among others, the Brazilian real, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Chinese yuan, Euro, Japanese yen, Korean won, Mexican peso, Singapore dollar, Swedish krona, Swiss franc and Thai baht. Since our financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, changes in currency exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and other currencies expose us to translation risk when the local currency financial statements are translated to U.S. dollars. Changes in currency exchange rates may also expose us to transaction risk. We may buy protecting or offsetting positions or hedges in certain currencies to reduce our exposure to currency exchange fluctuations; however, these transactions may not be adequate or effective to protect us from the exposure for which they are purchased. We have not engaged in any speculative hedging activities. Currency fluctuations may impact our revenues and profitability in the future.\nThe global nature of our operations and assets subject us to additional financial and regulatory risks. We have operations and assets in various parts of the world. In addition, we sell or may in the future sell our products and services to the U.S. and foreign governments and in foreign countries. As a global business, we are subject to complex laws and regulations in the U.S. and other countries in which we operate, and associated risks, including: U.S. imposed embargoes of sales to specific countries; foreign import controls (which may be arbitrarily imposed or enforced); import regulations and duties; export regulations (which require us to comply with stringent licensing regimes); anti-dumping regulations; unclaimed property regulations; price and currency controls; exchange rate fluctuations; dividend remittance restrictions; expropriation of assets; war, civil uprisings and riots; government instability; government contracting requirements including cost accounting standards, including various procurement, security, and audit requirements, as well as requirements to certify to the government compliance with these requirements; the necessity of obtaining governmental approval for new and continuing products and operations; and legal systems or decrees, laws, taxes, regulations, interpretations and court decisions that are not always fully developed and that may be retroactively or arbitrarily applied. We have experienced inadvertent violations of some of these regulations, including export regulations, safety and environmental regulations, regulations prohibiting sales of certain products and product labeling regulations, in the past, none of which has had or, we believe, will have a material adverse effect on our business. However, any significant violations of these or other regulations in the future could result in civil or criminal sanctions, and the loss of export or other licenses which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We may also be subject to unanticipated income taxes, excise duties, import taxes, export taxes, value added taxes, or other governmental assessments, and taxes may be impacted by changes in legislation in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate. In addition, our organizational and capital structure may limit our ability to transfer funds between countries, particularly into the U.S., without incurring adverse tax consequences. Any of these events could result in a loss of business or other unexpected costs that could reduce sales or profits and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur ability to recover deferred tax assets depends on future income. From time to time, we may have significant deferred tax assets. The realization of these assets is dependent on our ability to generate future taxable income. In the event we do not generate sufficient taxable income, there could be a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in the availability or price of materials, products and energy resources could adversely affect our costs and profitability. We may be adversely affected by the availability or price of raw materials, products and energy resources, particularly related to certain manufacturing operations that utilize steel, stainless steel, titanium, Inconel, Hastelloys and other specialty materials. The availability and price of raw materials and energy resources may be subject to curtailment or change due to, among other things, new laws or regulations, global economic or political events including strikes, terrorist attacks and war, suppliers\u2019 allocations to other purchasers, interruptions in production by suppliers, changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels. In some instances there are limited sources for raw materials and a limited number of primary suppliers for some of our products for resale. Although we are not dependent upon any single source for any of our principal raw materials or products for resale, and such materials and products have, historically, been readily available, we cannot assure you that such raw materials and products will continue to be readily available. Disruption in the supply of raw materials, products or energy resources or our inability to come to favorable agreements with our suppliers could impair our ability to manufacture, sell and deliver our products and require us to pay higher prices. Any increase in prices for such raw materials, products or energy resources could materially adversely affect our costs and our profitability.\nUnder the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the SEC established disclosure and reporting requirements regarding the use of \u201cconflict minerals\" mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries. These requirements could adversely affect the sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of certain of our products. As a result, we may not be able to obtain certain materials or products at competitive prices. We have and expect to continue to incur costs to comply with these new requirements, including for due diligence to identify the sources of any conflict minerals used in our products. Further, we may face reputational risk and other challenges with our customers and suppliers if we are unable to verify sufficiently that the minerals used in our products are conflict free.\nWe maintain pension and other postretirement benefit plans in the U.S. and certain international locations. Our costs of providing defined benefit plans are dependent upon a number of factors, such as the rates of return on the plans\u2019 assets, exchange rate fluctuations, future governmental regulation, global equity prices, and our required and/or voluntary contributions to the plans. Declines in the stock market, prevailing interest rates, declines in discount rates, improvements in mortality rates and rising medical costs may cause an increase in our pension and other postretirement benefit expenses in the future and result in reductions in our pension fund asset values and increases in our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. These changes have caused and may continue to cause a significant reduction in our net worth and without sustained growth in the pension investments over time to increase the value of the plans\u2019 assets, and depending upon the other factors listed above, we could be required to increase funding for some or all of these pension and postretirement plans.\nOur cash is highly concentrated with certain financial institutions. At various times we have a concentration of cash in accounts with financial institutions in the U.S. and around the globe. Our holdings in certain of these institutions significantly exceeded the insured limits of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or their equivalent outside the U.S. at December 31, 2014.\nWe carry significant inventories and a loss in net realizable value could cause a decline in our net worth. At December 31, 2014, our inventories totaled $212.0 million. Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market based on management's judgments and estimates concerning future sales levels, quantities and prices at which such inventories will be sold in the normal course of business. Accelerating the disposal process or incorrect estimates of future sales potential may necessitate future reduction to inventory values. The Company's inventories include certain parts related to specific engines within the aftermarket repair and overhaul business. The demand for these parts and our ability to utilize these parts depends on the frequency and scope of repair and maintenance of aircraft engines and our ability to effectively access that market, and a decline in demand could require us to write off a portion of our inventory. See \u201cPart II - Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies\u201d.\nWe have significant goodwill and an impairment of our goodwill could cause a decline in our net worth. Our total assets include substantial goodwill. At December 31, 2014, our goodwill totaled $594.9 million. The goodwill results from our prior acquisitions, representing the excess of the purchase price we paid over the net assets of the companies acquired. We assess whether there has been an impairment in the value of our goodwill during each calendar year or sooner if triggering events warrant. If future operating performance at one or more of our reporting units does not meet expectations or fair values fall due to significant stock market declines, we may be required to reflect a non-cash charge to operating results for goodwill impairment. The recognition of an impairment of a significant portion of goodwill would negatively affect our results of operations and total capitalization, the effect of which could be material. See \u201cPart II - Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies\u201d.\nWe could be adversely affected by changes in interest rates. Our profitability may be adversely affected as a result of increases in interest rates. At December 31, 2014, we and our subsidiaries had approximately $504.7 million aggregate principal amount of consolidated debt obligations outstanding, of which approximately 60% had interest rates that float with the market (not hedged against interest rate fluctuations). A 100 basis point increase in the interest rate on the floating rate debt in effect at December 31, 2014 would result in an approximate $3.0 million annualized increase in interest expense.\nWe may not realize all of the sales expected from our existing backlog or anticipated orders. At December 31, 2014, we had $728.6 million of order backlog, the majority of which related to aerospace OEM customers. There can be no assurances that the revenues projected in our backlog will be realized or, if realized, will result in profits. We consider backlog to be firm customer orders for future delivery. From time to time, OEM customers provide projections of components and assemblies that they anticipate purchasing in the future under new and existing programs. Such projections are not included in our backlog unless we have received a firm order from our customers. Our customers may have the right under certain circumstances or with certain penalties or consequences to terminate, reduce or defer firm orders that we have in backlog. If our customers terminate, reduce or defer firm orders, we may be protected from certain costs and losses, but our sales will nevertheless be adversely affected. Although we strive to maintain ongoing relationships with our customers, there is an ongoing risk that orders may be cancelled or rescheduled due to fluctuations in our customers\u2019 business needs or purchasing budgets.\nAlso, our realization of sales from new and existing programs is inherently subject to a number of important risks and uncertainties, including whether our customers execute the launch of product programs on time, or at all, the number of units that our customers actually produce, the timing of production and manufacturing insourcing decisions made by our customers. In addition, until firm orders are placed, our customers generally have the right to discontinue a program or replace us with another supplier at any time without penalty. Our failure to realize sales from new and existing programs could have a material adverse effect on our net sales, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may not recover all of our up-front costs related to new or existing programs. New programs may require significant up-front investments for capital equipment, engineering, inventory, design and tooling. As OEMs in the transportation and aerospace industries have looked to suppliers to bear increasing responsibility for the design, engineering and manufacture of systems and components, they have increasingly shifted the financial risk associated with those responsibilities to the suppliers as well. This trend may continue and is most evident in the area of engineering cost reimbursement. We cannot assure you that we will have adequate funds to make such up-front investments or to recover such costs from our customers as part of our product pricing. In the event that we are unable to make such investments, or to recover them through sales or direct reimbursement from our customers, our profitability, liquidity and cash flows may be adversely affected. In addition, we incur costs and make capital expenditures for new program awards based upon certain estimates of\nproduction volumes and production complexity. While we attempt to recover such costs and capital expenditures by appropriately pricing our products, the prices of our products are based in part upon planned production volumes. If the actual production is significantly less than planned or significantly more complex than anticipated, we may be unable to recover such costs. In addition, because a significant portion of our overall costs is fixed, declines in our customers\u2019 production levels can adversely affect the level of our reported profits even if our up-front investments are recovered.\nWe may not realize all of the intangible assets related to the Aerospace aftermarket businesses. Our total investments in participation fees under our Revenue Sharing Programs (RSPs) as of December 31, 2014 equaled $293.7 million, all of which have been paid. At December 31, 2014, the remaining unamortized balance of these participation fees was $220.7 million. We participate in aftermarket RSPs under which we receive an exclusive right to supply designated aftermarket parts over the life of the related aircraft engine program to our customer, General Electric. As consideration, we pay participation fees, which are recorded as intangible assets and are recognized as a reduction of sales over the estimated useful life of the related engine programs which range up to 30 years.\nWe entered into Component Repair Programs (\"CRPs\"), also with General Electric, during the fourth quarter of 2013 (\"CRP 1\") and the second quarter of 2014 (\"CRP 2\"). The CRPs provide for, among other items, the right to sell certain aftermarket component repair services for CFM56, CF6 and LM engines directly to other customers as one of a few GE licensed suppliers. In addition, the CRPs extend certain existing contracts under which the Company currently provides these services directly to GE.\nWe agreed to pay $26.6 million as consideration for the rights related to CRP 1. Of this balance, we paid $16.6 million in the fourth quarter of 2013 and $9.1 million in the fourth quarter of 2014. The remaining payment of $0.9 million has been included within accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Financial Statements. We agreed to pay $80.0 million as consideration for the rights related to CRP 2. We paid $41.0 million in the second quarter of 2014, $20.0 million in the fourth quarter of 2014 and the remaining payment of $19.0 million, also included within accrued liabilities, will be paid in the second quarter of 2015. We recorded the CRP payments as an intangible asset which is recognized as a reduction of sales over the remaining useful life of these engine programs.\nThe realizability of each asset is dependent upon future revenues related to the programs' aftermarket parts and services and is subject to impairment testing if circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable. The potential exists that actual revenues will not meet expectations due to a change in market conditions, including, for example, the replacement of older engines with new, more fuel-efficient engines or our ability to capture additional market share within the aftermarket business. A shortfall in future revenues may result in the failure to realize the net amount of the investments, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, future growth and profitability could be impacted by the amortization of the participation fees and licenses, and the expiration of the international tax incentives on these programs.\nWe face risks of cost overruns and losses on fixed-price contracts. We sell certain of our products under firm, fixed-price contracts providing for a fixed price for the products regardless of the production or purchase costs incurred by us. The cost of producing products may be adversely affected by increases in the cost of labor, materials, fuel, outside processing, overhead and other factors, including manufacturing inefficiencies. Increased production costs may result in cost overruns and losses on contracts.\nThe departure of existing management and key personnel, a shortage of skilled employees or a lack of qualified sales professionals could materially affect our business, operations and prospects. Our executive officers are important to the management and direction of our business. Our future success depends, in large part, on our ability to retain or replace these officers and other capable management personnel. Although we believe we will be able to attract and retain talented personnel and replace key personnel should the need arise, our inability to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Because of the complex nature of many of our products and services, we are generally dependent on an educated and highly skilled workforce, including, for example, our engineering talent. In addition, there are significant costs associated with the hiring and training of sales professionals. We could be adversely affected by a shortage of available skilled employees or the loss of a significant number of our sales professionals.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights effectively, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. We own or are licensed under various intellectual property rights, including patents, trademarks and trade secrets. Our intellectual property rights may not be sufficiently broad or otherwise may not provide us a significant competitive advantage, and patents may not be issued for pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us. In addition, the steps that we have taken to maintain and protect our intellectual property may not prevent it from being challenged, invalidated, circumvented or designed-around, particularly in countries where intellectual property rights are not\nhighly developed or protected. In some circumstances, enforcement may not be available to us because an infringer has a dominant intellectual property position or for other business reasons, or countries may require compulsory licensing of our intellectual property. We also rely on nondisclosure and noncompetition agreements with employees, consultants and other parties to protect, in part, confidential information, trade secrets and other proprietary rights. There can be no assurance that these agreements will adequately protect these intangible assets and will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach, or that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information. Our failure to obtain or maintain intellectual property rights that convey competitive advantage, adequately protect our intellectual property or detect or prevent circumvention or unauthorized use of such property and the cost of enforcing our intellectual property rights could adversely impact our competitive position, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny product liability, warranty, contractual or other claims in excess of insurance may adversely affect our financial condition. Our operations expose us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the design, manufacture and sale of our products and the products we buy from third parties and sell to our customers, or to potential warranty, contractual or other claims. For example, we may be exposed to potential liability for personal injury, property damage or death as a result of the failure of an aircraft component designed, manufactured or sold by us, or the failure of an aircraft component that has been serviced by us or of the components themselves. While we have liability insurance for certain risks, our insurance may not cover all liabilities. Additionally, insurance coverage may not be available in the future at a cost acceptable to us. Any material liability not covered by insurance or for which third-party indemnification is not available for the full amount of the loss could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFrom time to time, we receive product warranty claims, under which we may be required to bear costs of repair or replacement of certain of our products. Warranty claims may range from individual customer claims to full recalls of all products in the field. We vigorously defend ourselves in connection with these matters. We cannot, however, assure you that the costs, charges and liabilities associated with these matters will not be material, or that those costs, charges and liabilities will not exceed any amounts reserved for them in our consolidated financial statements.\nOur business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted by strikes or work stoppages. Approximately 15% of our U.S. employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements and more than 32% of our non-U.S. employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or statutory trade union agreements. The Company is currently in the process of negotiating a collective bargaining agreement (\u201cCBA\u201d) with certain unionized employees at the Bristol, Connecticut and Corry, Pennsylvania facilities, which are located within the Associated Spring business unit, and which covers approximately 233 employees. The current CBA expired on November 30, 2014, and we continue to negotiate a successor agreement. In 2015, we are also scheduled to conduct local negotiations with our unionized employees at our Corry, Pennsylvania facility, which covers approximately 130 employees. In addition, we have annual negotiations in Brazil and Mexico and, collectively, these negotiations cover approximately 329 employees in those two countries. We also expect to have negotiations in 2015 with two of our German locations, a Singapore location, and our Sweden location, which collectively cover over 500 employees. Although we believe that our relations with our employees are good, we cannot assure you that we will be successful in negotiating new collective bargaining agreements or that such negotiations will not result in significant increases in the cost of labor, including healthcare, pensions or other benefits. Any potential strikes or work stoppages, and the resulting adverse impact on our relationships with customers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Similarly, a protracted strike or work stoppage at any of our major customers, suppliers or other vendors could materially adversely affect our business.\nChanges in accounting guidance and taxation requirements could affect our financial results. New accounting guidance that may become applicable to us from time to time, or changes in the interpretations of existing guidance, could have a significant effect on our reported results for the affected periods. For example, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new accounting standard for revenue recognition in May 2014 - Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2014-09, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)\". Although we are currently in the process of evaluating the impact of ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated financial statements, it could change the way we account for certain of our sales transactions. Adoption of the standard could have a significant impact on our financial statements and may retroactively affect the accounting treatment of transactions completed before adoption. In addition, our products are subject to import and excise duties and/or sales or value-added taxes in many jurisdictions in which we operate. Increases in indirect taxes could affect our products\u2019 affordability and therefore reduce our sales. We are also subject to income tax in numerous jurisdictions in which we generate revenues. Changes in tax laws, tax rates or tax rulings may have a significant adverse impact on our effective tax rate. Among other things, our tax liabilities are affected by the mix of pretax income or loss among the tax jurisdictions in which we operate and the repatriation of foreign earnings to the U.S. We must exercise judgment in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes, interest and penalties; accordingly, future events could change management\u2019s assessment of these amounts.\nRISKS RELATED TO THE INDUSTRIES IN WHICH WE OPERATE\nA general economic downturn could adversely affect our business and financial results. All of our businesses are impacted by the health of the economies in which they operate. A decline in economies in which we operate could reduce demand for our products and services or increase pricing pressures, thereby having an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We derive a large portion of our sales from the transportation industry. The operation of our business within that industry subjects us to the pressures applicable to all companies operating in it, including unfavorable pricing pressures. While the precise effects of instability in the transportation industry are difficult to determine, they may negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe operate in very competitive markets. We may not be able to compete effectively with our competitors, and competitive pressures could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Our two global business segments compete with a number of larger and smaller companies in the markets we serve. Some of our competitors have greater financial, production, research and development, or other resources than we do. Within Aerospace, certain of our OEM customers compete with our repair and overhaul business. Some of our OEM customers in the aerospace industry also compete with us where they have the ability to manufacture the components and assemblies that we supply to them but have chosen, for capacity limitations, cost considerations or other reasons, to outsource the manufacturing to us. Our two business segments compete on the basis of price, service, quality, reliability of supply, technology, innovation and design. We must continue to make investments to maintain and improve our competitive position. We cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make such investments or that we will be successful in maintaining our competitive position. Our competitors may develop products or services, or methods of delivering those products or services that are superior to our products, services or methods. Our competitors may also adapt more quickly than us to new technologies or evolving customer requirements. Pricing pressures could cause us to adjust the prices of certain of our products to stay competitive. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully with our existing or future competitors. Also, if consolidation of our existing competitors occurs, we would expect the competitive pressures we face to increase. Our failure to compete successfully could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur customers\u2019 businesses are generally cyclical. Weaknesses in the industries in which our customers operate could impact our revenues and profitability. The industries to which we sell tend to decline in response to overall declines in industrial production. Aerospace is heavily dependent on the commercial aerospace industry, which is cyclical and a long cycle industry. Industrial is dependent on the transportation industry, and general industrial and tooling markets, all of which are also cyclical. Many of our customers have historically experienced periodic downturns, which often have had a negative effect on demand for our products.\nOriginal equipment manufacturers in the aerospace and transportation industries have significant pricing leverage over suppliers and may be able to achieve price reductions over time. Additionally, we may not be successful in our efforts to raise prices on our customers. There is substantial and continuing pressure from OEMs in the transportation industries, including automotive and aerospace, to reduce the prices they pay to suppliers. We attempt to manage such downward pricing pressure, while trying to preserve our business relationships with our customers, by seeking to reduce our production costs through various measures, including purchasing raw materials and components at lower prices and implementing cost-effective process improvements. Our suppliers have periodically resisted, and in the future may resist, pressure to lower their prices and may seek to impose price increases. If we are unable to offset OEM price reductions, our profitability and cash flows could be adversely affected. In addition, OEMs have substantial leverage in setting purchasing and payment terms, including the terms of accelerated payment programs under which payments are made prior to the account due date in return for an early payment discount. OEMs can unexpectedly change their purchasing policies or payment practices, which could have a negative impact on our short-term working capital.\nDemand for our defense-related products depends on government spending. A portion of Aerospace's sales is derived from the military market, including single-sourced and dual-sourced sales. The military market is largely dependent upon government budgets and is subject to governmental appropriations. Although multi-year contracts may be authorized in connection with major procurements, funds are generally appropriated on a fiscal year basis even though a program may be expected to continue for several years. Consequently, programs are often only partially funded and additional funds are committed only as further appropriations are made. We cannot assure you that maintenance of or increases in defense spending will be allocated to programs that would benefit our business. Moreover, we cannot assure you that new military aircraft programs in which we participate will enter full-scale production as expected. A decrease in levels of defense spending or the government\u2019s termination of, or failure to fully fund, one or more of the contracts for the programs in which we participate could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nThe consolidation occurring in the industries in which we operate could adversely affect our business and financial results. The industries in which we operate have been experiencing consolidation. There has been consolidation of both suppliers and the customers we serve. Supplier consolidation is in part attributable to OEMs more frequently awarding long-term sole source or preferred supplier contracts to the most capable suppliers in an effort to reduce the total number of suppliers from whom components and systems are purchased. We cannot assure you that our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows will not be adversely impacted as a result of consolidation by our competitors or customers.\nThe aerospace industry is highly regulated. Complications related to aerospace regulations may adversely affect the Company. A substantial portion of our income is derived from our aerospace businesses. The aerospace industry is highly regulated in the U.S. by the Federal Aviation Administration, or FAA, and in other countries by similar regulatory agencies. We must be certified by these agencies and, in some cases, by individual OEMs in order to engineer and service systems and components used in specific aircraft models. If material authorizations or approvals were delayed, revoked or suspended, our business could be adversely affected. New or more stringent governmental regulations may be adopted, or industry oversight heightened, in the future, and we may incur significant expenses to comply with any new regulations or any heightened industry oversight.\nEnvironmental regulations impose costs and regulatory requirements on our operations. Environmental compliance may be more costly than we expect, and we may be subject to material environmental-based claims in the future. Our past and present business operations and past and present ownership and operations of real property and the use, sale, storage and handling of chemicals and hazardous products subject us to extensive and changing U.S. federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, as well as those of other countries, pertaining to the discharge of materials into the environment, enforcement, disposition of wastes (including hazardous wastes), the use, shipping, labeling, and storage of chemicals and hazardous materials, building requirements, or otherwise relating to protection of the environment. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations. In addition, new laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new clean-up requirements could require us to incur costs or become subject to new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations. In addition, many of our current and former properties are or have been used for industrial purposes. Accordingly, we monitor hazardous waste management and applicable environmental permitting and reporting for compliance with applicable laws at our locations in the ordinary course of our business. We may be subject to potential material liabilities relating to any investigation and clean-up of our locations or properties where we delivered hazardous waste for handling or disposal that may be contaminated or which may have been contaminated prior to our purchase, and to claims alleging personal injury.\nFluctuations in jet fuel and other energy prices may impact our operating results. Fuel costs constitute a significant portion of operating expenses for companies in the aerospace industry. Fluctuations in fuel costs could impact levels and frequency of aircraft maintenance and overhaul activities, and airlines' decisions on maintaining, deferring or canceling new aircraft purchases, in part based on the value associated with new fuel efficient technologies. Widespread disruption to oil production, refinery operations and pipeline capacity in certain areas of the U.S. can impact the price of jet fuel significantly. Conflicts in the Middle East, an important source of oil for the U.S. and other countries where we do business, cause prices for fuel to be volatile. Because we and many of our customers are in the aerospace industry, these fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nOur products and services may be rendered obsolete by new products, technologies and processes. Our manufacturing operations focus on highly engineered components which require extensive engineering and research and development time. Our competitive advantage may be adversely impacted if we cannot continue to introduce new products ahead of our competition, or if our products are rendered obsolete by other products or by new, different technologies and processes. The success of our new products will depend on a number of factors, including innovation, customer acceptance, the efficiency of our suppliers in providing materials and component parts, and the performance and quality of our products relative to those of our competitors. We cannot predict the level of market acceptance or the amount of market share our new products will achieve. Additionally, we may face increased or unexpected costs associated with new product introduction including the use of additional resources such as personnel. We cannot assure that we will not experience new product introduction delays in the future.\nRISKS RELATED TO RESTRUCTURING, ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES AND JOINT VENTURES\nOur acquisition and divestiture strategies and our restructuring activities may not be successful. We have made a number of acquisitions in the past and we anticipate that we may, from time to time, acquire additional businesses, assets or securities of companies that we believe would provide a strategic fit with our businesses. Acquisitions expose the Company to a number of risks and uncertainties, the occurrence of any of which could materially adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. A portion of the industries that we serve are mature industries. As a result, our future growth may depend in part on the successful acquisition and integration of acquired businesses into our existing operations. We may not be able to identify and successfully negotiate suitable acquisitions, obtain financing for future acquisitions on satisfactory terms, obtain regulatory approvals or otherwise complete acquisitions in the future.\nWe could have difficulties integrating acquired businesses with our existing operations. Difficulties of integration can include coordinating and consolidating separate systems, integrating the management of the acquired business, retaining market acceptance of acquired products and services, maintaining employee morale and retaining key employees, and implementing our enterprise resource planning systems and operational procedures and disciplines. Any such difficulties may make it more difficult to maintain relationships with employees, customers, business partners and suppliers. In addition, even if integration is successful, the financial performance of acquired business may not be as expected and there can be no assurance we will realize anticipated benefits from our acquisitions. We cannot assure you that we will effectively assimilate the business or product offerings of acquired companies into our business or product offerings or realize anticipated operational synergies. In connection with the integration of acquired operations or the conduct of our overall business strategies, we may periodically restructure our businesses and/or sell assets or portions of our business. Integrating the operations and personnel of acquired companies into our existing operations may result in difficulties, significant expense and accounting charges, disrupt our business or divert management\u2019s time and attention.\nAcquisitions involve numerous other risks, including potential exposure to unknown liabilities of acquired companies and the possible loss of key employees and customers of the acquired business. In connection with acquisitions or joint venture investments outside the U.S., we may enter into derivative contracts to purchase foreign currency in order to hedge against the risk of foreign currency fluctuations in connection with such acquisitions or joint venture investments, which subjects us to the risk of foreign currency fluctuations associated with such derivative contracts. Additionally, our final determinations and appraisals of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in our acquisitions may vary materially from earlier estimates. We cannot assure you that the fair value of acquired businesses will remain constant.\nWe have also in the past divested assets and businesses and we may in the future seek to sell certain of our assets or businesses in order to meet our strategic objectives, and we cannot be certain that our business, operating results and financial condition will not be materially and adversely affected. A successful divestiture depends on various factors, including our ability to effectively transfer liabilities, contracts, facilities and employees to any purchaser, identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to retain, reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business, and collect the proceeds from any divestitures. In addition, if customers of the divested business do not receive the same level of service from the new owners, this may adversely affect our other businesses to the extent that these customers also purchase other products offered by us. All of these efforts require varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations. If we do not realize the expected benefits or synergies of any divestiture transaction, our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted. In addition, divestitures of businesses involve a number of risks, including the diversion of management and employee attention, significant costs and expenses, the loss of customer relationships, and a decrease in revenues and earnings associated with the divested business. Furthermore, divestitures potentially involve significant post-closing separation activities, which could involve the expenditure of material financial resources and significant employee resources. Any divestiture may result in a dilutive impact to our future earnings if we are unable to offset the dilutive impact from the loss of revenue associated with the divestiture, as well as significant write-offs, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe may not achieve expected cost savings from restructuring activities and actual charges, costs and adjustments due to restructuring activities may vary materially from our estimates. Our ability to realize anticipated cost savings, synergies and revenue enhancements may be affected by a number of factors, including the following: our ability to effectively eliminate duplicative back office overhead and overlapping sales personnel, rationalize manufacturing capacity, synchronize information technology systems, consolidate warehousing and distribution facilities and shift production to more economical facilities; significant cash and non-cash integration and implementation costs or charges in order to achieve those cost savings, which could offset any such savings and other synergies resulting from our acquisitions or divestitures; and our ability to avoid labor disruption in connection with integration efforts or divestitures.\nAny joint ventures or teaming arrangements we enter into may not be successful. We may enter into joint ventures or teaming arrangements. Partners with whom we share control may at any time have economic, business or legal interests or goals that are inconsistent with our goals or the goals of the joint venture or arrangement. Our joint venture or teaming arrangements may require us to pay certain costs or to make certain capital investments and we may have little control over the amount or the timing of these payments and investments. In addition, our joint venture or teaming partners may be unable to meet their economic or other obligations and we may be required to fulfill those obligations alone. Our failure or the failure of an entity in which we have a joint venture interest or teaming arrangement to adequately manage the risks associated with any acquisitions, joint ventures or teaming arrangements could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. We cannot assure you that any of our joint ventures or teaming arrangements will be profitable or that forecasts regarding joint venture or teaming activities will be accurate. In particular, risks and uncertainties associated with our joint ventures and teaming arrangements include, among others, the joint venture\u2019s or teaming partner\u2019s ability to operate its business successfully, to develop appropriate standards, controls, procedures and policies for the growth and management of the joint venture or teaming arrangement and the strength of their relationships with employees, suppliers and customers.", "PERMNO": 39693, "SIC": 3490, "TIC": "B"}
