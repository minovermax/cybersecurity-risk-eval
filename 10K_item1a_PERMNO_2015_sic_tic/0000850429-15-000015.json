{"cik": "850429", "company": "TREDEGAR CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-02", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRISK FACTORS\nThere are a number of risks and uncertainties that could have a material adverse effect on the operating results of the Company\u2019s businesses and consolidated financial condition and liquidity. The following risk factors should be considered, in addition to the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014 (\u201cForm 10-K\u201d), when evaluating Tredegar and its businesses:\nGeneral\n\u2022\nTredegar may not be able to successfully execute its acquisition strategy. New acquisitions, such as the October 2011 acquisition of Terphane Holdings LLC (\u201cTerphane\u201d) and the October 2012 acquisition of AACOA, can provide meaningful opportunities to grow the Company\u2019s business and improve profitability. Acquired businesses may not achieve expected levels of revenue, profit or productivity, or otherwise perform as expected. Acquisitions involve special risks, including, without limitation, diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from existing businesses, the potential assumption of unanticipated liabilities and contingencies and potential difficulties in integrating acquired businesses and achieving anticipated operational improvements. While the Company\u2019s strategy is to acquire businesses that will improve its competitiveness and profitability, acquisitions may not be successful or accretive to earnings.\n\u2022\nTredegar\u2019s performance is influenced by costs incurred by its operating companies, including, for example, the cost of raw materials and energy. These costs include, without limitation, the cost of resin, PTA and MEG (the raw materials on which Film Products primarily depends), aluminum (the raw material on which Aluminum Extrusions primarily depends), natural gas (the principal fuel necessary for Aluminum Extrusions\u2019 plants to operate), electricity and diesel fuel. Resin, aluminum and natural gas prices are extremely volatile as shown in the charts on pages 34-36. The Company attempts to mitigate the effects of increased costs through price increases and contractual pass-through provisions, but there are no assurances that higher prices can effectively be passed through to customers or that Tredegar will be able to offset fully or on a timely basis the effects of higher raw material and energy costs through price increases or pass-through arrangements. Further, the Company\u2019s cost control efforts may not be sufficient to offset any additional future declines in revenue or increases in raw material, energy or other costs.\n\u2022\nNoncompliance with any of the covenants in the Company\u2019s $350 million credit facility could result in all debt under the agreement outstanding at such time becoming due and limiting its borrowing capacity, which could have a material adverse effect on financial condition and liquidity. The credit agreement governing Tredegar\u2019s revolving credit facility contains restrictions and financial covenants that could restrict the Company\u2019s operational and financial flexibility. Failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default, which if not cured or waived, would result in all outstanding debt under the credit facility at such time becoming due, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition and liquidity. Renegotiation of the covenant(s) through an amendment to the revolving credit facility may effectively cure the noncompliance, but may have a negative effect on the Company\u2019s consolidated financial condition or liquidity depending upon how the amended covenant is renegotiated.\n\u2022\nFailure to continue to attract, develop and retain certain key officers or employees could adversely affect Tredegar\u2019s businesses. The Company depends on its senior executive officers and other key personnel to run the businesses. The loss of any of these officers or other key personnel could have a material adverse effect on operations. Competition for qualified employees among companies that rely heavily on engineering and technology is intense, and the loss of qualified employees or an inability to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled employees required for the operation and expansion of Tredegar\u2019s businesses could hinder its ability to improve manufacturing operations, conduct research activities successfully and develop marketable products.\n\u2022\nTredegar is subject to various environmental laws and regulations and could become exposed to material liabilities and costs associated with such laws. The Company is subject to various environmental obligations and could become subject to additional obligations in the future. In the case of known potential liabilities, it is management\u2019s judgment that the resolution of ongoing and/or pending environmental remediation obligations is not expected to have a material adverse effect on consolidated financial condition or liquidity. In any given period(s), however, it is possible such obligations or matters could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations. Changes in environmental laws and regulations, or their application, including, but not limited to, those relating to global climate change, could subject Tredegar to significant additional capital expenditures and operating expenses. Moreover, future developments in federal, state, local and international environmental laws and regulations are difficult to predict. Environmental laws have become and are expected to continue to become increasingly strict. As a result, Tredegar will be subject to new environmental laws and regulations. However, any such changes are uncertain and, therefore, it is not possible for the Company to predict with certainty the amount of additional capital expenditures or operating expenses that could be necessary for compliance with respect to any such changes.\n\u2022\nMaterial disruptions at one of the Company\u2019s major manufacturing facilities could negatively impact financial results. Tredegar believes its facilities are operated in compliance with applicable local laws and regulations and that the Company has implemented measures to minimize the risks of disruption at its facilities. A material disruption in one of the Company\u2019s operating locations could negatively impact production and financial results. Such a disruption could be a result of any number of events, including but not limited to: an equipment failure with repairs requiring long lead times, labor stoppages or shortages, utility disruptions, constraints on the supply or delivery of critical raw materials, and severe weather conditions.\n\u2022\nAn information technology system failure may adversely affect the business. Tredegar relies on information technology systems to transact its businesses. An information technology system failure due to computer viruses, internal or external security breaches, power interruptions, hardware failures, fire, natural disasters, human error, or other causes could disrupt operations and prevent the Company from being able to process transactions with its customers, operate its manufacturing facilities, and properly report those transactions in a timely manner. A significant, protracted information technology system failure may result in a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\n\u2022\nTredegar is subject to credit risk that is inherent with efforts to increase market share as the Company attempts to broaden its customer base. In the event of the deterioration of operating cash flows or diminished borrowing capacity of the Company\u2019s customers, the collection of trade receivable balances may be delayed or deemed unlikely. Film Products\u2019 credit risk exposure could increase as efforts to expand its business may lead to a broader, more diverse customer base. In addition, the operations of the customers for Aluminum Extrusions generally follow the cycles within the economy, resulting in greater credit risk from diminished operating cash flows and higher bankruptcy rates when the economy is deteriorating or in recession.\n\u2022\nTredegar could be required to make additional cash contributions to its defined benefit (pension) plan. Tredegar sponsors a pension plan that covers certain hourly and salaried employees in the U.S. Tredegar has experienced a significant reduction in interest rates and fluctuations in plan asset investment returns in recent years. Cash contribution requirements for the pension plan are sensitive to changes in these market factors. Tredegar expects that it will be required to make a cash contribution of approximately $2.4 million to its underfunded pension plan in 2015, and the Company may be required to make additional cash contributions in future periods if current trends in interest rates continue, volatility in investment returns on plan assets persist or if plan asset investment returns lag market performance.\n\u2022\nTredegar and its customers operate in highly competitive markets. Tredegar and its businesses compete on product innovation, quality, price and service, and its businesses and their customers operate in highly competitive markets. Global market conditions continue to exacerbate the Company\u2019s exposure to margin compression due to competitive forces, especially as certain products move into the later stages of their product life cycles. Tredegar attempts to mitigate the effects of this trend through the introduction of new products, cost saving measures and manufacturing efficiency initiatives, but these efforts may not be sufficient to offset the impact of margin compression as a result of competitive pressure.\n\u2022\nAn inability to renegotiate one of the Company\u2019s collective bargaining agreements could adversely affect financial results. Some of the Company\u2019s employees are represented by labor unions under various collective bargaining agreements with varying durations and expiration dates. Tredegar may not be able to satisfactorily renegotiate collective bargaining agreements when they expire, which could result in strikes or work stoppages or higher labor costs. In addition, existing collective bargaining agreements may not prevent a strike or work stoppage at the Company\u2019s facilities in the future. Any such work stoppages (or potential work stoppages) could negatively impact Tredegar\u2019s ability to manufacture its products and adversely affect results of operations.\n\u2022\nTredegar\u2019s investments (primarily $7.5 million of investments in kal\u00e9o and a $1.8 million net investment in Harbinger) have high risk. The value of the Company\u2019s investment in a specialty pharmaceutical company, kaleo, Inc. (\u201ckal\u00e9o\u201d), which was formerly known as Intelliject, Inc., can fluctuate, primarily as a result of kal\u00e9o\u2019s ability to meet its developmental and commercialization milestones within an anticipated time frame. Commercial sales of kal\u00e9o\u2019s first licensed product commenced in the first quarter of 2013, and commercial sales of its second product commenced in the third quarter of 2014. As kal\u00e9o continues to invest in its product pipeline, it may require additional rounds of financing to have the opportunity to complete product pipeline development and bring its technology to market, which may never occur. The estimated fair value of this investment was $39.1 million at December 31, 2014.\nHarbinger Capital Partners Special Situations Fund, L.P. (\u201cHarbinger Fund\u201d) is a private investment fund, and an investment in the fund involves risk and is subject to limitations on withdrawal. The amount of future installments of withdrawal proceeds is uncertain, and the timing of such payments is not known.\nThere is no secondary market for selling the Company\u2019s interests in either investment. As a result, Tredegar may be required to bear the risk of its investment in kal\u00e9o and the Harbinger Fund for an indefinite period of time.\nFilm Products\n\u2022\nFilm Products is highly dependent on sales associated with one customer, P&G. P&G comprised approximately 24% of Tredegar\u2019s consolidated net sales from continuing operations in 2014, 28% in 2013 and 31% in 2012. The loss or significant reduction of sales associated with P&G could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business. Other P&G-related factors that could adversely affect the business include, by way of example, (i) failure by P&G to achieve success or maintain share in markets in which P&G sells products containing Film Products\u2019 materials, (ii) operational decisions by P&G that result in component substitution, inventory reductions and similar changes, (iii) delays in P&G rolling out products utilizing new technologies developed by Film Products and (iv) P&G rolling out products utilizing technologies developed by others that replace Film Products\u2019 business with P&G. While Film Products has undertaken efforts to expand its customer base, there can be no assurance that such efforts will be successful, or that they will offset any delay or loss of sales and profits associated with P&G.\nIn 2014, Film Products lost certain babycare elastic laminate volumes sold to P&G due to P&G\u2019s consolidation of suppliers for its North American product needs. Annualized net sales to P&G associated with these plastic films were approximately $51 million. While it continues to identify new business opportunities with P&G, Film Products is also working to expand its customer base in order to create long-term growth and profitability by (1) actively competing for new business with various customers across its full product portfolio, (2) expanding capacity in emerging markets, (3) introducing new products and/or improvements to existing applications, and (4) investigating opportunities to diversify its customer and product offerings through additional acquisitions. There is no assurance that these efforts to expand the revenue base and mitigate this or any future loss of sales and profits from P&G will be successful.\n\u2022\nGrowth of Film Products depends on its ability to develop and deliver new products at competitive prices. Personal care materials, surface protection films and polyethylene overwrap and polypropylene films are now being made with a variety of new materials and the overall cycle for new product introduction has accelerated. While Film Products has substantial technological resources, there can be no assurance that its new products can be brought to market successfully, or if brought to market successfully, at the same level of profitability and market share of replaced films. A shift in customer preferences away from Film Products\u2019 technologies, its inability to develop and deliver new profitable products, or delayed acceptance of its new products in domestic or foreign markets, could have a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations and cash flows. In the long term, growth will depend on Film Products\u2019 ability to provide innovative products at a price that meets the customers\u2019 needs.\n\u2022\nFailure of Film Products\u2019 customers, who are subject to cyclical downturns, to achieve success or maintain market share could adversely impact its sales and operating margins. The Company\u2019s plastic films serve as components for various consumer products sold worldwide. A customer\u2019s ability to successfully develop, manufacture and market their products is integral to Film Products\u2019 success. In addition, many customers are in industries that are cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in general economic conditions. Downturns in the businesses that use the Company\u2019s plastic film products can adversely affect sales and operating margins.\n\u2022\nContinued growth in Film Products\u2019 sale of protective film products is not assured. A shift in customer preference to new or different products or new technology that displaces the need for protective films that currently utilize Film Products\u2019 surface protection applications could have a material adverse effect on the sales of these protective films. Surface protection films accounted for approximately 10%, 10% and 8% of Tredegar\u2019s consolidated net sales from continuing operations in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Unanticipated changes in the demand for the products of Film Products\u2019 customers, a decline in the rate of growth for flat panel displays or improvements in the durability of flat panel displays could have a material adverse effect on protective film sales.\n\u2022\nSubstantial international operations subject Film Products to risks of doing business in countries outside the U.S., which could adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations. Risks inherent in international operations include the following, by way of example: changes in general economic conditions or governmental policies, potential difficulty enforcing agreements and intellectual property rights, modifications in foreign tax laws and incentives, staffing and managing widespread operations and the challenges of complying with a wide variety of laws and regulations, restrictions on international trade or investment, restrictions on the repatriation of income, imposition of additional taxes on income generated outside the U.S., nationalization of private enterprises, unexpected adverse changes in international laws and regulatory requirements and fluctuations in exchange rates. In the countries where Film Products conducts its operations, significant fluctuations in the foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar could have a material impact on operating results. In addition, while expanding operations into emerging markets provides greater opportunities for growth, there are certain operating risks, as previously noted.\n\u2022\nThe Company\u2019s inability to protect its intellectual property rights or its infringement of the intellectual property rights of others could have a material adverse impact on Film Products. Film Products operates in an industry where its significant customers and competitors have substantial intellectual property portfolios. The continued success of its business depends on its ability not only to protect its own technologies and trade secrets, but also to develop and sell new products that do not infringe upon existing patents or threaten existing customer relationships. Intellectual property litigation is very costly and could result in substantial expense and diversions of its resources, both of which could adversely affect its operations and financial condition and results. In addition, there may be no effective legal recourse against infringement of the Company\u2019s intellectual property by third parties, whether due to limitations on enforcement of rights in foreign jurisdictions or as a result of other factors. An unfavorable outcome in any intellectual property litigation or similar proceeding could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition and results of operations in Film Products.\n\u2022\nU.S. and global economic conditions could have an adverse effect on the operating results of some or all of Film Products\u2019 operations. As a global entity, the operating results and financial condition for Film Products could become more sensitive to changes in macroeconomic conditions, including fluctuations in exchange rates. Sales associated with new products and regions tend to more closely follow the cycles within the economy. Cost reductions and productivity improvements may not be sufficient to offset the adverse effects on profitability from lower customer demand in an economic downturn. Therefore, as such product offerings become a greater part of the film products business, the Company\u2019s operating results and financial condition may be adversely impacted by seasonal slowdowns, cyclical downturns in the economy or changes in foreign currency rates.\n\u2022\nAn unstable economic environment could have a disruptive impact on Film Products\u2019 supply chain. Certain raw materials used in manufacturing the Company\u2019s products are sourced from single suppliers, and Film Products may not be able to quickly or inexpensively re-source from other suppliers. The risk of damage or disruption to its supply chain has been exacerbated as different suppliers have consolidated their product portfolios or experienced financial distress. Failure to take adequate steps to effectively manage such events, which are intensified when a product is procured from a single supplier or location, could adversely affect Film Products\u2019 business and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to restore its supply chain.\n\u2022\nGovernmental failure to extend anti-dumping duties in Brazil on imported products or prevent competitors from circumventing such duties could adversely impact Film Products. In recent years, imports into Brazil, primarily from Asia, represented an increasing portion of the Brazilian flexible packaging films market. The Brazilian government currently applies anti-dumping duties on PET films imported from the UAE, Mexico, and Turkey, and these protective tariffs may be extended to other countries in Asia and the Middle East in the near future. In the absence of these anti-dumping duties, some suppliers may choose to sell excess inventory in Brazil, especially when markets for PET films in Europe and Asia are saturated. Additional supply in the Brazilian market could have a material adverse impact on pricing, thereby creating margin compression that Film Products may not be able to offset with cost savings measures and/or manufacturing efficiency initiatives. An inability to extend and/or expand anti-dumping duties on PET films in Brazil could have a material adverse effect on the operating results of Film Products.\nAluminum Extrusions\n\u2022\nSales volume and profitability of Aluminum Extrusions is cyclical and highly dependent on economic conditions of end-use markets in the U.S., particularly in the construction sector. Aluminum Extrusions\u2019 end-use markets can be subject to seasonal slowdowns. Because of the high degree of operating leverage inherent in its operations (generally constant fixed costs until full capacity utilization is achieved), the percentage drop in operating profits in a cyclical downturn will likely exceed the percentage drop in volume. Any benefits associated with cost reductions and productivity improvements may not be sufficient to offset the adverse effects on profitability from pricing and margin pressure and higher bad debts (including a greater chance of loss associated with customers defaulting on fixed-price forward sales contracts) that usually accompany a downturn. In addition, higher energy costs can further reduce profits unless offset by price increases or cost reductions and productivity improvements.\n\u2022\nThe markets for Aluminum Extrusions\u2019 products are highly competitive with product quality, service, delivery performance and price being the principal competitive factors. Aluminum Extrusions has approximately 1,500 customers that are in a variety of end-use markets within the broad categories of building and construction, distribution, automotive and other transportation, machinery and equipment, electrical and consumer durables. No single customer exceeds 3% of Aluminum Extrusions\u2019 net sales. Due to the diverse customer mix across many end-use markets, the Company believes the industry generally tracks the real growth of the overall economy. Future success and prospects depend on its ability to retain existing customers and participate in overall industry cross-cycle growth.\nDuring improving economic conditions, excess industry capacity is absorbed and pricing pressure becomes less of a factor in many of its end-use markets. Conversely, during an economic slowdown, excess industry capacity often drives increased pricing pressure in many end-use markets as competitors protect their position with key customers. Because the business is susceptible to these changing economic conditions, Aluminum Extrusions targets complex, customized, service-intensive business with more challenging requirements in order to differentiate itself from competitors that focus on higher volume, standard extrusion applications.\n\u2022\nAluminum Extrusions\u2019 efforts to expand into new market segments may not be successful. Aluminum Extrusions has made significant capital investments in recent years to execute on its market diversification strategy. Investments in new aluminum extrusion presses dedicated to serve automotive and light truck tier suppliers are intended to provide meaningful opportunities to grow Aluminum Extrusions and improve profitability. Efforts to expand product offerings and broaden the customer base are tied to successfully substituting the Company\u2019s aluminum extrusions for current market alternatives. Additional volume and/or alternative products offered by Aluminum Extrusions may not be demanded or accepted by market participants. If customer purchases do not meet expectations, Aluminum Extrusions\u2019 market diversification strategy may not be successful, which could have a material adverse effect on the operating results of Aluminum Extrusions.\n\u2022\nFailure to extend duties on imported products or prevent competitors from circumventing such duties could adversely impact Aluminum Extrusions. In previous years, imports into the U.S., primarily from China, represented an increasing portion of the U.S. aluminum extrusion market. However, due to an affirmative determination by the U.S. International Trade Commission in April 2011 that asserted that dumped and subsidized imports of aluminum extrusion from China unfairly and negatively impacted the domestic industry, the U.S. Department of Commerce has applied duties to these imported products. As a result, aluminum extrusion imports from China have decreased significantly. While the risk to the domestic industry has been abated for the time being, these protective duties are scheduled to expire in 2016. There are ongoing efforts within the U.S. aluminum extrusions industry to extend these protective duties. An unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse effect on the operating results of Aluminum Extrusions.", "PERMNO": 75649, "SIC": 3081, "TIC": "TG"}
