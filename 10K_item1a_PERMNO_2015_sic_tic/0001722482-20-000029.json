{"cik": "1722482", "company": "Avantor, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-14", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk factors\nRisks related to our business and our industry\nSignificant interruptions in our operations could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nManufacturing, distribution, service and logistics problems can and do arise, and any such problems could have a significant impact on our operating results. Accordingly, any significant disruptions to the operations of our manufacturing or distribution centers or logistics providers for any reason, including labor relations issues, power interruptions, severe weather, fire or other circumstances beyond our control could cause our operating expenses to increase without coverage or compensation or seriously harm our ability to fulfill our customers\u2019 orders or deliver products on a timely basis, or both. We must also maintain sufficient production capacity in order to meet anticipated customer demand, which carries fixed costs that we may not be able to offset if orders slow, which would adversely affect our operating margins. If we are unable to manufacture our products consistently, in sufficient quantities, and on a timely basis, our net sales, gross margins and our other operating results will be materially and adversely affected. Prompt shipment of our products is also very important to our business. We have experienced problems with or delays in our production, shipping and logistics capabilities that resulted in delays in our ability to ship finished products, and there can be no assurance that we will not encounter such problems in the future. If we experience significant delays in our manufacturing, shipping or logistics processes, we could damage our customer relationships, cause disruption to our customers and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe compete in highly competitive markets. Failure to compete successfully could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face competition across our products and the markets in which we operate. We compete on several fronts, both domestically and internationally, including competing with other companies that provide similar offerings. Competition is driven by proprietary technologies and know-how, capabilities, consistency of operational performance, quality, supply chain control, price, value and speed. Our competitors range from regional companies, which may be able to more quickly respond to customers\u2019 needs because of geographic proximity, to large multinational companies, which may have greater financial, marketing, operational and research and development resources than we do. Such greater resources may allow our competitors to respond more quickly with new, alternative or emerging technologies.\nIn addition, consolidation trends in the biopharma and healthcare industries have served to create fewer customer accounts and to concentrate purchasing decisions for some customers, resulting in increased pricing pressures. The entry into the market by manufacturers in low-cost manufacturing locations also creates increased pricing and competitive pressures, particularly in developing markets, which may impede our goal to grow in those markets. Failure to anticipate and respond to competitors\u2019 actions may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nIt may be difficult for us to implement our strategies for improving growth.\nWe plan to continue expanding our commercial sales operations and scope and complexity of our business both domestically and internationally, while maintaining our commercial operations and administrative activities. For example, we intend to pursue the following growth strategies: (i) increase integration of our products and services into customers\u2019 workflows; (ii) develop new products and services; (iii) expand in geographies expected to have outsized growth; (iv) continue to enhance our global online platform; (v) increase commercial excellence and operational efficiency to drive margin expansion; and (vi) pursue strategic acquisitions to expand our platform. However, our ability to manage our business and conduct our global operations while also pursuing the aforementioned growth strategies requires considerable management attention and resources and is subject to the challenges of supporting a rapidly growing business in an environment of multiple languages, cultures and customs, legal and regulatory systems, alternative dispute systems and commercial markets.\nOur failure to implement these strategies in a cost-effective and timely manner could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nPart of our growth strategy is to pursue strategic acquisitions, which will subject us to a variety of risks that could harm our business.\nAs part of our business strategy, we intend to continue to review, pursue and complete selective acquisition opportunities. There can be no assurances that we will be able to complete suitable acquisitions for a variety of reasons, including the identification of and competition for acquisition targets, the need for regulatory approvals, the inability of the parties to agree to the structure or purchase price of the transaction and the inability to finance the transaction on commercially acceptable terms. In addition, any completed acquisition will subject us to a variety of other risks, including:\n\u2022\nacquisitions may have an adverse effect on our business relationships with existing or future suppliers and other business partners, in particular, to the extent we consummate acquisitions that vertically integrate portions of our business;\n\u2022\nwe may assume substantial actual or contingent liabilities, known and unknown;\n\u2022\nacquisitions may not meet our expectations of future financial performance;\n\u2022\nwe may experience delays or reductions in realizing expected synergies;\n\u2022\nwe may incur substantial unanticipated costs or encounter other problems associated with acquired businesses or devote time and capital investigating a potential acquisition and not complete the transaction;\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to achieve our intended objectives for the transaction; and\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to retain the key personnel, customers and suppliers of the acquired business.\nThese factors related to our acquisition strategy, among others, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to integrate mergers or acquisitions successfully into our existing business, or realize anticipated cost savings or synergies, if any, from those transactions, which could adversely affect our business.\nOur ability to realize the benefits we anticipate from our mergers and acquisitions activities, including anticipated cost savings and additional sales opportunities, will depend in large part upon whether we are able to integrate such businesses efficiently and effectively. Integration is an ongoing process and we may not be able to fully integrate such businesses smoothly or successfully and the process may take longer than expected. Further, the integration of certain operations and the differences in operational culture following mergers and acquisitions activity will continue to require the dedication of significant management resources, which may distract management\u2019s attention from day-to-day business operations. There may also be unasserted claims or assessments that we failed or were unable to discover or identify in the course of performing due diligence investigations of target businesses. If we are unable to successfully integrate the operations of acquired businesses into our business, we may be unable to realize the sales growth, cost synergies and other anticipated benefits we expect to achieve as a result of such transactions and our business, results of operations and cash flow could be adversely affected.\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations may be harmed if our customers discontinue or spend less on research, development, production or other scientific endeavors.\nOur customers include companies in the biopharma, healthcare, education & government and advanced technologies & applied materials industries. Many factors, including public policy spending priorities, available resources and product and economic cycles, have a significant effect on the capital spending policies of these entities. Fluctuations in the research and development budgets of our customers could have a significant effect on the demand for our products. Our customers determine their research and development budgets based on several factors, including the need to develop new products, continued availability of governmental and other funding, competition and the general availability of resources. If research and development budgets are reduced, the impact could eventually adversely affect our overall business.\nThe customers we serve have and will continue to experience significant industry-related changes that could adversely affect our business.\nMany of the customers we serve have experienced significant industry-related changes in the last several years and are expected to continue to experience significant changes, including reductions in governmental payments for biopharmaceutical products, expirations of significant patents, adverse changes in legislation or regulations regarding the delivery or pricing of general healthcare services or mandated benefits, and increased requirements on quality. General industry changes include:\n\u2022\ndevelopment of large and sophisticated group purchasing organizations and on-line auction sites that increase competition for and reduce spending on laboratory products;\n\u2022\nconsolidation of biopharmaceutical companies resulting in a rationalization of research expenditures;\n\u2022\nincreased regulatory scrutiny over drug production requiring safer raw materials;\n\u2022\ncustomers\u2019 purchasing the products that we supply directly from our suppliers; and\n\u2022\nsignificant reductions in development and production activities.\nSome of our customers have implemented or may in the future implement certain measures described above in an effort to control and reduce costs. The ability of our customers to develop new products to replace sales decreases attributable to expirations of significant patents, along with the impact of other past or potential future changes in the industries we serve, may result in our customers significantly reducing their purchases of products from us or the prices they are willing to pay for those products. While we believe we are able to adapt our business to maintain existing customer relationships and develop new customer relationships if we are unsuccessful or untimely in these efforts, our results of operations may suffer.\nWe may be adversely affected by global and regional economic and political conditions.\nWe conduct operations around the globe. The prospects, strength and sustainability of the current environment remain uncertain as does the possibility of an economic downturn in the United States and other countries. The uncertainty or deterioration of the global economic environment could adversely affect us. Customers or suppliers may experience cash flow problems, and as a result, customers may modify, delay or cancel plans to purchase our products and services. Suppliers may significantly and rapidly increase their prices or reduce their output. Any inability of current and/or potential customers to purchase and/or pay for our products due to, among other things, declining economic conditions as a result of inflation, rising interest rates, changes in spending patterns at biopharma, healthcare, education & government and advanced technologies & applied materials companies and the effects of governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions may have a negative impact on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Overall demand for our products could be reduced as a result of a global economic recession or political unrest, especially in such areas as\nthe biopharma, healthcare, education & government and advanced technologies & applied materials industries.\nSales and earnings could also be affected by our ability to manage the risks and uncertainties associated with the application of trade protection measures, regional political instability, war, terrorist activities, severe or prolonged adverse weather conditions and natural disasters as well as health epidemics and pandemics. For example, the ongoing coronavirus outbreak since the beginning of 2020 has resulted in increased travel restrictions and extended shutdown of certain businesses in the region, as well as reports of dramatically reduced economic activity in the region, which may impact our operations particularly in the AMEA region. These or any further political or governmental developments or health concerns in China or other countries in which we operate could result in social, economic and labor instability, which could have a material adverse effect on the continuity of our business, including with respect to the availability of raw materials for production, as well as our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s decision to leave the European Union (\u201cBrexit\u201d) could adversely affect our business.\nDuring the second quarter of 2016, the United Kingdom voted by referendum to exit the European Union, commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit.\u201d On January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom ceased to be part of the European Union. The impact of the United Kingdom\u2019s departure from, and future relationship with, the European Union are uncertain. Brexit has and continues to create general economic uncertainty in the United Kingdom and European Union. The effects of Brexit could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The withdrawal could, among other potential outcomes, adversely affect the tax, tax treaty, currency, operational, legal and regulatory regimes to which our business operations and suppliers in the region are subject. The withdrawal could also, among other potential outcomes, disrupt the free movement of goods, services and people between the United Kingdom and the European Union and significantly disrupt trade between the United Kingdom and the European Union and other parties. Further, uncertainty around and developments regarding these and related issues has contributed to deteriorating market conditions and could further adversely impact consumer and investor confidence and the economy of the United Kingdom and the economies of other countries in which we operate, and cause significant volatility in currency exchange rates.\nOur offerings are highly complex, and, if our products do not satisfy applicable quality criteria, specifications and performance standards, we could experience lost net sales, delayed or reduced market acceptance of our products, increased costs and damage to our reputation.\nThe high-purity materials and customized solutions we offer are highly exacting and complex due to demanding customer specifications and stringent regulatory and industry requirements. Our operating results depend on our ability to execute and, when necessary, improve our global quality control systems, including our ability to effectively train and maintain our employees with respect to quality control. A failure of our global quality control systems could result in problems with facility operations or preparation or provision of defective or non-compliant\nproducts. In each case, such problems could arise for a variety of reasons, including equipment malfunction, failure to follow specific protocols and procedures, problems with raw materials, or environmental factors and damage to, or loss of, manufacturing operations. Although many of our products are tested prior to shipment, defects or errors nevertheless occur and we have product recalls from time to time. Such problems could affect production of a particular batch or series of batches of products, requiring the destruction of such products or a halt of facility production altogether. Nearly all of our products are subsequently incorporated into products sold to end users by our customers, and we have no control over the manufacture and production of such products.\nOur success depends on our customers\u2019 confidence that we can provide reliable, high-quality products. We believe that customers in our target markets are likely to be particularly sensitive to product defects and errors. Our reputation and the public image of our products and technologies may be impaired if our products fail to perform as expected or fail to meet applicable quality criteria, specifications or performance standards. If our products experience, or are perceived to experience, a material defect or error, this could result in loss or delay of net sales, damaged reputation, diversion of development resources, and increased insurance or warranty costs, any of which could harm our business. Such defects or errors could also result in our inability to timely deliver products to our customers, which in turn could cause disruption to our customers\u2019 production of their products, narrowing the scope of the use of our products and ultimately hindering our or their success in relevant markets. Even after any underlying concerns or problems are resolved, any lingering concerns in our target markets regarding our technology, product defects or performance standards could continue to result in lost net sales, delayed market acceptance and damaged reputation, among other things. If problems in preparation or manufacture of a product or failures to meet required quality standards for that product or other product defects are not discovered before such product is released to our customers, we may be subject to adverse regulatory and legal actions, including recalls, product seizures, injunctions to halt manufacture and distribution, restrictions on our operations, civil sanctions, including monetary sanctions, and criminal actions. In addition, such problems or failures subject us to other litigation claims, including claims from our customers for reimbursement for the cost of lost or damaged raw materials or end products, disposal of defective products, production line clean out and consequential damages, the cost of which could be significant.\nThe loss of a significant number of customers or a reduction in orders from a significant number of customers could reduce our net sales and harm our operating results.\nOur operating results could be negatively affected by the loss of revenue from a significant number of our customers, including direct distributors and end users. Though we often include pricing and volume incentives in our contracts, our customers are generally not obligated to purchase any fixed quantities of products, and they may stop placing orders with us at any time. If a significant number of customers purchase fewer of our products, defer orders or fail to place additional orders with us, our sales could decline, and our operating results may not meet our expectations. In addition, if those customers order our products, but fail to pay on time or at all, our liquidity and operating results could be adversely affected.\nOur contracts generally do not contain minimum purchase requirements, and we sell primarily on a purchase order basis. Therefore, our sales are subject to changes in demand from our customers, and these changes have been material in the past. The level and timing of orders placed by our customers vary for a number of reasons, including individual customer strategies, the introduction of new technologies, the desire of our clients to reduce their exposure to any single supplier and general economic conditions. If we are unable to anticipate and respond to the demands of our clients, we may lose clients because we have an inadequate supply of raw materials with which to manufacture our products or insufficient capacity in our sites. Alternatively, we may have excess inventory or excess capacity. Either of these factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and operating results.\nThough we do generate a portion of our net sales from long-term contracts, the majority of these contracts are non-exclusive and do not require a minimum purchase volume. This makes it difficult to estimate our customers\u2019 demand for our products and our raw material needs. In addition, though we believe customers in our markets display a significant amount of loyalty to their supplier of a particular product, we may not be able to renew a contract on favorable pricing terms if our competitors reduce their prices in order to procure business, or if a customer insists that we lower the price charged under the contract being renewed in order to retain the contract. The loss of sales obtained through long-term contracts or the reduced profitability of such sales could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nWe are subject to risks associated with doing business globally, which may harm our business.\nWe have global operations and derive a portion of our net sales from customers outside the United States. Accordingly, our international operations or those of our international customers could be substantially affected by a number of risks arising with operating an international business, including:\n\u2022\nlimitations on repatriation of earnings;\n\u2022\ntaxes on imports;\n\u2022\nthe possibility that unfriendly nations or groups could boycott our products;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and political conditions in the markets we operate in;\n\u2022\nforeign currency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u2022\npotential increased costs associated with overlapping tax structures;\n\u2022\npotential increased reliance on third parties within less developed markets;\n\u2022\npotential trade restrictions, tariffs and exchange controls;\n\u2022\nmore limited protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;\n\u2022\ndifficulties and costs associated with staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nthe risk that certain governments may adopt regulations or take other actions that would have a direct adverse impact on our business and market opportunities, including nationalization of private enterprise;\n\u2022\nviolations of anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, such as the FCPA;\n\u2022\nviolations of economic sanctions laws, such as the regulations enforced by OFAC;\n\u2022\nlonger accounts receivable cycles in certain foreign countries, whether due to cultural differences, exchange rate fluctuation or other factors;\n\u2022\nthe credit risk of local customers and distributors;\n\u2022\nlimitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies with third parties or partners outside the United States;\n\u2022\nimport and export licensing requirements and other restrictions, such as those imposed by OFAC, BIS, DDTC and comparable regulatory agencies and policies of foreign governments; and\n\u2022\nchanges to our distribution networks.\nChanges in exchange rates can adversely affect our net sales, profits and cash flows.\nWe report our consolidated financial results in U.S. dollars. Approximately 45% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2019 were generated from operations outside the United States and denominated in foreign currencies (principally the euro, the British pound sterling and the Canadian dollar). Fluctuations in the relative values of currencies occur from time to time and could adversely affect our operating results. Specifically, during times of a strengthening U.S. dollar, our reported international sales and earnings will be reduced because the local currency will convert into fewer U.S. dollars. In addition, currency fluctuations may affect the comparability of our results of operations between financial periods.\nFurther, we have a substantial amount of euro denominated indebtedness. Fluctuations in the exchange rate between U.S. dollars and euros may have a material adverse effect on our ability to repay such indebtedness. See Item 7A. \u201cQuantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk.\u201d\nOur business depends on our ability to use and access information systems, and any failure to successfully maintain these systems or implement new systems to handle our changing needs could materially harm our operations.\nWe depend on standardized procedures and multiple information systems, including our online customer portal and distribution and enterprise resource systems, for our operations, customer service and quality and safety procedures. Furthermore, we rely on information technology systems to process, transmit, store and protect electronic information, including confidential customer, supplier, employee or other business information. Through our online customer portal, we collect and store confidential information that customers provide in order to, among other things, purchase products and services and register on our website.\nWe utilize commercially available third-party technology solutions, software and software systems with some proprietary configurations. We also store data using third-party cloud services. Our information systems are subject to damage or interruption from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches, vandalism, catastrophic events, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, hackers and other security issues as well as human error. If our information systems are damaged, fail to work properly or otherwise become unavailable, we may incur substantial costs to repair or replace them, and we may experience a loss of critical information, customer disruption and interruptions or delays in our ability to perform essential functions and implement new and innovative services. If the cloud service providers we use were to experience unplanned downtime, delays or other issues delivering data to our information technology systems, this could significantly and adversely impact business operations. A compromise of our information systems or those with which we interact could harm our reputation and expose us to regulatory actions and claims from customers and other persons, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations.\nIn addition, we may not have the necessary resources to enhance existing information systems or implement new systems where necessary to handle our increasing volume and changing needs, and may experience unanticipated delays, complications and expenses in implementing and integrating our systems. Any interruptions in operations would adversely affect our ability to properly allocate resources and timely deliver our products, which could result in customer dissatisfaction. The failure to successfully implement and maintain information systems could have an adverse effect on our ability to obtain new business, retain existing business and maintain or increase our sales and profit margins.\nIn recent years, information security risks have generally increased because of the proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyberattacks. In addition to exploiting technical vulnerabilities, the perpetrators of cyberattacks may seek to gain access to user credentials through \u201cphishing\u201d and \u201cspear phishing\u201d attacks. A failure in or breach of our operational or information systems, or those of our third-party service providers, as a result of cyberattacks or information security breaches, regardless of whether the failure or breach is attributable to a vulnerability in our systems, could disrupt our business and/or our supply chain, result in the improper disclosure or misuse of our or our customers\u2019\nconfidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, subject us to claims and/or increase our costs. We may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance our information security measures and/or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.\nThe GDPR, which went into effect in the EU on May 25, 2018, applies to the collection, use, retention, security, processing, and transfer of personally identifiable information of residents of countries in the European Economic Area. The GDPR created a range of new compliance obligations, and imposes significant fines and sanctions for violations. It is possible that the GDPR may be interpreted or applied in a manner that is adverse to us or otherwise inconsistent with our practices; or that the EU authorities may hold that we are not in full compliance with the GDPR\u2019s requirements.\nAny failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with the GDPR, or with any applicable regulatory requirements or orders, including but not limited to privacy, data protection, information security, or consumer protection-related privacy laws and regulations, in one or more jurisdictions within the EU or elsewhere, could: result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or individuals; subject us to significant fines, penalties, and/or judgments; require us to change our business practices; limit access to our products and services in certain countries, incur substantial costs (even if we ultimately prevail) or otherwise adversely affect our business.\nOur inability to protect our intellectual property could adversely affect our business. In addition, third parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property, and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expenses as a result.\nWe rely on a variety of intellectual property rights, including patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets, to protect our proprietary technology and products. We place considerable emphasis on obtaining patent or maintaining trade secret protection for significant new technologies, products and processes because of the length of time and expense associated with bringing new products and processes through the development process and to the market. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to develop and maintain trade secrets, or obtain and enforce patent protection, for our products and processes both in the United States and internationally.\nWe rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how to protect our products and processes, in part, by confidentiality agreements with our customers, collaborators, employees and consultants. We cannot be certain, however, that these agreements will not be breached, including a breach by a customer or collaborator involving reverse-engineering of our products or the use or disclosure of our trade secrets or know-how, or that adequate remedies will be available in the event of any breach. We cannot guarantee that our trade secrets and other proprietary and confidential information will not be disclosed or that competitors will not otherwise gain access to or independently develop our trade secrets. If a competitor lawfully obtained or independently developed any of our trade secrets, we would have no right to prevent such competitor from using that technology or information to compete with us. Monitoring unauthorized uses and disclosures is difficult, and we do not know whether the steps we have taken to protect our\nproprietary technologies will be effective. Furthermore, enforcing a claim that a party illegally disclosed or misappropriated a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable, in part because some courts both within and outside the United States may be less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. Any misappropriation, disclosure or independent development of our trade secrets could harm our competitive position.\nWe own numerous U.S. and foreign patents and patent applications, and we expect to file additional applications, as appropriate, for patents covering certain of our products and processes. Patents may not be issued for any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us, and the claims allowed under any issued patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. Any issued patents owned by or licensed to us may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and the rights under these patents may not provide us with competitive advantages. In addition, competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies. Intellectual property rights may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries, which could make it easier for competitors to capture increased market position. Moreover, pursuing patent protection in all jurisdictions would be prohibitively expensive, and we will not have the benefit of any such protection in jurisdictions where we do not pursue and obtain patents. We could incur substantial costs to defend ourselves in suits brought against us or in suits in which we may assert our patent rights against others. An unfavorable outcome of any such litigation could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe may need to spend significant resources monitoring and enforcing our intellectual property rights and we may not be able to prove infringement by third parties. Our competitive position may be harmed if we cannot enforce our intellectual property rights. In some circumstances, we may choose to not pursue enforcement for business reasons. In addition, competitors might avoid infringement by designing around our intellectual property rights or by developing non-infringing competing technologies. Intellectual property rights and our ability to enforce them may be unavailable or limited in some countries, which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share and could result in lost revenues.\nWe may be subject to claims that former employees, collaborators or other third parties have an interest in our patents or other intellectual property as an inventor or co-inventor, or that an employee, consultant, or other third party performed work for us that conflicts with that person\u2019s obligations to a third party. While it is generally our policy to require our employees and contractors who may be involved in the creation, conception or development of intellectual property to execute agreements assigning such intellectual property to us, we may be unsuccessful in executing such an agreement with each party who, in fact, creates, conceives or develops intellectual property that we regard as our own, or a court may determine that such agreement was insufficient to assign such intellectual property to us. In some cases, when we perform certain services for a customer, the customer may own rights in resulting intellectual property, if any, generated in the course of performing those services. Disputes may arise with respect to such arrangements and our, and the customer\u2019s, rights in such intellectual property. Litigation may be necessary to defend against any of these and other claims challenging inventorship or ownership. If we fail in defending or asserting any such claims, in addition to\npaying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights, such as exclusive ownership of, or right to use, valuable intellectual property. Even if we are successful in defending or asserting such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and other employees.\nWe cannot be certain that our products and our business do not or will not infringe the intellectual property rights of a third party. Third parties may assert claims against us to the effect that we are infringing on their intellectual property rights. Such claims are costly, regardless of their merit, divert the attention of management, and outcomes are uncertain, all of, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, parties making these claims could secure a judgment awarding substantial damages, as well as injunctive or other equitable relief against us and those to whom we have sold the allegedly infringing products, which could require us to design around the infringement, and/or effectively block our ability to make, use, sell, distribute, or market our products in the United States or other countries. In the event that a claim relating to intellectual property is asserted against us, or third parties not affiliated with us hold pending or issued patents that relate to our products or technology, we may seek licenses to such intellectual property or challenge those patents. However, we may be unable to obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, and our challenge of the patents may be unsuccessful. Our failure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights could prevent the sale, manufacture, or distribution of our products and, therefore, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur trademarks are valuable assets and if we are unable to protect them from infringement our business prospects may be harmed.\nOur brands, particularly our J.T.Baker, NuSil and VWR brands, are valuable assets. Therefore, we actively manage our trademark portfolio, including by maintaining registrations for long-standing trademarks and applying to obtain trademark registrations for new brands. We also police our trademark portfolio against infringement. Our efforts to protect and defend our trademarks may fall short or be unsuccessful against competitors or other third parties for a variety of reasons. To the extent that third parties or distributors sell products that are counterfeit versions of our branded products, our customers could inadvertently purchase products that are inferior. This could cause them to refrain from purchasing our brands in the future and in turn could impair our brand equity and adversely affect our sales.\nWe are subject to product liability and other claims in the ordinary course of business.\nOur business involves risk of product liability, intellectual property claims and other claims in the ordinary course of business arising from the products that we source from various manufacturers or produce ourselves. Furthermore, there may be product liability risks that are unknown or which become known in the future. Substantial, complex or extended litigation on any claim could cause us to incur significant costs and distract our management. For example, lawsuits by governmental authorities, employees, shareholders, suppliers, collaborators, distributors, customers, competitors or others with protected intellectual property could be very costly and substantially disrupt our business. Our exposure to such claims may increase as we seek to increase the geographic scope of our sourcing and sales activities and to the extent that\nwe expand our manufacturing operations. We maintain insurance policies and in some cases, our suppliers, customers and predecessors of acquired companies have indemnified us against certain claims. We cannot assure you that our insurance coverage or indemnification agreements will be available in all pending or any future cases brought against us. Furthermore, our ability to recover under any insurance or indemnification arrangements is subject to the terms and conditions of such insurance or indemnification agreement, as well as the financial viability of our and such third parties\u2019 insurers, as well as legal enforcement under the local laws governing these arrangements. Insurance coverage in general or coverage for certain types of liabilities, such as product liability in developing markets, may not be readily available for purchase or cost-effective for us to purchase. Furthermore, many of our insurance policies are subject to high deductibles and retentions. Accordingly, we could be subject to uninsured and unindemnified future liabilities requiring us to provide additional reserves to address such liabilities. An unfavorable result in a case for which adequate insurance or indemnification is not available could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are also involved in various disputes, litigation and regulatory matters incidental to and in the ordinary course of our business, including employment matters, commercial disputes, government compliance matters, environmental matters, and other matters arising out of the normal conduct of our business. We intend to vigorously defend ourselves in such matters. While the impact of this litigation has or may be immaterial, there can be no assurance that the impact of the pending and any future claims will not be material to our business, financial condition or results of operations in the future.\nWe must develop new products, adapt to rapid and significant technological change and respond to introductions of new products by competitors to remain competitive.\nWe sell our products in industries that are characterized by significant technological changes, frequent new product and technology introductions and enhancements and evolving industry standards. As a result, our customers\u2019 needs are rapidly evolving. If we do not appropriately innovate and invest in new technologies, our offerings may become less desirable in the markets we serve, and our customers could move to new technologies offered by our competitors or make products themselves. Though we believe customers in our markets display a significant amount of loyalty to their supplier of a particular product, we also believe that because of the initial time investment required by many of our customers to reach a purchasing decision for a new product, it may be difficult to regain that customer once the customer purchases a product from a competitor. Without the timely introduction of new products, services and enhancements, our offerings will likely become less competitive over time, in which case our competitive position, net sales and operating results could suffer. Accordingly, we focus significant efforts and resources on the development and identification of new technologies, products and services that are attractive to and gain acceptance in the markets we serve and further broaden our offerings. To the extent we fail to timely introduce new and innovative products or services, adequately predict our customers\u2019 needs or fail to obtain desired levels of market acceptance, our business may suffer.\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations depend upon the availability of raw materials.\nOur operations depend upon our ability to obtain high-quality raw materials meeting our specifications and other requirements at reasonable prices, including various active pharmaceutical ingredients, components, compounds, excipients and other raw materials, many of which are sole-sourced due to market or customer demands. Our ability to maintain an adequate supply of such materials and components could be impacted by the availability and price of those raw materials and maintaining relationships with key suppliers. While we may seek to minimize the impact of price increases and potential shortages by, among other things, entering into long-term supply agreements, increasing our own prices and implementing cost-saving measures, our earnings and cash flows could be adversely affected in the event these measures are insufficient to cover our costs. Our dependency upon regular deliveries from particular suppliers of components and raw materials means that interruptions or stoppages in such deliveries could adversely affect our operations until arrangements with alternate suppliers, to the extent any alternate suppliers acceptable to us and, if applicable, to our customers, even exist. If this occurs, we could expend substantial expense and time in re-establishing relationships with third-party suppliers that meet the appropriate quality, cost and regulatory requirements needed for commercially viable manufacture of our products or in re-designing our products to incorporate different components and raw materials that are available from third-party suppliers. If we are unable to obtain the materials we need at reasonable prices or at all, we may not be able to produce certain of our products at a marketable price or at all. If our supply of raw materials and key components is adversely affected, we could impact our customers\u2019 ability to produce their products, damage our relationship with current and prospective customers and our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nMoreover, we are dependent upon the ability of our suppliers to provide materials and components that meet our specifications, quality standards, other applicable criteria, and delivery schedules. Our suppliers\u2019 failure to provide expected raw materials or components that meet such criteria could adversely affect production schedules and contract profitability.\nThe continued supply of materials from our suppliers is subject to a number of risks including:\n\u2022\nthe destruction of or damage to our suppliers\u2019 facilities or their distribution infrastructure;\n\u2022\nwork stoppages or strikes by our suppliers\u2019 employees;\n\u2022\nthe failure of our suppliers to provide materials of the requisite quality or in compliance with strict specifications;\n\u2022\nthe failure of essential equipment at our suppliers\u2019 plants;\n\u2022\nthe failure of our suppliers to satisfy U.S. and international import and export control laws for goods that we purchase from them;\n\u2022\nthe failure of our suppliers to meet regulatory standards, including cGMP, where applicable;\n\u2022\nthe failure, shortage or delay in the delivery of raw materials to our suppliers;\n\u2022\ncontractual amendments and disputes with our suppliers; and\n\u2022\ninability of our suppliers to perform as a result of the weakened global economy or otherwise.\nIf we experience problems with suppliers, we may not be able to find acceptable alternatives, and any such alternatives could result in increased costs for us and possible forward losses on certain contracts. Even if acceptable alternatives are found, the process of locating and securing such alternatives might be disruptive to our business, might lead to termination of our supply agreements with our customers, and might disrupt the operations of our customers leading to potential claims.\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations depend upon maintaining our relationships with suppliers.\nWe offer products from a wide range of suppliers. While there is generally more than one source of supply for most of the categories of third-party materials & consumables and equipment & instrumentation that we sell, we currently do not manufacture the majority of our products and are dependent on these suppliers for access to those products.\nOur ability to sustain our gross margins has been, and will continue to be, dependent in part upon our ability to obtain favorable terms from our suppliers. These terms may change from time to time, and such changes could adversely affect our gross margins over time. In addition, our results of operations and cash flows could be adversely impacted by the acceleration of payment terms to our suppliers and/or the imposition of more restrictive credit terms and other contractual requirements.\nSome of our competitors are increasing their manufacturing operations both internally and through acquisitions of manufacturers, including manufacturers that supply products to us. In addition, we manufacture certain products that may compete directly with products we source from our suppliers. To date, we have not experienced an adverse impact on our ability to continue to source products from manufacturers that have been vertically integrated or otherwise compete with us, although there is no assurance that we will not experience such an impact in the future.\nThe loss of one or more of our large suppliers, including as a result of consolidation, a material reduction in their supply of products or provision of services to us, extended disruptions or interruptions in their operations or material changes in the terms we obtain from them, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur use of chemicals and chemical processes is subject to inherent risk.\nWe use chemical ingredients in the manufacture of certain of our products. Due to the nature of the manufacturing process itself, there is a risk of incurring liability for damages caused by or during the storage or manufacture of both the chemical ingredients and the finished products. The processes used in certain of our facilities typically involve large volumes of solvents and chemicals, creating the potential for fires, spills and other safety or environmental impacts. If any of these risks materialize, it could result in significant remediation and other costs, potential adverse regulatory actions and liabilities, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, the manufacturing, use, storage, and distribution of chemicals are subject to threats including terrorism. We have several high-risk chemical facilities that possess materials that could be stolen and used to make weapons. We could also be subject to an attack on our high-risk facilities that could cause a significant number of deaths and injuries. As a result, many people, including our employees, could be harmed. Such an occurrence could also harm the environment, our reputation and disrupt our operations.\nWe are highly dependent on our senior management and key employees. Competition for our employees is intense, and we may not be able to attract and retain the highly skilled employees that we need to support our business and our intended future growth.\nOur success largely depends on the skills, experience and continued efforts of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and our senior leadership. The replacement of any member of our management team would likely involve the expenditure of significant time and financial resources, and the loss of any such individual may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives. As we continue to grow, our success also depends on our ability to attract, motivate and retain highly qualified individuals. Competition for senior management and other key personnel in our industry is intense, and the pool of suitable candidates is limited. If qualified personnel become scarce or difficult to attract or retain in our industry for compensation-related or other reasons, we could experience higher labor, recruiting or training costs. Further, new hires may require significant training and time before they achieve full productivity and may not become as productive as we expect. The failure to attract, retain and properly motivate members of our senior management team and other key employees, or to find suitable replacements for them in the event of death, illness or their desire to pursue other professional opportunities, could have a negative effect on our operating results.\nWe may incur impairment charges on our goodwill, other intangible assets or other assets that would reduce our earnings.\nWe are required under generally accepted accounting principles to test goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually and to review our finite-lived intangible assets, including other assets acquired through merger and acquisition activity, for impairment when events or changes in circumstance indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.\nFactors that could lead to impairment of goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, and finite-lived intangible assets in the future (including goodwill or assets acquired via acquisitions) include significant adverse changes in the business climate and actual or projected operating results and declines in the financial condition of our business. We have recorded and may be required in the future to record additional charges to earnings if our goodwill, other intangible assets or other assets become impaired. Any such charge would adversely impact our financial results.\nOur reputation, ability to do business and financial statements may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents or business partners.\nWe cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by employees, agents or business partners of ours (or of businesses we acquire or partner with) that would violate U.S. and/or non-U.S. laws, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, kickbacks and false claims, pricing, sales and marketing practices, conflicts of interest, competition, export and import compliance, money laundering and data privacy. In particular, the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, and we operate in many parts of the world that have experienced corruption to some degree. Any such improper actions or allegations of such acts could damage our reputation and subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the United States and in other jurisdictions and related shareholder lawsuits, could lead to substantial civil and criminal, monetary and nonmonetary penalties and could cause us to incur significant legal and investigatory fees. In addition, the government may seek to hold us liable as a successor for violations committed by companies in which we invest or that we acquire. We also rely on our suppliers to adhere to our supplier standards of conduct, and material violations of such standards of conduct could occur that could have a material effect on our business, reputation and financial statements.\nThe indemnification provisions of acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies may not fully protect us and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities.\nCertain of the acquisition agreements by which we have acquired companies require the former owners to indemnify us against certain liabilities related to the operation of the company before we acquired it. In most of these agreements, however, the liability of the former owners is limited and certain former owners may be unable to meet their indemnification responsibilities. We cannot assure you that these indemnification provisions will protect us fully or at all, and as a result we may face unexpected liabilities that adversely affect our financial statements.\nGovernment or private civil antitrust actions could harm our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe antitrust laws prohibit, among other things, any joint conduct among competitors that would lessen competition in the marketplace. We believe that we are in compliance with the legal requirements imposed by the antitrust laws. However, a governmental or private civil action alleging the improper exchange of information, or unlawful participation in price maintenance or\nother unlawful or anticompetitive activity, even if unfounded, could be costly to defend and could harm our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nChanges in tax law relating to multinational corporations could adversely affect our tax position.\nThe U.S. Congress, government agencies in non-U.S. jurisdictions where we and our affiliates do business, and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, or OECD, have recently focused on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations. One example is in the area of \u201cbase erosion and profit shifting,\u201d where profits are claimed to be earned for tax purposes in low-tax jurisdictions, or payments are made between affiliates from a jurisdiction with high tax rates to a jurisdiction with lower tax rates. The OECD has released several components of its comprehensive plan to create an agreed set of international rules for addressing base erosion and profit shifting.\nDue to the potential for changes to tax laws and regulations or changes to the interpretation thereof (including regulations and interpretations pertaining to recent tax reform in the United States), the ambiguity of tax laws and regulations, the subjectivity of factual interpretations, the complexity of our intercompany arrangements, uncertainties regarding the geographic mix of earnings in any particular period, and other factors, our estimates of effective tax rate and income tax assets and liabilities may be incorrect and our financial statements could be adversely affected. The impact of the factors referenced in the first sentence of this paragraph may be substantially different from period-to-period.\nIn addition, the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by U.S. federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-U.S. tax authorities. If audits result in payments or assessments different from our reserves, our future results may include unfavorable adjustments to our tax liabilities and our financial statements could be adversely affected. Any further significant changes to the tax system in the United States or in other jurisdictions (including changes in the taxation of international income as further described below) could adversely affect our financial statements.\nCertain of our businesses rely on relationships with collaborative partners and other third parties for development, supply and marketing of certain products and potential products, and such collaborative partners or other third parties could fail to perform sufficiently.\nWe believe that for certain of our businesses, success in penetrating target markets depends in part on their ability to develop and maintain collaborative relationships with other companies. Relying on collaborative relationships is risky because, among other things, our collaborative partners may (i) not devote sufficient resources to the success of our collaborations; (ii) fail to obtain regulatory approvals necessary to continue the collaborations in a timely manner; (iii) be acquired by other companies and terminate our collaborative partnership or become insolvent; (iv) compete with us; (v) disagree with us on key details of the collaborative relationship; (vi) have insufficient capital resources; and (vii) decline to renew existing collaborations on acceptable terms. Because these and other factors may be beyond our control, the development or commercialization of our products involved in collaborative partnerships may be delayed or\notherwise adversely affected. If we or any of our collaborative partners terminate a collaborative arrangement, we may be required to devote additional resources to product development and commercialization or we may need to cancel some development programs, which could adversely affect our business and financial statements.\nRisks related to regulation\nWe are required to comply with a wide variety of laws and regulations, and are subject to regulation by various federal, state and foreign agencies, and our failure to comply with existing and future regulatory requirements could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe compete in markets in which we and our customers are subject to federal, state, local, international and transnational laws and regulations, including the operating, quality and security standards of the FDA, various state health departments, the DHHS, similar bodies of the EU and its member states and other comparable agencies around the world, and, in the future, any changes to such laws and regulations could adversely affect us. We develop, configure and market our products to meet customer needs driven by those regulations. Among other rules affecting us, we are subject to laws and regulations concerning cGMP and product safety. Our subsidiaries may be required to register for permits and/or licenses with, and may be required to comply with, the laws and regulations of the FDA, the DHHS, the DEA, foreign agencies including the EMA, and other various state health departments and/or comparable state and foreign agencies as well as certain accrediting bodies depending upon the types of operations and locations of distribution and sale of the products manufactured or services provided by those subsidiaries. Any significant change in regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses. For example, many of our products are marketed to the biopharma industry for use in discovering, developing and manufacturing drugs, or are sold as raw materials or components to drug device manufacturers or for use in the manufacture of implantable devices. Changes in the domestic or foreign regulation of drug discovery, development or manufacturing processes or medical device manufacturing processes, or adverse findings concerning any health effects associated with these products, could have an adverse effect on the demand for these products and could also result in legal liability and claims.\nOur operations are subject to a broad array of regulatory requirements globally. In particular, certain portions of our business must satisfy domestic and international standards in the medical, biopharmaceutical and other health sciences areas involving products and technologies which impact human health and safety. In addition, some of our operations must meet governmental requirements in terms of contracting, sourcing, financial accounting standards, product testing and reporting. We are required to comply with economic sanctions laws, which may affect our transactions with certain customers, business partners and other persons and entities. There are also business operations that produce products regulated by import/export regulations because their actual or potential use is considered sensitive and involves substantial licensing and record-keeping obligations. In addition, we are registered with the DDTC, as a manufacturer and exporter of goods controlled by ITAR, and we are subject to strict export control and prior approval requirements related to these goods. Our failure to comply with ITAR and other export\ncontrol laws and regulations, as well as economic sanctions, could result in penalties, loss, or suspension of contracts or other consequences. Any of these could adversely affect our operations and financial condition. Failure by us or by our customers to meet one or more of these various regulatory obligations could have adverse consequences in the event of material non-compliance. Compliance with relevant sanctions and export control laws could restrict our access to, and increase the cost of obtaining, certain products and at times could interrupt our supply of imported inventory or our ability to service certain customers. Conversely, compliance with these regulatory obligations may require us to incur significant expenses.\nAlthough we believe that we comply in all material respects with applicable laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that a regulatory agency or tribunal would not reach a different conclusion concerning the compliance of our operations with applicable laws and regulations. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or renew existing permits, licenses or other regulatory approvals or obtain, without significant delay, future permits, licenses or other approvals needed for the operation of our businesses. Any noncompliance by us with applicable laws and regulations or the failure to maintain, renew or obtain necessary permits and licenses could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, loss of a permit, license or other approval in any one portion of our business may have indirect consequences in other portions of our business if regulators or customers, for example cease doing business with such other portion due to fears that such loss is a sign of broader concerns about our ability to deliver products or services of sufficient quality.\nViolation of government regulations or quality programs could harm demand for our products or services.\nSome of our testing procedures and products, as well as some of the products manufactured by our customers which incorporate our products, are regulated by the FDA, the EMA and other comparable local, state, federal, foreign and transnational regulatory authorities. As applicable, we and our customers may be required to comply with laws and regulations enforced by the FDA and comparable state and foreign agencies. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations can lead to agency action, including warning letters, product recalls, product seizures, monetary sanctions, injunctions to halt manufacturing or distribution, restrictions on our operations, withdrawal of existing or denial of pending approvals, permits or registrations, including those relating to products or facilities, debarment consent decrees and civil and criminal sanctions. To the extent these agencies were to take enforcement action, such action may be publicly available, and such publicity could harm our ability to sell these regulated products globally and may harm our reputation. In addition, such actions could limit the ability of our customers to obtain regulatory clearance or approval for their products in the United States or abroad and/or our customers may incur significant costs in obtaining or maintaining such regulatory clearances or approvals in the United States or abroad. In addition, any such failure relating to the products we provide exposes us to direct and third-party product liability claims as well as contractual claims from our customers, including claims for reimbursement for lost or damaged products, as well as potential recall liability, which costs could be significant. Customers may also claim loss of profits due to lost or delayed sales, although our direct contracts with end customers typically\nplace limits on such claims. There can be no assurance that any such contractual limitation will be applicable or sufficient or fully enforced in any given situation.\nAdditionally, some of our customers use our products in the manufacturing or testing processes for their drug and medical device products, and such end-products may be regulated by the FDA under pharmaceutical cGMP for drugs and Quality System Regulations for medical devices, or by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments. The customer is ultimately responsible for all compliance requirements relating to the manufacture and sale of their end-products; however, our customers rely on us to provide products in compliance with laws and regulations enforced by the FDA and comparable state and foreign agencies. Should any non-compliance be related to the products we sell, we could lose sales and customers and be exposed to liability claims.\nMany of our facilities are either FDA-registered or the international equivalent or cGMP manufacturing sites. As such, these facilities are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA and/or foreign regulatory authorities to determine compliance with applicable regulations. Any failure to comply with these regulations could require us to implement costly remedial measures, institute product recalls, cease manufacturing products or commence manufacturing at an alternative facility, if available, until such issues are remediated. In addition, certain of our facilities are certified to ISO, including ISO 13485, ISO 9001, AS9100, ISO 22000 and/or ISO 14001. These standards are voluntary quality management system standards, the maintenance of which indicates to customers certain quality and operational norms. Customers may rely on contractual assurances that we make with respect to ISO certificates to transact business. Failure to comply with these ISO standards can lead to observations of non-compliance or even suspension of ISO or AS certifications or EC Declarations of Conformity Certificates by the registrar. If we were to lose ISO or AS certifications or EC Declarations of Conformity, we could lose sales and customers to competitors or other suppliers. We are also subject to periodic inspections or audits by our customers. If these audits or inspections identify issues or the customer perceives there are issues, the customer may decide to cease purchasing products from us which could adversely affect our business.\nIf we violate a government-mandated or voluntary quality program, we may incur additional expense to come back into compliance with such government mandated or voluntary standards. That expense may be material and we may not have anticipated that expense in our financial forecasts. Our financial results could suffer as a result of such increased expenses.\nWe are subject to environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, and costs to comply with such laws and regulations, or any liability or obligation imposed under such laws or regulations, could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to a broad range of foreign, federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those of the EPA, OSHA and equivalent local, state, and foreign regulatory agencies in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate. These laws and regulations govern, among other things: air emissions; wastewater discharges; the manufacturing, handling, disposal and transport of hazardous materials and solid waste; the\nmanufacturing, processing and selling of chemical substances; the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater contamination and otherwise relating to health and safety of our employees; and the protection of the environment and natural resources. Further, as our global operations have involved and continue to involve the manufacturing, handling, transport and distribution of materials that are, or could be classified as toxic or hazardous, there is a risk of contamination and environmental damage inherent in our operations and the products we manufacture, handle, transport and distribute. Our environmental, health and safety liabilities and obligations may result in significant capital expenditures and other costs, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. We may be fined or penalized by regulators for failing to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. For example, the EPA inspected our Phillipsburg, New Jersey facility in March 2017 and June 2017, and in April 2018 notified us of potential liabilities under the Toxic Substances Control Act and the Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act, and proposed that we pay civil penalties. See Item 3, \u201cLegal Proceedings.\u201d In addition, contamination resulting from our current or past operations or from past uses of land that we own or operate may trigger investigation or remediation obligations, which may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot be certain that identification of presently unidentified environmental, health and safety conditions, new regulations, more vigorous enforcement by regulatory authorities or other unanticipated events will not arise in the future and give rise to additional environmental liabilities, business interruptions, compliance costs or penalties which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, environmental, health and safety laws and regulations are constantly evolving and it is not possible to predict accurately the effect they, or any new regulations or legislation may have in future periods.\nWe currently incur costs and may incur additional costs related to remediation of alleged environmental damage associated with past or current waste disposal practices or other hazardous materials handling at property that we currently own or operate, or formerly owned or operated, or facilities to which we arranged for the disposal of hazardous substances. Our liabilities arising from past or future releases of, or exposures to, hazardous substances may exceed our estimates or adversely affect our financial statements and reputation and we may be subject to additional claims for cleanup or other environmental claims in the future based on our past, present or future business activities, or that we will be able to recover any costs under any indemnifications that we have. For additional information regarding environmental matters, see note 12 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page of this report.\nRisks related to our indebtedness\nOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and prevent us from fulfilling our debt or contractual obligations.\nThrough our subsidiaries, we have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which requires us to make significant interest and principal payments. As of December 31, 2019, we had indebtedness of $5,249.4 million and $416.7 million of additional borrowing capacity under our credit\nfacilities. Our high level of debt could have important consequences to us including the following:\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt or contractual obligations;\n\u2022\nexposing us to the risk of increased interest rates as certain of our borrowings, including borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities, are at variable rates of interest;\n\u2022\nrestricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures;\n\u2022\nrequiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, which would reduce the funds available for working capital, capital expenditures, investments, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, future business opportunities and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to any of our less leveraged competitors;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to a downturn in our business and both general and industry-specific adverse economic conditions; and\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing at a favorable cost of borrowing, or at all, or to dispose of assets to raise funds, to fund future working capital, capital expenditures, investments, acquisitions or other general corporate requirements.\nAny of the above-listed factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our payment obligations.\nOur debt agreements contain restrictions on our ability to operate our business and to pursue our business strategies, and our failure to comply with, cure breaches of, or obtain waivers for covenants could result in an acceleration of the due date of our indebtedness.\nThe agreements governing our senior secured credit facilities, the notes and the receivables facility contain, and agreements governing future debt issuances may contain, covenants that restrict our ability to finance future operations or capital needs, to respond to changing business and economic conditions or to engage in other transactions or business activities that may be important to our growth strategy or otherwise important to us. The agreements governing our existing indebtedness restrict, subject to certain exceptions, among other things, Avantor Funding, Inc.\u2019s ability and the ability of its subsidiaries to:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness and guarantee indebtedness;\n\u2022\ncreate or incur liens;\n\u2022\nmake investments and loans;\n\u2022\nengage in mergers, consolidations or sales of all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022\npay dividends or make other distributions, in respect of, or repurchase or redeem, capital stock;\n\u2022\nprepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt;\n\u2022\nengage in certain transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nsell or otherwise dispose of assets;\n\u2022\nsell stock of our subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nenter into agreements restricting our and our subsidiaries ability to pay dividends; and\n\u2022\namend, modify, waive or supplement certain subordinated indebtedness to the extent such amendments would be materially adverse to lenders.\nIn addition, any future financing arrangements entered into by us or any of our subsidiaries may contain similar restrictions. As a result of these covenants and restrictions, through our subsidiaries we are and will be limited in how we conduct our business, and we may be unable to raise additional debt or equity financing to compete effectively or to take advantage of new business opportunities. In addition, Avantor Funding, Inc. is required to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests. See Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations - Liquidity and capital resources - Indebtedness.\u201d The terms of any future indebtedness we or our subsidiaries may incur could include more restrictive covenants. We cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain compliance with these covenants in the future and, if we fail to do so, that we will be able to obtain waivers from the lenders and/or amend the covenants.\nOur or our subsidiaries\u2019 failure to comply with the restrictive covenants described above as well as others contained in our or our subsidiaries\u2019 future debt instruments from time to time could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could result in our being required to repay these borrowings before their maturity. If we are forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms or cannot refinance these borrowings, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. If we were unable to repay or otherwise refinance these borrowings, the lenders under our senior secured credit facilities and/or the collateral agent under our senior secured notes could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure such indebtedness, which could force us into bankruptcy or liquidation. Any such acceleration may also constitute a termination event under our receivables facility, which could result in the amount outstanding under that facility becoming due and payable. Any acceleration of amounts due under our debt agreements, or the exercise by the applicable lenders or agent of their rights under the related security documents, would likely have a material adverse effect on our business.\nDespite our current level of indebtedness, we and our subsidiaries may still be able to incur substantially more debt.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur significant additional indebtedness in the future. Although our credit agreement and indentures contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and the additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face could intensify.\nWe may be unable to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our significant debt service obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to service our indebtedness and to refinance our indebtedness will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future and is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. If our business does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations, in the amounts projected or at all, or if future borrowings are not available to us in amounts sufficient to fund our other liquidity needs, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nIf we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our indebtedness in the future, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity, sell assets, delay capital expenditures or seek additional equity. The terms of our existing or future debt agreements may also restrict us from effecting any of these alternatives. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. Further, changes in the credit and capital markets, including market disruptions and interest rate fluctuations, may increase the cost of financing, make it more difficult to obtain favorable terms, or restrict our access to these sources of future liquidity. In addition, any failure to make required payments on our outstanding indebtedness would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt service obligations, or to refinance or restructure our obligations on commercially reasonable terms or at all, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as on our ability to satisfy our obligations in respect of our indebtedness.\nAn increase in interest rates may negatively impact our operating results and financial condition.\nCertain of our borrowings, including borrowings under our senior secured credit facilities and our receivables facility, to the extent the interest rate is not fixed, are at variable rates of interest. An increase in interest rates would have a negative impact on our results of operations by causing an increase in interest expense.\nOur total interest expense was $440.0 million in 2019 and $523.8 million in 2018.\nOur ability to repay our indebtedness is affected by the cash flow generated by our subsidiaries.\nOur subsidiaries own substantially all of our assets and conduct substantially all of our operations. Accordingly, repayment of our indebtedness will be dependent on the generation of cash flow by our subsidiaries and their ability to make such cash available to us, by dividend, debt repayment or otherwise. Our subsidiaries may not be able to, or may not be permitted to, make distributions to enable us or Avantor Funding, Inc. to make payments in respect of our indebtedness. Each subsidiary is a distinct legal entity and, under certain circumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit our ability to obtain cash from our subsidiaries. While our credit agreement and indentures limit the ability of our subsidiaries to incur consensual restrictions on their ability to pay dividends or make other intercompany payments to us, these limitations are subject to certain qualifications and exceptions.\nRisks related to ownership of our stock\nOur stock price may be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance, and you may not be able to resell shares of our common stock at or above the price you paid or at all, and you could lose all or part of your investment as a result.\nYou may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price at which you purchased them due to a number of factors such as those listed in \u201c-Risks related to our business\u201d and the following:\n\u2022\nresults of operations that vary from the expectations of securities analysts and investors;\n\u2022\nresults of operations that vary from those of our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in expectations as to our future financial performance, including financial estimates and investment recommendations by securities analysts and investors;\n\u2022\nchanges in economic conditions for companies in our industry;\n\u2022\nchanges in market valuations of, or earnings and other announcements by, companies in our industry;\n\u2022\ndeclines in the market prices of stocks generally, particularly those of companies in our industry;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key management personnel;\n\u2022\nstrategic actions by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us, our competitors or our suppliers of significant contracts, price reductions, new products or technologies, acquisitions, joint marketing relationships, joint ventures, other strategic relationships or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nchanges in preference of our customers;\n\u2022\nchanges in general economic or market conditions or trends in our industry or the economy as a whole;\n\u2022\nchanges in business or regulatory conditions;\n\u2022\nfuture sales of our common stock or other securities;\n\u2022\ninvestor perceptions of or the investment opportunity associated with our common stock relative to other investment alternatives;\n\u2022\nthe public\u2019s response to press releases or other public announcements by us or third parties, including our filings with the SEC;\n\u2022\nannouncements relating to litigation or governmental investigations;\n\u2022\nguidance, if any, that we provide to the public, any changes in this guidance or our failure to meet this guidance;\n\u2022\nthe development and sustainability of an active trading market for our stock;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting principles; and\n\u2022\nother events or factors, including those resulting from informational technology system failures and disruptions, natural disasters, war, acts of terrorism or responses to these events.\nFurthermore, the stock market may experience extreme volatility that, in some cases, may be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. In addition, price volatility may be greater if the public float and trading volume of our common stock is low.\nIn the past, following periods of market volatility, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation. If we were to become involved in securities litigation, it could have a substantial cost and divert resources and the attention of executive management from our business regardless of the outcome of such litigation.\nThe outstanding shares of MCPS may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe market price of our common stock is likely to be influenced by the outstanding shares of MCPS. For example, the market price of our common stock could become more volatile and could be depressed by:\n\u2022\ninvestors\u2019 anticipation of the potential resale in the market of a substantial number of additional shares of our common stock received upon conversion of the MCPS;\n\u2022\npossible sales of our common stock by investors who view the MCPS as a more attractive means of equity participation in us than owning shares of our common stock; and\n\u2022\nhedging or arbitrage trading activity that may develop involving the MCPS and our common stock.\nCertain rights of the holders of the MCPS could delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial takeover or takeover attempt of us.\nCertain rights of the holders of the MCPS could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us. For example, if a fundamental change, as defined in the Registration Statement, were to occur on or prior to May 15, 2022, holders of the MCPS may have the right to convert their MCPS, in whole or in part, at an increased conversion rate and will also be entitled to receive a make-whole amount equal to the present value of all remaining dividend payments on their MCPS as described in the certificate of designations governing the MCPS. These features of the MCPS could increase the cost of acquiring us or otherwise discourage a third party from acquiring us or removing incumbent management.\nOur common stock ranks junior to the MCPS with respect to the payment of dividends and amounts payable in the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of our affairs.\nOur common stock ranks junior to the MCPS with respect to the payment of dividends and amounts payable in the event of our liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of our affairs. This means that, unless accumulated and unpaid dividends have been declared and paid, or set aside for payment, on all outstanding shares of the MCPS for all preceding dividend periods, no dividends may be declared or paid on our common stock and we will not be permitted to purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any of our common stock, subject to limited exceptions. Likewise, in the event of our voluntary or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding-up of our affairs, no distribution of our assets may be made to holders of our common stock until we have paid to holders of the MCPS a liquidation preference equal to $50.00 per share plus accumulated and unpaid dividends.\nHolders of the MCPS have the right to elect two directors in the case of certain dividend arrearages.\nWhenever dividends on any shares of the MCPS have not been declared and paid for the equivalent of six or more dividend periods, whether or not for consecutive dividend periods, the authorized number of directors on our Board of Directors will, at the next annual meeting of stockholders or at a special meeting of stockholders, if any, automatically be increased by two and the holders of such shares of the MCPS voting together as a single class with holders of other series of our voting preferred stock then outstanding will be entitled, at our next annual meeting of stockholders or at a special meeting of stockholders, if any, to vote for the election of a total of two additional members of our Board of Directors, subject to certain terms and limitations. This right to elect directors will dilute the representation of the holders of our common stock on our Board of Directors and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nBecause we have no current plans to pay cash dividends on our common stock, you may not receive any return on investment unless you sell your common stock for a price greater than that which you paid for it.\nWe have no current plans to pay cash dividends on our common stock. The declaration, amount and payment of any future dividends on our common stock will be at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors may take into account general and economic conditions, our financial condition and results of operations, our available cash and current and anticipated cash needs, capital requirements, contractual, legal, tax and regulatory restrictions and implications on the payment of dividends by us to our stockholders or by our subsidiaries to us, including restrictions under our credit agreement and other indebtedness we may incur, and such other factors as our Board of Directors may deem relevant. In addition, no dividends may be declared or paid on our common stock unless accumulated and unpaid dividends on the MCPS have been declared and paid, or set aside for payment, on all outstanding shares of the MCPS for all preceding dividend periods.\nAs a result, you may not receive any return on an investment in our common stock unless you sell our common stock for a price greater than your purchase price.\nWe are a holding company with no operations of our own and, as such, we depend on our subsidiaries for cash to fund all of our operations and expenses, including future dividend payments, if any.\nOur operations are conducted entirely through our subsidiaries and our ability to generate cash to meet our debt service obligations or to make future dividend payments, if any, is highly dependent on the earnings and the receipt of funds from our subsidiaries via dividends or intercompany loans. We do not currently expect to declare or pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future; however, to the extent that we determine in the future to pay dividends on our common stock, the agreements governing our indebtedness restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or otherwise transfer assets to us. See note 25 to the consolidated financial statements beginning on page of this report.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they downgrade our stock or our sector, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock relies in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. We do not control these analysts. Furthermore, if one or more of the analysts who do cover us downgrade our stock or our industry, or change their views regarding the stock of any of our competitors, or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price of our stock could decline. If one or more of these analysts stop covering us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nMaintaining the requirements of being a public company may strain our resources, divert management\u2019s attention and affect our ability to attract and retain qualified board members.\nIn the second quarter of 2019, we completed our IPO. As a public company, we incur significant legal, regulatory, finance, accounting, investor relations and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company, including costs associated with public company governance and reporting requirements. We also have incurred and will continue to incur costs associated with our compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, as well as rules and regulations implemented by the SEC and costs in connection with continued listing on the NYSE. Our efforts to comply with these rules and regulations have significantly increased our legal and financial compliance costs and have made some activities more time-consuming or costly. Our management devotes a substantial amount of time to ensure that we comply with all of these requirements, diverting the attention of management away from revenue-producing activities. The expenses incurred by public companies generally for reporting and corporate governance purposes have been increasing. These laws and regulations also could make it more difficult or costly for us to obtain certain types of insurance, including director and officer liability insurance, and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. These laws and regulations could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our Board of Directors, our board committees or as our executive officers. Furthermore, if we are unable to satisfy our obligations as a public company, we could be subject to delisting of our common stock and the MCPS, fines, sanctions and other regulatory action and potentially civil litigation.\nFailure to comply with requirements to design, implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price, and any failure to maintain financial controls could result in our financial statements becoming unreliable.\nAs a public company, we have significant requirements for enhanced financial reporting and internal controls. We have made, and will continue to make, changes to our internal controls and procedures for financial reporting and accounting systems to meet our reporting obligations as a public company. The process of designing and implementing effective internal controls is a continuous effort that requires us to anticipate and react to changes in our business and the economic and regulatory environments and to expend significant resources to maintain a system of internal controls that is adequate to satisfy our reporting obligations as a public company. The measures we take may not be sufficient to satisfy our obligations as a public company, and if we are unable to establish or maintain appropriate internal financial reporting controls and procedures, it could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations on a timely basis, result in material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements and harm our results of operations.\nIn connection with the implementation of the necessary procedures and practices related to internal control over financial reporting, we may identify deficiencies that we may not be able to\nremediate in time to meet the deadline imposed by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 for compliance with the requirements of Section 404. In addition, we may encounter problems or delays in completing the remediation of any deficiencies identified by our independent registered public accounting firm in connection with the issuance of their attestation report.\nOur testing, or the subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm, may reveal deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses which could result in a material misstatement of our annual or quarterly consolidated financial statements or disclosures that may not be prevented or detected.\nWe may not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 or our independent registered public accounting firm may not issue an unqualified opinion. If either we are unable to conclude that we have effective internal control over financial reporting or our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to provide us with an unqualified opinion, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nFuture sales, or the perception of future sales, by us or our existing stockholders in the public market could cause the market price for our common stock to decline.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales could occur, could substantially decrease the market price of shares of our common stock. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had 572.8 million shares of our common stock outstanding. Of the outstanding shares, the 233.1 million shares sold in the IPO are freely tradable without restriction or further registration under the Securities Act, except that any shares held by our affiliates, as that term is defined under Rule 144 of the Securities Act, or Rule 144, including our directors, executive officers and other affiliates (including New Mountain Capital and Goldman Sachs).\nThe 185.3 million shares of common stock held by affiliates of New Mountain Capital, affiliates of Goldman Sachs and certain of our directors and executive officers as of December 31, 2019, representing 32% of the total outstanding shares of our common stock are \u201crestricted securities\u201d within the meaning of Rule 144 and subject to certain restrictions on resale. Restricted securities may be sold in the public market only if they are registered under the Securities Act or are sold pursuant to an exemption from registration such as Rule 144.\nIn addition, pursuant to a registration rights agreement, New Mountain Capital, Goldman Sachs and certain other stockholders have the right, subject to certain conditions, to require us to register the sale of their shares of our common stock under the Securities Act. By exercising its registration rights and selling a large number of shares, New Mountain Capital and Goldman Sachs could cause the prevailing market price of our common stock to decline. Certain of our other stockholders have \u201cpiggyback\u201d registration rights with respect to future registered offerings\nof our common stock. As of December 31, 2019, the shares of common stock covered by registration rights would represent approximately 50% of our total common stock outstanding. Registration of any of these outstanding shares of common stock would result in such shares becoming freely tradable without compliance with Rule 144 upon effectiveness of the registration statement.\n44.5 million shares of our common stock subject to our outstanding stock options or shares of our common stock subject to issuance under the Legacy Avantor Plan, the Vail Plan and our 2019 Plan have been registered with a registration statement on Form S-8 and will be available for sale in the open market, subject to limitations in the stockholders agreement. As of December 31, 2019, there were stock options outstanding to purchase a total of 22.7 million shares of our common stock, and 5.2 million shares of our common stock were subject to restricted stock units. In addition, as of December 31, 2019, 16.6 million shares of common stock were reserved for future issuance under the 2019 Plan.\nAs restrictions on resale end, or if the existing stockholders exercise their registration rights, the market price of our shares of common stock could drop significantly if the holders of these shares sell them or are perceived by the market as intending to sell them. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to raise additional funds through future offerings of our shares of common stock or other securities.\nIn the future, we may also issue our securities in connection with investments or acquisitions. The amount of shares of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our then-outstanding shares of our common stock. Any issuance of additional securities in connection with investments or acquisitions may result in additional dilution to you.\nConcentrations of shareholder control could have adverse impacts\nCertain of our shareholders, including affiliates of New Mountain Capital and affiliates of Goldman Sachs, have considerable influence over us as a result of their share ownership. This concentration could lead to conflicts of interest and difficulties for non-insider investors effecting corporate changes, and could adversely affect our Company\u2019s share price. These shareholders (and their affiliates) and certain of our directors and officers, acting together, hold approximately 32% of our issued and outstanding shares as of December 31, 2019 and have the ability to influence all matters submitted to our shareholders for approval (including the election and removal of directors and any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets). In addition, in connection with the IPO, we entered into an investor rights agreement with an affiliate of New Mountain Capital, which agreement provides for the ability of New Mountain Capital to nominate members to our Board of Directors. Accordingly, this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of our Company, impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our shares. The issuance of stock options and warrants could lead to greater concentration of share ownership among insiders and could lead to dilution of share\nownership which could lead to depressed share prices. In addition, New Mountain Capital and shareholders affiliated with Goldman Sachs may have different interests than other public investors.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents could delay or prevent a change of control.\nCertain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may have an anti-takeover effect and may delay, defer or prevent a merger, acquisition, tender offer, takeover attempt, or other change of control transaction that a stockholder might consider in its best interest, including those attempts that might result in a premium over the market price for the shares held by our stockholders. These provisions provide for, among other things:\n\u2022\na classified Board of Directors, as a result of which our Board of Directors is divided into three classes, with each class serving for staggered terms, with successors to the class of directors whose term expires at the first and second annual meetings of stockholders following the date of the IPO, as applicable, elected for a term expiring at the third annual meeting of stockholders following the date of the IPO;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our Board of Directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock;\n\u2022\nadvance notice requirements for nominations of directors by stockholders and for stockholders to include matters to be considered at our annual meetings;\n\u2022\ncertain limitations on convening special stockholder meetings;\n\u2022\nthe removal of directors either with or without cause and only upon the affirmative vote of the holders of at least 66\u2154% of the shares of common stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors; and\n\u2022\nthat certain provisions may be amended only by the affirmative vote of at least 66\u2154% in voting power of all outstanding shares of stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class.\nThese anti-takeover provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if the third party\u2019s offer may be considered beneficial by many of our stockholders. As a result, our stockholders may be limited in their ability to obtain a premium for their shares.\nOur Board of Directors is authorized to issue and designate shares of our preferred stock in additional series without stockholder approval.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation authorizes our Board of Directors, without the approval of our stockholders, to issue 75.0 million shares of our preferred stock (including 25.0 million shares of MCPS), subject to limitations prescribed by applicable law, rules and regulations and the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as shares of preferred stock in series, to establish from time to time the number of shares to be included in\neach such series and to fix the designation, powers, preferences and rights of the shares of each such series and the qualifications, limitations or restrictions thereof. The powers, preferences and rights of these additional series of preferred stock may be senior to or on parity with our common stock, which may reduce its value.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides, subject to limited exceptions, that state and federal courts (as appropriate) located within the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for certain stockholder litigation matters, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, employees or stockholders.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation provides that unless we consent to the selection of an alternative forum, the state or federal courts (as appropriate) located within the State of Delaware shall, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for any (i) derivative action or proceeding brought on behalf of our company, (ii) action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any director, officer, or other employee or stockholder of our company to us or our stockholders, creditors or other constituents, (iii) action against us or any of our directors or officers involving a claim or defense arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law or our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or our amended and restated bylaws, (iv) action against us or any director or officer of the Company involving a claim or defense implicating the internal affairs doctrine, or (v) action against us or any of our directors or officers involving a claim or defense arising pursuant to the Exchange Act or the Securities Act. It is possible that these exclusive forum provisions may be challenged in court and may be deemed unenforceable in whole or in part. Our exclusive forum provision shall not relieve the company of its duties to comply with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder, and our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with these laws, rules and regulations.\nAny person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and consented to the forum provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers, other employees or stockholders which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 18579, "SIC": 3826, "TIC": "AVTR"}
