RISK FACTORS\nThe following are some of the factors that could materially and adversely affect our future performance or could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in our forward-looking statements. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us and we cannot predict every event and circumstance that may adversely affect our business. However, these risks and uncertainties are the most significant factors that we have identified at this time. If one or more of these risks actually occurs, our business, results of operations and/or financial condition could suffer, and the price of our stock could be negatively affected.\n- 12 -\nWe seek to acquire additional businesses. If we are unable to do so, our future rate of growth may be reduced or limited. We may incur significant expenses related to due diligence or other transaction-related expenses for a proposed acquisition that may not be completed.\nA key element of our growth strategy is to acquire businesses, technologies or products that are complementary to our current product offerings. We seek to make acquisitions that will further expand our product lines as well as reduce our overall reliance on the ATE market. We may not be able to execute our acquisition strategy if:\n\u25cf\nwe are unable to identify suitable businesses, technologies or products to acquire;\n\u25cf\nwe do not have sufficient cash or access to required capital at the necessary time;\n\u25cf\nwe are unwilling or unable to outbid larger, more resourceful companies; or\n\u25cf\nwe are unable to successfully close proposed acquisitions.\nOur acquisition strategy involves financial and management risks which may adversely affect our results in the future.\nIf we acquire additional businesses, technologies or products, we will face the following additional risks:\n\u25cf\nfuture acquisitions could divert management's attention from daily operations or otherwise require additional management, operational and financial resources;\n\u25cf\nwe might not be able to integrate future acquisitions into our business successfully or operate acquired businesses profitably;\n\u25cf\nwe may realize substantial acquisition related expenses which would reduce our net earnings in future years; and\n\u25cf\nour investigation of potential acquisition candidates may not reveal problems and liabilities of the companies that we acquire.\nIf any of the events described above occur, our earnings could be reduced. If we issue shares of our stock or other rights to purchase our stock in connection with any future acquisitions, we would dilute our existing stockholders' interests and our earnings per share may decrease. If we issue or incur debt in connection with any future acquisitions, lenders may require that we pledge our assets to secure repayment of such debt and impose covenants on us which could, among other things, restrict our ability to increase capital expenditures or to acquire additional businesses.\nWe may attempt to acquire a substantial business that would require us to issue or incur significant debt from third-parties. If we are unable to secure sufficient financing at terms that are acceptable to us, we may not be able to close the proposed acquisition. Additionally, should we incur significant debt, we may not be able to achieve compliance with all covenants related to the debt depending on our financial results in future periods.\nIn connection with our acquisition strategy, we are pursuing potential acquisition opportunities that may be significant in size compared to us, which could require us to obtain significant third-party financing to close the proposed transaction. We may encounter difficulties in securing necessary financing at terms that would be acceptable to us and may not be able to close on the proposed acquisition. In addition, should we incur significant third-party debt, our future financial results may be negatively impacted by external factors, such as an economic recession, which may impact our ability to achieve compliance with any covenants related to the debt as well as make the required payments under the terms of the indebtedness.\nWe may acquire businesses in the future and utilize an earnout structure as we have done on prior transactions we have closed. In connection with the earnout, we may be required to accrue significant increases or decreases to the contingent consideration liability we would establish. These adjustments to the contingent consideration liability could cause our results of operations to have increased variability, which may negatively impact our stock\u2019s trading price.\nWe may utilize an earnout structure on future acquisitions. We are required to estimate the fair value of the contingent consideration associated with any earnout on a quarterly basis and record an adjustment to the contingent consideration liability in our results of operations for the period concerned. The contingent consideration adjustment we record quarterly may cause increased variability in our future results of operations, which may cause fluctuations in our stock price.\nOur business is subject to intense competition, which has in the past and could in the future, materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face significant competition throughout the world in each of our product segments. Some of our competitors have substantial financial resources and more extensive design and production capabilities than we do. Some of our competitors are much smaller than we are, and therefore have much lower levels of overhead than we do, which enables them to sell their competing products at lower prices. In order to remain competitive, we must be able to continually commit a significant portion of our personnel and financial resources to developing new products and maintaining customer satisfaction worldwide. We expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and introduce new products or technologies. Over the last several years, in response to significant declines in global demand for our products, some competitors have reduced their product pricing significantly, which has led to intensified price based competition, which has and could continue to materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n- 13 -\nOur sales are affected by the cyclicality and seasonality of the semiconductor and ATE markets, which causes our operating results to fluctuate significantly.\nOur business depends in significant part upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers. Capital expenditures by these companies depend upon, among other things, the current and anticipated market demand for semiconductors and the products that utilize them. Typically, semiconductor manufacturers curtail capital expenditures during periods of economic downturn. Conversely, semiconductor manufacturers increase capital expenditures when market demand requires the addition of new or expanded production capabilities or the reconfiguration of existing fabrication facilities to accommodate new products. In addition to being cyclical, the ATE market has also developed a seasonal pattern in the last several years, with the second and third quarters being the periods of strong demand and the first and fourth quarters being periods of weakened demand. We believe this change has been driven by the strong demand for consumer products containing semiconductor content sold during the year-end holiday shopping season. These market changes and seasonal sales pattern have contributed in the past, and will likely continue to contribute in the future, to fluctuations in our operating results.\nWe seek to further diversify the markets for our thermal products in order to increase the proportion of our sales attributable to markets which are less subject to cyclicality than the semiconductor and ATE markets. If we are unable to do so, our future performance will remain substantially exposed to the fluctuations of the cyclicality of the semiconductor and ATE markets.\nSince 2009, we have sold our thermal products in markets outside of the semiconductor market, including the automotive, consumer electronics, defense/aerospace, energy, industrial and telecommunications markets. During 2018 and 2017, our sales to these non-semiconductor markets were $33.2 million (including $19.1 million of net revenues attributable to Ambrell) and $29.0 million (including $13.2 million of net revenues attributable to Ambrell), respectively, and represented 42% and 44% of our consolidated net revenues, respectively. Prior to our acquisition of Ambrell, we offered only highly specialized engineering solutions in these markets outside the semiconductor market, the demand for which is limited and which we expect may vary significantly from period to period. Our goal is to increase our sales into these and other non-semiconductor markets; however, in most cases, the expansion of our thermal product sales into these new markets has occurred in the last several years, and we may experience difficulty in expanding our sales efforts further into these markets. These difficulties could include hiring sales and marketing staff with sufficient experience selling into these new markets and our ability to continue to develop products which meet the needs of customers in these markets and which are not currently offered by our competitors. In addition, due to the highly specialized nature of certain of our product offerings in these non-semiconductor markets, we do not expect broad market penetration in many of these markets. If we are unable to expand our sales in non-semiconductor markets, our net revenues and results of operations will remain substantially dependent upon the cycles of the semiconductor and ATE markets.\nChanges in the buying patterns of our customers have affected, and may continue to affect, demand for our products and our gross and net operating margins. Such changes in patterns are difficult to predict and may not be immediately apparent.\nIn addition to the cyclicality and seasonality of the semiconductor and ATE markets, demand for our products and our gross and net operating margins have also been affected by changes in the buying patterns of our customers. Some of the changes in customer buying patterns that have impacted us in the past, and may continue to do so in the future, have included customers placing heightened emphasis on shorter lead times (which places increased demands on our available engineering and production capacity and may result in increasing unit costs) and ordering in smaller quantities (which prevents us from acquiring component materials in larger volumes at lower unit costs.) We have also experienced customer supply chain management groups demanding lower prices and spreading purchases across multiple vendors. We believe some of the changes in customer buying patterns are the result of changes within the ATE market over the last several years, including, for example, changing product requirements and longer time periods between new product offerings by OEMs. Such shifts in market practices have had, and may continue to have, varying degrees of impact on our net revenues and our gross and net operating margins. Such shifts are difficult to predict and may not be immediately apparent, and the impact of these practices is difficult to quantify from period to period. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in implementing effective strategies to counter these shifts.\n- 14 -\nWe generate a large portion of our sales from a small number of customers. If we were to lose one or more of our large customers, operating results could suffer dramatically.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, Texas Instruments Incorporated accounted for 11% of our consolidated net revenues. While both of our operating segments sold products to this customer, these revenues were primarily generated by our EMS segment. During the year ended December 31, 2017, Hakuto Co. Ltd., one of our distributors, accounted for 11% of our consolidated net revenues. These revenues were generated by our Thermal segment. Our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 40% and 46% of our consolidated net revenues in 2018 and 2017, respectively. The loss of any one or more of our largest customers, or a reduction in orders by a major customer, could materially reduce our net revenues or otherwise materially affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur operating results often change significantly from quarter to quarter and may cause fluctuations in our stock price.\nHistorically, our operating results have fluctuated significantly from quarter to quarter. We believe that these fluctuations occur primarily due to the cycles of demand in the semiconductor manufacturing industry. In addition to these changing cycles of demand, other factors that have caused our quarterly operating results to fluctuate in the past, and that may cause fluctuations and losses in the future, include:\n\u25cf\nchanges in demand in the markets we serve outside the ATE market including the automotive, consumer electronics, defense/aerospace, energy, industrial and telecommunication markets;\n\u25cf\nthe state of the U.S. and global economies;\n\u25cf\nchanges in the buying patterns of our customers;\n\u25cf\nchanges in our market share;\n\u25cf\ncosts related to due diligence and transaction-related expenses for a proposed acquisition that does not get completed;\n\u25cf\ncosts and timing of integration of our acquisitions and plant consolidations and relocations;\n\u25cf\nthe technological obsolescence of our inventories;\n\u25cf\nquantities of our inventories greater than is reasonably likely to be utilized in future periods;\n\u25cf\nfluctuations in the level of product warranty charges;\n\u25cf\ncompetitive pricing pressures;\n\u25cf\nexcess manufacturing capacity;\n\u25cf\nour ability to control operating costs;\n\u25cf\ndelays in shipments of our products;\n\u25cf\nthe mix of our products sold;\n\u25cf\nthe mix of customers and geographic regions where we sell our products;\n\u25cf\nchanges in the level of our fixed costs;\n\u25cf\ncosts associated with the development of our proprietary technology;\n\u25cf\nour ability to obtain raw materials or fabricated parts when needed;\n\u25cf\nincreases in costs of component materials;\n\u25cf\ncancellation or rescheduling of orders by our customers;\n\u25cf\nchanges in government regulations; and\n\u25cf\npolitical or economic instability.\nBecause the market price of our common stock has tended to vary based on, and in relation to, changes in our operating results, fluctuations in the market price of our stock are likely to continue as variations in our quarterly results continue.\nA breach of our operational or security systems could negatively affect our business and results of operations.\nWe rely on various information technology networks and systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, including confidential data, and to carry out and support a variety of business activities, including manufacturing, research and development, supply chain management, sales and accounting. A failure in or a breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of our suppliers and other service providers, including as a result of cyberattacks, could disrupt our business, result in the disclosure or misuse of proprietary or confidential information, damage our reputation, cause losses and significantly increase our costs. In addition, domestic and international regulatory agencies have implemented, and are continuing to implement, various reporting and remediation requirements that companies must comply with upon learning of a breach. While we have insurance that may protect us from incurring some of these costs, there is no assurance that such insurance coverage is adequate to cover all costs and damages incurred in connection with a cyberattack.\nOur industry is subject to rapid technological change, and our business prospects would be negatively affected if we are unable to quickly and effectively respond to innovation in the semiconductor and ATE markets.\nSemiconductor technology continues to become more complex as manufacturers incorporate ICs into an increasing variety of products. This trend, and the changes needed in automated testing systems to respond to developments in the semiconductor market, are likely to continue. We cannot be certain that we will be successful or timely in developing, manufacturing or selling products that will satisfy customer needs or that will attain market acceptance. Our failure to provide products that effectively and timely meet customer needs or gain market acceptance will negatively affect our business prospects.\n- 15 -\nIf our suppliers do not meet product or delivery requirements, we could have reduced revenues and earnings.\nCertain components may be in short supply from time to time because of high demand or the inability of some vendors to consistently meet our quality or delivery requirements. A significant portion of our material purchases require some custom work and there are not always multiple suppliers capable of performing such custom work on a timely or cost effective basis. If any of our suppliers were to cancel commitments or fail to meet quality or delivery requirements needed to satisfy customer orders for our products, we could lose time-sensitive customer orders, have reduced revenues and earnings, and be subject to contractual penalties, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business may suffer if we are unable to attract and retain key employees.\nThe loss of key personnel could adversely affect our ability to manage our business effectively. Our future success will depend largely upon the continued services of our senior management and other key employees or the development of successors with commensurate skills and talents. In the past, during periods of weakened demand which has caused us to experience operating losses, we have implemented temporary salary and benefit reductions and eliminations that have remained in place until our operations returned to profitability. If global economic conditions were to deteriorate and we were to implement such salary and benefit reductions or eliminations again, or if we cannot continue to increase employee salaries and maintain employee benefits commensurate with competitive opportunities, we may not be able to retain our senior management and other key employees. Our business could suffer if we were to lose one of more of our senior officers or other key employees.\nA substantial portion of our customers are located outside the U.S., which exposes us to foreign political and economic risks.\nWe have operated internationally for many years and expect to expand our international operations as necessary to continue expansion of our sales and service to our non-U.S. customers. Our foreign subsidiaries generated 16% and 17% of consolidated net revenues in 2018 and 2017, respectively. Net revenues from foreign customers totaled $53.0 million, or 68% of consolidated net revenues in 2018, and $46.6 million, or 70% of consolidated net revenues in 2017. We expect our net revenues from foreign customers will continue to represent a significant portion of total net revenues. In addition to the risks generally associated with sales and operations in the U.S., sales to customers outside the U.S. and operations in foreign countries are subject to additional risks, which may, in the future, affect our operations. These risks include:\n\u25cf\nthe implementation of trade tariffs by the U.S. and other countries that would impact our products;\n\u25cf\npolitical and economic instability in foreign countries;\n\u25cf\nthe imposition of financial and operational controls and regulatory restrictions by foreign governments;\n\u25cf\nthe need to comply with a wide variety of U.S. and foreign import and export laws;\n\u25cf\nlocal business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices, including business practices that we are prohibited from engaging in by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws and regulations;\n\u25cf\ntrade restrictions;\n\u25cf\nchanges in taxes;\n\u25cf\nlonger payment cycles;\n\u25cf\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates; and\n\u25cf\nthe greater difficulty of administering business abroad.\nA significant portion of our cash position is maintained overseas and we may not be able to repatriate cash from overseas when necessary which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition.\nWhile much of our cash is in the U.S., a significant portion is generated from and maintained by our foreign operations. As of December 31, 2018, $3.9 million, or 22%, of our cash and cash equivalents was held by our foreign subsidiaries. Our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted if we are unable to maintain a sufficient level of cash flow in the U.S. to address our cash requirements and we are unable to efficiently and timely repatriate cash from overseas. Any payment of distributions, loans or advances to us by our foreign subsidiaries could be subject to restrictions on, or taxation of, dividends or repatriation of earnings under applicable local law, monetary transfer restrictions and foreign currency exchange regulations in the jurisdictions in which our subsidiaries operate. If we are unable to repatriate the earnings of our subsidiaries, it could have an adverse impact on our ability to redeploy earnings in other jurisdictions where they could be used more profitably.\nWe have experienced and may continue to experience significant variability in our effective tax rates and may have exposure to additional tax liabilities and costs.\nWe are subject to paying income taxes in the U.S. and various other countries in which we operate. Our effective tax rate is dependent on where our earnings are generated and the tax regulations and the interpretation and judgment of administrative tax or revenue entities in the U.S. and other countries. We are also subject to tax audits in the countries where we operate. Any material assessment resulting from an audit from an administrative tax or revenue entity could negatively affect our financial results.\n- 16 -\nClaims of intellectual property infringement by or against us could seriously harm our businesses.\nFrom time to time, we may be forced to respond to or prosecute intellectual property infringement claims to defend or protect our rights or a customer's rights. These claims, regardless of merit, may consume valuable management time, result in costly litigation or cause product shipment delays. Any of these factors could seriously harm our business and operating results. We may have to enter into royalty or licensing agreements with third parties who claim infringement. These royalty or licensing agreements, if available, may be costly to us. If we are unable to enter into royalty or licensing agreements with satisfactory terms, our business could suffer. In instances where we have had reason to believe that we may be infringing the patent rights of others, or that someone may be infringing our patent rights, we have asked our patent counsel to evaluate the validity of the patents in question, as well as the potentially infringing conduct. If we become involved in a dispute, neither the third parties nor the courts are bound by our counsel's conclusions.", "PERMNO": 85013, "SIC": 3825, "TIC": "INTT"}
