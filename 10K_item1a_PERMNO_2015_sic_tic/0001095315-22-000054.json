{"cik": "1095315", "company": "PFSWEB INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-05-09", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected by any or all of the following factors, in which event the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Operations\nOur service fee revenue and gross margin are dependent upon our clients\u2019 business and transaction volumes and our costs. A reduction in our clients\u2019 eCommerce business, our inability to grow our business or increase service fee revenue from new or existing clients, or our inability to manage expected costs could result in financial performance shortfalls and negatively impact our operating results.\nOur service fee revenue is primarily transaction based and fluctuates with the volume of transactions or level of sales of the products by our clients for whom we provide omnichannel services. If we are unable to retain existing clients or attract new clients, or if we dedicate significant resources to clients whose business does not generate revenues at projected levels or sufficient revenues, or whose products do not generate substantial customer sales, our business and financial condition may be materially adversely affected.\nWhen making a proposal for clients, we rely on our estimates of costs and timing for delivering our services, which may be based on limited data and could be inaccurate. Further, our ability to estimate service fee revenue for future periods is substantially dependent upon our clients\u2019 and our own projections, the accuracy of which has been, and will continue to be, unpredictable. Therefore, our planning for client activity and targeted goals for service fee revenue and gross margin may be materially adversely affected by incomplete, delayed or inaccurate projections. Any increased or unexpected costs or unanticipated delays in connection with the performance of fixed-price contracts, including delays caused by factors outside of our control, could make these contracts less profitable or unprofitable and may affect the amount of revenue, profit and profit margin reported in any period.\nIn addition, most of our service agreements with our clients are non-exclusive and we cannot be assured that any of our clients will continue to use our services for any period of time. The loss of a significant amount of service fee revenue due to client terminations (including terminations related to client bankruptcies) or material reductions in the services provided to one or more clients could have a material adverse effect on our ability to cover our costs and thus on our profitability.\nOur business may suffer if we are unable to hire and retain sufficient temporary and seasonal workers or if labor costs increase.\nWe regularly hire a large number of part-time and seasonal workers, particularly during the fourth quarter holiday season and to meet temporary increases in client activity volume related to \u201cflash sales\u201d and other short-term marketing programs throughout our geographic locations. Any difficulty we may encounter in hiring such workers could result in significant increases in labor costs, or inability to support our clients\u2019 businesses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition and results of operations. We may also hire more full-time and part-time employees to mitigate the risk of the unavailability of temporary workers, and our failure to maintain an appropriate mix of labor personnel may result in higher costs. Increases in minimum wage requirements and other competition for labor, could also substantially increase our labor costs. Although we seek to preserve the contractual ability to pass through increases in labor costs to our clients, not all of our current contracts provide us with this protection, and we may enter into contracts in the future, which limit or prohibit our ability to pass through increases in labor costs to our clients.\nWe are dependent on our key officers, managers and highly skilled personnel, and if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel in all our geographic locations, our business and our results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nDue to current general labor shortages, we have had difficulty retaining and hiring highly-skilled, competent and trained personnel, including management and accounting personnel. As a result, we need to attract and retain highly-skilled and technical personnel for whom there is intense competition in all our geographical areas of operation. Increasing wages and competition for skilled personnel worldwide may negatively impact our business and increase our costs. We cannot be certain that we will be able to attract and retain the personnel necessary for the continuing support of and growth of our business. The loss of any of our key personnel or our inability to attract and retain key employees in the future could materially harm and be disruptive to our business.\nWe face competition from many sources that could adversely affect our business, and growth in our clients\u2019 eCommerce business may make it more efficient for the client to perform some of our service offerings themselves.\nMany companies offer, on an individual basis, one or more of the same services we do, and we face competition from many different sources depending upon the type and range of services requested by a potential client. Our competitors include vertical outsourcers, which are companies that offer a single function, such as call centers, and public warehouses. We compete against transportation logistics providers who offer product management functions as an ancillary service to their primary transportation services. We also compete against other infrastructure service providers, who perform many similar services as us. Many of these companies have greater capabilities than we do for the single or multiple functions they provide. In many instances, our competition is the in-house operations of potential clients themselves. The in-house operations of potential clients often believe they can perform the same services we do, while others are reluctant to outsource business functions that involve direct customer contact. We cannot be certain we will be able to compete successfully against these or other competitors in the future.\nTo remain competitive, we must continue to enhance and improve the responsiveness, functionality and features of our services and the underlying network infrastructure. If we are unable to adapt to changing market conditions, client requirements or emerging industry standards, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur operating results are materially impacted by our client concentration and mix and the seasonality of our clients' business.\nOur business is materially impacted by our client mix and the seasonality of their business as well as the concentration of our clients including our focus on certain primary vertical industries. With a concentration of our revenue with certain clients and the concentration of clients in certain industries, our business may be more susceptible as a result of a loss of one or customers and/or a single industry specific occurrence or change in law or regulation with respect to our client\u2019s business. Further, based upon our current client mix and their current projected business volumes, we anticipate our highest service fee revenue will be recorded in our fourth quarter. We are unable to predict how the seasonality of future clients\u2019 business may affect our quarterly revenue and whether the seasonality may change due to modifications to a client\u2019s business. As such, we believe results of operations for a quarterly period may not be indicative of the results for any other quarter or for the full year.\nOur business is subject to the risk associated with timing of contracts, adherence to contract terms and certain recovery of costs under the contract.\nThe sales cycle for our services is variable, typically ranging between several months to up to a year from initial contact with the potential client to the signing and the actual implementation of our services for the contract. A potential client\u2019s decision to purchase our services is discretionary, involves a significant commitment of the client\u2019s resources and is influenced by intense internal and external pricing and operating comparisons. Consequently, the period between initial contact and the purchase of our services is often long and subject to delays associated with the lengthy approval and competitive evaluation processes that typically accompany significant operational decisions. Additionally, the time required to finalize pending contracts and to implement our systems and integrate a new client can range from several weeks to many months. Delays in signing and integrating new clients may affect our revenue and cause our operating results to vary widely.\nMany of our client service agreements contain minimum service level requirements and impose financial penalties if we fail to meet such requirements. The imposition of a substantial amount of such penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations. In the event we are unable to meet the service levels expected by the client, our relationship with the client could suffer and may result in financial penalties and/or the termination of the client contract.\nAdditionally, most of our client agreements provide a contract expiration date, but many also include an early termination clause permitting the client to terminate the contract for convenience prior to its stated expiration date or to reduce the scope of services or delay the commencement of services to be provided under the contract. Termination, reduction, or delay of our services under a contract could result from factors unrelated to our work product or the progress of the project, such as factors related to business or financial conditions of the client, changes in client strategies or the domestic or global economy generally. The bankruptcy, early termination, reduction or substantial delay of services of any significant client, or nonrenewal of any significant client contract, or the nonpayment of a material amount of our service fees by a significant client, if not offset by an increase in other revenue or cost reductions, could have a material adverse effect upon our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFurther, we generally incur start-up costs in connection with the planning and implementation of business process solutions for our clients. Although we generally attempt to recover these costs from the client in the early stages of the client relationship, or upon contract termination if the client terminates without cause prior to full payment of these costs, there is a risk that the client contract may not fully cover the start-up costs or that the client will terminate the contract for cause and withhold payment of any unpaid start-up costs. To the extent start-up costs exceed the start-up fees received, certain excess costs will be expensed as incurred. Additionally, in connection with new client contracts, we may incur capital expenditures associated with assets whose primary use is related to the client solution. There is a risk that the contract may end before expected and we may not recover the full amount of our capital costs.\nOur business could be adversely affected if our clients are not satisfied with our services or our third party provider services resulting in client attrition.\nOur success depends on our ability to handle a large number of transactions for many different clients in various product categories that are effective and profitable. Our success also depends on our ability to satisfy our clients, both with respect to our professional services and operational eCommerce platform to meet our clients\u2019 business needs. These services may be performed by our own staff, or by a third party or a combination of the two. If a client is not satisfied with the quality of work performed by us or a third party, then we could incur additional costs to address the situation, the profitability of that work might be impaired, and the client\u2019s dissatisfaction with our services could damage our ability to obtain additional work from that client. Under the terms of several of our contracts with our service clients, we remain liable to provide such third party services and may be liable for the actions and omissions of such third party providers. In addition, negative publicity related to our client relationships, regardless of its accuracy, may further damage our business and reputation by affecting our ability to compete for new business with current and prospective clients and otherwise could result in a material adverse effect upon our business and financial condition.\nFurther, as we experience volume increases in transactions due to increased sales and/or client growth, including from client marketing programs, such as \u201csecret sales\u201d, \u201cflash sales\u201d or holiday related promotions, these often result in significant short-term spikes in transaction volumes. When this occurs, additional stress is placed upon our network hardware and software and our ability to efficiently manage our operations and available staffing resources, and our ability to efficiently manage a large number of spikes in transactions could be hampered. If we are not able to maintain an appropriate level of operating performance, we may be in breach of our client contractual obligations, develop a negative reputation, and impair existing and prospective client relationships and our business could be materially adversely affected.\nWe may experience fluctuations in the utilization of our distribution facilities as a result of shifts in our client concentration, attrition or growth, some of which we may not be able to control, which could adversely impact our operations and financial condition.\nOur clients expect us to provide omnichannel services at the appropriate size and scope of projects based on the client\u2019s needs, whether such needs are expanding or contracting. We must seek to maintain sufficient capacity in our fulfillment, call center and computer technology systems to support our projected existing and new client business activity, including seasonal volumes. The fixed cost structure of many of these investments limits our flexibility to reduce our costs when excess capacity occurs. A reduction in our clients\u2019 business, including from financial distress or related bankruptcies, or our inability to grow our business or increase service fee revenue from new or existing clients could result in an underutilization in our invested assets.\nSimilarly, salaries and payroll-related expenses are a significant component of our costs. Balancing our workforce levels against the demands for our services is difficult. We generally cannot reduce our labor costs as quickly as negative changes\nin revenue may occur. We must maintain our operating efficiency and utilization at an appropriate rate to achieve our desired level of profitability. If we are unable to achieve and maintain our target efficiency and utilization rates, our profitability could be adversely impacted. Further, increases in minimum wage requirements and other competitive increases in labor costs could put upward pressure on our costs and adversely affect our profitability if we are unable to recover these increased costs by increasing the prices for our services.\nWe are exposed to the credit risk of some of our clients and to credit exposures in weakened markets, which could result in material losses.\nA substantial portion of our sales are on an open credit basis. We monitor individual client financial viability in granting such open credit arrangements, seek to limit such open credit to amounts we believe the clients can pay, and maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure for doubtful accounts.\nIn the past, there have been bankruptcies amongst our client base, and certain of our clients\u2019 businesses face financial challenges that put them at risk of future bankruptcies. Losses, resulting from client bankruptcies, have impacted our operations and any future bankruptcies could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. To the degree that the credit markets become difficult such that clients cannot maintain financing, our clients' ability to pay could be adversely impacted, which in turn could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nWe process, store and use personal information and other confidential data that we must safeguard the security and privacy of in compliance with laws that govern such data, including governmental regulations in the US, E.U., U.K. and Canada and we may be liable for an actual or perceived failure to comply with such laws, regulations and contractual obligations which could result in significant liability.\nWe are subject to US and foreign laws relating to the collection, use, storage and retention, security and transfer and processing of personally identifiable information. In the provisions of our services to our clients, we may be required to process personally identifiable information in compliance and adherence with numerous federal, state, local and foreign laws regarding privacy and the storing, sharing, access, use, processing, disclosure and protection of personal information, personal data and other customer data. The interpretation and application of data protection laws are in a state of flux, and may vary from country to country or state to state in the US and abroad and may conflict. These laws are increasing in number, enforcement, fines and other penalties. In the event of a security breach, these laws may subject us to incident response, notice and remediation costs, as well as costs associated with any investigations that might arise from federal regulatory agencies and state attorney generals and enforcement agencies. Failure to safeguard data adequately, process data in accordance with such laws or to destroy data securely or otherwise anonymize and de-identify such could subject us to regulatory investigations or enforcement actions under applicable data security, unfair practices, or consumer protection laws. The scope and interpretation of these laws could change and the associated burdens and compliance costs could increase in the future.\nA significant portion of our services are provided in the U.K. and the E.U. As such, we are subject to GDPR, and applicable national implementing legislation of the GDPR, and the U.K. GDPR. The GDPR/U.K. GDPR imposes stringent data protection requirements when acting as a controller and a processor where we are required to provide detailed disclosures and/or comply with mandatory regulations and data processing clauses consistent with the requirements under the GDPR/U.K. GDPR. As we are required to comply with both the GDPR and the U.K. GDPR, we could be subject to parallel enforcement actions with respect to breaches of both GDPR and U.K. GDPR which affects both E.U. and U.K. data subjects of our clients. In addition to the foregoing, a breach of the GDPR or U.K. GDPR could result in regulatory investigations, reputational damage, orders to cease or change our processing of personal data, enforcement notices, and/or assessment notices for a compulsory audit. We may also face civil claims including representative actions and other class action type litigation (where individuals have suffered harm), potentially amounting to significant compensation or damages liabilities, as well as associated costs, diversion of internal resources, and reputational harm.\nGDPR and U.K. GDPR requires, among other things, that personal information only be transferred outside of the European Economic Area, or the U.K, if certain safeguards are taken to legitimize those data transfers. Recent legal developments in the E.U. have created complexity and uncertainty regarding such transfers. Most recently, the European Commission published new versions of the Standard Contractual Clauses on June 4, 2021, which require implementation by September 27th, 2021, for new transfers, and by December 2022 for all existing transfers, such changes will require us to review and revise any existing Standard Contractual Clauses which could increase our compliance costs and adversely affect our business.\nFurther, following Brexit, the E.U. continues to allow the transfer of data from the E.U. to the U.K, however, this decision is subject to a limited term under which the E.U. could revise this decision and/or determine not to renew the term of\nsuch decision. If the decision is not renewed after its term, or the E.U. intervenes during the term, data may not be able to flow freely from the E.U. to the U.K., which would compromise our operations and could materially adversely affect our business.\nIn the United States, we are subject to the CCPA, which became effective in January 2020 and imposes obligations on companies that process personal information for California consumers. Additionally, in November 2020, California passed the CPRA, which expands the CCPA significantly, including by expanding consumers\u2019 rights which will become effective on January 1, 2023. We have taken what we believe are appropriate measures to implement CCPA and CPRA in our business activities, including establishing internal protocols and procedures as well as modifying our contracts accordingly. Further, Virginia enacted the CDPA, another comprehensive state privacy law, which will also be effective January 1, 2023. We will likely see the continuing compliance impact of the new legislation and interpretations thereof and the evolving regulatory environment on our business activities with respect to the use and transfer of personal data. As we expand our operations, the CCPA, CPRA, CDPA and evolving consumer protection regulation may significantly increase our compliance costs and potential liability and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAdditionally, we are subject to PCI-DSS, a security standard applicable to companies that collect, store or transmit certain data regarding credit and debit cards, holders and transactions. Despite our compliance efforts, we may become subject to claims that we have violated the PCI-DSS based on past, present, and future business practices. Our actual or perceived failure to comply with the PCI-DSS can subject us to fines, termination of banking relationships, and increased transaction fees. In addition, there is no guarantee that PCI-DSS compliance will prevent illegal or improper use of our payment systems or the theft, loss or misuse of payment card data or transaction information. We depend on a number of third parties in relation to the operation of our business, a number of which process personal data on our behalf or as our sub-processor, including for PCI-DSS purposes. To the extent required by applicable law, we attempt to mitigate the associated risks of using third parties by performing security assessments and detailed due diligence, entering into contractual arrangements to ensure that providers only process personal data according to our instructions or equivalent instructions to the instructions of our customer (as applicable), and that they have sufficient technical and organizational security measures in place. We and our third-party service providers may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent spam attacks, cyber-attacks and ransomware aimed at personal information and data, specifically identity theft and credit card theft. There is no assurance that these contractual measures and our own privacy and security-related safeguards will protect us from the risks associated with the third-party processing, storage and transmission of such information, including the assessment of fines and penalties under the respective applicable laws and regulations.\nWe generally seek to comply with industry standards and are subject to the terms of our privacy policies and privacy-related obligations to third parties. We strive to comply with all applicable laws, policies, legal obligations and industry codes of conduct relating to privacy and data protection to the extent possible. Compliance with these and any other applicable privacy and data security laws and regulations is a rigorous and time-intensive process, and we may be required to put in place additional mechanisms ensuring compliance with the new data protection rules. we may face significant fines, penalties and costs that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with applicable privacy and data security laws and regulations, our privacy policies, or our privacy-related obligations to users or other third parties, or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of personal information or other customer data, may result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation, or others and could cause our clients to lose trust in us, as well as result in significant fines and penalties, all of which would have an adverse effect on our reputation and business.\nThe rise in cyber warfare, ransomware attacks and the like, increases the potential for a breach of our e-commerce security measures, which could adversely affect our business or expose us to significant financial loss or liability and reputational harm.\nA requirement of the continued growth of e-commerce is the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks, especially as cyber-attacks against companies doing business on the internet and individuals are increasingly subjected to identity and credit card theft. In the ordinary course of our business, we collect, store and process sensitive information relating to our business, clients, customers of our clients, suppliers, third party providers and employees on our networks and through cloud-based services that may be hosted by third parties and in data center infrastructure maintained by third parties. The secure maintenance of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy.\nOur information systems and those of our suppliers, third party providers, partners and clients are subject to the increasing threat and sophistications of intrusions by a wide range of actors, including computer crimes, industrial, state-sponsored, and/or economic espionage, or financial cyber extortion or fraud, especially with increasing political instability and unrest globally. These threats take many shapes and may be introduced through computer viruses, malicious code, ransomware, phishing and malware/spyware to our computers and networks or to an electronic system operated by a third party for our benefit.\nIn addition, such tactics may also seek to cause payments between us and our clients or suppliers due to or from us or our clients to be misdirected to fraudulent accounts, which may not be recoverable.\nWe use various encryption, tokenization and authentication technologies to mitigate cybersecurity risks and effect secure transmission of sensitive information such as customer credit card numbers. We also provide employees with awareness training of cybersecurity threats and routinely utilize information technology security experts to assist us in our evaluations of the effectiveness of the security of our information technology systems. However, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade systems change frequently and often are not recognized or known until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. Further, we and our partners, suppliers and third-party service providers may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent all the varying and changing cyber-attacks which could result in the misappropriate our clients\u2019 or our clients\u2019 customers\u2019 personal information or credit card information by way of example. Such resulting liability could include claims for unauthorized purchases with credit card information, impersonation or other similar fraud claims, as well as claims for other misuses or inadvertent disclosure of personal information, including unauthorized marketing purposes or selling of data. Moreover, the tools we and our service providers use with advances in computer capabilities or other developments may still result in a compromise or breach of the measures that we use to protect client transaction data. Compounding the above, we increased the use of remote work environments and virtual platforms in response to COVID-19, further increasing the risk of cyber-attacks or data security breaches.\nWe may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against such security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches. Because our activities involve the storage and transmission of personal and proprietary information, such as credit card numbers and addresses, security breaches could damage our reputation, cause us to lose clients, impact our ability to attract new clients and we could be exposed to litigation and possible liability. Our security measures may not prevent security breaches, and failure to prevent security breaches may disrupt our operations. The failure to adequately control fraudulent transactions on either our behalf or our client\u2019s behalf could increase our expenses and expose us to reputational damage which could adversely affect our business. Consequently, we cannot provide assurances that a security breach, cyber-attack, data theft or other significant systems or security failures will not occur in the future, and such occurrences could have a material and adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations or financial position.\nOur business is susceptible to risks associated with international operations.\nWe operate on a global basis with operations outside of the United States, including distribution facilities, call centers, technology centers, administrative offices and/or have sales personnel in Belgium, Canada, India and the U.K., and we are currently looking to expand our existing international operations. We may face competition from companies that may have more experience with operations in these countries or with international operations generally. We may also face difficulties integrating new facilities into our existing operations, as well as staffing and integrating employees that we hire in different countries into our existing corporate culture. In addition to the uncertainties from our foreign operations and potential expansion of our international presence, there are risks inherent in doing business internationally that we have not generally faced in our US operations, including:\n\u2022lack of familiarity with, and resulting risk of breach of, and/or unanticipated additional cost of compliance with, foreign laws and regulations, including those governing privacy, data security, data transfer, employment, taxes, tariffs, trade restrictions, transfer pricing and other matters;\n\u2022political, social and economic instability abroad, terrorist attacks, political or military conflict and security concerns;\n\u2022changes in foreign laws, regulations and trade policies, including local tax and customs duty laws or changes in the enforcement, application or interpretation of such laws which may limit our ability to enforce our legal rights and remedies and repatriation of funds;\n\u2022potential for violations of anti-corruption laws and regulations, such as those related to bribery and fraud;\n\u2022fluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022difficulties and expenses associated with localizing our services and operations to local markets, including language and cultural differences;\n\u2022difficulties in staffing and managing international operations, including complex and costly hiring, disciplinary and termination requirements;\n\u2022the impact upon our clients, international firms and global economies arising from Brexit and and the continuing surrounding uncertainty and instability of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) effective as of May 2021 between the U.K. and E.U., and the continuing political, economic and commercial impact on goods and services and travel, including related labor shortages and supply chain delays which could result in increased or decreased sales or revenues or an increase in costs of operations due to continuing uncertainty with import/export and immigration policies or other factors;\n\u2022the complexities of foreign value-added taxes and restrictions on the repatriation of earnings;\n\u2022reduced or varied protection for intellectual property rights in some countries; and\n\u2022increased accounting and reporting burdens and complexities.\nAdditionally, the U.K. is one of our larger markets in Europe. We currently ship products for U.K. clients from our continental Europe location, as well as our facility in Southampton, U.K. As a result of the U.K.'s departure from the E.U., we anticipate greater restrictions on imports and exports between the U.K. and the E.U. and increased regulatory complexity. The uncertainty regarding the TCA and the application and interpretation of such, including with respect to the UK GDPR, may adversely affect our international operations by, among other things, increasing our costs and reducing the volume of our client activities.\nFurther, operating in any international markets requires significant management attention and financial resources. We cannot be certain that the investments and additional resources required to establish and maintain operations in other countries will hold their value or produce desired levels of revenues or profitability. Any one or more of the above risks could negatively impact our international business efforts which could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition as a whole.\nOur financial results may be adversely affected by fluctuations in the foreign currency exchange markets.\nThe revenues and expenses of our international operations generally are denominated in local currencies. Accordingly, we are subject to exchange rate fluctuations between such local currencies and the US dollar. These exchange rate fluctuations subject us to currency translation risk with respect to the reported results of our international operations. Significant strengthening or weakening of the US dollar against currencies like the Canadian Dollar, British Pound and the Euro may materially impact our revenue and profits. As we continue to expand our presence in India, we will have increased exposure to fluctuations between the Indian Rupee and the US dollar. In addition, we have transactions with clients, as well as inter-company transactions between our subsidiaries, that cross currencies and expose us to foreign currency gains and losses. These types of events are difficult to predict and may recur. There can be no assurance that we will be able to reduce the currency risks associated with our international operations. We seek to manage our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates through our normal operating and financing activities and, if deemed appropriate, we may use derivative financial instruments. There is no assurance that we will be successful in managing or controlling foreign currency risks.\nWe or our clients may be a party to litigation involving intellectual property rights used in the provision of services we render. If third parties claim we or our clients are infringing their intellectual property rights under the indemnification obligations within our contracts with our clients and business partners, we could incur significant litigation costs and be required to pay damages, which may have a material adverse effect upon our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe or our clients may be subject to intellectual property legal proceedings and claims in the ordinary course of business. We cannot predict whether third parties will assert claims of infringement in the future. If we or our clients are found to infringe, we may be required to pay monetary damages, which could include treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees for any infringement that is found to be willful, and either be enjoined or required to pay ongoing royalties with respect to any technologies found to infringe. Further, as a result of infringement claims either against us or our clients, we may be required, or deem it advisable, to develop non-infringing technology, which could be costly and time consuming, or enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements. Such royalty or licensing agreements, if required, may be unavailable on terms that are acceptable, or at all.\nUnder our indemnification provisions in the contracts that we enter into with our clients and business partners, we are generally required to defend against claims arising out of our infringement of third-party intellectual property rights, breach of contractual obligations and/or unlawful or otherwise culpable conduct, including breach of data security. The indemnity obligations generally cover damages, costs and attorneys\u2019 fees arising out of such claims. In many instances, our indemnification obligations to our clients include the actions or omissions of our third-party service providers. Although we seek to limit our total liability under such provisions to either a portion of the value of the contract or a specified, agreed-upon amount, in some cases\nour total liability under such provisions is unlimited. Although in many cases our third party service providers indemnify us for their actions and omissions, such providers may dispute or be unable to satisfy their indemnification obligation to us. In addition, our indemnification obligation to our clients may be broader in scope, or may be subject to larger limitations of liability, than the indemnification obligation of our third party service providers to us. In most cases, the term of the indemnity provision is perpetual. If we are required to indemnify a claim in a material amount, or if a series of indemnification claims are in the aggregate a material amount, we may be required to expend significant resources to defend the claims, which may have a material adverse effect upon our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe and our clients may be subject to existing, new or expanded imposition of sales tax in one or more jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe collect sales or other similar taxes for shipments of our and our clients\u2019 goods in certain states and jurisdictions. One or more local, state or foreign jurisdictions may seek to impose sales tax collection obligations on us and other out-of-state companies, including our clients that engage in online commerce, depending upon the nexus we or our clients may have with that jurisdiction and the product or services being performed. As a result of the US Supreme Court's 2018 decision in South Dakota v. Wayfair, many states have enacted, and others may choose to enact in the future, new legislation and increase enforcement efforts of existing legislation requiring online retailers to collect and remit sales tax. If unexpected sales tax obligations are successfully imposed upon us or our clients by a state or other jurisdiction, we or our clients could be exposed to substantial tax liabilities for past sales and fines and penalties for failure to collect sales taxes and we or our clients could suffer decreased sales in that state or jurisdiction as the effective cost of purchasing goods from or through us increases for those residing in that state or jurisdiction. This imposition of sales tax may also be enforced on companies providing software as a service (SaaS), information services, data processing services, and maintenance, to name a few. As we provide such services, we may become subject to sales tax in each state where we provide services.\nIf there is increased legislative or enforcement action, eCommerce in general could decline as increased taxation of online sales could result in online shopping losing some of its current advantage over traditional retail models, which could diminish its appeal to consumers. A decrease in our clients\u2019 eCommerce sales could impact our revenue. In addition, the cost of implementing new and expanded sales tax impositions by multiple taxing authorities may adversely impact our and our clients\u2019 profitability.\nDeterminations under government audits could negatively affect our business.\nWe provide services to a US government agency under a contract that provides the agency with the right to audit and review our performance under the contract, our pricing practices, our cost structure, and our compliance with applicable laws, regulations and standards. If a government audit determines that we are in breach of our contractual terms, or have engaged in improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of the contract, suspension of payments, or disqualification from continuing to do business, or bidding on new business, with this agency and other federal agencies.\nRisks related to our Financial Position and Capital Needs\nOur future capital needs and growth of our business may depend on access to and the ability to secure financing on favorable terms.\nOur business and future growth could depend on our ability to access financing, whether through bank, vendor and commercial lines of credit or raising such through debt or equity securities or a combination of the foregoing. During the year ended December 31, 2021, in conjunction with the sale of our LiveArea business unit in August 2021, we generated approximately $250.0 million in gross proceeds, of which approximately $62.5 million was used to pay off and extinguish the Company\u2019s Credit Agreement with Regions Bank. Our access to any new financing depends upon, among other things, on our operating performance, our financial condition and prospects and the condition of the capital markets at the time we seek financing, including the availability of bank loans and commercial credit in general. Therefore, we cannot guarantee that financing will be available or that we will be able to timely secure financing on favorable terms or at all. Our inability to access new financing could have a material adverse effect on our business and ability to fund future growth.\nWe anticipate incurring significant expenses in the foreseeable future, which may reduce our ability to achieve or maintain profitability.\nTo reach our business growth objectives, we currently expect to increase our operating, sales and marketing expenses, as well as capital expenditures. To offset these expenses, we will need to generate additional profitable business. If our revenue declines or grows slower than either we anticipate or our clients\u2019 projections indicate, or if our operating, sales and marketing\nexpenses exceed our expectations or cannot be reduced to an appropriate level, we may not generate sufficient revenue to be profitable or be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future. Additionally, if our revenue declines or grows slower than either we anticipate or our clients\u2019 projections indicate, we may incur unnecessary or redundant costs and our operating results could be adversely affected.\nOur financial results may be negatively impacted by impairment in the carrying value of our goodwill.\nGoodwill represented approximately 7% of our total assets as of December 31, 2021. The carrying value of goodwill represents the fair value of an acquired business in excess of identifiable assets and liabilities as of the acquisition date. We are required to test goodwill for impairment annually and when factors or indicators become apparent that could reduce the fair value of any of our reporting units below its book value. Such factors requiring an interim test for impairment include financial performance indicators, such as negative or declining cash flows or a decline in actual or planned revenue or earnings, and a sustained decrease in share price. A significant downward revision in the fair value of one or more of our business units that causes the carrying value to exceed the fair value could cause goodwill to be considered impaired and could result in a non-cash impairment charge in our consolidated statement of operations.\nIf our estimates relating to our critical accounting policies prove to be incorrect, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as provided in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities and equity, and the amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Significant assumptions and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements include those related to revenue recognition, allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable, accounting for property, plant and equipment and definite-lived assets, stock-based compensation, income taxes and other contingencies. Our operating results may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in the price of our common stock.\nOur expenses could be adversely impacted by increases in healthcare costs.\nWe provide healthcare benefits to our employees, which we self-insure. Increased costs of providing such benefits, including potential impact from modifications to healthcare legislation and related regulations, could materially impact our future healthcare costs, which could adversely affect our results and cash flow.\nRisks Related to Our Stock\nWe have recently had to delay the flings of certain of our SEC reports as result of the complexity of the closing process associated with the sale of our LiveArea business unit and the related required financial reporting and accounting segmentation of previously commingled business entities, and we expect our Form 10-Q for the period ending March 31, 2022, due on May 10, 2022, will be delayed, which will mean that we will not have met the Nasdaq Global Market continued listing standards, and Nasdaq may delist our common stock which could have a material adverse effect on our company, the price of our common stock and your ability to sell our common stock.\nThe continued listing of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Market is subject to our compliance with Nasdaq listing standards. As previously disclosed and as a result of the delayed filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we expect our Form 10-Q for the period ending March 31, 2022, due on May 10, 2022, will be delayed. A delisting from Nasdaq could adversely affect our relationships with our business partners, vendors, clients and potential clients and our ability to attract and retain employees by means of equity compensation. If our common stock ultimately were to be delisted for any reason, trading of our common stock thereafter would be conducted on the over-the-counter market, or in the so-called \u201cpink sheets.\u201d As a consequence, our stockholders would likely find it more difficult to dispose of, or to obtain accurate quotations as to the prices of, our common stock. A delisting could further adversely impact us by (i) reducing the liquidity and market price of our common stock\u037e (ii) reducing the number of investors willing to hold or acquire our common stock, which could adversely impact our ability to raise equity financing\u037e and (iii) limiting our ability to use a registration statement to offer and sell freely tradable securities, thereby preventing us from accessing the public capital markets.\nInstitutional shareholders hold a significant amount of our common stock and these shareholders may have conflicts of interests with the interests of our other shareholders.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our top three shareholders (including transcosmos, Inc., our largest shareholder) own or control approximately 36% of the voting power of our common stock. The interests of these shareholders may differ from our other shareholders in material respects. This concentration of voting power of our common stock may make it difficult for our other shareholders to approve or defeat matters that may be submitted for action by our shareholders, including the election of directors and amendments to our Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws. This also may have the effect of deterring, delaying, or preventing a change in control, even when such a change in control could benefit our other shareholders. These shareholders may have the power to exert significant influence over our affairs in ways that may be adverse to the interests of our other shareholders.\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile. You may not be able to sell your shares at or above the price at which you purchased such shares.\nThe trading price of our common stock may be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarter-to-quarter fluctuations in operating results, announcements of material adverse events, general conditions in our industry or the public marketplace and other events or factors, including the thin trading of our common stock. In addition, stock markets have experienced extreme price and trading volume volatility in recent years. This volatility has had a substantial effect on the market prices of securities of many technology-related companies for reasons frequently unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Further, our market price may be impacted by our inability to maintain or comply with the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (\u201cNasdaq\u201d) listing requirements, which could include reduction in our market price or delisting of our stock.\nIn addition, if our operating results differ from our announced guidance or the expectations of equity research analysts or investors, the price of our common stock could decrease significantly.\nOur certificate of incorporation, our bylaws, our shareholder rights plan and Delaware law make it difficult for a third party to acquire us, despite the possible benefit to our shareholders.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation, our bylaws, our shareholder rights plan and Delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would be beneficial to our shareholders. For example, our certificate of incorporation permits our Board of Directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock, which may have rights and preferences superior to those of the common stock. The ability to issue preferred stock could have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring us. We have also adopted a shareholder rights plan. These provisions could discourage takeover attempts and could materially adversely affect the price of our stock. In addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may prohibit large shareholders from consummating a merger with, or acquisition of us. These provisions may prevent a merger or acquisition that could be attractive to shareholders and could limit the price investors would be willing to pay in the future for our common stock.\nWe incur significant costs as a result of operating as a public company.\nAs a public company, we bear significant legal, accounting and compliance costs related to our obligations under the applicable laws, including securities laws requiring the preparation of and distribution of periodic public reports. Our management and other skilled and technical personnel devote a substantial amount of time and incur significant expense in connection with accounting and compliance initiatives.\nIn addition, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the related rules and regulations implemented by the SEC and Nasdaq increases our legal and financial compliance costs, while also requiring a substantial amount of time of our management and technical personnel, which may divert management\u2019s time and attention from our other business activities.\nOur stock price could decline if a significant number of shares become available for sale.\nThe current and future issuance and/or vesting of shares of our common stock under our outstanding and future stock options, stock awards, performance shares and deferred stock units, sales of substantial amounts of common stock in the public market following the issuance and/or vesting of such shares, and/or the perception that future sales of these shares could occur, could reduce the market price of our common stock and make it more difficult to sell equity securities in the future.\nActions of activist shareholders could be disruptive and potentially costly, and the possibility that activist shareholders may seek changes that conflict with our strategic direction could cause uncertainty about the strategic direction of our business.\nActivist investors may attempt to effect changes in our strategic direction or our business objectives, or to acquire control or Board representation to advocate corporate actions such as financial restructuring, stock repurchases or sales of assets or the entire company. Activist campaigns that contest or conflict with our strategic direction could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial conditions, as responding to proxy contests and other actions by activist shareholders can disrupt our operations, be costly and time consuming and divert the attention of our Board and senior management from the pursuit of business strategies. These types of actions could cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business.\nGeneral Risks\nWe have identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting which, if not timely remediated, may adversely affect the accuracy and reliability of our financial statements, and our reputation, business and the price of our common stock, as well as lead to a loss of investor confidence in us.\nWe are required to maintain internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures in order to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of our consolidated financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. We currently rely on a manual process in some areas which increases our exposure to human error or intervention in reporting our financial results.\nOur internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements because of its inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud. Even effective internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements. As described in Part II, Item 9A, \u201cControls and Procedures,\u201d of our Annual Report on Form 10-K as of December 31, 2020, we determined that we had material weaknesses in our revenue process and in \"Item 4, Controls and Procedures\" of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for June 30, 2021, we further concluded that our internal controls over financial reporting and our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of June 30, 2021 as a result of deficiencies in (1) accounting for and reporting on unusual transactions (including the sale of our LiveArea business unit), (2) our income tax controls and income tax provision process and (3) our information technology general controls (\u201cITGCs\u201d) related to user access and segregation of duties. For a discussion of these material weaknesses, please see \u201cPart II-Item 9A. Controls and Procedures,\u201d of our Form 10-K for December 31, 2020, filed on March 31, 2021, \u201cItem 4. Controls and Procedures\u201d of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for June 30, 2021, filed on February 7, 2022, \u201cItem 4. Controls and Procedures\u201d of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for September 30, 2021, filed on March 10, 2022, and in \u201cPart II-Item 9A. Controls and Procedures,\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe material weaknesses identified did not result in any material adjustments or restatements of our audited and unaudited consolidated financial statements or disclosures for any prior period previously reported by the Company. Until we fully remediate these weaknesses, it may be more difficult for us to report results accurately and on time and we may rely significantly on manual procedures to assist us with meeting the objectives otherwise fulfilled by an effective control environment and need to engage third-party advisory accounting firms to assist with financial report around our income taxes. The implementation of new procedures and internal controls or modifying our existing processes and controls may require significant time to complete and may require the hiring of additional staff and advisory firms which could be costly and distract management from other activities. While we are working to address our internal control over financial reporting, we cannot be certain that our efforts will be successful or that we will be able to maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future. Any difficulties or delays in implementing these controls could impact our ability to timely report our financial results and ability to provide our investors with information in a timely manner. We expect to incur additional audit fees related to incremental procedures performed and we may see a decline in our stock price due to reduced investor confidence.\nBecause of the inherent limitations in a cost-effective control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur undetected, and it is possible that additional significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting may be identified in the future. Any failure of our internal controls could result in material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements, significant deficiencies, material weaknesses, costs, failure to timely meet our periodic reporting obligations, incremental audit fees and further erosion of investor confidence. It would also adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.\nWe have made, and may make in the future, strategic acquisitions and divestitures that may involve significant risks and uncertainties. We may not realize the anticipated benefits of past or future acquisitions and integration of these acquisitions may disrupt our business and divert management attention. Likewise, any future divestitures may be unsuccessful and negatively impact our business.\nFrom time to time, we may seek opportunities to maximize efficiency and value through various transactions including the sale of the Company, assets or businesses, or the pursuit of acquisitions of complementary assets or businesses. These transactions are subject to inherent risks and could:\n\u2022cause us to incur significant expenses, increase our operating costs, or potentially harm our business;\n\u2022divert management's attention away from other operational matters;\n\u2022result in unanticipated costs, assumption of liabilities or exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired businesses;\n\u2022result in difficulties in integrating the operations, assets and employees of the acquired business;\n\u2022affect the market value of our common stock or relationships with third parties upon the announcement or consummation of a proposed transaction;\n\u2022reduce cash balances and/or increases our debt obligations to finance activities associated with a transaction, including future payments under earn-outs and other contingent payments, which reduce the availability of cash flow for general corporate or other purposes or impact our financial results;\n\u2022result in difficulties in maintaining an effective internal control environment over an acquired business;\n\u2022increase risks of entering markets in which we have limited prior experience;\n\u2022decrease earnings, revenues or cash flow resulting from dispositions; and\n\u2022increase our expenses and working capital requirements.\nThe process of integrating an acquired business may involve unforeseen costs and delays or other operational, technical and financial difficulties that may require a disproportionate amount of management attention and financial and other resources. Our failure to achieve consolidation savings, to incorporate the acquired businesses and assets into our existing operations successfully or to minimize any unforeseen operational difficulties could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nLikewise, divestitures of assets or businesses involves a number of risks, including the diversion of management's attention, significant costs and expenses, goodwill and other intangible asset impairment charges, the loss of customer relationships and cash flow, adverse impact on any remaining business and our stock price, and disruption of operations in the affected business. Failure to timely complete or consummate a divestiture may negatively affect valuation of the affected business or result in incremental costs and restructuring charges. In the event an unsuccessful acquisition or divestiture, our competitive position, revenues, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOur business, operations and profitability could be adversely affected as the result of acts of God, natural disasters, pandemics, and/or endemics, political unrest and conflict and other catastrophic events beyond our control, in particular if one or more of our distribution facilities were interrupted or shut down.\nOur operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our distribution facilities, client service centers, computer and telecommunications equipment and software systems against interruption, damage and failures. Our business operations as a whole are subject to serious disruptions, interruption and possible cessation of services by acts of God, natural disasters, fire, tornado, flood, power shortages, political unrest, conflict or war, terrorism, strikes, pandemics and endemics (including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic), equipment malfunctions, system failures and other events beyond our control. These risks beyond our control could result in macroeconomic changes affecting not only us but also our clients and their operations, especially due to changing and divergent views and rising political tensions and conflicts, which may result in adverse and volatile market conditions that may cause a decline in our revenue and increase our costs of operations and negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition as a whole. Additionally, such risks could also adversely affect our relationship with our clients and we may lose these clients and our ability to attract new clients may be adversely affected.\nAlthough we maintain crisis management and disaster response plans, such events could make it difficult or impossible to support our operations or substantially disrupt our ability for us to deliver our services to our clients, which may be due to (i) the inability of personnel to come to work to perform services, (ii) personnel being incapacitated to work, (iii) third party vendors and suppliers inability to provide materials and/or services required for us to perform our services and/or (iv) a shutdown from a government mandate or local or national threat, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we could incur significantly higher costs during the time it takes for us to reopen or replace any one or more of our facilities, personnel, vendors and/ supplier services which may or may not be reimbursed by insurance.\nThe global coronavirus pandemic and any new strains of the virus could harm our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has had and continues to cause general business disruption worldwide.\nAcross our business, we have implemented and continue several key measures to prioritize our employees\u2019 health and safety in response to the pandemic. We majority of our contact center workforce remains in a work-from-home model, and in our distribution centers continue to implement and adhere to CDC and global health regulations and guidelines and recommended practices, including controlled entry points, providing personal protective equipment for our teams, and mobile cleaning stations. We also have maintained enhanced sanitation criteria for daily and nightly cleaning and social distancing practices.\nWhile the COVID-19 pandemic has not had a material adverse impact on our operations to date, it is difficult to predict the extent of the potential economic impact, particularly in light of the continuing effects of COVID-19. The continuing economic impact may cause disruptions and severely impact our business or that of our clients as we continue to move through the fiscal year, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022adversely affecting new client wins and the anticipated launch dates of new projects;\n\u2022reduced availability and productivity of our employees due to illness, quarantines, absenteeism, government actions, travel restrictions or other restrictions in connection with the pandemic;\n\u2022disruption to our or our client\u2019s supply chain and the procurement of products and ability to fulfill orders due to disruptions in our distribution centers;\n\u2022increased operational risks as a result of remote work arrangements, including the potential effects on internal controls, as well as cybersecurity risks and increased vulnerability to security breaches, information technology disruptions and other similar events;\n\u2022increased costs, including increased labor costs, procurement of equipment to move personnel into a work-from-home model, personal protective equipment and increased and enhanced cleaning services; and\n\u2022continued volatility in market prices for our securities.\nTo the extent the duration of any of these conditions extends for a prolonged period of time, any adverse impact may be more severe. Such matters could impact future revenues and the Company\u2019s asset values, including goodwill and intangible assets. We expect to face difficulty predicting our internal financial forecasts as a result of the various continuing unknown factors resulting from the pandemic, including government actions or mandates, restrictions on or changes to clients\u2019 operations and business decisions and our supplier and vendor\u2019s ability to continue operations and/or provide timely services and goods.\nOur insurance policies may not fully cover all losses we may incur.\nAlthough we attempt to limit our liability for damages arising from negligent acts, errors or omissions through contractual provisions, the limitations of liability included in our contracts may not fully protect us from liability or damages and may not be enforceable in all instances. In addition, not all of our contracts may limit our exposure for certain liabilities, such as data security claims or claims of third parties for which we may be required to indemnify our clients. Although we have general liability and errors and omissions insurance coverage, this coverage may not continue to be available on terms reasonable to us or in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims, and our insurers may disclaim coverage as to any future claim. The successful assertion of one or more large claims against us that are excluded from our insurance coverage or that exceed our\navailable insurance coverage, or changes in our insurance policies (including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements), could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.", "PERMNO": 87510, "SIC": 7374, "TIC": "PFSW"}
