{"cik": "1733413", "company": "TFF Pharmaceuticals, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-10", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Before purchasing our common stock, you should read and consider carefully the following risk factors as well as all other information contained in this report, including our financial statements and the related notes. Each of these risk factors, either alone or taken together, could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition, as well as adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock. There may be additional risks that we do not presently know of or that we currently believe are immaterial, which could also impair our business and financial position. If any of the events described below were to occur, our financial condition, our ability to access capital resources, our results of operations and/or our future growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected and the market price of our common stock could decline. As a result, you could lose some or all of any investment you may make in our common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe are a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company with limited operating history. We are a biopharmaceutical company, newly-formed in January 2018, and have limited operating history. We have not commenced revenue-producing operations. In November 2019, we initiated Phase I human clinical trials for our TFF VIP product candidate and in June 2020, we initiated Phase I human clinical trials for our TFF TIP product candidate, however, to date, our operations have otherwise consisted of preliminary research and development, drug formulation and characterization and testing of our initial product candidates. Our limited operating history makes it difficult for potential investors to evaluate our technology or prospective operations. As a development stage biopharmaceutical company, we are subject to all the risks inherent in the organization, financing, expenditures, complications and delays involved with a new business. Accordingly, you should consider our prospects in light of the costs, uncertainties, delays and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in the early stages of development, especially clinical-stage biopharmaceutical companies such as ours. Potential investors should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties that a company with a limited operating history will face. In particular, potential investors should consider that we may be unable to:\n\u25cf successfully implement or execute our business plan, or ensure that our business plan is sound;\n\u25cf successfully complete pre-clinical and clinical trials and obtain regulatory approval for the marketing of our product candidates;\n\u25cf successfully demonstrate a favorable differentiation between our dry powder candidates and the current products on the market;\n\u25cf successfully contract for the manufacture of our clinical drug products and establish a commercial drug supply;\n\u25cf secure market exclusivity and/or adequate intellectual property protection for our product candidates;\n\u25cf attract and retain an experienced management and advisory team; and\n\u25cf raise sufficient funds in the capital markets to effectuate our business plan, including product and clinical development, regulatory approval and commercialization for our product candidates.\nInvestors should evaluate an investment in us in light of the uncertainties encountered by developing companies in a competitive environment. There can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful or that we will ultimately be able to attain profitability. If we cannot successfully execute any one of the foregoing, our business may not succeed and your investment will be adversely affected. You must be prepared to lose all of your investment.\nWe have a history of significant operating losses and anticipate continued operating losses for the foreseeable future. For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we incurred a net loss applicable to common stockholders of $18.6 million and $36.7 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $34.3 million. We expect to continue to incur substantial expenses without any corresponding revenues unless and until we are able to obtain regulatory approval and successfully commercialize at least one of our product candidates. However, there can be no assurance we will be able to obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates. Even if we are able to obtain regulatory approval and subsequently commercialize our product candidates, there can be no assurance that we will generate significant revenues or ever achieve profitability.\nWe expect to have significant research, regulatory and development expenses as we advance our product candidates towards commercialization. As a result, we expect to incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future, and these losses will be increasing. We are uncertain when or if we will be able to achieve or sustain profitability. If we achieve profitability in the future, we may not be able to sustain profitability in subsequent periods. Failure to become and remain profitable may impair our ability to sustain operations and adversely affect our business and our ability to raise capital. If we are unable to generate positive cash flow within a reasonable period of time, we may be unable to further pursue our business plan or continue operations, in which case you may lose your entire investment.\nWe expect we will need additional financing to execute our business plan and fund operations, which additional financing may not be available on reasonable terms or at all. As of December 31, 2020, we had total assets of approximately $38.7 million and working capital of approximately $36.2 million. As of December 31, 2020, our liquidity included approximately $35.3 million of cash and cash equivalents. We believe that our cash on-hand as of the date of this report is sufficient to fund our proposed operating plan for, at least, the 12 months following the date of this report. However, as of the date of this report, we believe that we will need additional capital to fund our operations through to the marketing approval for TFF VIP and TFF TIP, assuming such approval can be obtained at all, and to engage in the substantial development of any other of our drug candidates, such as formulation, early stage animal testing and formal toxicology studies. We intend to seek additional funds through various financing sources, including the sale of our equity and debt securities, licensing fees for our technology and co-development and joint ventures with industry partners, with a preference towards licensing fees for our technology and co-development and joint ventures with industry partners. In addition, we will consider alternatives to our current business plan that may enable to us to achieve revenue producing operations and meaningful commercial success with a smaller amount of capital. However, there can be no guarantees that such funds will be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If such financing is not available on satisfactory terms, we may be unable to further pursue our business plan and we may be unable to continue operations, in which case you may lose your entire investment.\nOur business model is entirely dependent on certain patent rights licensed to us from the University of Texas at Austin, and the loss of those license rights would, in all likelihood, cause our business, as presently contemplated, to fail. In July 2015, the University of Texas at Austin, or UT, granted to our former parent, LTI, an exclusive worldwide, royalty bearing license to the patent rights for the TFF platform in all fields of use, other than vaccines. In March 2018, LTI assigned to us all of its interest to the TFF platform, including the patent license agreement with UT. In November 2018, we and UT amended the patent license agreement such that our exclusive patent rights to the TFF platform were expanded to all fields of use. Our current business model, which focuses exclusively on the development of drugs using the TFF technology, is based entirely on the availability of the patent rights licensed to us by UT under the patent license agreement. The patent license agreement requires us to pay royalties and milestone payments and conform to a variety of covenants and agreements, and in the event of our breach of the agreement, UT may elect to terminate the agreement. As of the date of this report, we believe we are in compliance with the patent license agreement and consider our relationship with UT to be excellent. However, in the event of our breach of the patent license agreement for any reason, and our inability to cure such breach within any cure period or obtain a waiver from UT, we could lose the patent license agreement, which would result in our loss of all rights to the TFF technology.\nOur business may be adversely affected by the recent COVID-19 outbreak. In December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, COVID-19, was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China. In January 2020, this coronavirus spread to other countries, including the United States, and efforts to contain the spread of COVID-19 have intensified. At this time, the United States and certain other countries are the subject of lock-downs and self-isolation procedures, which have significantly limited business operations and restricted internal and external meetings. We had expected to commence Phase 1 clinical trials our TFF formulation of Tacrolimus, or TFF TIP, in Australia in the first quarter of 2020, and on March 13, 2020 we had received the approval of the Australian Human Research Ethics Committee to commence Phase 1 trials. However, later in March 2020, our contract research organization partner in Australia informed us that because of the spread of the COVID-19 virus in Australia, there would be a delay in initiating the trials. One contributing factor is that Tacrolimus is an immunosuppressant drug and, given the threat of the COVID-19 virus, we were concerned that even though we would be dosing healthy volunteers the inhalation of an immunosuppressant could increase the risk of severe complications if a volunteer was to contract COVID-19. In June 2020, we were able to begin dosing in the Phase I trial our TFF TIP in Melbourne, however, in July 2020, due to the resurgence of COVID-19 in the Melbourne area, the Phase I trials were delayed. With the flaring of COVID-19 in the Melbourne area and in order to remain dynamic, a second clinical trial site in Brisbane, Queensland, Australia was opened and we resumed dosing in the Phase I clinical trials during the third quarter of 2020. Further, the outbreak and any preventative or protective actions that we or our customers may take in respect of COVID-19 may result in a period of disruption to other work in progress. Our customers\u2019 businesses could be disrupted, and our future costs and potential revenues and technology evaluations could be negatively affected. Any resulting financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time but may materially affect our business and financial condition. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and the actions to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact, among others.\nWe currently have no sales and marketing organization. If we are unable to establish satisfactory sales and marketing capabilities or secure a third-party sales and marketing relationship, we may not be able to successfully commercialize any of our product candidates. At present, we have no sales or marketing personnel. Upon and subject to initial receipt of the requisite regulatory approvals for one or more of our drug products, we intend to commercialize our drug products through a combination of our internal direct sales force, third-party marketing and distribution relationships. In some cases, such as involving the development of combination drugs or the development of dry powder formulations of patented drugs, we intend to pursue the licensing of our TFF technology or enter into a joint development arrangement. If we are not successful in recruiting sales and marketing personnel and building a sales and marketing infrastructure or entering into appropriate collaboration arrangements with third parties, we will have difficulty successfully commercializing our product candidates, which would adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nEven if we enter into third-party marketing and distribution arrangements, we may have limited or no control over the sales, marketing and distribution activities of these third parties. Our future revenues may depend heavily on the success of the efforts of these third parties. In terms of establishing a sales and marketing infrastructure, we will have to compete with established and well-funded pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to recruit, hire, train and retain sales and marketing personnel. Factors that may inhibit our efforts to build an internal sales organization or enter into collaboration arrangements with third parties include:\n\u25cf our inability to recruit and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel;\n\u25cf the inability of sales personnel to obtain access to or persuade adequate numbers of physicians to prescribe any of our product candidates;\n\u25cf the lack of complementary products to be offered by sales personnel, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies with more extensive product lines; and\n\u25cf unforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating an internal sales and marketing organization.\nWe will be completely dependent on third parties to manufacture our product candidates, and the commercialization of our product candidates could be halted, delayed or made less profitable if those third parties fail to obtain manufacturing approval from the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities fail to provide us with sufficient quantities of our product candidates or fail to do so at acceptable quality levels or prices. We do not currently have, nor do we plan to acquire, the capability or infrastructure to manufacture our drug candidates for use in our clinical trials or for commercial sales, if any. As a result, we will be obligated to rely on contract manufacturers, if and when any of our product candidates are approved for commercialization. We have entered into short-term contract manufacturing agreements with IriSys, Inc. and CoreRx, Inc. for their provision of certain product testing, development and clinical manufacturing services for our TFF VIP and TFF TIP product candidates, respectively, and we are currently in discussion with several contract manufacturers for the commercial supply of any drug candidates we are able to bring to market. However, we have not entered into agreements with any contract manufacturers for commercial supply and may not be able to engage contract manufacturers for commercial supply of any of our product candidates on favorable terms to us, or at all, should the need arise.\nThe facilities used by our current and future contract manufacturers to manufacture our product candidates must be approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Such approvals are subject to inspections that will be conducted after we submit a New Drug Application, or NDA, or Biologics License Application, or BLA, to the FDA or their equivalents to other relevant regulatory authorities. We will not control the manufacturing process of our product candidates, and will be completely dependent on our contract manufacturing partners for compliance with Current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMPs, for manufacture of both active drug substances and finished drug products. These cGMP regulations cover all aspects of the manufacturing, testing, quality control, storage, distribution and record keeping relating to our product candidates. If our contract manufacturers do not successfully manufacture material that conforms to our specifications and the strict regulatory requirements of the FDA or others, we will not be able to secure or maintain regulatory approval for product made at their manufacturing facilities. If the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority does not approve these facilities for the manufacture of our product candidates or if it withdraws any such approval in the future, we may need to find alternative manufacturing facilities, which would significantly impact our ability to develop, manufacture, obtain regulatory approval for or market our product candidates, if approved. Likewise, we could be negatively impacted if any of our contract manufacturers elect to discontinue their business relationship with us.\nOur contract manufacturers will be subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and corresponding state and foreign agencies for compliance with cGMPs and similar regulatory requirements. We will not have control over our contract manufacturers\u2019 compliance with these regulations and standards. Failure by any of our contract manufacturers to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, failure to grant approval to market any of our product candidates, delays, suspensions or withdrawals of approvals, inability to supply product, operating restrictions and criminal prosecutions, any of which could significantly and adversely affect our business. In addition, we will not have control over the ability of our contract manufacturers to maintain adequate quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel. Failure by our contract manufacturers to comply with or maintain any of these standards could adversely affect our ability to develop, manufacture, obtain regulatory approval for or market any of our product candidates, if approved.\nIf, for any reason, these third parties are unable or unwilling to perform we may not be able to locate alternative manufacturers or formulators or enter into favorable agreements with them and we cannot be certain that any such third parties will have the manufacturing capacity to meet future requirements. If these manufacturers or any alternate manufacturer of finished drug product experiences any significant difficulties in its respective manufacturing processes for our active pharmaceutical ingredients, or APIs, or finished products or should cease doing business with us for any reason, we could experience significant interruptions in the supply of any of our product candidates or may not be able to create a supply of our product candidates at all. Were we to encounter manufacturing difficulties, our ability to produce a sufficient supply of any of our product candidates might be negatively affected. Our inability to coordinate the efforts of our third-party manufacturing partners, or the lack of capacity available at our third-party manufacturing partners, could impair our ability to supply any of our product candidates at required levels. Because of the significant regulatory requirements that we would need to satisfy in order to qualify a new bulk drug substance or finished product manufacturer, if we face these or other difficulties with our then current manufacturing partners, we could experience significant interruptions in the supply of any of our product candidates if we decided to transfer the manufacture of any of our product candidates to one or more alternative manufacturers in an effort to deal with such difficulties.\nAny manufacturing problem or the loss of a contract manufacturer could be disruptive to our operations and result in development delays and lost sales. Additionally, we will rely on third parties to supply the raw materials needed to manufacture our product candidates. Any such reliance on suppliers may involve several risks, including a potential inability to obtain critical materials and reduced control over production costs, delivery schedules, reliability and quality. Any unanticipated disruption to the operation of one of our contract manufacturers caused by problems with suppliers could delay shipment of any of our product candidates, increase our cost of goods sold and result in lost sales.\nIf product liability lawsuits are brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of our product candidates. We will face a potential risk of product liability as a result of the clinical testing of our product candidates and will face an even greater risk of such liability if we commercialize any of our product candidates. For example, we may be sued if any product we develop, including any of our product candidates, or any materials that we use in our product candidates allegedly causes injury or is found to be otherwise unsuitable during product testing, manufacturing, marketing or sale. Any such product liability claims may include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product, negligence, strict liability and a breach of warranties. In the U.S., claims could also be asserted against us under state consumer protection acts. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims, we may incur substantial liabilities or be required to limit commercialization of our product candidates. Even successful defense of these claims would require us to employ significant financial and management resources. Regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u25cf decreased demand for any of our product candidates or any future products that we may develop;\n\u25cf injury to our reputation;\n\u25cf failure to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates;\n\u25cf withdrawal of participants in our clinical trials;\n\u25cf costs associated with our defense of the related litigation;\n\u25cf a diversion of our management\u2019s time and our resources;\n\u25cf substantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;\n\u25cf product recalls, withdrawals or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions;\n\u25cf the inability to commercialize some or all of our product candidates; and\n\u25cf a decline in the value of our stock.\nAs of the date of this report, we have procured insurance coverage for our human clinical trials, which we consider adequate for our current level of clinical testing and development, however we do not carry product liability insurance. We intend to obtain product liability insurance at the time we commence commercial sale of our initial product. Our inability to obtain and retain sufficient product liability insurance at an acceptable cost to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of products we develop. Although we will endeavor to obtain and maintain such insurance in coverage amounts we deem adequate, any claim that may be brought against us could result in a court judgment or settlement in an amount that is not covered, in whole or in part, by our insurance or that is in excess of the limits of our insurance coverage. Our insurance policies would also have various exclusions, and we may be subject to a product liability claim for which we have no coverage. As a result, we may have to pay any amounts awarded by a court or negotiated in a settlement that exceed our coverage limitations or that are not covered by our insurance, and we may not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient capital to pay such amounts.\nOur business operations could suffer in the event of information technology systems\u2019 failures or security breaches. While we believe that we have implemented adequate security measures within our internal information technology and networking systems, our information technology systems may be subject to security breaches, damages from computer viruses, natural disasters, terrorism, and telecommunication failures. Any system failure or security breach could cause interruptions in our operations in addition to the possibility of losing proprietary information and trade secrets. To the extent that any disruption or security breach results in inappropriate disclosure of our confidential information, our competitive position may be adversely affected and we may incur liability or additional costs to remedy the damages caused by these disruptions or security breaches.\nSales of counterfeit versions of our product candidates, as well as unauthorized sales of our product candidates, may have adverse effects on our revenues, business, results of operations and damage our brand and reputation. Our product candidates may become subject to competition from counterfeit pharmaceutical products, which are pharmaceutical products sold under the same or very similar brand names and/or having a similar appearance to genuine products, but which are sold without proper licenses or approvals. Such products divert sales from genuine products, often are of lower cost and quality (having different ingredients or formulations, for example), and have the potential to damage the reputation for quality and effectiveness of the genuine product. Obtaining regulatory approval for our product candidates is a complex and lengthy process. If during the period while the regulatory approval is pending illegal sales of counterfeit products begin, consumers may buy such counterfeit products, which could have an adverse impact on our revenues, business and results of operations. In addition, if illegal sales of counterfeits result in adverse side effects to consumers, we may be associated with any negative publicity resulting from such incidents. Although pharmaceutical regulation, control and enforcement systems throughout the world have been increasingly active in policing counterfeit pharmaceuticals, we may not be able to prevent third parties from manufacturing, selling or purporting to sell counterfeit products competing with our product candidates. Such sales may also be occurring without our knowledge. The existence and any increase in production or sales of counterfeit products or unauthorized sales could negatively impact our revenues, brand reputation, business and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Product Regulation\nOur success is entirely dependent on our ability to obtain the marketing approval for our product candidates by the FDA and the regulatory authorities in foreign jurisdictions in which we intend to market our product candidates, of which there can be no assurance. We are not permitted to market our product candidates as prescription pharmaceutical products in the United States until we receive approval of an NDA from the FDA, or in any foreign countries until we receive the requisite approval from such countries. In the United States, the FDA generally requires the completion of clinical trials of each drug to establish its safety and efficacy and extensive pharmaceutical development to ensure its quality before an NDA is approved. Of the large number of drugs in development, only a small percentage result in the submission of an NDA to the FDA and even fewer are eventually approved for commercialization. As of the date of this report, we have not submitted an NDA to the FDA or comparable applications to other regulatory authorities for any of our product candidates.\nBecause our initial dry powder drug candidates, TFF VIP and TFF TIP, will be established drugs that are off-patent, we believe that our initial drug product candidates will qualify for FDA approval through the FDA\u2019s 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway and in corresponding regulatory paths in other foreign jurisdictions. The 505(b)(2) pathway sometimes does not require clinical trials other than a bioequivalence trial; however, to the extent we claim that our drug product candidates target a new indication or offer improved safety compared to the existing approved products, and it is our present expectation that we will do so in many cases, it is likely that we will be required to conduct additional clinical trials in order to obtain marketing approval. For example, based on separate pre-IND meetings with the FDA concerning TFF VIP and TFF TIP, we believe we will need to conduct Phase I and Phase II studies prior to filing for marketing approval for TFF VIP and Phase I and Phase IIb/IIIa studies prior to filing for marketing approval for TFF TIP. However, there can be no assurance that the FDA will not ask for additional clinical data for either TFF VIP or TFF TIP.\nOur business model is to pursue the development of off-patent drugs for which we would directly pursue the development of a dry powder formulation through the FDA\u2019s 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway; however, not all of our product candidates will target off-patent drugs and, at least in the case of a dry powder formulation of CBD, our product candidate may not be a drug. We do not expect any dry powder formulation of a CBD drug product to be off-patent and our proposed dry powder formulation of aluminum salt vaccines may not be off-patent. We also expect that our dry powder formulation of a CBD drug product will likely require a full NDA through the FDA\u2019s 505(b)(1) regulatory pathway; however, a non-pharmaceutical CBD dry powder formulation may not require FDA approval. We expect that our dry powder formulation of aluminum salt vaccines will require a biological license application, or BLA, which is very similar to a full NDA through the FDA\u2019s 505(b)(1) regulatory pathway.\nOur success depends on our receipt of the regulatory approvals described above, and the issuance of such regulatory approvals is uncertain and subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u25cf the results of toxicology studies may not support the filing of an IND for our product candidates;\n\u25cf the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities or Institutional Review Boards, or IRB, may disagree with the design or implementation of our clinical trials;\n\u25cf we may not be able to provide acceptable evidence of our product candidates\u2019 safety and efficacy;\n\u25cf the results of our clinical trials may not be satisfactory or may not meet the level of statistical or clinical significance required by the FDA, European Medicines Agency, or EMA, or other regulatory agencies for us to receive marketing approval for any of our product candidates;\n\u25cf the dosing of our product candidates in a particular clinical trial may not be at an optimal level;\n\u25cf patients in our clinical trials may suffer adverse effects for reasons that may or may not be related to our product candidates;\n\u25cf the data collected from clinical trials may not be sufficient to support the submission of an NDA, BLA or other submission or to obtain regulatory approval in the United States or elsewhere;\n\u25cf the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may fail to approve the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we contract for clinical and commercial supplies; and\n\u25cf the approval policies or regulations of the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may significantly change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval of our product candidates.\nThe process of obtaining regulatory approvals is expensive, often takes many years, if approval is obtained at all, and can vary substantially based upon, among other things, the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidates involved, the jurisdiction in which regulatory approval is sought and the substantial discretion of the regulatory authorities. Changes in regulatory approval policies during the development period, changes in or the enactment of additional statutes or regulations, or changes in regulatory review for a submitted product application may cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application. Regulatory approval obtained in one jurisdiction does not necessarily mean that a product candidate will receive regulatory approval in all jurisdictions in which we may seek approval, but the failure to obtain approval in one jurisdiction may negatively impact our ability to seek approval in a different jurisdiction. Failure to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates for the foregoing, or any other reasons, will prevent us from commercializing our product candidates, and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired.\nClinical testing is expensive, is difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and is uncertain as to outcome. Our business model depends entirely on the successful development, regulatory approval and commercialization of our product candidates, which may never occur. In November 2019, we initiated Phase I human clinical trials for our TFF VIP product candidate and initiated Phase I human clinical trials for our TFF TIP product candidate in June 2020. However, as of the date of this report, we have not otherwise progressed any of our product candidates beyond performance characterization and animal testing. We may not be successful in obtaining approval from the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities to start clinical trials for any other of our product candidates. If we do not obtain such approvals as presently planned, the time in which we expect to commence clinical programs for any product candidate will be extended and such extension will increase our expenses, delay our potential receipt of any revenues, and increase our need for additional capital. Moreover, there is no guarantee that we will receive approval to commence human clinical trials or, if we do receive approval, that our clinical trials will be successful or that we will continue clinical development in support of an approval from the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities for any indication. We note that most product candidates never reach the clinical development stage and even those that do commence clinical development have only a small chance of successfully completing clinical development and gaining regulatory approval. Success in early phases of pre-clinical and clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful, and interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results. A failure of one or more of our clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing. We may experience numerous unforeseen events during, or as a result of, the clinical trial process that could delay or prevent our ability to receive regulatory approval or commercialize our product candidates. Therefore, our business currently depends entirely on the successful development, regulatory approval and commercialization of our product candidates, which may never occur.\nEven if we receive regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we may not be able to successfully commercialize the product and the revenue that we generate from its sales, if any, may be limited. If approved for marketing, the commercial success of our product candidates will depend upon each product\u2019s acceptance by the medical community, including physicians, patients and health care payors. The degree of market acceptance for any of our product candidates will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf demonstration of clinical safety and efficacy;\n\u25cf relative convenience, dosing burden and ease of administration;\n\u25cf the prevalence and severity of any adverse effects;\n\u25cf the willingness of physicians to prescribe our product candidates, and the target patient population to try new therapies;\n\u25cf efficacy of our product candidates compared to competing products;\n\u25cf the introduction of any new products that may in the future become available targeting indications for which our product candidates may be approved;\n\u25cf new procedures or therapies that may reduce the incidences of any of the indications in which our product candidates may show utility;\n\u25cf pricing and cost-effectiveness;\n\u25cf the inclusion or omission of our product candidates in applicable therapeutic and vaccine guidelines;\n\u25cf the effectiveness of our own or any future collaborators\u2019 sales and marketing strategies;\n\u25cf limitations or warnings contained in approved labeling from regulatory authorities;\n\u25cf our ability to obtain and maintain sufficient third-party coverage or reimbursement from government health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, private health insurers and other third-party payors or to receive the necessary pricing approvals from government bodies regulating the pricing and usage of therapeutics; and\n\u25cf the willingness of patients to pay out-of-pocket in the absence of third-party coverage or reimbursement or government pricing approvals.\nIf any of our product candidates are approved, but do not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, health care payors, and patients, we may not generate sufficient revenue and we may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability. Our efforts to educate the medical community and third-party payors on the benefits of our product candidates may require significant resources and may never be successful.\nIn addition, even if we obtain regulatory approvals, the timing or scope of any approvals may prohibit or reduce our ability to commercialize our product candidates successfully. For example, if the approval process takes too long, we may miss market opportunities and give other companies the ability to develop competing products or establish market dominance. Any regulatory approval we ultimately obtain may be limited or subject to restrictions or post-approval commitments that render our product candidates not commercially viable. For example, regulatory authorities may approve any of our product candidates for fewer or more limited indications than we request, may not approve the price we intend to charge for any of our product candidates, may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly post-marketing clinical trials, or may approve any of our product candidates with a label that does not include the labeling claims necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of that indication. Further, the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may place conditions on approvals or require risk management plans or a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy, or REMS, to assure the safe use of the drug. Moreover, product approvals may be withdrawn for non-compliance with regulatory standards or if problems occur following the initial marketing of the product. Any of the foregoing scenarios could materially harm the commercial success of our product candidates.\nEven if we obtain marketing approval for any of our product candidates, we will be subject to ongoing obligations and continued regulatory review, which may result in significant additional expense. Additionally, our product candidates could be subject to labeling and other restrictions and withdrawal from the market and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we experience unanticipated problems with our product candidates. Even if we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates for an indication, the FDA or foreign equivalent may still impose significant restrictions on their indicated uses or marketing or the conditions of approval, or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly and time-consuming post-approval studies, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and post-market surveillance to monitor safety and efficacy. Our product candidates will also be subject to ongoing regulatory requirements governing the manufacturing, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, safety surveillance, advertising, promotion, recordkeeping and reporting of adverse events and other post-market information. These requirements include registration with the FDA, as well as continued compliance with current Good Clinical Practices regulations, or cGCPs, for any clinical trials that we conduct post-approval. In addition, manufacturers of drug products and their facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with current cGMPs, requirements relating to quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents.\nThe FDA has the authority to require a REMS as part of an NDA or after approval, which may impose further requirements or restrictions on the distribution or use of an approved drug, such as limiting prescribing to certain physicians or medical centers that have undergone specialized training, limiting treatment to patients who meet certain safe-use criteria or requiring patient testing, monitoring and/or enrollment in a registry.\nWith respect to sales and marketing activities related to our product candidates, advertising and promotional materials must comply with FDA rules in addition to other applicable federal, state and local laws in the United States and similar legal requirements in other countries. In the United States, the distribution of product samples to physicians must comply with the requirements of the U.S. Prescription Drug Marketing Act. Application holders must obtain FDA approval for product and manufacturing changes, depending on the nature of the change. We may also be subject, directly or indirectly through our customers and partners, to various fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the U.S. Anti-Kickback Statute, U.S. False Claims Act, and similar state laws, which impact, among other things, our proposed sales, marketing, and scientific/educational grant programs. If we participate in the U.S. Medicaid Drug Rebate Program, the Federal Supply Schedule of the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, or other government drug programs, we will be subject to complex laws and regulations regarding reporting and payment obligations. All of these activities are also potentially subject to U.S. federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws. Similar requirements exist in many of these areas in other countries.\nIn addition, if any of our product candidates are approved for a particular indication, our product labeling, advertising and promotion would be subject to regulatory requirements and continuing regulatory review. The FDA strictly regulates the promotional claims that may be made about prescription products. In particular, a product may not be promoted for uses that are not approved by the FDA as reflected in the product\u2019s approved labeling. If we receive marketing approval for our product candidates, physicians may nevertheless legally prescribe our products to their patients in a manner that is inconsistent with the approved label. If we are found to have promoted such off-label uses, we may become subject to significant liability and government fines. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses, and a company that is found to have improperly promoted off-label uses may be subject to significant sanctions. The federal government has levied large civil and criminal fines against companies for alleged improper promotion and has enjoined several companies from engaging in off-label promotion. The FDA has also requested that companies enter into consent decrees of permanent injunctions under which specified promotional conduct is changed or curtailed.\nIf we or a regulatory agency discover previously unknown problems with a product candidate, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, or we or our manufacturers fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, we may be subject to the following administrative or judicial sanctions:\n\u25cf restrictions on the marketing or manufacturing of the product, withdrawal of the product from the market, or voluntary or mandatory product recalls;\n\u25cf issuance of warning letters or untitled letters;\n\u25cf clinical holds;\n\u25cf injunctions or the imposition of civil or criminal penalties or monetary fines;\n\u25cf suspension or withdrawal of regulatory approval;\n\u25cf suspension of any ongoing clinical trials;\n\u25cf refusal to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us, or suspension or revocation of product license approvals;\n\u25cf suspension or imposition of restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements; or\n\u25cf product seizure or detention or refusal to permit the import or export of product.\nThe occurrence of any event or penalty described above may inhibit our ability to commercialize our product candidates and generate revenue. Adverse regulatory action, whether pre- or post-approval, can also potentially lead to product liability claims and increase our product liability exposure.\nObtaining and maintaining regulatory approval of our product candidates in one jurisdiction does not mean that we will be successful in obtaining regulatory approval of our product candidates in other jurisdictions. Obtaining and maintaining regulatory approval of our product candidates in one jurisdiction does not guarantee that we will be able to obtain or maintain regulatory approval in any other jurisdiction, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one jurisdiction may have a negative effect on the regulatory approval process in others. For example, even if the FDA grants marketing approval of a product candidate, comparable regulatory authorities in foreign jurisdictions must also approve the manufacturing, marketing and promotion of the product candidate in those countries. Approval procedures vary among jurisdictions and can involve requirements and administrative review periods different from those in the United States, including additional preclinical studies or clinical trials, as clinical studies conducted in one jurisdiction may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions. In many jurisdictions outside the United States, a product candidate must be approved for reimbursement before it can be approved for sale in that jurisdiction. In some cases, the price that we intend to charge for our products is also subject to approval.\nObtaining foreign regulatory approvals and compliance with foreign regulatory requirements could result in significant delays, difficulties and costs for us and could delay or prevent the introduction of our product candidates in certain countries. If we fail to comply with the regulatory requirements in international markets and/ or to receive applicable marketing approvals, our target market will be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of our product candidates will be harmed.\nEven though we may apply for orphan drug designation for a product candidate, we may not be able to obtain orphan drug marketing exclusivity. We believe that in some cases our dry powder drug products may qualify for the FDA\u2019s orphan drug status. There is no guarantee that the FDA will grant any future application for orphan drug designation for any of our product candidates, which would make us ineligible for the additional exclusivity and other benefits of orphan drug designation.\nUnder the Orphan Drug Act, the FDA may grant orphan drug designation to a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally a disease or condition that affects fewer than 200,000 individuals in the United States and for which there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing and making a drug available in the United States for this type of disease or condition will be recovered from sales of the product. Orphan drug designation must be requested before submitting an NDA. After the FDA grants orphan drug designation, the identity of the therapeutic agent and its potential orphan use are disclosed publicly by the FDA. Orphan product designation does not convey any advantage in or shorten the duration of regulatory review and approval process. In addition to the potential period of exclusivity, orphan designation makes a company eligible for grant funding of up to $400,000 per year for four years to defray costs of clinical trial expenses, tax credits for clinical research expenses and potential exemption from the FDA application user fee.\nIf a product that has orphan designation subsequently receives the first FDA approval for the disease or condition for which it has such designation, the product is entitled to orphan drug exclusivity, which means the FDA may not approve any other applications to market the same drug for the same indication for seven years, except in limited circumstances, such as (i) the drug\u2019s orphan designation is revoked; (ii) its marketing approval is withdrawn; (iii) the orphan exclusivity holder consents to the approval of another applicant\u2019s product; (iv) the orphan exclusivity holder is unable to assure the availability of a sufficient quantity of drug; or (v) a showing of clinical superiority to the product with orphan exclusivity by a competitor product. If a drug designated as an orphan product receives marketing approval for an indication broader than what is designated, it may not be entitled to orphan drug exclusivity. There can be no assurance that we will receive orphan drug designation for any of our product candidates in the indications for which we think they might qualify, if we elect to seek such applications.\nCurrent and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for us to obtain marketing approval of and commercialize our product candidates and affect the prices we may obtain. In the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval for our product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell our product candidates. Legislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products. We do not know whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether the FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals of our product candidates, if any, may be. In addition, increased scrutiny by the U.S. Congress of the FDA\u2019s approval process may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval, as well as subject us to more stringent product labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements.\nIn the United States, the Medicare Modernization Act, or MMA, changed the way Medicare covers and pays for pharmaceutical products. The legislation expanded Medicare coverage for drug purchases by the elderly and introduced a new reimbursement methodology based on average sales prices for drugs. In addition, this legislation authorized Medicare Part D prescription drug plans to use formularies where they can limit the number of drugs that will be covered in any therapeutic class. As a result of this legislation and the expansion of federal coverage of drug products, we expect that there will be additional pressure to contain and reduce costs. These cost reduction initiatives and other provisions of this legislation could decrease the coverage and price that we receive for our product candidates and could seriously harm our business. While the MMA applies only to drug benefits for Medicare beneficiaries, private payors often follow Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates, and any reduction in reimbursement that results from the MMA may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors.\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 or, collectively, the Health Care Reform Law, is a sweeping law intended to broaden access to health insurance, reduce or constrain the growth of healthcare spending, enhance remedies against fraud and abuse, add new transparency requirements for healthcare and health insurance industries, impose new taxes and fees on the health industry and impose additional health policy reforms. The Health Care Reform Law revised the definition of \u201caverage manufacturer price\u201d for reporting purposes, which could increase the amount of Medicaid drug rebates to states. Further, the law imposed a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug products.\nThe Health Care Reform Law remains subject to legislative efforts to repeal, modify or delay the implementation of the law. If the Health Care Reform Law is repealed or modified, or if implementation of certain aspects of the Health Care Reform Law are delayed, such repeal, modification or delay may materially adversely impact our business, strategies, prospects, operating results or financial condition. We are unable to predict the full impact of any repeal, modification or delay in the implementation of the Health Care Reform Law on us at this time. Due to the substantial regulatory changes that will need to be implemented by Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, and others, and the numerous processes required to implement these reforms, we cannot predict which healthcare initiatives will be implemented at the federal or state level, the timing of any such reforms, or the effect such reforms or any other future legislation or regulation will have on our business.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Health Care Reform Law was enacted. We expect that additional federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, and in turn could significantly reduce the projected value of certain development projects and reduce or eliminate our profitability.\nAny termination or suspension of, or delays in the commencement or completion of, any necessary studies of any of our product candidates for any indications could result in increased costs to us, delay or limit our ability to generate revenue and adversely affect our commercial prospects. The commencement and completion of clinical studies can be delayed for a number of reasons, including delays related to:\n\u25cf the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority failing to grant permission to proceed and placing the clinical study on hold;\n\u25cf subjects for clinical testing failing to enroll or remain enrolled in our trials at the rate we expect;\n\u25cf a facility manufacturing any of our product candidates being ordered by the FDA or other government or regulatory authorities to temporarily or permanently shut down due to violations of cGMP requirements or other applicable requirements, or cross-contaminations of product candidates in the manufacturing process;\n\u25cf any changes to our manufacturing process that may be necessary or desired;\n\u25cf subjects choosing an alternative treatment for the indications for which we are developing our product candidates, or participating in competing clinical studies;\n\u25cf subjects experiencing severe or unexpected drug-related adverse effects;\n\u25cf reports from clinical testing on similar technologies and products raising safety and/or efficacy concerns;\n\u25cf third-party clinical investigators losing their license or permits necessary to perform our clinical trials, not performing our clinical trials on our anticipated schedule or employing methods consistent with the clinical trial protocol, cGMP requirements, or other third parties not performing data collection and analysis in a timely or accurate manner;\n\u25cf inspections of clinical study sites by the FDA, comparable foreign regulatory authorities, or IRBs finding regulatory violations that require us to undertake corrective action, result in suspension or termination of one or more sites or the imposition of a clinical hold on the entire study, or that prohibit us from using some or all of the data in support of our marketing applications;\n\u25cf third-party contractors becoming debarred or suspended or otherwise penalized by the FDA or other government or regulatory authorities for violations of regulatory requirements, in which case we may need to find a substitute contractor, and we may not be able to use some or any of the data produced by such contractors in support of our marketing applications;\n\u25cf one or more IRBs refusing to approve, suspending or terminating the study at an investigational site, precluding enrollment of additional subjects, or withdrawing its approval of the trial; reaching agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations, or CROs, and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;\n\u25cf deviations of the clinical sites from trial protocols or dropping out of a trial;\n\u25cf adding new clinical trial sites;\n\u25cf the inability of the CRO to execute any clinical trials for any reason; and\n\u25cf government or regulatory delays or \u201cclinical holds\u201d requiring suspension or termination of a trial.\nProduct development costs for any of our product candidates will increase if we have delays in testing or approval or if we need to perform more or larger clinical studies than planned. Additionally, changes in regulatory requirements and policies may occur and we may need to amend study protocols to reflect these changes. Amendments may require us to resubmit our study protocols to the FDA, comparable foreign regulatory authorities, and IRBs for reexamination, which may impact the costs, timing or successful completion of that study. If we experience delays in completion of, or if we, the FDA or other regulatory authorities, the IRB, or other reviewing entities, or any of our clinical study sites suspend or terminate any of our clinical studies of any of our product candidates, its commercial prospects may be materially harmed and our ability to generate product revenues will be delayed. Any delays in completing our clinical trials will increase our costs, slow down our development and approval process and jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenues. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, financial condition and prospects significantly. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, termination or suspension of, or a delay in the commencement or completion of, clinical studies may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval of our product candidates. In addition, if one or more clinical studies are delayed, our competitors may be able to bring competing products to market before we do, and the commercial viability of any of our affected product candidates could be significantly reduced.\nThird-party coverage and reimbursement and health care cost containment initiatives and treatment guidelines may constrain our future revenues. Our ability to successfully market our product candidates will depend in part on the level of reimbursement that government health administration authorities, private health coverage insurers and other organizations provide for the cost of our product candidates and related treatments. Countries in which any of our product candidates are sold through reimbursement schemes under national health insurance programs frequently require that manufacturers and sellers of pharmaceutical products obtain governmental approval of initial prices and any subsequent price increases. In certain countries, including the United States, government-funded and private medical care plans can exert significant indirect pressure on prices. We may not be able to sell our product candidates profitably if adequate prices are not approved or coverage and reimbursement is unavailable or limited in scope. Increasingly, third-party payors attempt to contain health care costs in ways that are likely to impact our development of products including:\n\u25cf failing to approve or challenging the prices charged for health care products;\n\u25cf introducing reimportation schemes from lower priced jurisdictions;\n\u25cf limiting both coverage and the amount of reimbursement for new therapeutic products;\n\u25cf denying or limiting coverage for products that are approved by the regulatory agencies but are considered to be experimental or investigational by third-party payors; and\n\u25cf refusing to provide coverage when an approved product is used in a way that has not received regulatory marketing approval.\nAny product candidates we develop that incorporate CBD will be subject to U.S. controlled substance laws and regulations and failure to comply with these laws and regulations, or the cost of compliance with these laws and regulations, may adversely affect the results of our business operations, both during clinical development and post approval, and our financial condition. We believe that our TFF platform could be used to formulate a dry powder version of cannabidiol, or CBD, and we are in the early stages of developing a dry powder form of CBD. CBD is a controlled substance as defined in the federal Controlled Substances Act of 1970, or CSA. Controlled substances are subject to a high degree of regulation under the CSA, which establishes, among other things, certain registration, manufacturing quotas, security, recordkeeping, reporting, import, export and other requirements administered by the federal Drug Enforcement Agency, or DEA. The DEA classifies controlled substances into five schedules: Schedule I, II, III, IV or V substances. Schedule I substances by definition have a high potential for abuse, have no currently \u201caccepted medical use\u201d in the United States, lack accepted safety for use under medical supervision, and may not be prescribed, marketed or sold in the United States. Pharmaceutical products approved for use in the United States may be listed as Schedule II, III, IV or V, with Schedule II substances considered to present the highest potential for abuse or dependence and Schedule V substances the lowest relative risk of abuse among such substances. Schedule I and II drugs are subject to the strictest controls under the CSA, including manufacturing and procurement quotas, security requirements and criteria for importation. In addition, dispensing of Schedule II drugs is further restricted. For example, they may not be refilled without a new prescription.\nWhile cannabis and certain of its derivatives, including CBD, are Schedule I controlled substances, products approved for medical use in the United States that contain cannabis or cannabis extracts must be placed in Schedules II through V, since approval by the FDA satisfies the \u201caccepted medical use\u201d requirement. In 2018, the FDA approved Epidiolex, a sesame oil oral solution of CBD, and the DEA scheduled Epidiolex to Schedule V. To our knowledge, Epidiolex is the only CBD-based drug to have received FDA marketing approval. If we are able to develop a CBD-based dry powder drug candidate, and the FDA provides market approval for such drug candidate, of which there can be no assurance, the DEA will make a scheduling determination and place our dry powder CBD-based drug candidate in a schedule other than Schedule I in order for it to be prescribed to patients in the United States. If we are able to develop a CBD-based dry powder drug candidate, we would be able to favorably cite Epidiolex for purposes of DEA scheduling; however, there can be no assurance that any CBD-based drug candidate we develop will be listed by the DEA as a Schedule V controlled substance. Furthermore, if the FDA, DEA or any foreign regulatory authority determines that any of our CBD-based drug candidates may have potential for abuse, it may require us to generate more clinical data than would otherwise be required, which could increase the cost or delay the launch of such drug candidate.\nFacilities conducting research, manufacturing, distributing, importing or exporting, or dispensing controlled substances must be registered (licensed) to perform these activities and have the security, control, recordkeeping, reporting and inventory mechanisms required by the DEA to prevent drug loss and diversion. All these facilities must renew their registrations annually, except dispensing facilities, which must renew every three years. The DEA conducts periodic inspections of certain registered establishments that handle controlled substances. Obtaining the necessary registrations may result in delay of the importation, manufacturing or distribution of any CBD-based drug candidates we may develop. Furthermore, failure to maintain compliance with the CSA, particularly non-compliance resulting in loss or diversion, can result in regulatory action that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The DEA may seek civil penalties, refuse to renew necessary registrations, or initiate proceedings to restrict, suspend or revoke those registrations. In certain circumstances, violations could lead to criminal proceedings.\nIndividual states have also established controlled substance laws and regulations. Though state-controlled substance laws often mirror federal law, because the states are separate jurisdictions, they may separately schedule our product candidates as well. While some states automatically schedule a drug based on federal action, other states schedule drugs through rulemaking or a legislative action. State scheduling may delay commercial sale of any product for which we obtain federal regulatory approval and adverse scheduling could have a material adverse effect on the commercial attractiveness of such product. We must also obtain separate state registrations, permits or licenses in order to be able to obtain, handle, and distribute controlled substances for clinical trials or commercial sale, and failure to meet applicable regulatory requirements could lead to enforcement and sanctions by the states in addition to those from the DEA or otherwise arising under federal law.\nThe passage of the 2018 Farm Bill will impact our development of a dry powder version of CBD. The Agriculture Improvement Act of 2018, or the 2018 Farm Bill, was signed into law on December 20, 2018. This new law excludes hemp from the definition of marijuana for purposes of the CSA, and legalizes the cultivation and commercial sale of hemp in the United States, subject to state regulation and continuing oversight by federal regulatory agencies. However, the 2018 Farm Bill does not legalize hemp-derived CBDs. CBDs generally remain a Schedule I controlled substance under the CSA and the 2018 Farm Bill provides that a CBD will be removed from Schedule I status if, among other requirements, the CBD is derived from hemp produced by a licensed grower in a manner consistent with the 2018 Farm Bill and associated federal and state regulations.\nIn addition, the 2018 Farm Bill did not alter the FDA\u2019s authority to regulate products containing cannabis or cannabis-derived compounds, including CBD, under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. Hemp products, including CBDs, that qualify as drugs, food, dietary supplements, veterinary products, and cosmetics will continue to be regulated by the FDA under the applicable regulatory frameworks. Following passage of the 2018 Farm Bill, the FDA reaffirmed its enforcement authority and reiterated the requirement that a CBD product (hemp-derived or otherwise) that is marketed with a claim of therapeutic benefit, or with any other disease claim, be approved by the FDA for its intended use before it may be introduced into interstate commerce. However, we believe that hemp-derived CBD products that are not marketed with a claim of therapeutic benefit, or with any other disease claim, may not require FDA pre-marketing approval. While we believe that recent legislation, most notably the 2018 Farm Bill, has reduced the amount of DEA regulation of CBDs, this is a rapidly evolving area of law and there remains some uncertainty surrounding future state regulation of CBDs. In addition, as of the date of this report, the FDA has approved for marketing only one CBD-based drug product, Epidiolex, and there can be no assurance that we will not encounter increased costs or delays in pursuing FDA market approval of a CBD-based dry powder formula, assuming we can obtain approval at all.\nRisks Relating to Our Intellectual Property Rights\nWe are dependent on rights to certain technologies licensed to us. We do not have complete control over these technologies and any loss of our rights to them could prevent us from selling our product candidates. As noted above, our business model is entirely dependent on certain patent rights licensed to us by the University of Texas at Austin, or UT. See, \u201cRisk Factors - Risks Relating to Our Business - Our business model is entirely dependent on certain patent rights licensed to us from the University of Texas at Austin, and the loss of those license rights would, in all likelihood, cause our business, as presently contemplated, to fail.\u201d Because we will hold those rights as a licensee, we have limited control over certain important aspects of those patent rights. Pursuant to the patent license agreement, UT has reserved the right to control all decisions concerning the prosecution and maintenance of all U.S. and foreign patents, as well as all decisions concerning the enforcement of any actions against potential infringers of the patent rights. We believe that UT shares a common interest in these matters with us, and UT has agreed to consult with us on the prosecution and enforcement of possible infringement claims as well as other matters for which UT has retained control. However, there can be no assurance that UT will agree with our views as to how best to prosecute, maintain and defend the patent rights subject to the patent license agreement.\nIt is difficult and costly to protect our intellectual property rights, and we cannot ensure the protection of these rights. Our commercial success will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully defend the patent rights subject to our patent license agreement with UT against third-party challenges and successfully enforcing these patent rights against third party competitors. The patent positions of pharmaceutical companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions for which important legal principles remain unresolved. Changes in either the patent laws or in interpretations of patent laws may diminish the value of our intellectual property. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowable or enforceable in the patent applications subject to the UT patent license agreement. The patents and patent applications relating to our TFF platform and related technologies may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by third parties and might not protect us against competitors with similar products or technologies.\nThe degree of future protection afforded by the patent rights licensed to us is uncertain, because legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights, permit us to gain or keep our competitive advantage, or provide us with any competitive advantage at all. We cannot be certain that any patent application owned by a third party will not have priority over patent applications in which we hold license rights or that we will not be involved in interference, opposition or invalidity proceedings before United States or foreign patent offices.\nAdditionally, if UT were to initiate legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent covering any of our product candidates, the defendant could counterclaim that such patent is invalid and/or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the United States, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity and/or unenforceability are commonplace. Grounds for a validity challenge include alleged failures to meet any of several statutory requirements, including lack of novelty, obviousness or non-enablement. Grounds for unenforceability assertions include allegations that someone connected with prosecution of the patent withheld relevant information from the United States Patent and Trademark Office, or the U.S. PTO, or made a misleading statement, during prosecution. Third parties may also raise similar claims before administrative bodies in the United States or abroad, even outside the context of litigation. Such mechanisms include re-examination, post grant review and equivalent proceedings in foreign jurisdictions, e.g. opposition proceedings. Such proceedings could result in revocation or amendment of UT\u2019s patents in such a way that they no longer cover our product candidates or competitive products. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability is unpredictable. With respect to validity, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art, of which UT and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity and/or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on any of our product candidates. Such a loss of patent protection would have a material adverse impact on our business.\nIn the future, we may rely on know-how and trade secrets to protect technology, especially in cases in which we believe patent protection is not appropriate or obtainable. However, know-how and trade secrets are difficult to protect. While we intend to require employees, academic collaborators, consultants and other contractors to enter into confidentiality agreements, we may not be able to adequately protect our trade secrets or other proprietary or licensed information. Typically, research collaborators and scientific advisors have rights to publish data and information in which we may have rights. Enforcing a claim that a third party illegally obtained and is using any of our trade secrets is expensive and time consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts are sometimes less willing to protect trade secrets than patents. Moreover, our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how.\nIf we fail to obtain or maintain patent protection or trade secret protection for our product candidates or our technologies, third parties could use our proprietary information, which could impair our ability to compete in the market and adversely affect our ability to generate revenues and attain profitability.\nOur product candidates may infringe the intellectual property rights of others, which could increase our costs and delay or prevent our development and commercialization efforts. Our success depends in part on avoiding infringement of the proprietary technologies of others. The pharmaceutical industry has been characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Identification of third-party patent rights that may be relevant to our proprietary technology is difficult because patent searching is imperfect due to differences in terminology among patents, incomplete databases and the difficulty in assessing the meaning of patent claims. Additionally, because patent applications are maintained in secrecy until the application is published, we may be unaware of third-party patents that may be infringed by commercialization of any of our product candidates or any future product candidate. There may be certain issued patents and patent applications claiming subject matter that we may be required to license in order to research, develop or commercialize any of our product candidates, and we do not know if such patents and patent applications would be available to license on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Any claims of patent infringement asserted by third parties would be time-consuming and may:\n\u25cf result in costly litigation;\n\u25cf divert the time and attention of our technical personnel and management;\n\u25cf prevent us from commercializing a product until the asserted patent expires or is held finally invalid or not infringed in a court of law;\n\u25cf require us to cease or modify our use of the technology and/or develop non-infringing technology; or\n\u25cf require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements.\nThird parties may hold proprietary rights that could prevent any of our product candidates from being marketed. Any patent-related legal action against us claiming damages and seeking to enjoin commercial activities relating to any of our product candidates or our processes could subject us to potential liability for damages and require us to obtain a license to continue to manufacture or market any of our product candidates or any future product candidates. We cannot predict whether we would prevail in any such actions or that any license required under any of these patents would be made available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. In addition, we cannot be sure that we could redesign our product candidates or any future product candidates or processes to avoid infringement, if necessary. Accordingly, an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding, or the failure to obtain necessary licenses, could prevent us from developing and commercializing any of our product candidates or a future product candidate, which could harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe expect that there are other companies, including major pharmaceutical companies, working in the areas competitive to our product candidates which either has resulted, or may result, in the filing of patent applications that may be deemed related to our activities. If we were to challenge the validity of these or any issued United States patent in court, we would need to overcome a statutory presumption of validity that attaches to every issued United States patent. This means that, in order to prevail, we would have to present clear and convincing evidence as to the invalidity of the patent\u2019s claims. If we were to challenge the validity of these or any issued United States patent in an administrative trial before the Patent Trial and Appeal Board in the U.S. PTO, we would have to prove that the claims are unpatentable by a preponderance of the evidence. There is no assurance that a jury and/or court would find in our favor on questions of infringement, validity or enforceability. Even if we are successful, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nWe may be subject to claims that we have wrongfully hired an employee from a competitor or that we or our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged confidential information or trade secrets of their former employers. As is commonplace in our industry, we will employ individuals who were previously employed at other pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although no claims against us are currently pending, we may be subject in the future to claims that our employees or prospective employees are subject to a continuing obligation to their former employers (such as non-competition or non-solicitation obligations) or claims that our employees or we have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nRisks Related to Owning Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our shares may be subject to fluctuation and volatility. You could lose all or part of your investment. The market price of our common stock is subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. Since shares of our common stock were sold in our initial public offering in October 2019 at a price of $5.00 per share, the reported high and low sales prices of our common stock have ranged from $3.44 to $21.14 through December 31, 2020. The market price of our shares on the NASDAQ Global Market may fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf actual or anticipated variations in our and our competitors\u2019 results of operations and financial condition;\n\u25cf market acceptance of our product candidates;\n\u25cf changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts, if our shares are covered by analysts;\n\u25cf development of technological innovations or new competitive products by others;\n\u25cf announcements of technological innovations or new products by us;\n\u25cf publication of the results of preclinical or clinical trials for our product candidates;\n\u25cf failure by us to achieve a publicly announced milestone;\n\u25cf delays between our expenditures to develop and market new or enhanced products and the generation of sales from those products;\n\u25cf developments concerning intellectual property rights, including our involvement in litigation brought by or against us;\n\u25cf regulatory developments and the decisions of regulatory authorities as to the approval or rejection of new or modified products;\n\u25cf changes in the amounts that we spend to develop, acquire or license new products, technologies or businesses;\n\u25cf changes in our expenditures to promote our product candidates;\n\u25cf our sale or proposed sale, or the sale by our significant stockholders, of our shares or other securities in the future;\n\u25cf changes in key personnel;\n\u25cf success or failure of our research and development projects or those of our competitors;\n\u25cf the trading volume of our shares; and\n\u25cf general economic and market conditions and other factors, including factors unrelated to our operating performance.\nThese factors and any corresponding price fluctuations may materially and adversely affect the market price of our shares and result in substantial losses being incurred by our investors. In the past, following periods of market volatility, public company stockholders have often instituted securities class action litigation. If we were involved in securities litigation, it could impose a substantial cost upon us and divert the resources and attention of our management from our business.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not continue to publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline. The trading market for our common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If industry analysts cease coverage of us, the trading price for our common stock would be negatively affected. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our common stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our common stock could decrease, which might cause our common stock price and trading volume to decline. In addition, independent industry analysts may provide reviews of our product candidates and our TFF platform\u2019s capabilities, as well as those of our competitors, and perception of our offerings in the marketplace may be significantly influenced by these reviews. We have no control over what these industry analysts report, and because industry analysts may influence current and potential customers, our brand could be harmed if they do not provide a positive review of our products and platform capabilities or view us as a market leader.\nFuture capital raises may dilute your ownership and/or have other adverse effects on our operations. If we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our existing stockholders\u2019 percentage ownership will be reduced and these stockholders may experience substantial dilution. If we raise additional funds by issuing debt securities, these debt securities would have rights senior to those of our common stock and the terms of the debt securities issued could impose significant restrictions on our operations, including liens on our assets. If we raise additional funds through collaborations and licensing arrangements, we may be required to relinquish some rights to our intellectual property or candidate products, or to grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the JOBS Act of 2012 and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors. We are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act;\n\u25cf reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements;\n\u25cf exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments; and\n\u25cf extended transition periods available for complying with new or revised accounting standards.\nWe have chosen to take advantage of all of the benefits available under the JOBS Act, including the exemptions discussed above. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nWe will remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d for up to five years, although we will lose that status sooner if our revenues exceed $1.07 billion, if we issue more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt in a three year period, or if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of June 30 in any future year.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. Commencing with our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, we will be required to provide a report on management\u2019s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting. Once we are neither an emerging growth company nor a non-accelerated filed, we will be required to obtain an attestation from our independent registered public accounting firm on our internal control report. Effective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and, together with adequate disclosure controls and procedures, are designed to prevent fraud. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. In addition, any testing by us conducted in connection with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or the subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm when required, may reveal deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses or that may require prospective or retrospective changes to our financial statements or identify other areas for further attention or improvement. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common shares. There is also a risk that neither we nor our independent registered public accounting firm (when applicable in the future) will be able to conclude within the prescribed timeframe that internal controls over financial reporting is effective as required by Section 404. As a result, investors could lose confidence in our financial and other public reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our common stock.\nWe have not paid dividends in the past and have no immediate plans to pay dividends. We plan to reinvest all of our earnings, to the extent we have earnings, to cover operating costs and otherwise become and remain competitive. We do not plan to pay any cash dividends with respect to our securities in the foreseeable future. We cannot assure you that we would, at any time, generate sufficient surplus cash that would be available for distribution to the holders of our common stock as a dividend. Therefore, you should not expect to receive cash dividends on our common stock.\nWe may be at an increased risk of securities class action litigation. Historically, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following a decline in the market price of its securities. This risk is especially relevant for us because biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies have experienced significant stock price volatility in recent years. If we were to be sued, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could harm our business.\nOur charter documents and Delaware law may inhibit a takeover that stockholders consider favorable. The provisions of our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation, or Certificate, and amended and restated bylaws and applicable provisions of Delaware law may delay or discourage transactions involving an actual or potential change in control or change in our management, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares, or transactions that our stockholders might otherwise deem to be in their best interests. The provisions in our Certificate and amended and restated bylaws:\n\u25cf limit who may call stockholder meetings;\n\u25cf do not provide for cumulative voting rights; and\n\u25cf provide that all board vacancies may be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of directors then in office, even if less than a quorum.\nIn addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law may limit our ability to engage in any business combination with a person who beneficially owns 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock unless certain conditions are satisfied. This restriction lasts for a period of three years following the share acquisition. These provisions may have the effect of entrenching our management team and may deprive you of the opportunity to sell your shares to potential acquirers at a premium over prevailing prices. This potential inability to obtain a control premium could reduce the price of our common stock.\nOur Certificate and amended and restated bylaws designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain litigation that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees. Provisions in our Certificate and amended and restated bylaws provide that the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for:\n\u25cf any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf;\n\u25cf any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed to us or our stockholders by any of our directors, officers or other employees;\n\u25cf any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors, officers or other employees arising pursuant to any provision of Delaware law or our charter documents; or\n\u25cf any action asserting a claim against us or any of our directors, officers or other employees governed by the internal affairs doctrine, but excluding actions to enforce a duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction.\nThese exclusive forum provisions do not apply to claims under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act. These exclusive forums provisions, however, do provide that if no state court located in the State of Delaware has jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware shall be the exclusive forum. By becoming a stockholder in our company, you will be deemed to have notice of and have consented to the provisions of our Certificate and amended and restated bylaws related to choice of forum, but will not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. The choice of forum provisions in our Certificate and amended and restated bylaws may limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or any of our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims. Alternatively, if a court were to find the choice of forum provision contained in our Certificate and amended and restated bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.", "PERMNO": 19026, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "TFFP"}
