{"cik": "1305323", "company": "Zovio Inc", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-04-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInvesting in our common stock involves risk. Before making an investment in our common stock, you should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below, as well as the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our annual consolidated financial statements and the information set forth in Part I, Item 1, \u201cBusiness\u201d and Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d The risks described below are those which we believe are the material risks we face.\nUpon the consummation of the Sale Transaction on December 1, 2020 (as discussed in Part II, Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d), we became a service provider of education services to Global Campus, our inaugural university client. Accordingly, we have set forth below additional material risks to reflect those factors now applicable to our new business operations. Given that our revenue from operations is currently derived primarily from our contractual relationship with Global Campus, the risk factors include risks attributable to Global Campus operating as a non-profit university, which could materially affect our business. Through December 1, 2020, we were the owner of a for-profit university and certain of the risk factors set forth below are the risks associated with that business.\nAdditional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may impact our business operations. Any of the risks described below could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. In these circumstances, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to the Sale Transaction and Change in the Structure of Our Operations\nThe Sale Transaction with the University of Arizona and Global Campus, is subject to certain terms and conditions that if not achieved, could disrupt our business.\nIn connection with the closing of the Sale Transaction, the Company and Global Campus entered into a long-term Services Agreement pursuant to which the Company will provide recruiting, financial aid, counseling, institutional support, information technology, and academic support services to Global Campus. The Services Agreement has an initial term through June 30, 2036, subject to renewal options, although Global Campus has the right to terminate the Services Agreement after its fiscal year ending June 30, 2028 subject to the payment of a termination fee equal to one-hundred (100%) of the services fees paid to the Company in the trailing twelve (12) month period (payable half in cash and half in an unsecured note).\nIn return for providing services under the Services Agreement, Global Campus, after covering its direct costs of operations (which may not be increased by more than 2% per year), will pay to the Company services fees equal to the Company\u2019s direct costs to provide the services plus an additional amount equal to 19.5% of Global Campus\u2019s tuition and fees revenue. If, following its fiscal year ending June 30, 2028, Global Campus\u2019s tuition and fees revenue is $440.0 million or less, then the Company\u2019s revenue share percentage is subject to decrease on a sliding scale to between 18.1% and 15.5%, subject to increase back up to 19.5% if, in any subsequent fiscal year, Global Campus\u2019s tuition and fees revenue again exceeds $440.0 million. In addition, the parties to the Services Agreement have agreed on certain minimum profit levels to be achieved by Global Campus after payment of the Company\u2019s services fees of $0 for the period ending June 30, 2021, $0 for Global Campus\u2019 fiscal year ending June 30, 2022, $12.5 million for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2023, $25.0 million for the fiscal years ending June 30, 2024, 2025 and 2026, and $10.0 million for each fiscal year thereafter through the remainder of the initial term; subject to certain limitations, the Company is required to adjust its fees in any year to the extent necessary for Global Campus to achieve such minimum levels. In addition, in accordance with the conditions of the WSCUC approval, the Services Agreement incorporates identified key performance indicators, all as mutually agreed upon the parties.\nOn an annual basis, immaterial cash penalties could arise from not meeting individual key performance indicators. However, breaches of these key performance indicators over a multi-year period could have a material impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFollowing the Sale Transaction, we are subject to various risks and uncertainties arising out of the changes in the structure of our operations, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business and operations, and our stock price.\nFollowing the Sale Transaction, various aspects of our operations have changed in important ways. We are no longer the owner and operator of a regulated institution of higher education, but we are now an education technology service provider. While the services we provide were part of our business prior to the Sale Transaction, we have no experience operating solely as an education technology service provider to third parties.\nInitially, substantially all of our revenue is derived pursuant to the Services Agreement. Accordingly, Global Campus\u2019 ability to increase its enrollment and tuition and fee revenue, and our ability to continue to perform the services necessary to enable Global Campus to achieve such goals, will be critical to the success of our services business.\nIf we are unable to successfully re-focus our business to providing education technology services to third-party education providers, or if the Services Agreement fails to achieve the anticipated levels of performance, then our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as our stock price, could be materially and adversely affected.\nIf the University is found to have violated any regulatory requirement while we owned and operated it, we remain responsible for any liabilities arising from such violation, either directly or because of our obligation to indemnify Global Campus, and the payment of any such damages or fines could materially and adversely affect our business and operations, and our stock price.\nFollowing the Sale Transaction, we retained all liabilities associated with the University during the time we owned and operated it and agreed to indemnify Global Campus for such matters if the University is found liable for violations during such period, including regulatory non-compliance. Should violations be determined, we may be required to either pay such liabilities directly or indemnify Global Campus. Such payments could be substantial and could adversely affect us.\nIf the Department does not recertify Global Campus to continue participating in the Title IV programs, Global Campus' students would lose their access to Title IV program funds, or there could be significant limitations as a condition of Global Campus' continued participation in the Title IV programs, and as a service provider, our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as our stock price, could be materially and adversely affected.\nInstitutions are required to seek recertification from the Department on a regular basis in order to continue their participation in Title IV programs. An institution must also apply for recertification by the Department if it undergoes a change in control, as defined by the Department regulations, and may be subject to similar review if it expands its operations or educational programs in certain ways. There can be no assurance that the Department will recertify Global Campus or that the Department will not impose conditions or other restrictions as a condition of granting Global Campus a provisional certification. If the Department does not renew, or withdraws, the certification of Global Campus to participate in the Title IV programs at any time, students would no longer be able to receive Title IV program funds. Similarly, the Department could renew Global Campus\u2019 certification, but restrict or delay its students\u2019 receipt of Title IV funds, limit the students to whom Global Campus could disburse funds, decline to approve Global Campus as a nonprofit institution for Title IV purposes, or place other restrictions on Global Campus.\nAny of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on us. We no longer own or operate the University, and we no longer participate in the Title IV programs as an institution. However, we face the risks discussed above in connection with providing services as a third-party education technology services provider, including adverse effects on our business and operations from a reduction or loss in our revenues under the Services Agreement.\nIf we are determined to have paid improper incentive compensation to our covered employees, or tuition sharing arrangements are deemed to violate the incentive compensation regulations, our business will be impaired.\nAn institution that participates in the Title IV programs may not provide any commission, bonus, or other incentive payment based directly or indirectly on success in securing enrollments or financial aid to any person or entity engaged in student recruitment, admissions, or financial aid awarding activity. Current regulations provide that higher education institutions agree that it will not provide any commission, bonus, or other incentive payment based in any part, directly or indirectly, upon success in securing enrollments or the award of financial aid, to any person or entity who is engaged in student recruitment or admission activity, or in making decisions regarding the award of Title IV, HEA program funds. Pursuant to this regulation, we are prohibited from offering our covered employees, which are those employees involved with or responsible for recruiting or admissions activities, any bonus or incentive-based compensation based on the successful recruitment, admission or enrollment of students into a postsecondary institution. We are also precluded from offering our covered employees that work on financial aid matters (if any), any bonus or incentive-based compensation based on the award of financial aid to students enrolled in a postsecondary institution.\nRisks Related to the Extensive Regulation of Our Business and University Partners\nIf our current or any future university partner fails to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, they could face monetary liabilities or penalties, operational restrictions, or loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs from which we derive most of our revenue.\nTo participate in Title IV programs, an institution must be (i) legally authorized to operate in the state in which it is physically located, (ii) accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by the Department as a reliable indicator of educational quality and (iii) certified as an eligible institution by the Department. As a result, we are subject to extensive regulation by the Department, WSCUC, and state education agencies. These regulatory requirements cover many aspects of our operations. Given that the Department, WSCUC and state education agencies periodically revise their requirements and modify their interpretations of existing requirements, we cannot reliably predict how these regulatory requirements will be applied or whether we will be able to comply with all the requirements. If our current or any future university partner fails to comply with these regulatory requirements, the Department could impose sanctions on that institution, including monetary liabilities or penalties, operational restrictions, or loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs from which we derive most of our revenue. For additional information, see \u201cRegulation - Department Regulation of Title IV Programs - Potential sanctions for noncompliance with Title IV regulations\u201d in Part I, Item 1, \u201cBusiness.\u201d If our current or future university partners were to lose eligibility to participate in Title IV programs or were to have such participation substantially curtailed, enrollments and our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected.\nAn institution must periodically seek recertification to participate in Title IV programs and may, in certain circumstances, be subject to review or other action by the Department in connection with such recertification.\nAn institution must periodically seek recertification from the Department to continue to participate in Title IV programs and may, in certain circumstances, be subject to review or other action by the Department in connection with such recertification. The Department may review an institution\u2019s continued certification to participate in Title IV programs in the event of a change of control and may take emergency action to suspend an institution\u2019s certification without advance notice if it determines the institution is violating Title IV requirements and immediate action is necessary to prevent misuse of Title IV funds. If the Department revokes or does not renew the certifications to participate in Title IV programs, our university partner\u2019s students would no longer be able to receive Title IV funds, which would have a material adverse effect on enrollments and our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nThe failure of our current or any future university partners to maintain accreditation would denigrate the value of their educational programs and result in a loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs.\nAn institution must be accredited by an accrediting agency recognized by the Department to participate in Title IV programs. WSCUC is recognized by the Department as a reliable authority regarding the quality of education and training provided by the institutions it accredits. To remain accredited, our university partners must continuously meet accreditation standards relating to, among other things, performance, governance, institutional integrity, educational quality, faculty, administrative capability, resources and financial stability. If a university partner fails to satisfy any of the standards of its accrediting agency, it could lose its accreditation. Loss of accreditation would denigrate the value of its educational programs and would result in its loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, which would have a material adverse effect on enrollments and our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nOur current or future university partners may lose eligibility to participate in Title IV programs or face other sanctions or fines if they are not compliant with the Higher Education Act for a variety of reasons.\nOur current or future university partners could lose eligibility to participate in Title IV programs or face other sanctions or fines if any of the following occur:\n\u2022An institution is not legally authorized to offer its educational programs by the states in which it is physically located. To maintain these authorizations and registrations, an institution must comply with applicable requirements under the statutes and rules of the applicable state.\n\u2022An institution derives more than 90% of its revenues from Title IV program funds for two consecutive fiscal years, as calculated in accordance with Department regulations. Any institution that violates the 90/10 rule for two consecutive fiscal years becomes ineligible to participate in Title IV programs for at least two fiscal years. In addition, an institution whose rate exceeds 90% for any single fiscal year will be placed on provisional certification and may be subject to other enforcement measures.\n\u2022An institution has too many students that default on their loans. For each federal fiscal year, the Department calculates a rate of student defaults over a three-year measuring period for each educational institution, which is known as a \u201ccohort default rate.\u201d An institution may lose its eligibility to participate in the Direct Loan Program and the Federal Pell Grant Program if for each of the three most recent federal fiscal years 30% or more of its students who became subject to a repayment obligation in that federal fiscal year defaulted on such obligation by the end of the following federal fiscal year.\n\u2022An institution has a failure to demonstrate financial responsibility. To participate in Title IV programs, an eligible institution must satisfy specific measures of financial responsibility prescribed by the Department. One measure of financial responsibility is an institution\u2019s composite score, a number between negative 1.0 and positive 3.0. An institution\u2019s composite score must be at least 1.5 for the institution to be deemed financially responsible without the need for further Department oversight.\n\u2022An institution pays incentive compensation to persons or entities involved in certain recruiting, admissions or financial aid awarding activities. The Higher Education Act prohibits an institution from providing any commission, bonus or other incentive payment based directly or indirectly on securing enrollments or financial aid to any persons or entities involved in student recruiting or admissions activities or making decisions about the award of student financial assistance. The criteria for complying with the Department\u2019s rules prohibiting incentive compensation are not clear in all circumstances, and the Department will not review or approve compensation plans prior to their implementation.\n\u2022An institution engages in substantial misrepresentation regarding the nature of its educational programs, its financial charges or the employability of its graduates. If the Department determines an institution has engaged in substantial misrepresentation, the Department may (i) attempt to revoke the institution\u2019s program participation agreement if the institution is provisionally certified, (ii) impose limitations on the institution\u2019s participation in Title IV programs if the institution is provisionally certified, (iii) deny applications from the institution for approval of new programs or locations or other matters or (iv) initiate proceedings to fine the institution or limit, suspend or terminate its eligibility to participate in Title IV programs.\n\u2022An institution fails to correctly calculate the amount of unearned Title IV program funds that have been disbursed to students who withdraw from their educational programs before completion, and must return those unearned funds in a timely manner, generally within 45 days of the date the institution determines that the student has withdrawn. Failure to make timely returns of Title IV program funds for 5% or more of students sampled in the institution\u2019s annual financial aid compliance audit in either of its two most recently completed fiscal years can result in an institution having to post a letter of credit equal to 25% of the amount of unearned Title IV funds the institution was required to return for its most recently completed fiscal year. If unearned funds are not properly calculated and returned in a timely manner, an institution may also be subject to monetary liabilities or an action to impose a fine or to limit, suspend or terminate its participation in Title IV programs.\nIf any of the above were to occur and there was a loss of eligibility to participate in Title IV programs, there could be a material adverse effect on enrollments of our current or future university partners, and therefore on our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nChanges to the 90/10 rule or related Title IV regulation could adversely impact our university partners, which in turn could adversely affect our revenues or our ability to grow.\nIn March 2021, President Biden signed the American Rescue Plan Act (\u201cARPA\u201d) of 2021. The ARPA includes a major change in the 90/10 revenue test that provides for-profit institutions and their students access to the Federal Student Aid (\u201cFSA\u201d) programs. Under the ARPA, the Higher Education Act would be modified to change the formula from counting only Title IV program funds on the '90 side' to instead include all \u201cfederal funds that are disbursed or delivered to or on behalf of a student to be used to attend such institution\u201d or collectively \u201cfederal education assistance funds.\u201d The 90/10 provision will be subject to negotiated rulemaking after October 2021, with an earliest effective date on or after January 1, 2023. Additionally, in June 2021, the Department held virtual public hearings to receive stakeholder feedback on potential issues for the upcoming negotiated rulemaking sessions. These issues include borrower defense to repayment for students, gainful employment requirements, and change in ownership and change in control of institutions of higher education among other topics. If these changes were to go into effect, it could adversely impact our university partners, which in turn could adversely affect our revenues or our ability to grow.\nThe borrower defense to repayment regulations expand the circumstances in which students may assert a defense to repayment against an institution and could result in the imposition of significant restrictions on our university partners ability to operate.\nThe Department has regulations regarding borrower defense to repayment. The regulations allow a borrower to assert a defense to repayment on the basis of a substantial misrepresentation, any other misrepresentation in cases where certain other factors are present, a breach of contract or a favorable non-default contested judgment against a school for its act or omission relating to the making of the borrower\u2019s loan or the provision of educational services for which the loan was provided. In addition, the financial responsibility standards contained in the regulations establish the conditions or events that trigger the requirement for an institution to provide the Department with financial protection in the form of a letter of credit or other security against potential institutional liabilities. Triggering conditions or events include, among others, certain state, federal or accrediting agency actions or investigations, and in the case of publicly traded companies, receipt of certain warnings from the SEC or the applicable stock exchange, or the failure to timely file a required annual or quarterly report with the SEC. The regulations also prohibit schools from requiring that students agree to settle future disputes through arbitration.\nUnder the borrower defense to repayment regulations, an institution could face claims by students based on the expanded circumstances in which students may assert a defense to repayment of their student loans, and the Department may be entitled to seek recoupment of student loans discharged pursuant to the regulations.\nIn July 2020, the Department notified the Company that the Department would be initiating a preliminary review of borrower defense applications from borrowers who made claims regarding the University. As part of the initial fact-finding process, the Department sent individual student claims to the University and allowed the institution to submit a response to the individual borrower\u2019s claim. The Company received and timely responded to each individual student claim and cannot predict the outcome of the Department's review at this time.\nIf we fail to maintain adequate systems and processes to detect and prevent fraudulent activity in student enrollment and financial aid, our business could be adversely impacted.\nWe are susceptible to an increased risk of fraudulent activity by outside parties with respect to student enrollment and student financial aid programs. The potential for outside parties to perpetrate fraud in connection with the award and disbursement of Title IV program funds, including as a result of identity theft, may be heightened because we are an online education provider. Our systems and processes may not always be adequate in the face of increasingly sophisticated and ever-changing fraud schemes. We must maintain systems and processes to successfully identify and prevent fraudulent applications for enrollment and financial aid.\nThe Department\u2019s regulations require institutions that participate in Title IV programs to refer to the OIG credible information indicating that any applicant, employee, third-party servicer or agent of the institution that acts in a capacity that involves administration of Title IV programs has been engaged in any fraud or other illegal conduct involving Title IV programs. If the systems and processes that we have established to detect and prevent fraud are inadequate, the Department may find that we do not satisfy its \u201cadministrative capability\u201d requirements. In addition, an institution\u2019s ability to participate in Title IV programs is conditioned on their maintaining accreditation by an accrediting agency that is recognized by the Department. Under the Higher Education Act, accrediting agencies that evaluate institutions offering distance learning programs, must require such institutions to have processes by which they establish that a student who registers for a distance education program is the same student who participates in and receives credit for the program. Any failure to satisfy the Department\u2019s administrative capability requirements or any loss of accreditation as a result of a failure to detect and prevent fraudulent activity could result in limits on or loss of Global Campus\u2019 eligibility to participate in Title IV programs and have a material adverse effect on enrollments and our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nGovernmental proceedings or other claims and lawsuits asserting regulatory noncompliance could result in monetary liabilities or penalties, injunctions or loss of Title IV funding for students at our current or any future university partner.\nBecause our current, and any future university partner operates in a highly regulated industry, we are subject to compliance reviews, claims of noncompliance and lawsuits by government agencies, regulatory agencies and third parties, including claims brought by third parties on behalf of the federal government under the federal False Claims Act. If the results of these reviews or proceedings are unfavorable to us or if we are unable to defend successfully against such lawsuits or claims, we may be required to pay money damages or be subject to fines, limitations, loss of Title IV funding, injunctions or other penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. Even if we adequately address issues raised by an agency review or successfully defend a lawsuit or claim, we may have to divert significant financial and management resources from our ongoing business operations to address issues raised by those reviews or to defend against those lawsuits or claims. In addition, claims and lawsuits brought against us may damage our reputation or adversely affect our stock price, even if such claims and lawsuits are eventually determined to be without merit.\nAdditional regulations or regulatory scrutiny resulting from action by the Department could result in increased compliance costs, fines, sanctions or lawsuits, which could have a material adverse effect on enrollments and our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nThe Department released final regulations to clarify state authorization requirements for postsecondary institutions offering distance education that participate in federal student loan programs, as required by the Higher Education Act. Among other things, the final regulations (i) require institutions offering distance education to be authorized by each state in which they enroll students, if such authorization is required by the state, (ii) require institutions to document the state process for resolving student complaints regarding distance education programs, (iii) require public and individualized disclosures to enrolled and prospective students in distance education programs, including disclosures regarding adverse actions taken against the institution, the institution\u2019s refund policies and whether each of the institution\u2019s programs meet applicable state licensure or certification requirements, and (iv) require institutions to explain to students the consequences of moving to a state where the school is not authorized, which could include loss of eligibility for federal student aid. The final regulations recognize authorization through participation in a state authorization reciprocity agreement, as long as the agreement does not prevent a state from enforcing its own consumer laws.\nWe cannot predict the scope and content of the regulations that may emerge from these or other rulemaking activities that the Department initiates. The Departments actions could result in direct and indirect costs related to compliance, increased scrutiny, fines, liabilities, sanctions or lawsuits, which could have a material adverse effect on enrollments and our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nAny action by Congress to revise the laws governing Title IV programs or to reduce funding for these programs could negatively impact our business.\nCongress must periodically reauthorize the Higher Education Act and annually determine the funding level for each Title IV program through the budget and appropriations process. The Higher Education Act\u2019s programs will continue year-to-year without explicit reauthorization as long as Congress appropriates funds for the programs. Congress may propose and pass revisions to the Higher Education Act between reauthorizations by using other legislative vehicles such as budget bills and appropriations bills, which could impact funding for student financial aid programs.\nWe cannot predict what legislation, if any, will arise out of the reauthorization of the Higher Education Act or other Congressional deliberations, or what impact any such legislation might have on the for-profit education sector and our business. However, any action by Congress that significantly reduces Title IV program funding or the eligibility of our current or any future university partners or students to participate in Title IV programs, or that requires us to modify our practices in ways that could increase our administrative costs and reduce our profit margin, would have a material adverse effect on enrollments and our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nA large percentage of our revenue is attributable to our contractual relationship with Global Campus, and the loss of, or a decline in enrollment in, Global Campus programs could significantly reduce our revenue and impact our overall financial performance.\nWe expect the programs of Global Campus to account for a large percentage of our revenue for the foreseeable future. Any decline in reputation or changes in policies of Global Campus could adversely affect its student enrollment and its overall financial and operating results, which could materially impact us. Furthermore, Global Campus has the right to terminate the Services Agreement early if certain conditions apply. If Global Campus were to terminate or not renew its relationship with us, or if certain of the programs with Global Campus were to materially underperform for any reason, it could negatively affect our reputation, revenue and future operating results.\nWe face litigation and legal proceedings that could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nWe are subject to lawsuits, investigations and claims covering a wide range of matters. We are the subject of complaints alleging violations of various laws including, but not limited to, federal securities laws, and the California State Attorney General. These and other legal proceedings could cause us to incur significant defense costs, are disruptive to our normal business operations and could damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price. An adverse outcome of any legal proceeding could result in monetary losses or restrictions on our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nOn March 7, 2022, the Superior Court of the State of California, County of San Diego, or the Court, issued a Statement of Decision in favor of the Attorney General of the State of California, or the California Attorney General, in an action brought by the California Attorney General alleging we, and our previous subsidiary, Ashford University, LLC, or Ashford, among other things deliberately misled Ashford students and falsely advertised Ashford\u2019s academic programs. Ashford no longer exists and we are responsible for Ashford\u2019s portion of the liability under this matter. The Court ordered us to pay $22.4 million in statutory penalties but denied the California Attorney General\u2019s demands for restitution and injunctive relief. We are currently considering all options available to us related to the Statement of Decision. On April 7, 2022, we filed a motion for a new trial and/or to set aside and vacate the judgement, which is currently set for a hearing on May 13, 2022. Regardless of the ultimate outcome, this decision could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and financial condition.\nFor additional information regarding current material legal proceedings involving us and our subsidiaries, see Note 19, \u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nWe may need to raise additional funding, which may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If such financing is not available or not available on terms acceptable to us, it could adversely affect our ability to continue operations.\nWe assess going concern considerations in accordance with Accounting Standards Update (\u201cASU\u201d) 2014-15, \u201cDisclosures of Uncertainties about an Entity's Ability to Continue as a Going Concern,\u201d as to whether there is substantial doubt about the ability to continue as a going concern for a period of one year after the date that our financial statements are issued.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our cash and cash equivalents were $28.3 million. If we are unable to obtain sufficient capital when needed, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe amount, timing and terms of such additional financing will vary principally depending on the amount of cash flows from our operations and our forecasted operations. To the extent that we require additional financing in the future, such financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all and, consequently, we may not be able to fully implement our plans. For additional information on financing obtained in April 2022, see Note 22, \u201cSubsequent Events\u201d to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nA failure of our information systems to properly store, process and report relevant data may reduce our management\u2019s effectiveness, interfere with our regulatory compliance and increase our operating expenses.\nWe are heavily dependent on the integrity of our data management systems. If these systems do not effectively collect, store, process and report relevant data for the operation of our business, whether due to equipment malfunction or constraints, software deficiencies or human error, our ability to effectively plan, forecast and execute our business plan and comply with applicable laws and regulations will be impaired. Any such impairment could have a material adverse effect on our business, revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nWe rely on a third-party vendor to provide the online learning platform for students and related support and hosting.\nWe have a license agreement with Instructure pursuant to which we license an online Canvas learning management system and platform for students at our university partners. We currently rely on Instructure for administrative support and hosting of the applicable systems. If Instructure ceases to operate or is unwilling or unable to work with us, or if our agreement with Instructure is otherwise terminated, the online learning platform for students at our university partners and related administrative support and hosting could be interrupted or become unavailable, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations as a result of our collection and use of personal information, and any violations of such laws or regulations, or any security or cybersecurity breach, theft or loss of such information, could adversely affect our business.\nPossession and use of personal information in our operations subjects us to risks and costs that could harm our business. We collect, use and retain large amounts of personal information regarding applicants, students, faculty and staff. We also collect and maintain personal information about our employees in the ordinary course of our business. Our services can be accessed globally through the internet. Therefore, we may be subject to the application of national privacy laws in countries outside the United States from which applicants and students access our services. Such privacy laws could impose conditions that limit the way we market and provide our services.\nOur computer networks and the networks of certain of our vendors that hold and manage confidential information on our behalf may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, employee theft or misuse, computer hackers, computer viruses and other security and cybersecurity threats. Confidential information may also inadvertently become available to third parties when we integrate systems or migrate data to our servers following an acquisition of a school or in connection with periodic hardware or software upgrades. Due to the sensitive nature of the personal information stored on our servers, our networks may be targeted by hackers seeking to access this data. Users who circumvents security measures could misappropriate sensitive information or cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations. Although we use security and business controls to limit access to and use of personal information, a third-party may be able to circumvent those security and business controls, which could result in a breach of student or employee privacy. In addition, errors in the storage, use or transmission of personal information could result in a breach of privacy for current or prospective students or employees.\nOur use of personal information also subjects us to legislative and regulatory burdens that could require notification of data breaches and could restrict our use of personal information, and a violation of any laws or regulations relating to the collection or use of personal information could result in the imposition of fines against us or lawsuits brought against us. We maintain a cybersecurity program with ongoing monitoring. However, we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of any security and cybersecurity breaches or to alleviate problems caused by these breaches. A major breach, theft or loss of personal information held by us or our vendors regarding students and their families or our employees, or a violation of laws or regulations relating to the same, could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, result in lawsuits and result in further regulation and oversight by federal and state authorities and increased costs of compliance. The adoption of new or modified state or federal data or cybersecurity legislation could increase our costs and/or require changes in our operating procedures or systems.\nWe are required to comply with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (\u201cFERPA\u201d), and failure to do so could harm our reputation and negatively affect our business.\nFERPA generally prohibits an institution of higher education participating in Title IV programs from disclosing personally identifiable information from a student\u2019s education records without the student\u2019s consent. Our university partners and their students disclose to us certain information that originates from or comprises a student education record under FERPA. As an entity that provides services to institutions participating in Title IV programs, we are indirectly subject to FERPA, and we may not transfer or otherwise disclose any personally identifiable information from a student record to another party other than in a manner permitted under the statute. If we violate FERPA, such violation could result in a material breach of contract with one or more of our university partners and could harm our reputation. Further, in the event that we disclose student information in violation of FERPA, the Department could require a university partner to suspend our access to its student information for at least five years.\nChanges in accounting principles and guidance could result in unfavorable accounting charges or effects.\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. These principles are subject to interpretation by the SEC and various bodies formed to create and interpret appropriate accounting principles and guidance. A change in these principles or guidance, or in their interpretations, may have a material effect on our results and disclosures, as well as our processes and related controls. For additional information, see Note 2, \u201cSummary of Significant Accounting Policies - Recent Accounting Pronouncements\u201d to our annual consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report.\nSystem disruptions and vulnerability from security risks to our technology infrastructure could damage our reputation and the reputation of our other subsidiaries, and negatively impact our business.\nThe performance and reliability of our technology infrastructure (including the software and related hosting and maintenance services for our online learning platform, student information system, and lead management system) is critical to our reputation and our ability to attract and retain students. Any system error or failure, or a sudden and significant increase in bandwidth usage, could result in the unavailability of systems to us or our university partners and negatively impact our business and reputation. Our computer networks may also be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer hackers, computer viruses, denial of service attacks and other security problems. Although we continually monitor the security of our technology infrastructure and take proactive measures to prevent potential threats, these efforts may not protect our computer networks against all threats of security breaches, which could damage our reputation and the reputation of our other subsidiaries, and negatively impact our business and prospects.\nOur spending in the areas of new investments or other marketing opportunities may cause us to incur additional operating losses if we do not realize our expected revenues.\nOur spending is based in significant part on our estimates of future revenue and is largely fixed in the short term. As a result, we may be unable to adjust our spending in a timely manner if our revenue falls short of our expectations. Accordingly, any significant shortfall in revenues in relation to our expectations would have an immediate and material adverse effect on our profitability. We anticipate increasing operating expenses on new investments and marketing initiatives. Any such increase could cause material losses to the extent we do not generate additional revenues sufficient to cover those expenses.\nWe may not be able to retain our key personnel or hire and retain the personnel we need to sustain and grow our business.\nOur success depends largely on the skills, efforts and motivations of our executive officers, who generally have significant experience with our company and within the education industry. Due to the nature of our business, we face significant competition in attracting and retaining personnel who possess the skill sets we seek. In addition, key personnel may leave us and may subsequently compete against us. We do not carry life insurance on our key personnel as part of our benefits. The loss of the services of any of our key personnel or our failure to attract, replace and retain other qualified and experienced personnel on acceptable terms could impair our ability to sustain and grow our business. In addition, because we operate in a highly competitive industry, our hiring of qualified executives or other personnel may cause us or such persons to be subject to lawsuits alleging misappropriation of trade secrets, improper solicitation of employees or other claims.\nIf we are unable to hire new employees or to continue to develop existing employees responsible for student recruitment, the effectiveness of our new enrollment efforts would be adversely affected.\nWe intend to (i) hire, develop and train additional employees responsible for new enrollment and (ii) retain and continue to develop and train our existing new enrollment personnel. Our ability to develop and maintain a strong new enrollment function may be affected by a number of factors, including our ability to integrate and motivate our enrollment service advisors, our ability to effectively train our enrollment service advisors, the length of time it takes new enrollment service advisors to become productive, regulatory restrictions on the method of compensating enrollment service advisors and the competition involved in hiring and retaining enrollment service advisors. If we are unable to hire new employees or retain and develop current employees responsible for new enrollment, it could have a material adverse effect on enrollments and our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nA decline in the overall growth of enrollment in postsecondary institutions, or in the number of students seeking degrees online, could cause our university partners to experience a decline in enrollment.\nIf enrollment at our university partners decline, this could cause our revenues to decline in the future. In addition, if job growth in the fields related to the core disciplines of our university partners is weaker than expected, fewer students may seek the types of degrees that such university partners offer. To return to growth in our revenues and increase enrollments of our university partners, our university partners will need to attract and retain a larger percentage of students in existing markets and expand their markets by creating new academic programs. Any further decline in enrollment as a result of the inability to attract and retain students in existing markets or expand our markets by creating new academic programs in areas where there is market demand could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nOur success depends in part on our university partners' ability to update and expand the content of existing programs and to develop new programs and specializations on a timely basis and in a cost-effective manner.\nThe updates and expansions of existing programs and the development of new programs and specializations may not be accepted by existing or prospective students or prospective employers of our university partners\u2019 graduates. If we do not adequately respond to changes in market requirements by updating and expanding our existing programs or developing new programs, our business will be adversely affected. Even if our university partners are able to develop acceptable new programs, they may not be able to introduce these new programs as quickly as students require or as quickly as our competitors introduce competing programs. To offer a new academic program, our university partners may be required to obtain appropriate federal, state and accrediting agency approvals, which may be conditioned or delayed in a manner that could significantly affect our operations. In addition, to be eligible for federal student financial aid programs, a new academic program may need to be approved by the Department.\nEstablishing new academic programs or modifying existing programs requires investments in management, faculty and capital expenditures, additional marketing expenses and reallocation of other resources. If our university partners are unable to increase enrollment in new programs, offer new programs in a cost-effective manner or otherwise manage effectively the operations of newly established academic programs, it could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nOur current or any future university partners failure to keep pace with changing market needs could harm their ability to attract students.\nOur success depends partially on the willingness of employers to hire, promote or increase the pay of our university partners\u2019 graduates. Increasingly, employers demand that their new employees possess appropriate technical and analytical skills, and appropriate interpersonal skills, such as communication and teamwork. These skills can evolve rapidly in a changing economic and technological environment. Accordingly, it is important that our university partners\u2019 educational programs continually evolve in response to those economic and technological changes.\nThe expansion of existing academic programs and the development of new programs may not be accepted by current or prospective students or by prospective employers. Even if our university partners develop acceptable new programs, they may not be able to begin offering those new programs in a timely fashion or as quickly as our competitors offer similar programs. If we are unable to adequately respond to changes in market requirements due to regulatory or financial constraints, unusually rapid technological changes or other factors, the rates at which our university partners\u2019 graduates obtain jobs in their fields of study could suffer, our ability to attract and retain students could be impaired and our business could be adversely affected.\nWe may be unable to sufficiently protect our proprietary rights and we may encounter disputes from time to time relating to our use of the intellectual property of third parties.\nWe rely on a combination of copyrights, trademarks, service marks, patents, trade secrets, domain names and agreements with employees and third parties to protect our proprietary rights. We have trademark and service mark registrations and pending applications for additional registrations in the United States and select foreign jurisdictions. In addition, we have applied for domestic and international patents for certain technology developed by us. Nonetheless, as new challenges arise in protecting these proprietary rights online, we cannot ensure that these measures will be adequate to protect our proprietary rights, that we have secured, or will be able to secure, appropriate protections for all our proprietary rights in the United States or select foreign jurisdictions, or that third parties will not infringe upon or violate our proprietary rights. Despite our efforts to protect these rights, unauthorized third parties may attempt to duplicate or copy the proprietary aspects of our technology, curricula and online resource material, among others. Our management\u2019s attention may be diverted by these attempts, and we may need to expend funds in litigation to protect our proprietary rights against any infringement or violation.\nWe may also encounter disputes from time to time over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property, and we may not prevail in these disputes. In certain instances, we may not have obtained sufficient rights to the content of a course. Third parties may raise claims against us alleging an infringement or violation of their intellectual property. Some third-party intellectual property rights may be extremely broad, and it may not be possible for us to conduct our operations in such a way as to avoid all alleged violations of such intellectual property rights. Any such intellectual property claim could subject us to costly litigation and impose a significant strain on our financial resources and management personnel regardless of whether such claim has merit. Our insurance may not cover potential claims of this type adequately or at all, and we may be required to pay monetary damages, which may be significant.\nGovernment regulations relating to the internet could increase our cost of doing business, affect our ability to grow or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe increasing use of the internet and other online services has led and may lead to the adoption of new laws and regulatory practices in the United States or in foreign countries and to new interpretations of existing laws and regulations. These new laws and interpretations may relate to issues such as online privacy, copyrights, trademarks and service marks, sales taxes, fair business practices and the requirement that online education institutions qualify to do business as foreign corporations or be licensed in one or more jurisdictions where they have no physical location or other presence. New laws, regulations or interpretations related to doing business over the internet could increase our costs and materially and adversely affect enrollments.\nA protracted economic slowdown and rising unemployment could lead to lower enrollment at our university partner.\nWe believe that many students pursue postsecondary education to be more competitive in the job market. However, a protracted economic slowdown could increase unemployment and diminish job prospects generally. Diminished job prospects and heightened financial worries could affect the willingness of students to incur loans to pay for postsecondary education and to pursue postsecondary education in general. As a result, enrollments at our university partner could suffer.\nIn addition, many students borrow Title IV loans to pay for tuition, fees and other expenses. A protracted economic slowdown could negatively impact their ability to repay those loans which would negatively impact cohort default rates. Our university partner\u2019s students also are frequently able to borrow Title IV loans in excess of their tuition. The excess is received by such students as a stipend. However, if a student withdraws, our university partner must return any unearned Title IV funds,\nincluding stipends. A protracted economic slowdown could negatively impact such students\u2019 ability to repay those stipends. As a result, the amount of Title IV funds we would have to return without reimbursement from students could increase, and our results of operations could suffer.\nThe acquisition, integration and growth of acquired businesses may present challenges that could harm our business.\nThe successful integration and profitable operation of an acquired institution or business, including the realization of anticipated cost savings and additional revenue opportunities, can present challenges, and the failure to overcome these challenges can have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. Some of these challenges include:\n\u2022the inability to maintain uniform standards, controls, policies and procedures;\n\u2022distraction of management\u2019s attention from normal business operations during the integration process;\n\u2022the inability to attract and/or retain key management personnel to operate the acquired entity;\n\u2022the inability to obtain, or delay in obtaining, regulatory or other approvals necessary to operate the business;\n\u2022the inability to correctly estimate the size of a target market or accurately assess market dynamics;\n\u2022the inability to retain the clients of the acquired entity;\n\u2022the lingering effects of poor client relations or service performance by the acquired entity, which also may negatively affect the Company\u2019s existing business;\n\u2022the inability to fully realize the desired efficiencies and economies of scale;\n\u2022expenses associated with the integration efforts; and\n\u2022unidentified issues not discovered in the due diligence process, including legal contingencies.\nAn acquisition related to an institution or other educational business often requires various regulatory approvals. If we are unable to obtain such approvals, or we obtain them on unfavorable terms, our ability to consummate a transaction may be impaired or we may be unable to operate the acquired entity in a manner that is favorable to us. If we fail to properly evaluate an acquisition, we may be required to incur costs in excess of what we anticipated, and we may not achieve the anticipated benefits of such acquisition.\nAn increase in interest rates could adversely affect our university partners' ability to attract and retain students.\nInterest rates have reached relatively low levels in recent years, creating a favorable borrowing environment for students. However, if Congress increases interest rates on Title IV loans, or if private loan interest rates rise, our university partners\u2019 students would have to pay higher interest rates on their loans. Any future increase in interest rates will result in a corresponding increase in educational costs to existing and prospective students. Higher interest rates could also contribute to higher default rates with respect to students\u2019 repayment of their education loans. Higher default rates may in turn adversely impact an institution\u2019s eligibility to participate in some or all Title IV programs, which could have a material adverse effect on enrollments and our revenues, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nOur financial results may suffer if we fail to successfully implement our restructuring plans and/or cost reduction initiatives aimed at right-sizing our operations to match revenue streams.\nWe have described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K our reductions in force which are intended to strengthen our business by right-sizing our operations to match revenue streams. We also described various restructuring charges related to these plans. If we fail to achieve the intended cost savings, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be further impacted. This plan also may have an adverse impact upon the morale or motivation of our employees and may result in further distractions to our management. In addition, management will continue to evaluate our cost structure, and additional restructuring plans may be needed. Any cost-saving measures could impact employee retention. In addition, we cannot be sure that the cost reduction will be successful in reducing our overall expenses as we expect or that additional costs, or reduced revenue, will not offset any such reductions. If our operating costs are higher than we expect or if we do not maintain adequate control of our costs and expenses, our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to effectively identify, pursue and consummate acquisitions, either in the U.S. or outside of the U.S., our ability to grow could be impacted and our profitability may be adversely affected.\nAcquisitions are one component of our overall long-term growth strategy. The successful implementation of this strategy depends upon the Company\u2019s ability to identify suitable domestic and international acquisition candidates, acquire such businesses on acceptable terms and finance such acquisitions. There can be no assurance that such candidates will be available or, if such candidates are available, that the price will be attractive or that the Company will be able to identify, acquire or finance such businesses successfully. In addition, in pursuing such acquisition opportunities, the Company may compete with other entities with similar growth strategies; these competitors may be larger and have greater financial and other resources than the Company. Competition for these acquisition targets could also result in increased prices of acquisition targets and/or a diminished pool of companies available for acquisition. There may be particular difficulties and complexities (regulatory or otherwise) associated with our expansion into international markets, and our strategies may not succeed beyond our current markets. If we are unable to effectively address these challenges, our ability to execute this component of our long-term strategy will be impaired, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to grow and our profitability.\nWe may be susceptible to a number of political, economic, and geographic risks that could harm our business. Significant disruptions in the global economic environment, as a result of a pandemic such as COVID-19, may adversely affect our business and financial results.\nThe occurrence of certain political, economic or geographic events, such as natural disasters or a pandemic, including the outbreak of COVID-19 could result in a significant decline in our revenue. We are dependent on customers that are geographically diverse and could be negatively impacted if economic conditions in the U.S. and globally were negatively impacted. Such an occurrence could cause a decrease in our university partner\u2019s enrollment, including a decline in student retention.\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 continues to grow both in the U.S. and globally, and related government and private sector responsive actions could adversely affect our business operations, including continued work-from home orders. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning the COVID-19 and the actions taken to contain it or treat its impact. We have asked our corporate employees whose jobs allow them to work remotely to do so, as deemed necessary. Such precautionary measures could create operational challenges as we adjust to a remote workforce, which could adversely impact our business. We are also dependent on customers that are geographically diverse and would be negatively impacted if economic conditions in the U.S. and globally continue to be negatively impacted and cause a decrease in our enrollment.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and may continue to do so in the future. As a result, you could lose all or part of your investment.\nVolatility in the market price of our common stock may prevent you from being able to sell your shares at or above the price you paid for your shares. The market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past, and may continue to fluctuate significantly for a variety of different reasons, including, without limitation:\n\u2022developments regarding the accreditation or state licensing of our university partners;\n\u2022our quarterly or annual earnings or those of other companies in our industry;\n\u2022public reaction to our press releases, corporate communications and SEC filings;\n\u2022changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by research analysts who track our common stock or the stocks of other companies in our industry;\n\u2022seasonal variations in our student enrollment;\n\u2022new laws or regulations or new interpretations of laws or regulations applicable to our industry or business;\n\u2022negative publicity, including government hearings and other public lawmaker or regulator criticism, regarding our industry or business;\n\u2022changes in enrollment;\n\u2022changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u2022litigation involving our company or investigations or audits by regulators into the operations of our company or our competitors;\n\u2022sales of common stock by our directors, executive officers and significant stockholders; and\n\u2022changes in general conditions in the United States and global economies or financial markets, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism or responses to such events.\nIn addition, in recent years, the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant impact on the market price of securities issued by many companies, including companies in our industry. Changes may occur without regard to the operating performance of these companies. The price of our common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with our company.\nSales of outstanding shares of our common stock into the market in the future could cause the market price of our stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.\nIf our stockholders sell, or indicate an intention to sell, substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline. At December 31, 2021, 33.5 million shares of our common stock were outstanding. In addition, as of December 31, 2021, there were 1.2 million shares of our common stock underlying outstanding stock options and 4.9 million shares of our common stock underlying outstanding stock awards, including restricted stock units and performance stock units. All shares subject to outstanding stock options are eligible for sale in the public market to the extent permitted by the provisions of the applicable stock option agreement and Rule 144 under the Securities Act. If these additional shares of common stock are sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline. Under Rule 144, shares held by non-affiliates for more than six months may generally be sold without restriction, other than a current public information requirement, and may be sold freely without any restrictions after one year. Shares held by affiliates may also be sold under Rule 144 after one year, subject to applicable restrictions, including volume and manner of sale limitations.\nIf securities or industry analysts change their recommendations regarding our common stock adversely or cease to cover our company, or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, our stock price could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business or industry. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. Moreover, if one or more of the analysts who cover our company downgrades our common stock, or if our operating results do not meet their expectations, our stock price could decline.\nWe currently do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock and, consequently, your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment in our common stock is if the price of our common stock appreciates.\nWe do not expect to pay dividends on shares of our common stock in the foreseeable future and we intend to use our cash position to grow our business. Consequently, your only opportunity to achieve a positive return on your investment in our common stock will be if the market price of our common stock appreciates.\nYour percentage ownership in the Company may be diluted by future issuances of capital stock, which could reduce your influence over matters on which stockholders vote.\nSubject to the rules of the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (\u201cNASDAQ\u201d), our board has the authority, without any action or vote of our stockholders, to issue all or any part of our authorized but unissued shares of capital stock. At December 31, 2021, there were 300.0 million shares of common stock authorized for issuance under our certificate of incorporation, 33.5 million shares of which were outstanding. At December 31, 2021, there were 20.0 million shares of preferred stock authorized for issuance under our certificate of incorporation, no shares of which were outstanding. Issuances of common stock or voting preferred stock would reduce the influence of our current stockholders over matters on which our stockholders vote and, in the case of issuances of preferred stock, would likely result in the rights of our current stockholders being subject to the prior rights of holders of that preferred stock.\nOur common stock has relatively low trading volume, compared to many other public companies.\nOur common stock trades on the NASDAQ. Our average daily trading volume over these various mediums is relatively low, particularly when compared to many larger public companies. This low trading volume can cause our common stock price to fluctuate significantly and can make it difficult for investors to buy or sell our common stock quickly and efficiently, compared to companies with a larger publicly traded float and higher average daily trading volumes.\nIf we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis could be impaired.\nWe are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and regulations of NASDAQ. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. We are required to perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in our Annual Report on Form 10-K filing for that year, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. This may require us to incur substantial additional professional fees and internal costs to further expand our accounting and finance functions and expend significant management efforts. As a smaller reporting company (as defined by the SEC), we are not required to obtain a separate attestation of our internal control over financial reporting from our independent auditors. If we are not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in a timely manner, or if we are unable to maintain proper and effective internal controls, we may not be able to produce timely and accurate financial statements. If that were to happen, the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the stock exchange on which our common stock is listed, the SEC or other regulatory authorities.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, may depress the trading price of our stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could depress the trading price of our stock by acting to discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our board that the stockholders of our company may deem advantageous. These provisions:\n\u2022authorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock by our board to increase the number of outstanding shares to discourage a takeover attempt;\n\u2022provide for a classified board (three classes);\n\u2022provide that stockholders may only remove directors for cause;\n\u2022provide that any vacancy on our board, including a vacancy resulting from an increase in the size of the board, may only be filled by the affirmative vote of a majority of our directors then in office, even if less than a quorum;\n\u2022provide that a special meeting of stockholders may only be called by our board or by our chief executive officer;\n\u2022provide that action by written consent of the stockholders may be taken only if the board first approves such action, whenever the vote of stockholders is required at a meeting for any corporate action, the meeting and vote of stockholders may be dispensed with, and the action may be taken without such meeting and vote, if a written consent is signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at the meeting of stockholders; provided that, notwithstanding the foregoing, we will hold an annual meeting of stockholders in accordance with NASDAQ rules for so long as our shares are listed on the NASDAQ, and as otherwise required by the bylaws;\n\u2022provide that the board is expressly authorized to make, alter or repeal our bylaws; and\n\u2022establish advance notice requirements for nominations for elections to our board or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nAdditionally, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any \u201cinterested\u201d stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an \u201cinterested\u201d stockholder.", "PERMNO": 92902, "SIC": 8200, "TIC": "ZVO"}
