The following are some of the more important risk factors that could affect our business.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Our Industry\nIf we are unable to predict fashion trends or react to changing consumer preferences in a timely manner, our sales will decrease.\nWe believe our success depends in substantial part on our ability to:\n\u2022\noriginate and define product and fashion trends,\n\u2022\nanticipate, predict and react to changing consumer demands in a timely manner, and\n\u2022\ntranslate market trends into desirable, saleable products far in advance of their offerings in our stores, on our websites, and in our catalogs.\nBecause we enter into commitments for the manufacture and purchase of merchandise well in advance of the season in which merchandise will be sold, we are vulnerable to changes in consumer demand, pricing shifts and suboptimal merchandise selection and timing of merchandise purchases. We attempt to mitigate the risks of changing fashion trends and product acceptance in part by devoting a portion of our product line to classic styles that are not significantly modified from year to year. Nevertheless, if we misjudge the market for our products or overall level of consumer demand, we may be faced with significant excess inventories for some products and missed opportunities for others. Our brands\u2019 images may also suffer if customers believe we are no longer able to offer the latest fashions or if we fail to address and respond to customer feedback or complaints. The occurrence of these events, among others, could hurt our financial results and liquidity by decreasing sales. We may respond by increasing markdowns or initiating marketing promotions to reduce excess inventory, which would further decrease our gross profits and net income.\nUnfavorable economic conditions could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nEconomic conditions around the world can impact our customers and affect the general business environment in which we operate and compete. Our results can be impacted by a number of macroeconomic factors, including, but not limited to, consumer confidence and spending levels, employment rates, consumer credit availability, fuel and energy costs, raw materials costs, global factory production, commercial real estate market conditions, credit market conditions, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, taxation, the level of customer traffic in malls and shopping centers and changing demographic patterns.\nThe specialty retail industry in which we operate is cyclical and demand for our merchandise is significantly impacted by negative trends in consumer confidence and other economic factors affecting consumer spending behavior, including the level of disposable consumer income, the availability of consumer credit, interest rates, foreign exchange rates, taxation and demographic patterns. Because apparel and accessories generally are discretionary purchases, consumer purchases of our products may decline during recessionary periods or when disposable income is lower. As a result, our sales, growth and profitability may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic conditions at a regional, national or international level. In addition, unfavorable economic conditions abroad may impact our ability to meet quality and production goals.\nPeriods of economic uncertainty or volatility make it difficult to plan, budget and forecast our business. Incorrect assumptions concerning economic trends, customer requirements, distribution models, demand forecasts, interest rate trends and availability of resources may result in our failure to accurately forecast results and to achieve forecasted results or budget targets.\nWe believe that our current cash balance, cash flow from operations and availability under our senior secured credit facilities, provide us with sufficient liquidity. However, a decrease in liquidity of our customers and suppliers could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and liquidity.\nWe operate in the highly competitive specialty retail industry, and the size and resources of some of our competitors may allow them to compete more effectively than we can, which could result in loss of our market share.\nWe face intense competition in the specialty retail industry. We compete primarily with specialty retailers, department stores and e-commerce businesses that engage in the sale of women\u2019s, men\u2019s and children\u2019s apparel, accessories, and similar merchandise, some of whom are or may become our wholesale customers. We compete on quality, design, customer service and price. We are not in the \u201cfast fashion\u201d business but it appears that an increasing number of customers are attracted to the aggressive pricing strategies of those retailers. Many of our competitors are, and many of our potential competitors may be, larger and have greater financial, marketing and other resources, devote greater resources to the marketing and sale of their products, generate greater international brand recognition or adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we can. A number of our competitors are continuing to operate with a promotional business strategy, both in-store and online. This promotional environment has negatively impacted our revenues and gross profit and may continue to do so in the future. In addition, consumers are increasingly seeking retail experiences which emphasize value, personalization and an omni-channel environment where the store, mobile and online shopping experience is tightly integrated. While we are working to meet these evolving customer expectations, there can be no assurance that we will do so effectively or without incurring substantial expense, which could impact our results of operations and liquidity.\nWe rely on the experience and skills of key personnel, the loss of whom could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe believe we benefit substantially from the leadership and strategic guidance of our Chief Executive Officer and other key executives, who are primarily responsible for executing our strategy. The loss, for any reason, of the services of any of these individuals and any negative market or industry perception arising from such loss could have a material adverse effect on our business. Our key executives have substantial experience and expertise in the specialty retail industry and have made significant contributions to our growth and success. The unexpected loss of one or more of these individuals could delay the development and introduction of, and harm our ability to sell, our merchandise. In addition, products we develop without the guidance and direction of these key personnel may not receive the same level of acceptance. For example, our former Chief Executive Officer resigned as of July 10, 2017, but remained as Chairman of the Board of Directors. In addition, certain other members of our management team have departed in recent years. Such changes, or any future changes in our management team, may create uncertainty in our business and future strategic direction.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain key personnel. Competition for this experienced talent is intense, and we may not be able to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel in the future.\nOur expanded product offerings, new sales channels, new brands, new sub-brands and concepts and international expansion may not be successful, and implementation of these strategies may divert our operational, managerial, financial and administrative resources, which could impact our competitive position.\nWe have grown our business in recent years by expanding our product offerings, sales channels, brands, sub-brands and concepts, including launching J.Crew Mercantile, opening stores in Canada, the United Kingdom and Hong Kong and expanding our international e-commerce business. In the future we may continue to make changes to our business, including by expanding our wholesale business and developing additional brands, sub-brands and concepts. These strategies involve various risks, including:\n\u2022\nimplementation may be delayed or may not be successful,\n\u2022\nif our expanded product offerings and sales channels or our international growth efforts fail to maintain and enhance the distinctive identity of our brands and sub-brands, their images may be diminished and our sales may decrease,\n\u2022\nif customers do not respond to these brands, sub-brands and concepts, product offerings and sales channels as anticipated, these strategies may not be profitable on a larger scale, and\n\u2022\nimplementation of these plans may divert management\u2019s attention from other aspects of our business, increase costs and place a strain on our management, operational and financial resources, as well as our information systems.\nIn addition, our new product offerings, new brands, sub-brands and concepts, new sales channels and international expansion may be affected by, among other things, economic, demographic and competitive conditions, changes in consumer spending patterns and changes in consumer preferences and style trends. Further rollout of these strategies could be delayed or abandoned, could cost more than anticipated and could divert resources from other areas of our business, any of which could impact our competitive position and reduce our revenue and profitability.\nOur growth strategy depends on the successful execution of our efforts to grow our brands, develop our omni-channel shopping experience and expand internationally.\nOur customers are seeking an omni-channel shopping experience through the integration of store and digital shopping channels. We have implemented systems to manage our inventory efficiently across all channels, to ship merchandise from stores to customers and use social media to interact with our customers to enhance their shopping experiences. However, these initiatives involve significant investments in information technology systems and significant operational changes, and the rapid pace of technological change may require us to incur costs to implement new systems and platforms to provide a desirable shopping experience for our customers. We may not be successful in developing or acquiring technology that is competitive and responsive to the needs of our customers and might lack sufficient resources to make the necessary investments in technology to compete with our competitors. In addition, our competitors are also investing in omni-channel capabilities, some of which may be more successful than our initiatives. If we do not implement and expand our omni-channel initiatives successfully or we do not realize our anticipated return on these investments, then our operating results could be negatively impacted and we could fail to meet our strategic and financial goals.\nOur growth strategy also includes international expansion of our brands. We have stores in Canada, the United Kingdom and Hong Kong and expanded our online presence to approximately 100 countries. We may open stores in additional countries in the future where brand recognition may be limited. We do not have experience operating in these regions and we will face established competition in most of these markets. Many of these countries have different operational and legal requirements, including, but not limited to, employment and labor, transportation, logistics, real estate, product labelling, product safety, consumer protection, data privacy and local reporting requirements. Consumer tastes, sizes and trends may differ from country to country and there may be seasonal differences, which, if we do not anticipate, may result in lower sales and/or margins for our products. Our success internationally could also be adversely impacted by the global economy, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, changes in diplomatic or trade relationships, political instability and foreign government regulation.\nIn addition, as we continue to expand our overseas operations, we are subject to certain U.S. laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, in addition to the laws of the foreign countries in which we operate. We must use all commercially reasonable efforts to ensure our associates and agents comply with these laws. If any of our associates or agents violate such laws we could become subject to sanctions or other penalties that could negatively affect our reputation, business and operating results.\nAs we execute our growth strategies, we may not adequately manage the related organizational changes needed for successful execution. In addition, we may distract key resources related to our core business as a result of the focus on growth strategies.\nAny material disruption of our information systems, or failure to maintain and develop our information systems, could disrupt our business and reduce our sales.\nWe are increasingly dependent on information systems to operate our websites, process transactions, respond to customer inquiries, manage inventory, purchase, sell and ship goods on a timely basis and maintain cost-efficient operations. Previously, we have experienced system interruptions which temporarily impaired our ability to capture, process and ship customer orders, and transfer product between channels. We may experience operational problems with our information systems as a result of system failures, viruses, computer \u201chackers\u201d or other causes. Any material disruption or slowdown of our systems, including a disruption or slowdown caused by our failure to successfully upgrade our systems, could cause information, including data related to customer orders, to be lost or delayed which could, especially if the disruption or slowdown occurred during the holiday season, result in delays in the delivery of merchandise to our stores and customers or lost sales, which could reduce demand for our merchandise and cause our sales to decline. In addition, if changes in technology cause our information systems to become obsolete, or if our information systems are inadequate to handle our growth, we could lose customers. We are also subject to risks and uncertainties associated with the Internet, including changes in required technology interfaces, website downtime and other technical failures. Our failure to successfully respond to these risks and uncertainties could reduce sales, increase costs and damage the reputation of our brands.\nManagement uses information systems to support decision making and to monitor business performance. We may fail to generate accurate and complete financial and operational reports essential for making decisions at various levels of management, which could lead to decisions being made that have adverse results. Failure to adopt systematic procedures to initiate change requests, test changes, document changes, and authorize changes to systems and processes prior to deployment may result in unsuccessful changes and could disrupt our business and reduce sales. In addition, if we do not maintain adequate controls such as reconciliations, segregation of duties and verification to prevent errors or incomplete information, our ability to operate our business could be limited.\nIn addition, we interact with many of our customers through our websites. We have an online presence in approximately 100 countries. Customers increasingly utilize our online and mobile services to purchase our merchandise. If we are unable to continue to provide consumers a user-friendly experience and evolve our platform to satisfy consumer preferences, the growth of our e-commerce business and our sales may be negatively impacted. If our websites contain errors or other vulnerabilities which impede or halt service, it could result in damage to our brands\u2019 images and a loss of revenue.\nCompromises of our data security could cause us to incur unexpected expenses and loss of revenues and may materially harm our reputation and business.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store certain personal information from individuals, such as our customers and employees, and we process customer payment card and check information. We rely on commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmission and storage of confidential information. There can be no assurance that we will not suffer a data compromise, that unauthorized parties will not gain access to personal information, or that any such data compromise or access will be discovered in a timely way. Further, the systems currently used for transmission and approval of payment card transactions, and the technology utilized in payment cards themselves, all of which can put payment card data at risk, are determined and controlled by the payment card industry, not by us. Computer hackers may attempt to penetrate our computer system and, if successful, misappropriate personal information, payment card or check information or confidential business information of our Company. In addition, there may be non-technical issues, such as our employees, contractors or third parties with whom we do business or to whom we outsource business operations may attempt to circumvent our security measures in order to misappropriate such information, and may purposefully or inadvertently cause a breach involving such information. Advances in computer and software capabilities, new tools and other developments may increase the risk of such a breach. The retail industry in particular has been the target of recent cyber-attacks, which are becoming increasingly difficult to anticipate and prevent due to their rapidly evolving nature. Data privacy and information security is regulated at the international, federal and state levels, and compliance with any changes in the laws and regulations enacted by these governments will likely increase the cost of doing business.\nCompromises of our data security or of third parties with whom we do business, failures to prevent or mitigate the loss of personal or business information and delays in detecting or providing prompt notice of any such compromise or loss could disrupt our operations, damage our reputation and customers\u2019 willingness to shop in our stores, violate applicable laws, regulations, orders and agreements, and subject us to litigation and additional costs and liabilities which could be material.\nIf we fail to maintain the value of our brands and protect our trademarks, our sales are likely to decline.\nOur success depends on the value of the J.Crew and Madewell brands and our corporate reputation. The J.Crew and Madewell names are integral to our business as well as to the implementation of our strategies for expanding our business. Maintaining, promoting and positioning our brands will depend largely on the success of our marketing and merchandising efforts and our ability to provide a consistent, high quality customer experience. Our brands could be adversely affected if we fail to achieve these objectives or if our public image or reputation were to be tarnished by negative publicity through traditional or social media platforms. Any of these events could result in decreases in sales.\nThe J.Crew and Madewell trademarks and variations thereon, such as crewcuts and J.Crew Mercantile, are valuable assets that are critical to our success. We intend to continue to vigorously protect our trademarks against infringement, but we may not be successful in doing so. The unauthorized reproduction or other misappropriation of our trademarks would diminish the value of our brands, which could reduce demand for our products or the prices at which we can sell our products.\nOur real estate strategy may not be successful, and store locations may fail to produce desired results, which could impact our competitive position and profitability.\nWe contracted our store base by 41 net fewer stores in fiscal 2017. We regularly evaluate our existing store base and seek to identify opportunities, where available, to renegotiate the terms of those leases. The success of our business depends, in part, on our ability to maintain profitable store locations and renew our existing store leases on terms that meet our financial targets. Our ability to open new stores on schedule or at all, to renew our existing store leases on favorable terms or to operate them on a profitable basis will depend on various factors, including our ability to:\n\u2022\nidentify suitable markets for new stores and available store locations,\n\u2022\nanticipate the impact of changing economic and demographic conditions for new and existing store locations,\n\u2022\nnegotiate acceptable lease terms for new locations or renewal terms for existing locations,\n\u2022\nhire and train qualified sales associates,\n\u2022\ndevelop new merchandise and manage inventory effectively to meet the needs of new and existing stores on a timely basis,\n\u2022\nfoster current relationships and develop new relationships with vendors that are capable of supplying the required volume of merchandise, and\n\u2022\navoid construction delays and cost overruns in connection with the build-out of new stores.\nNew stores and stores with renewed lease terms may not produce anticipated levels of revenue even though they increase our costs. As a result, our expenses as a percentage of sales would increase and our competitive position and profitability would be adversely affected. In addition, if we determine that it is no longer economically beneficial to operate a store and decide to close it, we may remain obligated under the applicable lease for, among other things, payment of the base rent for the balance of the lease term. Our lease obligations with respect to closed stores could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nReductions in the volume of mall traffic or closing of shopping malls as a result of unfavorable economic conditions or changing demographic patterns could significantly reduce our sales and leave us with excess inventory.\nMost of our stores are located in shopping malls or outlet centers. Sales at these stores are derived, in part, from the volume of traffic in those locations. Our stores benefit from the ability of the malls\u2019 \u201canchor\u201d tenants, generally large department stores and other area attractions, to generate consumer traffic in the vicinity of our stores. Unfavorable economic conditions and changes in consumer behavior, particularly in certain regions, have adversely affected mall traffic and resulted in the closing of certain anchor stores and has threatened the viability of certain commercial real estate firms which operate major shopping malls. A continuation of this trend, including failure of a large commercial landlord or continued declines in the popularity of mall shopping generally among our customers, would reduce our sales and leave us with excess inventory. We may respond by increasing markdowns or initiating marketing promotions to reduce excess inventory, which would further decrease our gross profits and net income.\nOur inability to maintain or increase comparable company sales could cause our earnings to decline.\nIf our future comparable company sales fail to meet expectations, our earnings could decline. In addition, our results have significantly fluctuated in the past and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future. For example, in the previous three fiscal years, our quarterly comparable company sales changes have ranged from a decrease of 3.1% to a decrease of 11.4%. A variety of factors affect comparable company sales, including fashion trends, competition, current economic conditions, pricing, inflation, the timing of the release of new merchandise and promotional events, changes in our merchandise mix, the success of marketing programs, timing and level of markdowns and weather conditions.\nIn addition, the softening apparel demand in recent years has led to a more promotional environment across the specialty retail industry, which has impacted our promotional posture and our gross margins. In addition, this promotional pricing may have a negative effect on our brands\u2019 images, which may be difficult to counteract even as the economy improves.\nVarious regions of the country experience extreme weather patterns. Natural disasters and other adverse weather conditions have caused and may continue to cause a greater number of store closures or lost revenue than we have historically experienced.\nAll of these factors may cause our comparable company sales to be materially lower than previous periods and our expectations, which could impact our ability to leverage fixed expenses, such as store rent and store asset depreciation, which may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nInterruption in our foreign sourcing operations could disrupt production, shipment or receipt of our merchandise, which would result in lost sales and could increase our costs.\nWe do not own or operate any manufacturing facilities and therefore depend upon independent third party vendors for the manufacture of all of our products. Our products are manufactured to our specifications primarily by factories outside of the United States. We cannot control all of the various factors, which include inclement weather, natural disasters, political and financial instability, strikes, health concerns regarding infectious diseases, and acts of terrorism that might affect a manufacturer\u2019s ability to ship orders of our products in a timely manner or to meet our quality standards. Inadequate labor conditions, health or safety issues in the factories where goods are produced can negatively impact our brands reputations. Late delivery of products or delivery of products that do not meet our quality standards could cause us to miss the delivery date requirements of our customers or delay timely delivery of merchandise to our stores or our wholesale customers for those items. These events could cause us to fail to meet customer expectations, cause our retail or wholesale customers to cancel orders or cause us to be unable to deliver merchandise in sufficient quantities or of sufficient quality to our stores or our wholesale customers, which could result in lost sales.\nIn fiscal 2017, approximately 98% of our merchandise was sourced from foreign factories. In particular, approximately 58% of our merchandise was sourced from China and Hong Kong. Any event causing a sudden disruption of manufacturing or imports from Asia or elsewhere, including changes to U.S. and foreign trade policies, including the enactment of tariffs, border adjustment taxes or increases in duties or quotas applicable to our merchandise, could materially harm our operations. We have no long-term merchandise supply contracts, and many of our imports are subject to existing or potential duties, tariffs or quotas that may limit the quantity of certain types of goods that may be imported into the United States from countries in Asia or elsewhere. We compete with other companies for production facilities and import quota capacity. While substantially all of our foreign purchases of our products are negotiated and paid for in U.S. dollars, the cost of our products may be affected by fluctuations in the value of relevant foreign currencies. Our business is also subject to a variety of other risks generally associated with doing business abroad, such as political instability, economic conditions, disruption of imports by labor disputes and local business practices.\nIn addition to manufacturing in China, we are also engaging in growing the amount of production in other developing countries. These other countries may present greater risks than China with regards to infrastructure to support manufacturing, labor and employee relations, political and economic stability, corruption, environmental, health and safety compliance. While we endeavor to monitor and audit facilities where our production is done, any significant events with factories we use can adversely impact our reputation, brand, and product delivery.\nIncreases in the demand for, or the price of, raw materials used to manufacture our products or other fluctuations in sourcing or distribution costs could increase our costs and hurt our profitability.\nThe raw materials used to manufacture our products are subject to availability constraints and price volatility caused by high demand for fabrics, weather, supply conditions, government regulations, economic climate and other unpredictable factors. In addition, our sourcing costs may also fluctuate due to labor conditions, transportation or freight costs, energy prices, currency fluctuations or other unpredictable factors. Further, the cost of labor at many of our third party manufacturers and the cost of transportation have been increasing and it is unlikely that such cost pressures will abate.\nMost of our products are shipped from our vendors by ocean. If a disruption occurs in the operation of ports through which our products are imported, we may incur increased costs related to air freight or to alternative ports. Shipping by air is significantly more expensive than shipping by ocean and our margins and profitability could be reduced. Shipping to alternative ports could also lead to delays in receipt of our products.\nWe believe that we have strong vendor relationships and we are working with our suppliers to manage cost increases. Our overall profitability depends, in part, on the success of our ability to mitigate rising costs or shortages of raw materials used to manufacture our products.\nAny significant interruption in the operations of our customer call, order fulfillment and distribution centers could disrupt our ability to process customer orders and to deliver our merchandise in a timely manner.\nA substantial portion of our e-commerce order fulfillment operations are housed in a single facility along with one of our customer call centers, while distribution operations for our stores are housed in another single facility. Although we maintain back-up systems for these facilities and have capabilities to bypass our distribution centers with a portion of our goods, we may not be able to prevent a significant interruption in our operations if one or both of these facilities were impacted by a natural disaster, accident, failure of the inventory locator or automated packing and shipping systems we use or other events. We have experienced interruptions in the past in connection with our website systems and while we have stabilized these systems, there can be no assurance that future interruptions will not occur. Any significant interruption in the operation of these facilities, including an interruption caused by our failure to successfully expand or upgrade our systems or manage our transition to utilizing the expansions or upgrades, could reduce our ability to receive and process orders and provide products and services to our stores and our wholesale and retail customers, which could result in lost sales, cancelled sales and a loss of loyalty to our brand.\nThird party failure to deliver merchandise to our distribution centers, stores and retail or wholesale customers or a disruption or adverse condition affecting our distribution centers could result in lost sales or reduced demand for our merchandise.\nOur success depends on the timely receipt of merchandise from our vendors to our distribution centers, and timely delivery of merchandise from our distribution centers to stores and retail or wholesale customers. Independent third party transportation companies deliver our merchandise to our distribution centers, stores and customers. Some of these third parties employ personnel represented by labor unions. Disruptions in the delivery of merchandise or work stoppages by employees of these third parties could delay the timely receipt of merchandise, which could result in cancelled sales, a loss of loyalty to our brands, increased logistics costs and excess inventory.\nWe currently operate two of our own distribution centers in North Carolina and Virginia. Timely receipt of merchandise by our distribution centers, stores and customers may also be affected by factors such as inclement weather, natural disasters, accidents, system failures and acts of terrorism. We may respond by increasing markdowns or initiating marketing promotions, which would decrease our gross profits and net income. Inability to recover from a business interruption and return to normal operations within a reasonable period of time could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and damage our brand reputation.\nOur ability to source our merchandise profitably or at all could be hurt if new trade restrictions are imposed, existing trade restrictions become more burdensome or disruption occur at our suppliers or at the ports.\nTrade restrictions, including increased tariffs, safeguards or quotas, on apparel and accessories could increase the cost or reduce the supply of merchandise available to us. We source our merchandise through buying agents and, increasingly, by purchasing directly from trading companies and manufacturers, predominately in Asia. The investments we are making to develop our direct sourcing capabilities may not be successful and may, in turn, have an adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations.\nThere are quotas and trade restrictions on certain categories of goods and apparel from China and countries that are not subject to the World Trade Organization Agreement, which could have a significant impact on our sourcing patterns in the future. In addition, political uncertainty in the United States may result in significant changes to United States trade policies, treaties and tariffs, including trade policies and tariffs regarding China, including the potential disallowance of tax deductions for imported merchandise or the imposition of unilateral tariffs on imported products. These developments, or the perception that any of them could occur, may have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets, and may significantly reduce global trade and, in particular, trade between these nations and the United States. Any of these factors could depress economic activity, restrict our sourcing from suppliers and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and affect our strategy in the Asia and elsewhere around the world. We cannot predict whether any of the countries in which our merchandise is currently manufactured or may be manufactured in the future will be subject to additional trade restrictions imposed by the U.S. and foreign governments, nor can we predict the likelihood, type or effect of any such restrictions. Trade restrictions, including increased tariffs or quotas, embargoes, safeguards and customs restrictions against apparel items could increase the cost, delay shipping or reduce the supply of apparel available to us or may require us to modify our current business practices, any of which could hurt our profitability.\nWe rely on our suppliers to manufacture and ship the products they produce for us in a timely manner. We also rely on the free flow of goods through open and operational ports worldwide. Labor disputes at various ports or at our suppliers could increase costs for us and delay our receipt of merchandise, particularly if these disputes result in work slowdowns, lockouts, strikes or other disruptions.\nIf our independent manufacturers do not use ethical business practices or comply with applicable laws and regulations, our brands could be harmed due to negative publicity.\nWhile our internal and vendor operating guidelines, as outlined in our Vendor Code of Conduct, promote ethical business practices and we, along with third parties that we retain for this purpose, monitor compliance with those guidelines, we do not control our independent manufacturers. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee their compliance with our guidelines. Our Vendor Code of Conduct is designed to ensure that each of our suppliers\u2019 operations is conducted in a legal, ethical, and responsible manner. Our Vendor Code of Conduct requires that each of our suppliers operates in compliance with applicable wage benefit, working hours and other local laws, and forbids the use of practices such as child labor or forced labor.\nViolation of labor or other laws by our independent manufacturers, or the divergence of an independent manufacturer\u2019s practices from those generally accepted as ethical in the United States could diminish the value of the J.Crew and Madewell brands and reduce demand for our merchandise if, as a result of such violation, we were to attract negative publicity.\nWe are subject to customs, advertising, consumer protection, data privacy, product safety, zoning and occupancy and labor and employment laws that could require us to modify our current business practices, incur increased costs or harm our reputation if we do not comply.\nWe are subject to numerous laws and regulations, including customs, truth-in-advertising, consumer protection, general data privacy, health information privacy, identity theft, online privacy, product safety, unsolicited commercial communication and zoning and occupancy laws and ordinances that regulate retailers generally and/or govern the importation, promotion and sale of merchandise and the operation of retail stores and warehouse facilities. If these regulations were to change or were violated by our management, associates, suppliers, buying agents or trading companies, the costs of certain goods could increase, or we could experience delays in shipments of our goods, be subject to fines or penalties, or suffer reputational harm, which could reduce demand for our merchandise and hurt our business and results of operations. Failure to protect personally identifiable information of our customers or associates could subject us to considerable reputational harm as well as significant fines, penalties and sanctions. In addition, changes in federal and state minimum wage laws and other laws relating to employee benefits could cause us to incur additional wage and benefits costs, which could hurt our profitability.\nLegal requirements frequently change and are subject to interpretation, and we are unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on our operations. Failure to define clear roles and responsibilities or to regularly communicate with and train our associates may result in noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations. We may be required to make significant expenditures or modify our business practices to comply with existing or future laws and regulations, which may increase our costs and materially limit our ability to operate our business. We expect the costs of compliance and risks to our business in this area to increase as we expand our international and e-commerce business.\nOur financial results could be adversely impacted by currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nOur international revenues are a small percentage of our business that may increase as we expand internationally. As a result, our future revenues and results of operations could be impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Revenues and certain expenses in markets outside the United States are recognized in local foreign currencies, and we are exposed to potential gains or losses from the translation of those amounts into U.S. dollars for consolidation into our financial statements. In addition, our international subsidiaries transact in currencies other than their functional currency, primarily in respect of inventory purchases denominated in U.S. dollars, which could result in foreign currency transaction gains or losses. Finally, our vendors and suppliers may also be impacted by currency exchange rate fluctuations with respect to the purchase of fabric and other raw materials.\nFluctuations in our results of operations for the fourth fiscal quarter would have a disproportionate effect on our overall financial condition and results of operations.\nOur revenues are generally lower during the first and second fiscal quarters. In addition, any factors that harm our fourth fiscal quarter operating results, including adverse weather or unfavorable economic conditions, could have a disproportionate effect on our results of operations for the entire fiscal year.\nIn order to prepare for our peak shopping season, we must order and keep in stock significantly more merchandise than we would carry at other times of the year. Any unanticipated decrease in demand for our products during our peak shopping season could require us to sell excess inventory at a substantial markdown, which could reduce our net sales and gross profit. Additional unplanned decreases in demand for our products could produce further reductions to our net sales and gross profit.\nOur quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of other factors, including the timing of store openings or closings and the revenues generated by new stores or lost by closed stores, merchandise mix and the timing and level of inventory markdowns. As a result, historical period-to-period comparisons of our revenues and operating results are not necessarily indicative of future period-to-period results.\nWe have recognized substantial goodwill and intangible asset impairment losses in the past and may be required to recognize additional non-cash impairment losses in the future.\nCertain factors, including consumer spending levels, industry and macroeconomic conditions, and the future profitability of our businesses, might have a negative impact on the carrying value of our goodwill, intangible assets and fixed assets. We could experience material impairment losses in the future. For example, during fiscal 2015, we recorded non-cash impairment charges of $1,382 million related to goodwill allocated to our J.Crew reporting unit, the intangible asset for our J.Crew trade name and certain long-lived assets. Although an impairment charge would be a non-cash expense, any impairment charges could materially increase our expenses and reduce our profitability. The process of testing goodwill and intangible assets for impairment involves numerous judgments, assumptions and estimates made by management including expected future profitability, cash flows and the fair values of assets and liabilities, which inherently reflect a high degree of uncertainty and may be affected by significant variability. If the business climate deteriorates, then actual results may not be consistent with these judgments, assumptions and estimates, and our goodwill and intangible assets may become impaired in future periods. This would in turn have an adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations.\nWe may be a party to legal proceedings in the future that could adversely affect our business.\nFrom time to time, like others in the retail industry, we are a party to legal proceedings, including matters involving personnel and employment issues, personal injury, intellectual property, consumer protection, consumer accessibility and other proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. In addition, there are an increasing number of cases being filed in the retail industry, including those that we have been subject to or may be subject to in the future, that contain class and representative action allegations, such as those relating to data privacy and wage and hour laws. We evaluate our exposure to these legal proceedings and establish reserves for the estimated liabilities in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Assessing and predicting the outcome of these matters involves substantial uncertainties. Although not currently anticipated by management, unexpected outcomes in these legal proceedings, or changes in management\u2019s evaluations or predictions and accompanying changes in established reserves, could have a material adverse impact on our financial results.\nWe could be subject to changes in our tax rates and the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation or exposed to additional tax liabilities in connection with our international operations, which could negatively impact our financial results.\nWe are subject to taxes in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions where our international subsidiaries are organized. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. Our future effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation, including in the U.S.\nWe are also subject to the examination of our tax returns and other tax matters by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If our effective tax rates were to increase, particularly in the U.S., or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, then our operating results, cash flows, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nIn December 2017, President Donald Trump signed into law new legislation that significantly revises the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Such changes include a reduction in the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and limitations on certain corporate deductions and credits, including significant limitations on the deductibility of interest, among other changes. Notwithstanding the reduction in the corporate income tax rate, the overall impact of the new federal tax law is expected to have a negative impact on our results of operations, which may be material.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness and Certain Other Obligations\nOur substantial indebtedness and lease obligations could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations and make strategic investments, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate debt and prevent us from meeting our obligations under our indebtedness.\nWe are highly leveraged. The total indebtedness of J.Crew and its subsidiaries at February 3, 2018 was $1,735 million, consisting of borrowings under our term loan credit facility, as amended and restated on March 5, 2014 and as further amended on July 13, 2017 (the \u201cTerm Loan Facility\u201d), and borrowings under the New Notes (as defined below). We can also borrow up to $350 million under our senior secured asset-based revolving line of credit, dated as of March 7, 2011 (as amended through and including November 17, 2016, the \u201cABL Facility\u201d, and together with our Term Loan Facility, the \u201cSenior Credit Facilities\u201d), subject to a borrowing base limitation. As of February 3, 2018, our Senior Credit Facilities also allowed uncommitted incremental facilities in an aggregate amount of $170 million consisting of $70 million available as incremental term loan facilities and $100 million available as increased commitments under our ABL Facility.\nOn November 4, 2013, PIK Notes Issuer, an indirect parent holding company of Group, issued $500 million of PIK Notes.\nOn July 13, 2017, as part of a series of interrelated significant liability management transactions, we completed (1) a private exchange offer pursuant to which $565.7 million aggregate principal amount of PIK Notes were exchanged for $249.6 million of Exchange Notes issued by J.Crew Brand, LLC and J.Crew Brand Corp. and shares of preferred and common stock of the Parent, (2) the issuance of $97 million aggregate principal amount of an additional series of 13% Senior Secured Notes due 2021 issued by issued by J.Crew Brand, LLC and J.Crew Brand Corp. and (3) the raising of additional borrowings under the Term Loan Facility of $30 million (at a 2% discount), the net proceeds of which were applied to finance the repurchase of $150 million principal amount of term loans.\nWe also have, and will continue to have, significant lease obligations. As of February 3, 2018, our minimum annual rental obligations under long-term operating leases for fiscal 2018 and fiscal 2019 are $178 million and $152 million, respectively.\nOur high degree of leverage and significant lease obligations could have important consequences for our creditors. For example, they could:\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital (including vendor payment terms), capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes;\n\u2022\nrestrict us from making strategic investments or cause us to make non-strategic divestitures;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to adjust to changing market conditions and place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who are not as highly leveraged;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nrequire a substantial portion of our cash flow to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations, capital expenditures and future strategic initiatives.\nWe expect to pay interest of approximately $125 million in fiscal 2018.\nOur debt agreements contain restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business.\nThe Senior Credit Facilities contain various covenants that limit the ability of J.Crew and our other subsidiaries to engage in specified types of transactions. These covenants limit our ability and the ability of J.Crew, Chinos Intermediate Holdings B, Inc. (\u201cIntermediate Holdings B\u201d) and our restricted subsidiaries to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur or guarantee additional debt;\n\u2022\npay dividends, including those paid to the Issuer to fund debt service obligations, or distributions on our capital stock or redeem, repurchase or retire our capital stock or indebtedness;\n\u2022\nissue stock of subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments, loans, advances and acquisitions;\n\u2022\ncreate liens on our assets to secure debt;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nmerge or consolidate with another company; and\n\u2022\nsell or otherwise transfer assets.\nIn addition, under our Senior Credit Facilities, we are required to meet specified financial ratios in order to undertake certain actions, under the Term Loan Facility, beginning with the fiscal quarter ending on or about November 2, 2019, we are subject to a maximum total leverage ratio at the end of each fiscal quarter and under the ABL Facility in certain circumstances, we may be required to maintain certain levels of excess availability or meet a specified fixed charge coverage ratio. Our ability to meet those tests can be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure you that we will meet them. A breach of any of these covenants in any Senior Credit Facility could result in a default under such Senior Credit Facility and, in some cases, the other Senior Credit Facility. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under any Senior Credit Facility, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under such Senior Credit Facility to be immediately due and payable and terminate all commitments to extend further credit. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders under the applicable Senior Credit Facilities could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure such indebtedness. Intermediate Holdings B, J.Crew and certain of J.Crew\u2019s subsidiaries have pledged substantially all of their assets, including, in the case of Intermediate Holdings B, a pledge of the capital stock of J.Crew, as collateral under the Senior Credit Facilities. If the lenders under any Senior Secured Credit Facility accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we may not have sufficient assets to repay that Senior Credit Facility, as well as our other secured and unsecured indebtedness.\nTo service our indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash and our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control.\nOur ability to make cash payments on and to refinance our indebtedness and to fund working capital and planned capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate sufficient operating cash flow in the future. This ability is, to a significant extent, subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.\nOur business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations, and future borrowings may not be available under our Senior Credit Facilities, in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness, or to fund our other liquidity needs. In any such circumstance, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness. We may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness, including our Senior Credit Facilities, on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we cannot service our indebtedness, we may have to take actions such as selling assets, seeking additional equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions and investments. Any such action, if necessary, may not be effected on commercially reasonable terms or at all. The credit agreements governing our Senior Credit Facilities contain restrictions on our ability to sell certain assets and limit the use of the proceeds from such sales.\nIf we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or are otherwise unable to obtain funds necessary to meet required payments of principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness, or if we otherwise fail to comply with the various covenants in the instruments governing our indebtedness (including covenants in our Senior Credit Facilities), we could be in default under the terms of the agreements governing such indebtedness. In the event of such default, the holders of such indebtedness could elect to declare all the funds borrowed thereunder to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest, the lenders under our Senior Credit Facilities could elect to terminate their commitments thereunder, cease making further loans and institute foreclosure proceedings against our assets, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation. If we breach our covenants under the credit agreements governing our Senior Credit Facilities and are required to seek a waiver, we may not be able to obtain a waiver from the required lenders on acceptable terms, or at all. If this occurs, we would be in default under our Senior Credit Facilities, the lenders could exercise their rights, as described above, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nBorrowings pursuant to our Term Loan Facility bear interest at floating rates based on LIBOR, but in no event less than the floor rate of 1.00%, plus the applicable margin. Accordingly, fluctuations in market interest rates may increase or decrease our interest expense which will in turn, increase or decrease our net income and cash flow. We hedge a portion of our interest rate risk related to floating rate indebtedness by entering into interest rate swaps. While limiting exposure to interest rate increases, these instruments may not fully mitigate our risk or may not be effective. For more information on our interest rate swaps, see note 9 in the consolidated financial statements.", "PERMNO": 91302, "SIC": 5621, "TIC": "0190A"}
