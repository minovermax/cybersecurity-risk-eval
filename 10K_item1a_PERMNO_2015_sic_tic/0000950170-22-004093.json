Risk Factors.\nRISK FACTORS\nYou should consider carefully the risks described below, as well as the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before deciding whether to purchase, hold or sell shares of our common stock. The occurrence of any of the following risks could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or growth prospects or cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements we have made in this report and those we may make from time to time. You should consider all of the factors described as well as the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d when evaluating our business. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In these circumstances, the market price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our business operations.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Development, Commercialization and Regulatory Approval of the Company\u2019s Investigational Therapies\nThe Company\u2019s business depends on the successful clinical development, regulatory approval and commercialization of LB1148.\nThe success of the Company\u2019s business, including its ability to finance itself and generate revenue in the future, primarily depends on the successful development, regulatory approval and commercialization of LB1148. The clinical and commercial success of LB1148 depends on a number of factors, including the following:\n\u2022timely and successful completion of required clinical trials not yet initiated, which may be significantly slower or costlier than the Company currently anticipates and/or produce results that do not achieve the endpoints of the trials;\n\u2022whether the Company is required by the FDA or similar foreign regulatory agencies to conduct additional studies beyond those planned to support the approval and commercialization of LB1148;\n\u2022submission and approval of regulatory filings by the FDA for LB1148;\n\u2022achieving and maintaining, and, where applicable, ensuring that the Company\u2019s third-party contractors achieve and maintain compliance with their contractual obligations and with all regulatory requirements applicable to LB1148;\n\u2022ability of third parties with whom the Company contracts to manufacture adequate clinical trial and commercial supplies of LB1148, to remain in good standing with regulatory agencies and to develop, validate and maintain commercially viable manufacturing processes that are compliant with current good manufacturing practices (\u201ccGMP\u201d);\n\u2022a continued acceptable safety profile during clinical development and following approval of LB1148;\n\u2022ability to obtain favorable labeling for LB1148 through regulators that allows for successful commercialization, given that the drugs may be marketed only to the extent approved by these regulatory authorities;\n\u2022ability to successfully commercialize LB1148 in the U.S. and internationally, if approved for marketing, sale and distribution in such countries and territories, whether alone or in collaboration others;\n\u2022acceptance by physicians, insurers and payors, and patients of the quality, benefits, safety and efficacy of LB1148, if approved, including relative to alternative and competing treatments;\n\u2022existence of a regulatory environment conducive to the success of LB1148;\n\u2022ability to price LB1148 to recover the Company\u2019s development costs and generate a satisfactory profit margin; and\n\u2022The Company\u2019s ability and its partners\u2019 ability to establish and enforce intellectual property rights in and to LB1148.\nIf the Company, either individually or through its co-development partner, does not achieve one or more of these factors, many of which are beyond its control, in a timely manner or at all, the Company could experience significant delays or an inability to obtain regulatory approvals or commercialize LB1148. Even if regulatory approvals are obtained, the Company may never be able to successfully commercialize LB1148. Accordingly, the Company cannot assure you that it will ever be able to generate sufficient revenue through the sale of LB1148, if approved, to continue its business.\nSome of the initial indications in which the Company plans to pursue development of LB1148 are indications for which there are no FDA-approved therapies. This makes it difficult to predict the timing and costs of clinical development for LB1148 in these indications, as well as the regulatory approval path.\nThere are no FDA-approved therapies for decreasing the time to normal feedings and bowel movement (or preventing necrotizing enterocolitis) in infants after heart surgery. While ENTEREG\u00ae is approved to accelerate the time to upper and lower gastrointestinal recovery following surgeries that include partial bowel resection with primary anastomosis, there is no guarantee that regulatory precedence regarding ENTEREG\u00ae will apply to the approval of other therapies that may accelerate the time to gastrointestinal recovery following surgery. While there are multiple medical devices approved for the reduction or elimination of postoperative intra-abdominal adhesions, there are no drugs approved to reduce postoperative intra-abdominal adhesions. The regulatory approval process for novel product candidates such as LB1148 can be more expensive and take longer than for other, better known or extensively studied therapeutic approaches.\nThe development and commercialization strategy for the Company\u2019s lead product candidate LB1148 depends, in part, on published scientific literature and the FDA\u2019s prior findings regarding the safety and efficacy of tranexamic acid. If the Company is not able to pursue this strategy, it may be delayed in receiving regulatory authority approval.\nThe Hatch-Waxman Act added Section 505(b)(2) to the U.S. Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (\u201cFDCA\u201d). Section 505(b)(2) permits the submission of a New Drug Application (\"NDA\") where at least some of the information required for approval comes from investigations that were not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference or use from the person by or for whom the investigations were conducted. The FDA interprets Section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA, for purposes of approving an NDA, to permit the applicant to rely, in part, upon published literature and/or the FDA\u2019s previous findings of safety and efficacy for an approved product. The FDA also requires companies to perform additional clinical trials or measurements to support any deviation from the previously approved product and to justify that it is scientifically appropriate to rely on the applicable published literature or referenced product, referred to as bridging. The FDA may then approve the new product candidate for all or some of the indications for which the referenced product has been approved, as well as for any new indication sought by the Section 505(b)(2) applicant, if such approval is supported by study data. The labeling, however, may be required to include all or some of the limitations, contraindications, warnings or precautions or restrictions on use included in the reference product\u2019s labeling, including a boxed warning, or may require additional limitations, contraindications, warnings or precautions or restrictions on use.\nThe Company currently plans to pursue marketing approval for LB1148, in the U.S. through a 505(b)(2) NDA and will be completing bridging analyses prior to NDA submissions. If the FDA disagrees with the Company\u2019s conclusions regarding the appropriateness of its reliance on the FDA\u2019s prior findings of safety and efficacy for TXA or on published literature, or if the Company is not otherwise able to bridge to the listed drug or published literature to demonstrate that its reliance is scientifically appropriate, the Company could be required to conduct additional clinical trials or other studies to support its NDA, which could lead to unanticipated costs and delays or to the termination of\nthe development program for LB1148. If the Company is unable to obtain approval for LB1148 through the 505(b)(2) NDA process, it may be required to pursue the more expensive and time consuming 505(b)(1) approval process, which consists of full reports of investigations of safety and effectiveness conducted by or for the Company.\nNotwithstanding the approval of a number of products by the FDA under Section 505(b)(2), pharmaceutical companies and others have objected to the FDA\u2019s interpretation of Section 505(b)(2). If the FDA\u2019s interpretation of Section 505(b)(2) is successfully challenged, the FDA may be required to change its policies and practices with respect to Section 505(b)(2) regulatory approvals, which could delay or even prevent the FDA from approving any NDA that the Company submits pursuant to the 505(b)(2) process. Even if the Company is allowed to pursue the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway to FDA approval, it cannot assure you that its product candidates will receive the requisite approvals for commercialization.\nThe Company may find it difficult to enroll patients in its clinical trials, which could delay or prevent it from proceeding with clinical trials of its product candidates.\nIdentifying and qualifying subjects to participate in clinical trials of the Company\u2019s product candidates is critical to its success. The timing of clinical trials depends on the Company\u2019s ability to recruit subjects to participate, as well as the completion of required follow-up periods. Patients may be unwilling to participate in clinical trials because of negative publicity from adverse events related to the biotechnology or pharmaceutical fields, competitive clinical trials for similar patient populations, the existence of current treatments or for other reasons. The timeline for recruiting patients, conducting studies and obtaining regulatory approval of the Company\u2019s product candidates may be delayed, which could result in increased costs, delays in advancing its product candidates, delays in testing the effectiveness of its product candidates or termination of the clinical trials altogether.\nPatient enrollment and trial completion are affected by numerous additional factors, including the:\n\u2022process for identifying patients;\n\u2022design of the trial protocol;\n\u2022eligibility and exclusion criteria;\n\u2022perceived risks and benefits of the product candidate under study;\n\u2022availability of competing therapies and clinical trials;\n\u2022severity of the disease under investigation;\n\u2022proximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective patients;\n\u2022ability to obtain and maintain patient consent;\n\u2022risk that enrolled patients will drop out before completion of the trial;\n\u2022patient referral practices of physicians; and\n\u2022ability to monitor patients adequately during and after treatment.\nIf the Company has difficulty enrolling a sufficient number of patients to conduct its clinical trials as planned, it may need to delay, limit or terminate ongoing or planned clinical trials, any of which would have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nClinical drug development is very expensive, time-consuming and uncertain.\nClinical development for the Company\u2019s product candidates is very expensive, time-consuming, difficult to design and implement, and the outcomes are inherently uncertain. Most product candidates that commence clinical trials are never approved by regulatory authorities for commercialization and of those that are approved many do not cover their costs of development. In addition, the Company, any partner with which it may in the future collaborate, the FDA, an\ninstitutional review board (\u201cIRB\u201d), or other regulatory authorities, including state and local agencies and counterpart agencies in foreign countries, may suspend, delay, require modifications to or terminate the Company\u2019s clinical trials at any time.\nThe results of previous clinical trials may not be predictive of future results, and the results of the Company\u2019s current and planned clinical trials may not satisfy the requirements of the FDA or non-U.S. regulatory authorities.\nThe results from the prior preclinical studies and clinical trials for LB1148 discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K may not necessarily be predictive of the results of future preclinical studies or clinical trials. Even if the Company is able to complete its planned clinical trials of its product candidates according to its current development timelines, the results from its prior clinical trials of its product candidates may not be replicated in these future trials. Many companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries (including those with greater resources and experience than the Company) have suffered significant setbacks in late-stage clinical trials after achieving positive results in early stage development, and the Company cannot be certain that it will not face similar setbacks. These setbacks have been caused by, among other things, preclinical findings made while clinical trials were underway or safety or efficacy observations made in clinical trials, including previously unreported adverse events. Moreover, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and many companies that believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials nonetheless have failed to obtain FDA approval. If the Company fails to produce positive results in its clinical trials of any of its product candidates, the development timelines and regulatory approvals and commercialization prospects for its product candidates and its business and financial prospects, would be adversely affected. If the Company fails to produce positive results in its clinical trials of any of its product candidates, the development timelines, regulatory approvals, and commercialization prospects for its product candidates, as well as the Company\u2019s business and financial prospects, would be adversely affected. Further, the Company\u2019s product candidates may not be approved even if they achieve their respective primary endpoints in Phase 3 registration trials. The FDA or non-U.S. regulatory authorities may disagree with the Company\u2019s trial designs or its interpretation of data from preclinical studies and clinical trials. The Company has taken the position that LB1148 has a single active ingredient, TXA. LB1148 also contains polyethylene glycol 3350 (\u201cPEG\u201d). Across different countries and different circumstances, PEG may be regulated as an inactive ingredient, a medical device, or an active ingredient. There is uncertainty on how the FDA and other regulatory agencies about (1) whether regulatory agencies will classify LB1148 as a fixed-combination drug product and (2) consequential implications of, for example, FDA\u2019s fixed-combination drug product regulation concerning the evaluation of each active drug component\u2019s individual contribution to the overall treatment effect. The treatment of PEG and any regulatory requirements, if it is considered an active ingredient, may differ across regulatory authorities. If LB1148 is considered a fixed-combination drug product, then this may impact the design and overall number of required clinical trials as well as additional requirements for nonclinical studies. Even though we are proceeding with a Phase 3 trial for LB1148 as a single active ingredient drug product, we may be required to conduct additional trials, which could include the use of a factorial design, and nonclinical studies if, for example, FDA (1) concludes that PEG is an active ingredient in LB1148 and (2) is unwilling to provide a waiver from meeting their fixed-combination drug product regulation/requirements. In addition, any of these regulatory authorities may change requirements for the approval of a product candidate even after reviewing and providing comments or advice on a protocol for a pivotal clinical trial that has the potential to result in approval by the FDA or another regulatory authority. Furthermore, any of these regulatory authorities may also approve the Company\u2019s product candidate for fewer or more limited indications than it requests or may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly post-marketing clinical trials.\nIf the clinical development of LB1148 is successful, the Company intends to eventually seek regulatory approvals of LB1148 initially in the U.S. and may seek approvals in other geographies. Before obtaining regulatory approvals for the commercial sale of any product candidate for any target indication, the Company must demonstrate with substantial evidence gathered in preclinical studies and adequate and well-controlled clinical studies, and, with respect to approval in the United States, to the satisfaction of the FDA, that the product candidate is safe and effective for use for that target indication. The Company cannot assure you that the FDA or non-U.S. regulatory authorities would consider its planned clinical trials to be sufficient to serve as the basis for approval of its product candidates for any indication. The FDA and non-U.S. regulatory authorities retain broad discretion in evaluating the results of the Company\u2019s clinical trials and in determining whether the results demonstrate that its product candidates are safe and effective. If the Company is required to conduct clinical trials of its product candidates in addition to those it has planned prior to\napproval, the Company will need substantial additional funds, and cannot assure you that the results of any such outcomes trial or other clinical trials will be sufficient for approval.\nThe Company\u2019s product candidates may cause undesirable side effects or have other unexpected properties that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval, limit the commercial profile of an approved label, or result in post-approval regulatory action.\nUnforeseen side effects from LB1148 could arise either during clinical development or, if approved, after it has been marketed. Undesirable side effects could cause the Company, any partners with which the Company may collaborate, or regulatory authorities to interrupt, extend, modify, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in a more restrictive or narrower label or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or comparable foreign authorities.\nResults of clinical trials could reveal a high and unacceptable severity and prevalence of side effects. In such an event, trials could be suspended or terminated, and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities could order us to cease further development of or deny approval of a product candidate for any or all targeted indications. The drug-related side effects could affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete the trial or result in product liability claims. Any of these occurrences may harm the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nAdditionally, if the Company or others identify undesirable side effects, or other previously unknown problems, caused by a product after obtaining U.S. or foreign regulatory approval, a number of potentially negative consequences could result, which could prevent the Company or its potential partners from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the product and could substantially increase the costs of commercializing such product.\nThe Company may in the future conduct clinical trials for its product candidates outside the United States, and the FDA and applicable foreign regulatory authorities may not accept data from such trials.\nThe Company, as well as investigator sponsors, have conducted clinical trials, is conducting clinical trials, and may in the future choose to conduct one or more clinical trials outside of the U.S. Although the FDA or applicable foreign regulatory authority may accept data from clinical trials conducted outside the U.S. or the applicable jurisdiction, acceptance of such study data by the FDA or applicable foreign regulatory authority may be subject to certain conditions or exclusion. Where data from foreign clinical trials are intended to serve as the basis for marketing approval in the United States, the FDA will not approve the application on the basis of foreign data alone unless such data are applicable to the U.S. population and U.S. medical practice; the studies were performed by clinical investigators of recognized competence; and the data are considered valid without the need for an on-site inspection by the FDA or, if the FDA considers such an inspection to be necessary, the FDA is able to validate the data through an on-site inspection or other appropriate means. Many foreign regulatory bodies have similar requirements. In addition, such foreign studies would be subject to the applicable local laws of the foreign jurisdictions where the studies are conducted. There can be no assurance the FDA or applicable foreign regulatory authority will accept data from trials conducted outside of the United States or the applicable home country. If the FDA or applicable foreign regulatory authority does not accept such data, it would likely result in the need for additional trials, which would be costly and time-consuming and delay aspects of the Company\u2019s business plan.\nThe Company relies on and expects to continue to rely on third-party CROs and other third parties to conduct and oversee its clinical trials. If these third parties do not meet the Company\u2019s requirements or otherwise conduct the trials as required, the Company may not be able to satisfy its contractual obligations or obtain regulatory approval for, or commercialize, its product candidates.\nThe Company relies on, and expects to continue to rely on, third-party CROs to conduct and oversee its LB1148 clinical trials and other aspects of product development. The Company also expects to rely on various medical institutions, clinical investigators and contract laboratories to conduct its trials in accordance with the Company\u2019s clinical protocols and all applicable regulatory requirements, including the FDA\u2019s regulations and good clinical practice (\u201cGCP\u201d) requirements, which are an international standard meant to protect the rights and health of patients and to define the roles of clinical trial sponsors, administrators and monitors, and state regulations governing the handling, storage, security and recordkeeping for drug and biologic products. These CROs and other third parties are expected to play a significant role in the conduct of these trials and the subsequent collection and analysis of data from\nthe clinical trials. The Company expects to rely heavily on these parties for the execution of its clinical trials and preclinical studies and will control only certain aspects of their activities. The Company and its CROs and other third-party contractors will be required to comply with GCP and good laboratory practice (\u201cGLP\u201d) requirements, which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Regulatory authorities enforce these GCP and GLP requirements through periodic inspections of trial sponsors, principal investigators and trial sites. If the Company or any of these third parties fail to comply with applicable GCP and GLP requirements, or reveal noncompliance from an audit or inspection, the clinical data generated in the Company\u2019s clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or other regulatory authorities may require the Company to perform additional clinical trials before approving the Company\u2019s or the Company\u2019s partners\u2019 marketing applications. The Company cannot assure that upon inspection by a given regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine whether or not any of the Company\u2019s clinical or preclinical trials comply with applicable GCP and GLP requirements. In addition, the Company\u2019s clinical trials generally must be conducted with product produced under cGMP regulations. The Company\u2019s failure to comply with these regulations and policies may require it to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process.\nIf any of the Company\u2019s CROs or clinical trial sites terminate their involvement in one of its clinical trials for any reason, it may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative CROs or clinical trial sites or do so on commercially reasonable terms. In addition, if the Company\u2019s relationship with clinical trial sites is terminated, it may experience the loss of follow-up information on patients enrolled in its ongoing clinical trials unless the Company is able to transfer the care of those patients to another qualified clinical trial site. In addition, principal investigators for the Company\u2019s clinical trials may serve as scientific advisors or consultants to it from time to time and could receive cash or equity compensation in connection with such services. If these relationships and any related compensation result in perceived or actual conflicts of interest, the integrity of the data generated at the applicable clinical trial site may be questioned by the FDA.\nEven if the Company receives marketing approval for LB1148, or any future product candidate, it may not be able to successfully commercialize its product candidates due to unfavorable pricing regulations or third-party coverage and reimbursement policies, which could make it difficult for the Company to sell its product candidates profitably.\nObtaining coverage and reimbursement approval for a product from a government or other third-party payor is a time consuming and costly process that could require the Company to provide supporting scientific, clinical and cost effectiveness data to the payor. There may be significant delays in obtaining such coverage and reimbursement for newly approved products, and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the product is approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. Moreover, eligibility for coverage and reimbursement does not imply that a product will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers costs, including research, development, intellectual property, manufacture, sale and distribution expenses. Interim reimbursement levels for new products, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover costs and may not be made permanent. Reimbursement rates may vary according to the use of the product and the clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on reimbursement levels already set for lower cost products and may be incorporated into existing payments for other services. Net prices for products may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors, by any future laws limiting drug prices and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of product from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States.\nThere is significant uncertainty related to the insurance coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products. Third-party payors often rely upon Medicare coverage policy and payment limitations in setting reimbursement policies, but also have their own methods and approval process apart from Medicare coverage and reimbursement determinations.\nCoverage and reimbursement by a third-party payor may depend upon a number of factors, including the third-party payor\u2019s determination that use of a product is:\n\u2022a covered benefit under its health plan;\n\u2022safe, effective and medically necessary;\n\u2022appropriate for the specific patient;\n\u2022cost-effective; and\n\u2022neither experimental nor investigational.\nThe Company cannot be sure that coverage and reimbursement will be available for any product that it commercializes and, if coverage and reimbursement are available, what the level of reimbursement will be. The Company\u2019s inability to promptly obtain coverage and adequate reimbursement rates from both government-funded and private payors for any approved products that the Company develops could have a material adverse effect on its operating results, its ability to raise capital needed to commercialize products and its overall financial condition.\nReimbursement may impact the demand for, and the price of, any product for which the Company obtains marketing approval. Assuming the Company obtains coverage for a given product by a third-party payor, the resulting reimbursement payment rates may not be adequate or may require co-payments that patients find unacceptably high. Patients who are prescribed medications for the treatment of their conditions, and their prescribing physicians, generally rely on third-party payors to reimburse all or part of the costs associated with those medications. Patients are unlikely to use the Company\u2019s products unless coverage is provided and reimbursement is adequate to cover all or a significant portion of the cost of the Company\u2019s products. Therefore, coverage and adequate reimbursement is critical to new product acceptance. Coverage decisions may depend upon clinical and economic standards that disfavor new products when more established or lower cost therapeutic alternatives are already available or subsequently become available. Coverage policies and third-party reimbursement rates may change at any time. Even if favorable coverage and reimbursement status is attained for one or more products for which the Company receives regulatory approval, less favorable coverage policies and reimbursement rates may be implemented in the future.\nThe Company\u2019s expects to experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of any of its product candidates due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations, and additional legislative changes. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription medicines, medical devices and surgical procedures and other treatments, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the successful commercialization of new products. Further, the adoption and implementation of any future governmental cost containment or other health reform initiative may result in additional downward pressure on the price that the Company may receive for any approved product.\nOutside of the U.S., many countries require approval of the sale price of a product before it can be marketed and the pricing review period only begins after marketing or product licensing approval is granted. To obtain reimbursement or pricing approval in some of these countries, the Company may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of its product candidate to other available therapies. In some foreign markets, prescription pharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even after initial approval is granted. As a result, the Company might obtain marketing approval for a product candidate in a particular country, but then be subject to price regulations that delay its commercial launch of the product, possibly for lengthy time periods, and negatively impact the revenues, if any, the Company is able to generate from the sale of the product in that country. Adverse pricing limitations may hinder the Company\u2019s ability to recoup its investment in one or more product candidates, even if such product candidates obtain marketing approval.\nEven if a product candidate obtains regulatory approval, it may fail to achieve the broad degree of physician and patient adoption and use necessary for commercial success.\nThe commercial success of LB1148, if approved, will depend significantly on attaining broad adoption and use of the drug by physicians and patients for approved indications, and it may not be commercially successful even though it is shown to be effective. The degree and rate of physician and patient adoption of a product, if approved, will depend on a number of factors, including but not limited to:\n\u2022patient demand for approved products that treat the indication for which they are approved;\n\u2022the effectiveness of a product compared to other available therapies or treatment regimens;\n\u2022the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from managed care plans and other healthcare payors;\n\u2022the cost of treatment in relation to alternative treatments and willingness to pay on the part of patients;\n\u2022insurers\u2019 willingness to see the applicable indication as a disease worth treating;\n\u2022proper administration by physicians or patients;\n\u2022patient satisfaction with the results, administration and overall treatment experience;\n\u2022limitations or contraindications, warnings, precautions or approved indications for use different than those sought by the Company that are contained in the final FDA-approved labeling for the applicable product;\n\u2022any FDA requirement to undertake a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy;\n\u2022the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s sales, marketing, pricing, reimbursement and access, government affairs, and distribution efforts;\n\u2022adverse publicity about a product or favorable publicity about competitive products;\n\u2022new government regulations and programs, including price controls and/or limits or prohibitions on ways to commercialize drugs, such as increased scrutiny on direct-to-consumer advertising of pharmaceuticals; and\n\u2022potential product liability claims or other product-related litigation.\nIf LB1148 is approved for use but fails to achieve the broad degree of physician and patient adoption necessary for commercial success, the Company\u2019s operating results and financial condition will be adversely affected, which may delay, prevent or limit its ability to generate revenue and continue its business.\nThe Company\u2019s product candidates, if approved, will face significant competition and their failure to compete effectively may prevent them from achieving significant market penetration.\nThe pharmaceutical industry is characterized by rapidly advancing technologies, intense competition, less effective patent terms, and a strong emphasis on developing newer, fast-to-market proprietary therapeutics. Numerous companies are engaged in the development, patenting, manufacturing and marketing of healthcare products competitive with those that the Company is developing, including LB1148. The Company will face competition from a number of sources, such as pharmaceutical companies, generic drug companies, biotechnology companies, medical device companies and academic and research institutions, many of which have greater financial resources, marketing capabilities, sales forces, manufacturing capabilities, research and development capabilities, regulatory expertise, clinical trial expertise, intellectual property portfolios, more international reach, experience in obtaining patents and regulatory approvals for product candidates and other resources than the Company. Some of the companies that offer competing products also have a broad range of other product offerings, large direct sales forces and long-term customer relationships with the Company\u2019s target physicians, which could inhibit the Company\u2019s market penetration efforts.\nWith respect to the Company\u2019s lead product candidate, LB1148, for the indication of postoperative improvement of bowel function, the Company expects to face competition in the pharmacological therapy space from alvimopan, marketed as a branded product, ENTEREG\u00ae, by Merck, as well as in generic form. There are no pharmacotherapies for decreasing the time to normal feedings and bowel movement (or preventing necrotizing enterocolitis) in infants after heart surgery or for the reduction or elimination of postoperative intra-abdominal adhesions. However, the Company will face general competition from other medical interventions, namely surgical procedures and adhesion barrier products. Adhesion barrier products approved for abdominal or pelvic surgery in the United States consist of SEPRAFILM, INTERCEED and ADEPT. In addition, several products are used off-label for adhesion prevention in the United States, including EVICEL, SURGIWRAP, COSEAL and PRECLUDE. Adhesion barrier products available outside the United States include HYALOBARRIER, SPRAYSHIELD, PREVADH, and INTERCOAT. Such products are used as adjunctive interventions, have variable efficacy, and are not easily used with laparoscopic procedures, which are becoming increasingly common.\nAny adverse developments that occur during any clinical trials conducted by Newsoara may affect the Company\u2019s ability to obtain regulatory approval or commercialize LB1148.\nNewsoara has the rights to develop and commercialize LB1148 in China for return of bowel function, reduction of adhesions, and sepsis. If serious adverse events occur during any clinical trials for which Newsoara conducts with respect to LB1148, the FDA and other regulatory authorities may delay, limit or deny approval of LB1148 or require the Company to conduct additional clinical trials as a condition to marketing approval, which would increase our costs. If the Company receives FDA approval for LB1148 and a new and serious safety issue is identified in connection with clinical trials conducted by Newsoara, the FDA and other regulatory authorities may withdraw their approval of the product or otherwise restrict the Company\u2019s ability to market and sell the Company\u2019s product. In addition, treating physicians may be less willing to administer the Company\u2019s product due to concerns over such adverse events, which would limit the Company\u2019s ability to commercialize LB1148.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Business\nThe Company has a very limited operating history and has never generated any revenues from product sales.\nThe Company is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company with a very limited operating history that may make it difficult to evaluate the success of its business to date and to assess its future viability. The Company was initially formed in 2001 and its operations, to date, have been limited to business planning, raising capital, developing the Company\u2019s pipeline assets and other research and development. The Company has not yet demonstrated an ability to successfully complete any clinical trials and has never completed the development of any product candidate, nor has it ever generated any revenue from product sales or otherwise. Consequently, the Company has no meaningful operations upon which to evaluate its business, and predictions about its future success or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if it had a longer operating history or a history of successfully developing and commercializing biopharmaceutical products.\nThe Company currently has no products approved for sale, and it may never obtain regulatory approval to commercialize any of its product candidates.\nThe research, testing, manufacturing, safety surveillance, efficacy, quality control, recordkeeping, labeling, packaging, storage, approval, sale, marketing, distribution, import, export and reporting of safety and other post-market information related to its biopharmaceutical products are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory authorities in the U.S. and in foreign countries, and such regulations differ from country to country and frequently are revised.\nEven after the Company achieves U.S. regulatory approval for a product candidate, if any, the Company will be subject to continued regulatory review and compliance obligations. For example, with respect to the Company\u2019s product candidates, the FDA may impose significant restrictions on the approved indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or on the conditions of approval. A product candidate\u2019s approval may contain requirements for potentially costly post-approval studies and surveillance, including Phase 4 clinical trials, to monitor the safety and efficacy of the product. The Company also will be subject to ongoing FDA obligations and continued regulatory review with respect to, among other things, the manufacturing, processing, labeling, packaging, distribution, pharmacovigilance and adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion and recordkeeping for the Company\u2019s product candidates. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration, continued compliance with cGMP requirements and with the FDA\u2019s GCP requirements and GLP requirements, which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA for all of the Company\u2019s product candidates in clinical and preclinical development, and for any clinical trials that it conducts post-approval, as well as continued compliance with the FDA\u2019s laws governing commercialization of the approved product, including but not limited to the FDA\u2019s Office of Prescription Drug Promotion (\u201cOPDP\u201d) regulation of promotional activities, fraud and abuse, product sampling, scientific speaker engagements and activities, formulary interactions as well as interactions with healthcare practitioners. To the extent that a product candidate is approved for sale in other countries, the Company may be subject to similar or more onerous (i.e., prohibition on direct-to-consumer advertising that does not exist in the U.S.) restrictions and requirements imposed by laws and government regulators in those countries.\nIn addition, manufacturers of drug and biologic products and their facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with cGMP regulations. If the\nCompany or a regulatory agency discovers previously unknown problems with a product, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the manufacturing, processing, distribution or storage facility where, or processes by which, the product is made, a regulatory agency may impose restrictions on that product or the Company, including requesting that the Company initiate a product recall, or requiring notice to physicians or the public, withdrawal of the product from the market, or suspension of manufacturing.\nIf the Company, its product candidates or the manufacturing facilities for its product candidates fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency may:\n\u2022impose restrictions on the sale, marketing or manufacturing of the products, amend, suspend or withdraw product approvals or revoke necessary licenses;\n\u2022mandate modifications to promotional and other product-specific materials or require the Company to provide corrective information to healthcare practitioners or in its advertising;\n\u2022require the Company or its partners to enter into a consent decree, which can include imposition of various fines, reimbursements for inspection costs, required due dates for specific actions, penalties for noncompliance and, in extreme cases, require an independent compliance monitor to oversee the Company\u2019s activities;\n\u2022issue warning letters, bring enforcement actions, initiate surprise inspections, issue show cause notices or untitled letters describing alleged violations, which may be publicly available;\n\u2022commence criminal investigations and prosecutions;\n\u2022impose injunctions, suspensions or revocations of necessary approvals or other licenses;\n\u2022impose other civil or criminal penalties;\n\u2022suspend any ongoing clinical trials;\n\u2022place restrictions on the kind of promotional activities that can be done;\n\u2022delay or refuse to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by the Company or its potential partners;\n\u2022refuse to permit drugs or precursor chemicals to be imported or exported to or from the United States;\n\u2022suspend or impose restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements; or\n\u2022seize or detain products or require the Company or its partners to initiate a product recall.\nThe regulations, policies or guidance of the FDA and other applicable government agencies may change, and new or additional statutes or government regulations may be enacted, including at the state and local levels, which can differ by geography and could prevent or delay regulatory approval of the Company\u2019s product candidates or further restrict or regulate post-approval activities. The Company cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse government regulations that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the United States or abroad. If the Company is not able to achieve and maintain regulatory compliance, it may not be permitted to commercialize its product candidates, which would adversely affect its ability to generate revenue and achieve or maintain profitability.\nIf the Company is not able to comply with the applicable continued listing requirements or standards of The Nasdaq Capital Market, Nasdaq could delist its common stock.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to publicly or privately sell equity securities and the liquidity of its common stock could be adversely affected if is delisted from The Nasdaq Capital Market or if it is unable to transfer its listing to another stock market. In order to maintain this listing, it must satisfy minimum financial and other continued listing requirements and standards, including a requirement to maintain a minimum bid price of the Company's common stock of $1.00 per share.\nThe Company cannot assure you that, in the future, its securities will meet the continued listing requirements to be listed on Nasdaq. If the Company\u2019s common stock is delisted by Nasdaq, it could lead to a number of negative implications, including an adverse effect on the price of its common stock, increased volatility in its common stock, reduced liquidity in its common stock, a limited availability of market quotations for the Company\u2019s common stock, the loss of federal preemption of state securities laws and greater difficulty in obtaining financing. In addition, delisting of the Company\u2019s common stock could deter broker-dealers from making a market in or otherwise seeking or generating interest in its common stock, could result in a loss of current or future coverage by certain sell-side analysts and might deter certain institutions and persons from investing in the Company\u2019s securities at all. Delisting could also cause a loss of confidence of the Company\u2019s collaborators, vendors, suppliers and employees, which could harm its business and future prospects.\nThe Company currently has no marketing capabilities and no sales organization. If the Company is unable to establish sales and marketing capabilities on its own or through third parties, the Company will be unable to successfully commercialize its product candidates, if approved, or generate product revenue.\nThe Company currently has no marketing capabilities and no sales organization. To commercialize the Company\u2019s product candidates, if approved, in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, the Company must build its marketing, sales, distribution, managerial and other non-technical capabilities or make arrangements with third parties to perform these services, and the Company may not be successful in doing so. Although the Company\u2019s employees, consultants, contractors, and partners have experience in the marketing, sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products, and business development activities involving external alliances, from prior employment at other companies, the Company as a company has no prior experience in the marketing, sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products, and there are significant risks involved in building and managing a sales organization, including its ability to hire, retain and incentivize qualified individuals, generate sufficient sales leads, provide adequate training to sales and marketing personnel, and effectively manage a geographically dispersed sales and marketing team. Any failure or delay in the development of the Company\u2019s internal sales, marketing, distribution and pricing/reimbursement/access capabilities would impact adversely the commercialization of these products.\nThe Company may face product liability exposure, and if successful claims are brought against it, the Company may incur substantial liability if its insurance coverage for those claims is inadequate.\nThe Company faces an inherent risk of product liability or similar causes of action as a result of the clinical testing of its product candidates and will face an even greater risk if the Company commercializes any products. This risk exists even if a product is approved for commercial sale by the FDA and manufactured in facilities licensed and regulated by the FDA or an applicable foreign regulatory authority and notwithstanding the Company complying with applicable laws on promotional activity. The Company\u2019s products and product candidates are designed to affect important bodily functions and processes. Any side effects, manufacturing defects, misuse or abuse associated with the Company\u2019s product candidates could result in injury to a patient or potentially even death. The Company cannot offer any assurance that it will not face product liability suits in the future, nor can it assure that its insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover its liability under any such cases.\nIn addition, a liability claim may be brought against the Company even if its product candidates merely appear to have caused an injury. Product liability claims may be brought against the Company by consumers, healthcare providers, pharmaceutical companies or others selling or otherwise coming into contact with its product candidates, among others, and under some circumstances even government agencies. If the Company cannot successfully defend itself against product liability or similar claims, it will incur substantial liabilities, reputational harm and possibly injunctions and punitive actions. In addition, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in:\n\u2022withdrawal or delay of recruitment or decreased enrollment rates of clinical trial participants;\n\u2022termination or increased government regulation of clinical trial sites or entire trial programs;\n\u2022the inability to commercialize the Company\u2019s product candidates;\n\u2022decreased demand for the Company\u2019s product candidates;\n\u2022impairment of the Company\u2019s business reputation;\n\u2022product recall or withdrawal from the market or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions;\n\u2022substantial costs of any related litigation or similar disputes;\n\u2022distraction of management\u2019s attention and other resources from the Company\u2019s primary business;\n\u2022significant delay in product launch;\n\u2022substantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants against the Company that may not be covered by insurance;\n\u2022withdrawal of reimbursement or formulary inclusion; or\n\u2022loss of revenue.\nThe Company intends to obtain product liability insurance coverage for its clinical trials. Large judgments have been awarded in class action or individual lawsuits based on drugs that had unanticipated side effects. The Company\u2019s insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all of its product liability-related expenses or losses and may not cover it for any expenses or losses it may suffer. Moreover, insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive, restrictive and narrow, and, in the future, the Company may not be able to maintain adequate insurance coverage at a reasonable cost, in sufficient amounts or upon adequate terms to protect it against losses due to product liability or other similar legal actions. The Company will need to increase its product liability coverage if any of its product candidates receive regulatory approval, which will be costly, and it may be unable to obtain this increased product liability insurance on commercially reasonable terms or at all and for all geographies in which the Company wishes to launch. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against the Company, if judgments exceed its insurance coverage, could decrease its cash and harm its business, financial condition, operating results and future prospects.\nOur stockholders may not receive any payment on the CVRs and the CVRs may otherwise expire valueless. In addition, the tax treatment of CVRs is uncertain.\nAlthough we sold our legacy assets related to NSI-189, sufficient proceeds were not received to require distribution of proceeds to our CVR holders as provided for in the CVR Agreement. The right of our stockholders to receive any future payment on or derive any value from the CVRs will be contingent upon: (i) our ability to sell or license certain legacy intellectual property within the time periods specified in the CVR Agreement and (ii) the consideration received for such intellectual property being greater than the amounts permitted to be retained or deducted by us pursuant to the CVR Agreement. If we are not able to sell or license such intellectual property within the prescribed time period, or the consideration received by us is not greater than the amounts permitted to be retained or deducted by us, no payments will be made under the CVRs, and the CVRs will expire valueless. Following the closing of the Merger, we do not have any contractual obligation to support the development of the legacy asset, NSI-566.\nFurthermore, the CVRs are unsecured obligations of the Company and all payments under the CVRs, all other obligations under the CVR Agreement and the CVRs and any rights or claims relating thereto will be subordinated in right of payment to the prior payment in full of all current or future senior obligations of the Company. Finally, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of the CVRs is unclear. There is no legal authority directly addressing the U.S. federal income tax treatment of the receipt of, and payments on, the CVRs, and there can be no assurance that the Internal Revenue Service would not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a position that could result in adverse U.S. federal income tax consequences to holders of the CVRs.\nThe Company\u2019s employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, other clinical trial staff, consultants, vendors, CROs and any partners with whom the Company may collaborate may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including noncompliance with regulatory standards and requirements.\nThe Company is exposed to the risk that its employees, independent contractors, principal investigators, other clinical trial staff, consultants, vendors, CROs and any partners with which the Company may collaborate may engage in fraudulent or other illegal activity. Misconduct by these persons could include intentional, reckless, gross or negligent misconduct or unauthorized activity that violates: laws or regulations, including those laws requiring the reporting of\ntrue, complete and accurate information to the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities; manufacturing standards; federal, state and foreign healthcare fraud and abuse laws and data privacy; anticorruption laws, antikickback and Medicare/Medicaid rules, or laws that require the true, complete and accurate reporting of financial information or data, books and records. If any such or similar actions are instituted against the Company and the Company is not successful in defending itself or asserting the Company\u2019s rights, those actions could have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s business, including the imposition of civil, criminal and administrative and punitive penalties, damages, monetary fines, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, debarments, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, injunctions, and curtailment or cessation of the Company\u2019s operations, any of which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to operate the Company\u2019s business and the Company\u2019s operating results.\nThe Company may be subject to risks related to off-label use of its product candidates.\nThe FDA strictly regulates the advertising and promotion of drug products, and drug products may only be marketed or promoted for their FDA approved uses, consistent with the product\u2019s approved labeling. Although physicians may prescribe legally available drugs for off-label uses, manufacturers may not market or promote such uses. Advertising and promotion of any product candidate that obtains approval in the United States will be heavily scrutinized by the FDA, the Department of Justice, the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services, state attorneys general, members of Congress and the public. Violations, including promotion of the Company\u2019s products for unapproved or off-label uses, are subject to enforcement letters, inquiries and investigations, and civil, criminal and/or administrative sanctions by the FDA. Additionally, advertising and promotion of any product candidate that obtains approval outside of the United States will be heavily scrutinized by relevant foreign regulatory authorities.\nEven if the Company obtains regulatory approval for its product candidates, the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require labeling changes or impose significant restrictions on a product\u2019s indicated uses or marketing or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post-approval studies or post-market surveillance.\nIn the U.S., engaging in impermissible promotion of the Company\u2019s product candidates for off-label uses can also subject it to false claims litigation under federal and state statutes, which can lead to civil, criminal and/or administrative penalties and fines and agreements, such as a corporate integrity agreement, that materially restrict the manner in which the Company promotes or distributes its product candidates. If the Company does not lawfully promote its products if they receive regulatory approval, the Company may become subject to such litigation and, if it is not successful in defending against such actions, those actions could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and operating results and even result in having an independent compliance monitor assigned to audit the Company\u2019s ongoing operations for a lengthy period of time.\nThe Company\u2019s or third party\u2019s clinical trials may fail to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of its product candidates, or serious adverse or unacceptable side effects may be identified during their development, which could prevent or delay marketing approval and commercialization, increase the Company\u2019s costs or necessitate the abandonment or limitation of the development of the product candidate.\nBefore obtaining marketing approvals for the commercial sale of any product candidate, the Company must demonstrate through lengthy, complex and expensive preclinical testing and clinical trials that such product candidate is both safe and effective for use in the applicable indication. Failures can occur at any stage of testing. Clinical trials often fail to demonstrate safety and are associated with side effects or have characteristics that are unexpected. Based on the safety profile seen in clinical testing, the Company may need to abandon development or limit development to more narrow uses in which the side effects or other characteristics are less prevalent, less severe or more tolerable from a risk-benefit perspective. The FDA or an IRB may also require that the Company suspend, discontinue, or limit clinical trials based on safety information. Such findings could further result in regulatory authorities failing to provide marketing authorization for the product candidate. Many pharmaceutical candidates that initially showed promise in early stage testing and which were efficacious have later been found to cause side effects that prevented further development of the drug candidate and, in extreme cases, the side effects were not seen until after the drug was marketed, causing regulators to remove the drug from the market post-approval.\nThe Company may expend its limited resources to pursue a particular indication and fail to capitalize on indications that may be more profitable or for which there is a greater likelihood of success.\nBecause the Company has limited financial and managerial resources, it is currently focusing only on development programs that it identifies for specific indications for its product candidates. As a result, the Company may forego or delay pursuit of opportunities for other indications, or with other potential product candidates that later prove to have greater commercial potential. The Company\u2019s resource allocation decisions may cause it to fail to capitalize on viable commercial products or profitable market opportunities. The Company\u2019s spending on current and future research and development programs for specific indications or future product candidates may not yield any commercially viable products. If the Company does not accurately evaluate the commercial potential or target market for a product candidate, it may not gain approval or achieve market acceptance of that candidate, and its business and financial results will be harmed.\nThe Company may choose to discontinue developing or commercializing any of its product candidates, or may choose to not commercialize product candidates in approved indications, at any time during development or after approval, which would reduce or eliminate its potential return on investment for those product candidates.\nAt any time, the Company may decide to discontinue the development of any of its product candidates for a variety of reasons, including the appearance of new technologies that make its product candidates obsolete, competition from a competing product or changes in or failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements. If the Company terminates a program in which it has invested significant resources, the Company will not receive any return on its investment and it will have missed the opportunity to have allocated those resources to potentially more productive uses.\nHealthcare reform measures could hinder or prevent the commercial success of the Company\u2019s product candidates.\nThere have been executive, judicial, and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act (collectively, \u201cAffordable Care Act\u201d). For example, the so-called \u201cindividual mandate\u201d was repealed as part of tax reform legislation adopted in December 2017, such that the shared responsibility payment for individuals who fail to maintain minimum essential coverage under section 5000A of the Code was eliminated beginning in 2019. On June 17, 2021 the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed a challenge on procedural grounds that argued the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional in its entirety because the \u201cindividual mandate\u201d was repealed by Congress. Thus, the Affordable Care Act will remain in effect in its current form. Prior to the U.S. Supreme Court ruling, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order that initiated a special enrollment period for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the Affordable Care Act marketplace. The executive order also instructed certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the Affordable Care Act. It is possible that the Affordable Care Act will be subject to judicial or Congressional challenges in the future. It is unclear how such challenges and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the Affordable Care Act and the Company's business.\nOther legislative changes have been proposed and adopted in the United States since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. These changes included aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, effective April 1, 2013, which, due to subsequent legislative amendments, including the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, will stay in effect through 2031 unless additional Congressional action is taken. However, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (\"CARES Act\") and other SARS-CoV-2 relief legislation have suspended the 2% Medicare sequester from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2022. Under current legislation the actual reduction in Medicare payments will vary from 1% in 2022 to up to 3% in the final fiscal year of this sequester. These laws may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, which could have a material adverse effect on customers for the Company's drugs, if approved, and accordingly, the Company's financial operations. The Company expects that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for its product candidates if approved or additional pricing pressures.\nFurther, in the United States there has been heightened governmental scrutiny over the manner in which manufacturers set prices for their marketed products, which has resulted in several Congressional inquiries, Presidential executive orders, and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to drug and biological product pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs and biological products under government payor programs and review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs. For example, in July 2021, the Biden administration released an executive order, \u201cPromoting Competition in the American Economy,\u201d with multiple provisions aimed at prescription drugs. In response to Biden\u2019s executive order, on September 9, 2021, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, released a Comprehensive Plan for Addressing High Drug Prices that outlines principles for drug pricing reform and sets out a variety of potential legislative policies that Congress could pursue as well as potential administrative actions HHS can take to advance these principles. No legislation or administrative actions have been finalized to implement these principles. It is unclear whether these or similar policy initiatives will be implemented in the future. Congress is considering drug pricing as part of other reform initiatives.\nThere are also calls to ban all direct-to-consumer advertising of pharmaceuticals, which would limit the Company\u2019s ability to market its product candidates. The United States is in a minority of jurisdictions that allow this kind of advertising and its removal could limit the potential reach of a marketing campaign. Further, it is possible that additional governmental action is taken in response to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic.\nThe Company may also be subject to stricter healthcare laws, regulation and enforcement, and its failure to comply with those laws could adversely affect its business, operations and financial condition.\nCertain federal and state healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse and patients\u2019 rights are and will be applicable to the Company\u2019s business. The Company is subject to regulation by both the federal government and the states in which it or its partners conduct business. The healthcare laws and regulations that may affect the Company\u2019s ability to operate include: the federal Anti-Kickback Statute; federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws; the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act; the federal physician sunshine requirements under the Affordable Care Act; the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act as it applies to activities outside of the United States; and state law equivalents of many of the above federal laws.\nBecause of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available, it is possible that some of the Company\u2019s business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. In addition, recent healthcare reform legislation has strengthened these laws. For example, the recently enacted Affordable Care Act, among other things, amended the intent requirement of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and certain criminal healthcare fraud statutes. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the Affordable Care Act provided that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal civil False Claims Act.\nAchieving and sustaining compliance with these laws may prove costly. In addition, any action against the Company for violation of these laws, even if the Company successfully defends against it, could cause the Company to incur significant legal expenses and divert its management\u2019s attention from the operation of its business and result in reputational damage. If the Company\u2019s operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental laws or regulations that apply to the Company, it may be subject to significant penalties, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, damages, including punitive damages, fines, disgorgement, the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, individual imprisonment or the curtailment or restructuring of its operations, and injunctions, any of which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s ability to operate its business and its financial results.\nThe Company\u2019s inability to successfully to in-license, acquire, develop and market additional product candidates or approved products would impair its ability to grow its business.\nThe Company intends to in-license, acquire, develop and market additional products and product candidates. Because the Company\u2019s internal research and development capabilities are limited, it may be dependent on pharmaceutical companies, academic or government scientists and other researchers to sell or license products or technology to it.\nThe success of this strategy depends partly on the Company\u2019s ability to identify and select promising pharmaceutical product candidates and products, negotiate licensing or acquisition agreements with their current owners, and finance these arrangements.\nThe process of proposing, negotiating and implementing a license or acquisition of a product candidate or approved product is lengthy and complex. Other companies, including some with substantially greater financial, marketing, sales and other resources, may compete with the Company for the license or acquisition of product candidates and approved products. The Company has limited resources to identify and execute the acquisition or in-licensing of third-party products, businesses and technologies and integrate them into its current infrastructure. Moreover, the Company may devote resources to potential acquisitions or licensing opportunities that are never completed, or the Company may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such efforts. The Company may not be able to acquire the rights to additional product candidates on terms that it finds acceptable or at all.\nFurther, any product candidate that the Company acquires may require additional development efforts prior to commercial sale, including preclinical or clinical testing and approval by the FDA and applicable foreign regulatory authorities. All product candidates are prone to risks of failure typical of pharmaceutical product development, including the possibility that a product candidate will not be shown to be sufficiently safe and effective for approval by regulatory authorities. In addition, the Company cannot provide assurance that any approved products that it acquires will be manufactured or sold profitably or achieve market acceptance.\nThe Company may seek to avail itself of mechanisms to expedite the development or approval for product candidates it may pursue in the future, such as Fast Track or breakthrough designation, but such mechanisms may not actually lead to a faster development or regulatory review or approval process.\nLB1148 has received Fast Track designation from the FDA for the treatment of postoperative GI dysfunction (which may present as feeding intolerance, ileus, necrotizing enterocolitis, etc.) associated with gut hypoperfusion injury in pediatric patients who underwent congenital heart disease repair surgery. In addition, the Company may seek Fast Track designation, breakthrough designation, or priority review for product candidates it may pursue in the future. For example, if a drug is intended for the treatment of a serious or life-threatening condition and the drug demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for this condition, the drug sponsor may apply for FDA Fast Track designation. However, the FDA has broad discretion with regard to these mechanisms, and even if the Company believes a particular product candidate is eligible for any such mechanism, it cannot guarantee that the FDA would decide to grant it. Even if it does obtain Fast Track or priority review designation or pursue an accelerated approval pathway, the Company may not experience a faster development process, review, or approval compared to conventional FDA procedures. The FDA may withdraw a particular designation if it believes that the designation is no longer supported by data from the Company\u2019s clinical development program.\nThe Company intends to seek breakthrough designation for LB1148 for the treatment of postoperative GI dysfunction associated with gut hypoperfusion injury in pediatric patients who undergo congenital heart disease repair surgery and for the treatment of postoperative GI dysfunction associated with major surgeries that risk disrupting the intestinal mucosal barrier. A breakthrough therapy is defined as a drug that is intended, alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on one or more clinically significant endpoints. Designation as a breakthrough therapy is within the discretion of the FDA. Accordingly, even if the Company believes a product candidate meets the criteria for designation as a breakthrough therapy, the FDA may disagree and instead determine not to make such designation. The Company cannot be sure that its evaluation of a product candidate as qualifying for breakthrough therapy designation will meet the FDA\u2019s requirements. In any event, the receipt of a breakthrough therapy designation for a product candidate may not result in a faster development process, review, or approval compared to conventional FDA procedures and does not assure ultimate approval by the FDA. In addition, even if one or more product candidates qualifies as a breakthrough therapy, the FDA may later determine that the product candidate no longer meets the conditions for qualification or may determine that the time period for FDA review or approval will not be shortened.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Dependence on Third Parties\nThe Company expects to rely on collaborations with third parties for the successful development and commercialization of its product candidates.\nThe Company expects to rely upon the efforts of third parties for the successful development and commercialization of the Company\u2019s current and future product candidates. The clinical and commercial success of the Company\u2019s product candidates may depend upon maintaining successful relationships with third-party partners which are subject to a number of significant risks, including the following:\n\u2022the Company\u2019s partners\u2019 ability to execute their responsibilities in a timely, cost-efficient and compliant manner;\n\u2022reduced control over delivery and manufacturing schedules;\n\u2022price increases and product reliability;\n\u2022manufacturing deviations from internal or regulatory specifications;\n\u2022quality incidents;\n\u2022the failure of partners to perform their obligations for technical, market or other reasons;\n\u2022misappropriation of the Company\u2019s current or future product candidates; and\n\u2022other risks in potentially meeting the Company\u2019s current and future product commercialization schedule or satisfying the requirements of its end-users.\n\u2022the Company cannot assure you that it will be able to establish or maintain third-party relationships in order to successfully develop and commercialize its product candidates.\nThe Company relies completely on third-party contractors to supply, manufacture and distribute clinical drug supplies for its product candidates, which may include sole-source suppliers and manufacturers; the Company intends to rely on third parties for commercial supply, manufacturing and distribution if any of its product candidates receives regulatory approval; and the Company expects to rely on third parties for supply, manufacturing and distribution of preclinical, clinical and commercial supplies of any future product candidates.\nThe Company does not currently have, nor does it plan to acquire, the infrastructure or capability to supply, store, manufacture or distribute preclinical, clinical or commercial quantities of drug substances or products. Additionally, the Company has not entered into a long-term commercial supply agreement to provide it with such drug substances or products. As a result, the Company\u2019s ability to develop its product candidates is dependent, and the Company\u2019s ability to supply its products commercially will depend, in part, on the Company\u2019s ability to obtain the active pharmaceutical ingredients (\u201cAPIs\u201d) and other substances and materials used in its product candidates successfully from third parties and to have finished products manufactured by third parties in accordance with regulatory requirements and in sufficient quantities for preclinical and clinical testing and commercialization. If the Company fails to develop and maintain supply and other technical relationships with these third parties, it may be unable to continue to develop or commercialize its products and product candidates.\nThe Company does not have direct control over whether or not its contract suppliers and manufacturers will maintain current pricing terms, be willing to continue supplying the Company with APIs and finished products or maintain adequate capacity and capabilities to serve its needs, including quality control, quality assurance and qualified personnel. The Company is dependent on its contract suppliers and manufacturers for day-to-day compliance with applicable laws and cGMPs for production of both APIs and finished products. If the safety or quality of any product or product candidate or component is compromised due to a failure to adhere to applicable laws or for other reasons, the Company may not be able to commercialize or obtain regulatory approval for the affected product or product candidate successfully, and the Company may be held liable for injuries sustained as a result.\nIn order to conduct larger or late-stage clinical trials for a product candidate and supply sufficient commercial quantities of the resulting drug product and its components, if that product candidate is approved for sale, the\nCompany\u2019s contract manufacturers and suppliers will need to produce its drug substances and product candidates in larger quantities more cost-effectively and, in certain cases, at higher yields than they currently achieve. If the Company\u2019s third-party contractors are unable to scale up the manufacture of any of the Company's product candidates successfully in sufficient quality and quantity and at commercially reasonable prices, or are shut down or put on clinical hold by government regulators, and the Company is unable to find one or more replacement suppliers or manufacturers capable of production at a substantially equivalent cost in substantially equivalent volumes and quality, and the Company is unable to transfer the processes successfully on a timely basis, the development of that product candidate and regulatory approval or commercial launch for any resulting products may be delayed, or there may be a shortage in supply, either of which could significantly harm its business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nThe Company expects to continue to depend on third-party contract suppliers and manufacturers for the foreseeable future. The Company\u2019s supply and manufacturing agreements do not guarantee that a contract supplier or manufacturer will provide services adequate for its needs. Additionally, any damage to or destruction of the Company\u2019s third-party manufacturer\u2019s or suppliers\u2019 facilities or equipment, even by force majeure, may significantly impair the Company's ability to have its products and product candidates manufactured on a timely basis. The Company\u2019s reliance on contract manufacturers and suppliers further exposes it to the possibility that they, or third parties with access to their facilities, will have access to and may misappropriate the Company\u2019s trade secrets or other proprietary information. In addition, the manufacturing facilities of certain of the Company\u2019s suppliers may be located outside of the United States. This may give rise to difficulties in importing the Company\u2019s products or product candidates or their components into the United States or other countries.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Financial Operations\nThe Company has expressed substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern.\nManagement has determined that there is substantial doubt about the Company\u2019s ability to continue as a going concern due to uncertainties that the Company\u2019s cash flows generated from its operations will be sufficient to meet its current operating costs and the Company\u2019s future consolidated financial statements may include a similar qualification about its ability to continue as a going concern. The Company\u2019s year-end and interim financial statements were prepared assuming that it will continue as a going concern and do not include any adjustments that may result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nIf the Company is unable to meet its current operating costs, the Company would need to seek additional financing or modify its operational plans. If the Company seeks additional financing to fund its business activities in the future and there remains substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern, investors or other financing sources may be unwilling to provide additional funding to the Company on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nFailure to remediate a material weakness in internal accounting controls could result in material misstatements in the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company\u2019s management has identified a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting. The material weakness was due to a lack of controls in the financial closing and reporting process, including a lack of segregation of duties and the documentation and design of formalized processes and procedures surrounding the creation and posting of journal entries and account reconciliations. Additionally, the Company\u2019s management identified a material weakness in its internal control over the fair value calculation of options granted during the quarter ended June 30, 2021. If not remediated, or if the Company identifies further material weaknesses in its internal controls, the Company\u2019s failure to establish and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could result in material misstatements in its consolidated financial statements and a failure to meet its reporting and financial obligations.\nThe Company may be adversely affected by natural disasters and other catastrophic events and by man-made problems such as terrorism that could disrupt its business operations, and its business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect it from a serious disaster.\nThe Company\u2019s headquarters and main research facility are located in the greater San Diego area, which in the past has experienced severe earthquakes and fires. If these earthquakes, fires, other natural disasters, health pandemics or epidemics, terrorism and similar unforeseen events beyond its control, including for example the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, prevented it from using all or a significant portion of its headquarters or research facility, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible for the Company to continue its business for a substantial period of time. The Company does not have a disaster recovery or business continuity plan in place and may incur substantial expenses as a result of the absence or limited nature of the Company\u2019s internal or third-party service provider disaster recovery and business continuity plans, which, particularly when taken together with its lack of earthquake insurance, could have a material adverse effect on its business. Furthermore, integral parties in the Company\u2019s supply chain are operating from single sites, increasing their vulnerability to natural disasters or other sudden, unforeseen and severe adverse events. If such an event were to affect its supply chain, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s ability to conduct clinical trials, its development plans and its business.\nIf our information systems or data, or those of third parties upon which we rely, are or were compromised, we could experience adverse consequences resulting from such compromise, including but not limited to regulatory investigations or actions; litigation; fines and penalties; disruptions of our business operations; reputational harm; loss of revenue or profits; loss of customers or sales; and other adverse consequences.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we may process, as defined above, proprietary, confidential, and sensitive data, including personal data (such as health-related patient data), intellectual property, and trade secrets (collectively, sensitive information). We may rely upon third-party service providers and technologies to operate critical business systems to process sensitive information in a variety of contexts, including, without limitation, third-party providers of cloud-based infrastructure, employee email, CROs, and other functions. Our ability to monitor these third parties\u2019 information security practices is limited, and these third parties may not have adequate information security measures in place. We may share or receive sensitive information with or from third parties.\nThe risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attacks, cyber-intrusion, malicious internet-based activity, and online and offline fraud, are prevalent and have generally increased as the number, intensity, and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. These threats are becoming increasingly difficult to detect and come from a variety of sources, including traditional computer hackers, threat actors, personnel (such as through theft or misuse), sophisticated nation states, and nation-state-supported actors. Some actors now engage and are expected to continue to engage in cyber-attacks, including without limitation nation-state actors for geopolitical reasons and in conjunction with military conflicts and defense activities. During times of war and other major conflicts, we and the third parties upon which we rely may be vulnerable to a heightened risk of these attacks, including cyber-attacks that could materially disrupt our systems and operations, supply chain, and ability to produce, sell and distribute our products.\nWe and the third parties upon which we rely may be subject to a variety of evolving threats, including but not limited to social engineering attacks (including through phishing attacks), malicious code (such as viruses and worms), malware (including as a result of advanced persistent threat intrusions), denial-of-service attacks (such as credential stuffing), personnel misconduct or error, ransomware attacks, supply-chain attacks, software bugs, server malfunctions, software or hardware failures, loss of data or other information technology assets, adware, natural disasters, terrorism, war, and telecommunication and electrical failures. Ransomware attacks, including by organized criminal threat actors, nation-states, and nation-state-supported actors, are becoming increasingly prevalent and can lead to significant interruptions in our operations, loss of data and income, reputational harm, and diversion of funds. Extortion payments may alleviate the negative impact of a ransomware attack, but we may be unwilling or unable to make such payments due to, for example, applicable laws or regulations prohibiting such payments. Similarly, supply-chain attacks have increased in frequency and severity.\nFurthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic and our remote workforce poses increased risks to our information technology systems and data, as more of our employees work from home, utilizing network connections outside our premises.\nAny of the previously identified or similar threats could cause a security breach or disruption. While the Company has not experienced any such security breach or other disruption to date, if such an event were to occur, it could result in unauthorized, unlawful, or accidental acquisition, modification, destruction, loss, alteration, encryption, disclosure of, or access to our sensitive information and cause interruptions in the Company\u2019s operations, including material disruptions of its development programs and business operations.\nWe may expend significant resources or modify our business activities (including our clinical trial activities) to try to protect against security breaches and disruptions. Certain data privacy and security obligations may require us to implement and maintain specific security measures, industry-standard or reasonable security measures to protect our information technology systems and sensitive information. While we have implemented security measures designed to protect against security incidents, there can be no assurance that these measures will be effective. We may be unable in the future to detect vulnerabilities in our information technology systems because such threats and techniques change frequently, are often sophisticated in nature, and may not be detected until after a security breach or disruption has occurred. Despite our efforts to identify and remediate vulnerabilities, if any, in our information technology systems, our efforts may not be successful. Further, we may experience delays in developing and deploying remedial measures designed to address any such identified vulnerabilities.\nApplicable data privacy and security obligations may require us to notify relevant stakeholders of certain security breaches and disruptions. Such disclosures are costly, and the disclosure or the failure to comply with such requirements could lead to adverse consequences. If we (or a third party upon whom we rely) experience a security breach or other disruption, or are perceived to have experienced such events, we may experience adverse consequences, including: government enforcement actions (for example, investigations, fines, penalties, audits, and inspections); additional reporting requirements and/or oversight; restrictions on processing sensitive information (including personal data); litigation (including class claims); indemnification obligations; negative publicity; reputational harm; monetary fund diversions; interruptions in our operations (including availability of data); financial loss; and other similar harms. In particular, since the Company sponsors clinical trials, any breach or disruption that compromises patient data and identities could generate significant reputational damage, which may affect trust in the Company and our ability to recruit for future clinical trials. Additionally, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or future clinical trials could result in delays in the Company\u2019s regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase its costs to recover or reproduce the data.\nOur contracts may not contain limitations of liability, and even where they do, there can be no assurance that limitations of liability in our contracts are sufficient to protect us from liabilities, damages, or claims related to our data privacy and security obligations. Furthermore, we cannot be sure that our insurance coverage will be adequate or sufficient to protect us from or to mitigate liabilities arising out of our privacy and security practices, that such coverage will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or that such coverage will pay future claims\nThe Company\u2019s business and operations would suffer in the event of system failures, cyber-attacks or a deficiency in its cyber-security.\nDespite the implementation of security measures, the Company\u2019s internal computer systems and those of its current and future CROs and other contractors and consultants are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. Although the Company has not suffered any material incidents to date, the risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attacks or cyber-intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments, and cyber-terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased. While the Company has not experienced any such material system failure, accident or security breach to date, if such an event were to occur and cause interruptions in the Company\u2019s operations, it could result in a material disruption of its development programs and its business operations. In addition, since the Company sponsors clinical trials, any breach that compromises patient data and identities causing a breach of privacy could generate significant reputational damage and legal liabilities and costs to recover and repair, including affecting trust in the Company to recruit for future clinical trials. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed or future clinical trials could result in delays in the Company\u2019s regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase its costs to recover or reproduce the data. To the extent that any disruption or security breach were to result in a loss of, or damage to, the Company\u2019s data\nor applications or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information, the Company could incur liability and the further development and commercialization of its products and product candidates could be delayed.\nRisks Related to the Company\u2019s Intellectual Property\nThe Company may not be able to obtain, maintain or enforce global patent rights or other intellectual property rights that cover its product candidates and technologies that are of sufficient breadth to prevent third parties from competing against the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s success with respect to its product candidates will depend, in part, on its ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in both the U.S. and other countries, to preserve its trade secrets and to prevent third parties from infringing on its proprietary rights. The Company\u2019s ability to protect its product candidates from unauthorized or infringing use by third parties depends in substantial part on its ability to obtain and maintain valid and enforceable patents around the world.\nThe patent application process, also known as patent prosecution, is expensive and time-consuming, and the Company and its current or future licensors and licensees may not be able to prepare, file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner in all the countries that are desirable. It is also possible that the Company or its current licensors, or any future licensors or licensees, will fail to identify patentable aspects of inventions made in the course of development and commercialization activities before it is too late to obtain patent protection on them. Therefore, these and any of the Company\u2019s patents and applications may not be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of its business. Moreover, the Company\u2019s competitors independently may develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how or discover workarounds to the Company patents that would not constitute infringement. Any of these outcomes could impair the Company\u2019s ability to enforce the exclusivity of its patents effectively, which may have an adverse impact on its business, financial condition and operating results.\nDue to legal standards relating to patentability, validity, enforceability and claim scope of patents covering pharmaceutical inventions, the Company\u2019s ability to obtain, maintain and enforce patents is uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions especially across countries. Accordingly, rights under any existing patents or any patents the Company might obtain or license may not cover its product candidates or may not provide the Company with sufficient protection for its product candidates to afford a sustainable commercial advantage against competitive products or processes, including those from branded, generic and over-the-counter pharmaceutical companies. In addition, the Company cannot guarantee that any patents or other intellectual property rights will issue from any pending or future patent or other similar applications owned by or licensed to the Company. Even if patents or other intellectual property rights have issued or will issue, the Company cannot guarantee that the claims of these patents and other rights are or will be held valid or enforceable by the courts, through injunction or otherwise, or will provide the Company with any significant protection against competitive products or otherwise be commercially valuable to the Company in every country of commercial significance that the Company may target.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to obtain and maintain valid and enforceable patents depends on whether the differences between its technology and the prior art allow its technology to be patentable over the prior art. The Company does not have outstanding issued patents covering all of the recent developments in its technology and is unsure of the patent protection that it will be successful in obtaining, if any. Even if the patents do successfully issue, third parties may design around or challenge the validity, enforceability or scope of such issued patents or any other issued patents the Company owns or licenses, which may result in such patents being narrowed, invalidated or held unenforceable. If the breadth or strength of protection provided by the patents the Company holds or pursues with respect to its product candidates is challenged, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with the Company to develop or threaten its ability to commercialize or finance its product candidates.\nThe laws of some foreign jurisdictions do not provide intellectual property rights to the same extent or duration as in the U.S., and many companies have encountered significant difficulties in acquiring, maintaining, protecting, defending and especially enforcing such rights in foreign jurisdictions. If the Company encounters such difficulties in protecting or are otherwise precluded from effectively protecting its intellectual property in foreign jurisdictions, its business prospects could be substantially harmed, especially internationally.\nProprietary trade secrets and unpatented know-how are also very important to the Company\u2019s business. Although the Company has taken steps to protect its trade secrets and unpatented know-how by entering into confidentiality agreements with third parties, and intellectual property protection agreements with officers, directors, employees, and certain consultants and advisors, there can be no assurance that binding agreements will not be breached or enforced by courts, that the Company would have adequate remedies for any breach, including injunctive and other equitable relief, or that its trade secrets and unpatented know-how will not otherwise become known, inadvertently disclosed by the Company or its agents and representatives, or be independently discovered by its competitors. If trade secrets are independently discovered, the Company would not be able to prevent their use and if the Company and its agents or representatives inadvertently disclose trade secrets and/or unpatented know-how, the Company may not be allowed to retrieve this and maintain the exclusivity it previously held.\nThe Company may not be able to protect its intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting and defending patents on the Company\u2019s product candidates does not guarantee exclusivity. The requirements for patentability differ in certain countries, particularly developing countries. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as laws in the United States, especially when it comes to granting use and other kinds of patents and what kind of enforcement rights will be allowed, especially injunctive relief in a civil infringement proceeding. Consequently, the Company may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing its inventions in all countries outside the United States and even in launching an identical version of the Company\u2019s product notwithstanding the Company has a valid patent in that country. Competitors may use the Company\u2019s technologies in jurisdictions where it has not obtained patent protection to develop their own products, or produce copy products, and, further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where the Company has patent protection but enforcement on infringing activities is inadequate or where the Company has no patents. These products may compete with the Company\u2019s products, and the Company\u2019s patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property protection, particularly those relating to pharmaceuticals, and the judicial and government systems are often corrupt, which could make it difficult for the Company to stop the infringement of its patents or marketing of competing products in violation of its proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce its patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert its efforts and attention from other aspects of its business, could put its global patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and its global patent applications at risk of not issuing, and could provoke third parties to assert claims against it. The Company may not prevail in any lawsuits that the Company initiates or infringement actions brought against the Company, and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful when the Company is the plaintiff. If the Company is the defendant it may be required to post large bonds to stay in the market while it defends itself from an infringement action.\nIn addition, certain countries in Europe and certain developing countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties, especially if the patent owner does not enforce or use its patents over a protracted period of time. In some cases, the courts will force compulsory licenses on the patent holder even when finding the patent holder\u2019s patents are valid if the court believes it is in the best interests of the country to have widespread access to an essential product covered by the patent. In these situations, the royalty the court requires to be paid by the license holder receiving the compulsory license is not calculated at fair market value and can be inconsequential, thereby disaffecting the patentholder\u2019s business. In these countries, the Company may have limited remedies if its patents are infringed or if the Company is compelled to grant a license to its patents to a third party, which could also materially diminish the value of those patents. This would limit its potential revenue opportunities. Accordingly, the Company\u2019s efforts to enforce its intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that the Company owns or licenses, especially in comparison to what it enjoys from enforcing its intellectual property rights in the United States. Finally, the Company\u2019s ability to protect and enforce its intellectual property rights may be adversely affected by unforeseen changes in both U.S. and foreign intellectual property laws, or changes to the policies in various government agencies in these countries, including but not limited to the patent office issuing patents and the health agency issuing pharmaceutical product approvals. Finally, many countries have large backlogs in patent prosecution,\nand in some countries in Latin America it can take years, even decades, just to get a pharmaceutical patent application reviewed notwithstanding the merits of the application.\nObtaining and maintaining the Company\u2019s patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment, and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and its patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nPeriodic maintenance and annuity fees on any issued patent are due to be paid to the U.S. Patent and Trade Office (\"USPTO\") and foreign patent agencies in several stages over the lifetime of the patent. The USPTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. While an inadvertent lapse can, in many cases, be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction just for failure to know about and/or timely pay a prosecution fee. Non-compliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application include failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time limits, non-payment of fees in prescribed time periods, and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents in the format and style the country requires. If the Company or its licensors fail to maintain the patents and patent applications covering its product candidates for any reason, the Company\u2019s competitors might be able to enter the market, which would have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business.\nIf the Company fails to comply with its obligations under its intellectual property license agreements, it could lose license rights that are important to its business. Additionally, these agreements may be subject to disagreement over contract interpretation, which could narrow the scope of its rights to the relevant intellectual property or technology or increase its financial or other obligations to its licensors.\nThe Company has entered into in-license agreements with respect to certain of its product candidates. These license agreements impose various diligence, milestone, royalty, insurance and other obligations on the Company. If the Company fails to comply with these obligations, the respective licensors may have the right to terminate the license, in which event the Company may not be able to develop or market the affected product candidate. The loss of such rights could materially adversely affect its business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nIf the Company is sued for infringing intellectual property rights of third parties, such litigation could be costly and time consuming and could prevent or delay it from developing or commercializing its product candidates.\nThe Company\u2019s commercial success depends on its ability to develop, manufacture, market and sell its product candidates and use its proprietary technologies without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. The Company cannot assure that marketing and selling such candidates and using such technologies will not infringe existing or future patents. Numerous U.S.- and foreign-issued patents and pending patent applications owned by third parties exist in the fields relating to its product candidates. As the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are issued, the risk increases that others may assert that its product candidates, technologies or methods of delivery or use infringe their patent rights. Moreover, it is not always clear to industry participants, including us, which patents and other intellectual property rights cover various drugs, biologics, drug delivery systems or their methods of use, and which of these patents may be valid and enforceable. Thus, because of the large number of patents issued and patent applications filed in the Company\u2019s fields across many countries, there may be a risk that third parties may allege they have patent rights encompassing the Company\u2019s product candidates, technologies or methods.\nIn addition, there may be issued patents of third parties that are infringed or are alleged to be infringed by the Company\u2019s product candidates or proprietary technologies notwithstanding patents the Company may possess. Because some patent applications in the United States may be maintained in secrecy until the patents are issued, because patent applications in the United States and many foreign jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing and because publications in the scientific literature often lag behind actual discoveries, the Company cannot be certain that others have not filed patent applications for technology covered by its own and in-licensed issued patents or its pending applications. the Company\u2019s competitors may have filed, and may in the future file, patent applications covering the Company\u2019s own product candidates or technology similar to the Company\u2019s technology. Any such patent application may have priority over the Company\u2019s own and in-licensed patent applications or patents, which could further require the Company to obtain rights to issued patents covering such\ntechnologies, which may mean paying significant licensing fees or the like. If another party has filed a U.S. patent application on inventions similar to those owned or in-licensed to us, the Company or, in the case of in-licensed technology, the licensor may have to participate, in the United States, in an interference proceeding to determine priority of invention.\nThe Company may be exposed to, or threatened with, future litigation by third parties having patent or other intellectual property rights alleging that its product candidates or proprietary technologies infringe such third parties\u2019 intellectual property rights, including litigation resulting from filing under Paragraph IV of the Hatch-Waxman Act or other countries\u2019 laws similar to the Hatch-Waxman Act. These lawsuits could claim that there are existing patent rights for such drug, and this type of litigation can be costly and could adversely affect its operating results and divert the attention of managerial and technical personnel, even if the Company does not infringe such patents or the patents asserted against the Company is ultimately established as invalid. There is a risk that a court would decide that the Company is infringing the third party\u2019s patents and would order the Company to stop the activities covered by the patents. In addition, there is a risk that a court will order the Company to pay the other party significant damages for having violated the other party\u2019s patents.\nBecause the Company relies on certain third-party licensors and partners and will continue to do so in the future, if one of its licensors or partners is sued for infringing a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights, the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, operating results and prospects could suffer in the same manner as if the Company were sued directly. In addition to facing litigation risks, the Company has agreed to indemnify certain third-party licensors and partners against claims of infringement caused by the Company\u2019s proprietary technologies, and the Company has entered or may enter into cost-sharing agreements with some its licensors and partners that could require the Company to pay some of the costs of patent litigation brought against those third parties whether or not the alleged infringement is caused by its proprietary technologies. In certain instances, these cost-sharing agreements could also require the Company to assume greater responsibility for infringement damages than would be assumed just on the basis of its technology.\nThe occurrence of any of the foregoing could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or operating results.\nThe Company may be subject to claims that its officers, directors, employees, consultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed to us alleged trade secrets of their former employers or their former or current customers.\nAs is common in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, certain of the Company\u2019s employees were formerly employed by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including its competitors or potential competitors. Moreover, the Company engages the services of consultants to assist us in the development of the Company's product candidates, many of whom were previously employed at, or may have previously been or are currently providing consulting services to, other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including the Company's competitors or potential competitors. The Company may be subject to claims that these employees and consultants or the Company has inadvertently or otherwise wrongfully used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers or their former or current customers. Although the Company has no knowledge of any such claims being alleged to date, if such claims were to arise, litigation may be necessary to defend against any such claims. Even if the Company is successful in defending against any such claims, any such litigation could be protracted, expensive, a distraction to its management team, not viewed favorably by investors and other third parties, and may potentially result in an unfavorable outcome.\nOther Risks Related to the Company\nThe Company will need to raise additional financing in the future to fund its operations, which may not be available to it on favorable terms or at all.\nThe Company will require substantial additional funds to conduct the costly and time-consuming clinical efficacy trials necessary to pursue regulatory approval of LB1148 and any other product candidates. The Company\u2019s future capital requirements will depend upon a number of factors, including: the number and timing of future product candidates in the pipeline; progress with and results from preclinical testing and clinical trials; the ability to\nmanufacture sufficient drug supplies to complete preclinical and clinical trials; the costs involved in preparing, filing, acquiring, prosecuting, maintaining and enforcing patent and other intellectual property claims; and the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals and favorable reimbursement or formulary acceptance. Raising additional capital may be costly or difficult to obtain and could significantly dilute stockholders\u2019 ownership interests or inhibit the Company\u2019s ability to achieve its business objectives. If the Company raises additional funds through public or private equity offerings, the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely the rights of its common stockholders. Further, to the extent that the combined company raises additional capital through the sale of common stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into common stock, its stockholder\u2019s ownership interest in the Company will be diluted. In addition, any debt financing may subject the Company to fixed payment obligations and covenants limiting or restricting its ability to take specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends. If the Company raises additional capital through marketing and distribution arrangements or other collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing arrangements with third parties, the Company may have to relinquish certain valuable intellectual property or other rights to its product candidates, technologies, future revenue streams or research programs or grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to it. Even if the Company were to obtain sufficient funding, there can be no assurance that it will be available on terms acceptable to the Company or its stockholders.\nThe Company\u2019s business could be adversely affected by the effects of health pandemics or epidemics, including the recent COVID-19 pandemic, in regions where it or third parties on which it relies have significant manufacturing facilities, concentrations of clinical trial sites or other business operations. The COVID-19 pandemic could materially affect the Company\u2019s operations, including at its headquarters in California, which has been in the past, and could be in the future, subject to a county-wide stay-at-home order, and at clinical trial sites, as well as the business or operations of manufacturers, CROs or other third parties with whom the Company conducts business.\nThe Company\u2019s business could be adversely affected by the effects of health pandemics or epidemics in regions where it has concentrations of clinical trial sites or other business operations, and could cause significant disruption in the operations of third-party manufacturers and CROs upon whom it relies. For example, in December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, causing a disease referred to as COVID-19, was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China. Since then, COVID-19 and its variants have spread to most countries, including the United States and many other countries. The Company\u2019s headquarters is located in San Diego County, California, and many of the Company\u2019s raw materials for manufacture of LB1148 are produced in foreign countries. In March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic and the U.S. government-imposed travel restrictions on travel between the United States and numerous other countries. Further, the President of the United States declared the COVID-19 pandemic a national emergency, invoking powers under the Stafford Act, the legislation that directs federal emergency disaster response. Similarly, the State of California declared a state of emergency related to the spread of COVID-19. Further, on March 19, 2020 the State of California declared a statewide stay at home order for an indefinite period of time (subject to certain exceptions to facilitate authorized necessary activities) to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the stay-at-home order, the Company implemented work from home policies for all of its employees. The stay-at-home order has since expired and currently not in effect. The effects of future stay-at-home orders and work from home policies may negatively impact productivity, disrupt business and delay clinical programs and timelines, the magnitude of which will depend, in part, on the length and severity of the restrictions and other limitations on its ability to conduct business in the ordinary course. These and similar, and perhaps more severe, disruptions in operations could negatively impact the Company\u2019s business, operating results and financial condition.\nQuarantines, stay at home and similar government orders, or the perception that such orders, shutdowns or other restrictions on the conduct of business operations could occur, related to COVID-19 or other infectious diseases, may impact personnel at third-party manufacturing facilities in the United States and other countries, or the availability or cost of materials, which could disrupt the Company\u2019s supply chain. In particular, some of the Company\u2019s suppliers of certain materials used in the production of the Company\u2019s drug products are located in countries outside the United States, where there have been government-imposed quarantines. While many of these materials may be obtained by more than one supplier, restrictions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic may disrupt the Company\u2019s supply chain or limit its ability to obtain sufficient materials for its product candidates.\nSupply chain constraints associated with the COVID-19 pandemic have impacted the availability of the components needed in the manufacture of LB1148 and, depending on the duration and extent of the pandemic or new strains, could\nimpact the components and production capacity required for a commercial scale-up of LB1148. The Company's suppliers could be adversely impacted, which may result in delays or disruptions in the Company's current or future supply chain.\nIn addition, the Company\u2019s clinical trials may be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Clinical site initiation and patient enrollment may be delayed due to prioritization of hospital resources toward the COVID-19 pandemic. Some patients may not be able or willing to comply with clinical trial protocols if quarantines interrupt healthcare services, particularly surgical services. Similarly, the Company\u2019s ability to recruit and retain patients, principal investigators and site staff (who as healthcare providers may have heightened exposure to COVID-19) may be hindered, which would adversely affect clinical trial operations. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic may cause interruption or delays in the operation of the FDA or other regulatory authorities which could negatively affect the Company\u2019s planned clinical trials.\nThe spread of COVID-19, which has caused a broad impact globally, may materially affect the Company economically. While the potential economic impact brought by, and the duration of, the COVID-19 pandemic may be difficult to assess or predict, it is currently resulting in significant disruption of global financial markets. This disruption, if sustained or recurrent, could make it more difficult for the Company to access capital, which could in the future negatively affect its liquidity. In addition, a recession or market correction resulting from the spread of COVID-19 could materially affect the Company\u2019s business and the value of its common stock.\nThe global pandemic of COVID-19 continues to rapidly evolve. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or a similar health pandemic or epidemic is highly uncertain and subject to change. The Company does not yet know the full extent of potential delays or impacts on its business, its clinical trials, healthcare systems or the global economy as a whole. These effects could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s operations, and it will continue to monitor the COVID-19 situation closely. To the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects the Company\u2019s operations, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nThe stock price of the Company may be highly volatile.\nThe market price of shares of the Company could be subject to significant fluctuations. Since the completion of the Merger on April 27, 2021, the Company\u2019s stock price has already been subject to significant fluctuation. Market prices for securities of biotechnology and other life sciences companies historically have been particularly volatile subject even to large daily price swings. Some of the factors that may cause the market price of shares of the Company to fluctuate include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022the ability of the Company to obtain timely regulatory approvals for LB1148 or future product candidates, and delays or failures to obtain such approvals;\n\u2022failure of LB1148, if approved, to achieve commercial success;\n\u2022issues in manufacturing LB1148 or future product candidates;\n\u2022the results of current and any future clinical trials of LB1148;\n\u2022failure of other Company product candidates, if approved, to achieve commercial success;\n\u2022the entry into, or termination of, or breach by partners of key agreements, including key commercial partner agreements;\n\u2022the initiation of, material developments in, or conclusion of any litigation to enforce or defend any intellectual property rights or defend against the intellectual property rights of others;\n\u2022announcements of any dilutive equity financings;\n\u2022announcements by commercial partners or competitors of new commercial products, clinical progress or the lack thereof, significant contracts, commercial relationships or capital commitments;\n\u2022failure to elicit meaningful stock analyst coverage and downgrades of the Company\u2019s stock by analysts; and\n\u2022the loss of key employees.\nMoreover, the stock markets in general have experienced substantial volatility in the biotech industry that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of individual companies or a certain industry segment. These broad market fluctuations may also adversely affect the trading price of the Company\u2019s shares.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, shareholders have often instituted class action securities litigation against those companies. Such litigation, if instituted, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management attention and resources, which could significantly harm the Company\u2019s profitability and reputation. In addition, such securities litigation often has ensued after a reverse merger or other merger and acquisition activity of the type that the Company recently completed with LBS. Such litigation if brought could negatively impact the Company\u2019s business.\nThe Company is expected to take advantage of reduced disclosure and governance requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies, which could result in its common stock being less attractive to investors.\nAs of June 30, 2021, the last business day of the Company\u2019s most recently completed second fiscal quarter, the public float of the Company is less than $250 million and therefore qualifies as a smaller reporting company under the rules of the SEC. As a smaller reporting company, the Company will be able to take advantage of reduced disclosure requirements, such as simplified executive compensation disclosures and reduced financial statement disclosure requirements in its SEC filings. Decreased disclosures in the Company\u2019s SEC filings due to its status as a smaller reporting company may make it harder for investors to analyze its results of operations and financial prospects. The Company cannot predict if investors will find the Company\u2019s common stock less attractive if it relies on these exemptions. If some investors find its common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for its common stock and its stock price may be more volatile. The Company may take advantage of the reporting exemptions applicable to a smaller reporting company until it is no longer a smaller reporting company, which status would end once it has a public float greater than $250 million. In that event, the Company could still be a smaller reporting company if its annual revenues were below $100 million and it has a public float of less than $700 million.\nThe Company does not anticipate paying any dividends in the foreseeable future.\nThe current expectation is that the Company will retain its future earnings to fund the development and growth of its business. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of the shares of the Company will be your sole source of gain, if any, for the foreseeable future.\nIf the Company fails to attract and retain management and other key personnel, it may be unable to successfully develop or commercialize its product candidates or otherwise implement its business plan.\nThe biotechnology industry has experienced a high rate of turnover in recent years. The Company\u2019s ability to compete in the highly competitive biopharmaceuticals industry depends upon the ability to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled and experienced personnel with scientific, medical, regulatory, manufacturing and management skills and experience. The Company will conduct its operations in the greater San Diego area, a region that is home to many other biopharmaceutical companies as well as many academic and research institutions, resulting in fierce competition for qualified personnel. The Company may not be able to attract or retain qualified personnel in the future due to the intense competition for a limited number of qualified personnel among biopharmaceutical companies. Many of the other biopharmaceutical companies against which the Company will compete have greater financial and other resources, different risk profiles and a longer history in the industry. The Company\u2019s competitors may provide higher compensation, more diverse opportunities and/or better opportunities for career advancement. Any or all of these competing factors may limit the Company\u2019s ability to continue to attract and retain high quality personnel, which could negatively affect its ability to successfully develop and commercialize its product candidates and to grow the business and operations as currently contemplated.\nThe Company\u2019s ability to use NOL carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nThe Company has incurred substantial losses during its history and does not expect to become profitable in the near future, and it may never achieve profitability. Unused U.S. federal and state net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforwards generated in taxable years beginning before January 1, 2018, may be carried forward to offset future taxable income, if any, until such unused NOLs expire. Under current U.S. federal income tax law, U.S. federal NOLs generated in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, can be carried forward indefinitely, but the deductibility of such U.S. federal NOLs in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2020, is limited to 80% of taxable income. It is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to current U.S. federal tax law.\nIn addition, both current and future unused NOLs and other tax attributes may be subject to limitation under Sections 382 and 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, (the \"Code\"), and corresponding provisions of state law, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d which is generally defined as a greater than 50-percentage-point cumulative change, by value, in its equity ownership over a three-year period. To the extent the Company has undergone an ownership change, its ability to use its pre-change NOL carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes to offset its post-change income or taxes may be limited. Including the recently completed Merger, the Company has completed several equity offerings since its inception which may have resulted in an ownership change as defined by Sections 382 and 383 of the Code, or could result in an ownership change in the future. The Company has not completed a Code Section 382 and 383 analysis regarding the limitation of NOL and research and development credit carryforwards for all relevant tax years.\nAccordingly, the Company's pre-2018 NOL carryforwards may expire prior to being used, its NOL carryforwards generated in 2018 and thereafter will be subject to a percentage limitation and, the Company's ability to use pre-change NOL carryforwards and other pre-change tax attributes (such as research tax credits) to offset post-change income or taxes may be limited. Similar provisions of state tax law may also apply to limit the Company's use of accumulated state tax attributes. In addition, at the state level, there may be periods during which the use of NOLs is suspended or otherwise limited, which could accelerate or permanently increase state taxes owed. As a result, even if the Company attains profitability, it may be unable to use all or a material portion of its NOLs and other tax attributes, which could adversely affect future cash flows.\nChanges in tax law could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business.\nThe rules dealing with U.S. federal, state and local income taxation are constantly under review by the Internal Revenue Service, the U.S. Treasury Department and other governmental bodies. Changes to tax laws (which changes may have retroactive application) could adversely affect the Company or holders of its common stock. In recent years, many such changes have been made and changes are likely to continue to occur in the future. Future changes in tax laws could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, cash flow, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Company will incur costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public companies.\nThe Company will incur significant legal, accounting and other expenses that the Company did not incur as a private company prior to the Merger, including costs associated with public company reporting requirements. The Company also incurs costs associated with corporate governance requirements, including requirements under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as new implemented requirements by the SEC and Nasdaq. These rules and regulations are expected to increase the Company\u2019s legal and financial compliance costs and to make some activities more time consuming and costly. For example, the Company\u2019s management team consists of the executive officers of the Company prior to the Merger, some of whom have not previously managed and operated a public company. These executive officers and other personnel need to devote substantial time to gaining expertise regarding operations as a public company and compliance with applicable laws and regulations. These rules and regulations also may make it difficult and expensive for the Company to obtain directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance. As a result, it may be more difficult for the Company to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve on the Company\u2019s board of directors or as executive officers of the Company, which may adversely affect investor confidence in the Company and could cause its business or stock price to suffer.\nAnti-takeover provisions in the Company\u2019s charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of the Company more difficult and may prevent attempts by the Company stockholders to replace or remove the Company management.\nProvisions in the Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation and bylaws may delay or prevent an acquisition or a change in management. In addition, because the Company is incorporated in Delaware, it is governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the DGCL, which prohibits stockholders owning in excess of 15% of the outstanding Company voting stock from merging or combining with the Company. Although the Company believes these provisions collectively will provide for an opportunity to receive higher bids by requiring potential acquirors to negotiate with the Company\u2019s board of directors, they would apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by the Company\u2019s stockholders to replace or remove then current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of the board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of management.\nIf the Company fails to maintain proper and effective internal controls, its ability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis could be impaired.\nThe Company is subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and regulations of Nasdaq. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that the Company maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. The Company must perform system and process evaluation and testing of its internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of its internal controls over financial reporting in its Annual Report on Form 10-K filing for that year, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. This has required that the Company incur substantial professional fees and internal costs to expand its accounting and finance functions and that it expend significant management efforts. The Company may experience difficulty in meeting these reporting requirements in a timely manner.\nThe Company may discover weaknesses in its system of internal financial and accounting controls and procedures that could result in a material misstatement of its consolidated financial statements. Prior to the Merger, LBS\u2019s management identified a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting. The material weakness was due to a lack of controls in the financial closing and reporting process for LBS, including a lack of segregation of duties and the documentation and design of formalized processes and procedures surrounding the creation and posting of journal entries and account reconciliations. If the Company does not remediate this material weakness, or if the Company identifies further material weaknesses in its internal controls, the Company\u2019s failure to establish and maintain effective internal financial and accounting controls and procedures could result in material misstatements in its consolidated financial statements and a failure to meet its reporting and financial obligations.\nThe Company\u2019s internal control over financial reporting will not prevent or detect all errors and all fraud. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system\u2019s objectives will be met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and instances of fraud will be detected.\nIf the Company is not able to comply with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or if it is unable to maintain proper and effective internal controls, the Company may not be able to produce timely and accurate consolidated financial statements. If that were to happen, the market price of its common stock could decline and it could be subject to sanctions or investigations by Nasdaq, the SEC or other regulatory authorities.\nOur board of directors has broad discretion to issue additional securities, which might dilute the net tangible book value per share of our common stock for existing stockholders.\nThe Company is entitled under its certificate of incorporation to issue up to 300,000,000 shares of common stock and 7,000,000 \u201cblank check\u201d shares of preferred stock. Shares of the Company\u2019s blank check preferred stock provide its board of directors with broad authority to determine voting, dividend, conversion, and other rights. The Company expects that significant additional capital may be needed in the future to continue its planned operations. To the extent the Company raises additional capital by issuing equity securities, its existing shareholders may experience substantial\ndilution. The Company may sell common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in one or more transactions at prices and in a manner the Company determines from time to time. If the Company sells common stock, convertible securities or other equity securities in more than one transaction, investors may be materially diluted by subsequent sales. These sales may also result in material dilution to the Company\u2019s existing shareholders, and new investors could gain rights superior to existing shareholders. Pursuant to the Company\u2019s equity incentive plans and employee stock purchase plan, management is authorized to grant stock options, restricted stock units and other equity-based awards to employees, directors and consultants, and to sell common stock to employees, respectively. Any increase in the number of shares outstanding as a result of the exercise of outstanding options, the vesting or settlement of outstanding stock awards, or the purchase of shares pursuant to the employee stock purchase plan will cause shareholders to experience additional dilution, which could cause the stock price to fall.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nIf equity research analysts do not publish research or reports, or publish unfavorable research or reports, about the Company, its business or its market, its stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for the Company\u2019s common stock is and will be influenced by the research and reports that equity research analysts publish about it and its business. Equity research analysts may elect not to provide research coverage of the Company\u2019s common stock, and such lack of research coverage may adversely affect the market price of its common stock. In the event it does have equity research analyst coverage, the Company will not have any control over the analysts, or the content and opinions included in their reports. The price of the Company\u2019s common stock could decline if one or more equity research analysts downgrade its stock or issue other unfavorable commentary or research. If one or more equity research analysts ceases coverage of the Company or fails to publish reports on it regularly, demand for its common stock could decrease, which in turn could cause its stock price or trading volume to decline.\nFuture sales of substantial amounts of our common stock, or the possibility that such sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nFuture sales in the public market of shares of our common stock, including shares issued upon exercise of our outstanding stock options, or the perception by the market that these sales could occur, could lower the market price of our common stock or make it difficult for us to raise additional capital.\nOur business could be negatively affected as a result of actions of activist stockholders, and such activism could impact the trading value of our securities.\nStockholders may, from time to time, engage in proxy solicitations or advance stockholder proposals, or otherwise attempt to effect changes and assert influence on our board of directors and management. Activist campaigns that contest or conflict with our strategic direction or seek changes in the composition of our board of directors could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. A proxy contest would require us to incur significant legal and advisory fees, proxy solicitation expenses and administrative and associated costs and require significant time and attention by our board of directors and management, diverting their attention from the pursuit of our business strategy. Any perceived uncertainties as to our future direction and control, our ability to execute on our strategy, or changes to the composition of our board of directors or senior management team arising from a proxy contest could lead to the perception of a change in the direction of our business or instability which may result in the loss of potential business opportunities, make it more difficult to pursue our strategic initiatives, or limit our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners, any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results. If individuals are ultimately elected to our board of directors with a specific agenda, it may adversely affect our ability to effectively implement our business strategy and create additional value for our stockholders. We may choose to initiate, or may become subject to, litigation as a result of the proxy contest or matters arising from the proxy contest, which would serve as a further distraction to our board of directors and management and would require us to incur significant additional costs. In addition, actions such as those described above could cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based upon temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business.\nSecurities class action litigation could divert our management\u2019s attention and harm our business and could subject us to significant liabilities.\nThe stock markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices for the equity securities of life sciences and biotechnology companies. These broad market fluctuations may cause the market price of our ordinary shares to decline. In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following a decline in the market price of its securities. This risk is especially relevant for us because biotechnology and biopharma companies have experienced significant stock price volatility in recent years. Even if we are successful in defending claims that may be brought in the future, such litigation could result in substantial costs and may be a distraction to our management and may lead to an unfavorable outcome that could adversely impact our financial condition and prospects.", "PERMNO": 92252, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "SNCA"}
