Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to significant risks, including the risks and uncertainties described below. These risks and uncertainties and the other information in this Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements, should be carefully considered. If any of the events described below actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected in a material way.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe may not be successful in the implementation of our long-term business rebuilding strategy, which could adversely affect our business and our results of operations.\nOur success depends, to a significant degree, on our ability to successfully implement our long-term business strategy. Our ability to successfully implement our business strategies depends upon a significant number of factors, including but not limited to:\n\u00b7\nour ability to successfully execute our long-term business strategy;\n\u00b7\nour ability to access an adequate supply of top-quality merchandise from suppliers at a competitive price;\n\u00b7\nour ability to achieve profitable sales and to make adjustments as market conditions change;\n\u00b7\ncustomer acceptance of our marketing and merchandise strategies;\n\u00b7\nour ability to respond to competitive pressures in our industry;\n\u00b7\nthe extent to which our management team can properly respond to the dynamics and demands of our market;\n\u00b7\nour ability to achieve positive cash flow, particularly during our peak inventory build-ups in advance of the holiday selling season; and\n\u00b7\nour employees\u2019 ability to adapt to our new strategic initiatives and organizational structure.\nChanges in economic and political conditions may adversely affect consumer spending, which could significantly harm our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nThe success of our business depends, to a significant extent, upon the level of consumer spending. A number of factors beyond our control affect the level of consumer spending on merchandise that we offer, including, among other things:\n\u00b7\ngeneral economic and industry conditions;\n\u00b7\nunemployment;\n\u00b7\nthe housing market;\n\u00b7\ndeterioration in consumer confidence;\n\u00b7\ncrude oil prices that affect gasoline and diesel fuel, as well as, increases in other fuels used to support utilities;\n\u00b7\nfood prices and their effect on consumer discretionary spending;\n\u00b7\nefforts by our customers to reduce personal debt levels;\n\u00b7\ninterest rates;\n\u00b7\nfluctuations in the financial markets;\n\u00b7\ntax rates and policies;\n\u00b7\nwar, terrorism and other hostilities; and\n\u00b7\nconsumer confidence in future economic conditions.\nThe merchandise we sell generally consists of discretionary items. Reduced consumer confidence and spending cut backs may result in reduced demand for our merchandise, including discretionary items, and may force us to take significant inventory markdowns. Reduced demand also may require increased selling and promotional expenses. Adverse economic conditions and any related decrease in consumer demand for our merchandise could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nAny failure to identify and respond to changes in consumer trends and preferences could significantly harm our business.\nThe retail home furnishings and housewares industry is subject to sudden shifts in consumer trends and consumer spending. Our sales and results of operations depend in part on our ability to predict or respond to changes in trends and consumer preferences in a timely manner. Although our business model allows us greater flexibility than many traditional retailers to meet consumer preferences and trends, we may not successfully do so. Any sustained failure to anticipate, identify and respond to emerging trends in consumer preferences could negatively affect our business and results of operations.\nWe must continuously attract buying opportunities for off-price merchandise and anticipate consumer demand as off-price merchandise becomes available, and our failure to do so could adversely affect our performance.\nBy its nature, specific off-price merchandise items are available from manufacturers or vendors generally on a non-recurring basis. As a result, we do not have long-term contracts with our vendors for supply, pricing or access to products, but make individual purchase decisions, which may be for large quantities. Due to economic uncertainties, some of our manufacturers and suppliers may cease operations or may otherwise become unable to continue supplying off-price merchandise on terms acceptable to us. We further cannot assure that manufacturers or vendors will continue to make off-price merchandise available to us in quantities acceptable to us or that our buyers will continue to identify and take advantage of appropriate buying opportunities. In addition, if we misjudge consumer demand for products, we may significantly overstock unpopular products and be forced to take significant markdowns and miss opportunities to sell more popular products. An inability to acquire suitable off-price merchandise in the future or to accurately anticipate consumer demand for such merchandise would have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nOur results of operations will be negatively affected if we are not successful in managing our inventory profitably.\nInventory is the largest asset on our balance sheet and represented approximately 63%, 62% and 66% of our total assets at June 30, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Efficient inventory management is a key component of our business success and profitability. To be successful, we must maintain sufficient inventory levels to meet our customers\u2019 demands without allowing those levels to increase to such an extent that the costs to store and hold the goods unduly impact our financial results. If our buying decisions do not accurately predict customer trends or purchasing actions, we may have to take unanticipated markdowns to dispose of the excess inventory, which also can adversely impact our financial results. We continue to focus on ways to reduce these risks, but we cannot assure that we will be successful in our inventory management. If we are not successful in managing our inventory balances, our results of operations may be negatively affected. In the second quarter of fiscal 2013, we made a strategic decision to accelerate the sell-off of certain inventory by the end of the 2013 calendar year. In connection with this decision, we recorded a pre-tax $41.8 million inventory write-down in cost of sales during the second quarter of fiscal 2013, and we recorded a pre-tax $43.7 million inventory write-down in cost of sales during the full fiscal 2013 year. As part of our business turnaround strategic decision to exit certain categories of merchandise, we recorded a pre-tax $5.3 million charge in cost of sales during fiscal 2014 and there can be no assurances that we will not record additional inventory charges in the future.\nThe loss of, or disruption in the operations of, our centralized distribution center would have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nWith few exceptions, all inventory is shipped directly from suppliers to our centralized distribution center in the Dallas, Texas metropolitan area, where the inventory is then processed, sorted and shipped to our stores. We depend in large part on the orderly operation of this receiving and distribution process, which depends, in turn, on adherence to shipping schedules and effective management of the distribution center. In fiscal 2015, we executed a lease related to our new, additional distribution center in Phoenix, Arizona. We may not anticipate all of the changing demands which our expanding operations will impose on our receiving and distribution system. We may also experience delays in opening our new distribution center or integrating the center with our existing distribution operations. In addition, events beyond our control, such as disruptions in operations due to fire or other catastrophic events, labor disagreements or shipping problems, may result in delays in the delivery of merchandise to our stores. We also cannot assure that our insurance will be sufficient, or that insurance proceeds will be timely paid to us, in the event a distribution center is shut down for any reason.\nThe loss or departure of one or more members of our senior management or other key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur future performance will depend in large part upon the efforts and abilities of our senior management and our other key employees. The loss of service of these persons could have a material adverse effect on our business and future prospects. We do not maintain key person life insurance for our senior management. In addition, we have recently experienced turnover of a number of members of senior management. We cannot provide any assurance that we will not experience future turnover related to our senior management team.\nOur business is intensely competitive, and a number of different competitive factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nThe retail home furnishings and housewares industry is intensely competitive. As an off-price retailer of home furnishings and housewares, we currently compete against a diverse group of retailers, including department stores and discount stores, specialty, on-line, and catalog retailers and mass merchants, which sell, among other products, home furnishing, houseware and related products similar and often identical to those we sell. We also compete in particular markets with a substantial number of retailers that specialize in one or more types of home furnishing and houseware products that we sell. Many of these competitors have substantially greater financial resources that may, among other things, increase their ability to purchase inventory at lower costs or to initiate and sustain aggressive price competition.\nA number of different competitive factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition, including:\n\u00b7\nincreased operational efficiencies of competitors;\n\u00b7\ncompetitive pricing strategies, including deep discount pricing by a broad range of retailers during periods of poor consumer confidence or economic uncertainty;\n\u00b7\ncontinued and prolonged promotional activity by competitors;\n\u00b7\nliquidation sales by a number of our competitors who have filed or may file in the future for bankruptcy;\n\u00b7\nexpansion by existing competitors;\n\u00b7\nentry by new competitors into markets in which we currently operate; and\n\u00b7\nadoption by existing competitors of innovative store formats or retail sales methods.\nWe cannot assure that we will be able to continue to compete successfully with our existing or new competitors, or that prolonged periods of deep discount pricing by our competitors will not materially harm our business. We compete for customers, associates, locations, merchandise, services and other important aspects of our business with many other local, regional, national and international retailers. We also face competition from alternative retail distribution channels such as catalogues and, increasingly, e-commerce websites. Changes in the merchandising, pricing and promotional activities of those competitors, and in the retail industry, in general, may adversely affect our performance.\nIf we are unable to successfully execute our strategy of relocating or expanding existing stores and when appropriate, opening new stores, our operating performance could be adversely impacted.\nAs part of our business strategy, we intend to pursue relocation opportunities to improve our existing store base as well as open new stores that will offset the closing of lower performing stores as they come up for renewal. However, we cannot assure that we will be able to achieve our relocation goals or that we will be able to operate any new or relocated stores profitably. Further, we cannot assure that any new or relocated store will achieve similar operating results to those of our existing stores or that new, relocated or expanded stores opened in markets in which we operate will not have a material adverse effect on the net sales and profitability of our existing store base.\nThe success of our store development strategy will be dependent upon numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including the following:\n\u00b7\nthe ability of our personnel to adequately analyze and identify suitable markets and individual store sites within those markets;\n\u00b7\nthe competition for suitable store sites;\n\u00b7\nour ability to negotiate favorable lease terms with landlords;\n\u00b7\nour ability to obtain governmental and other third-party consents, permits and licenses needed to operate our stores;\n\u00b7\nthe availability of employees to staff new stores and our ability to hire, train, motivate and retain store personnel;\n\u00b7\nthe availability of adequate management and financial resources to properly manage a large volume of stores;\n\u00b7\nour ability to adapt our distribution and other operational and management systems to a changing network of stores; and\n\u00b7\nour ability to attract customers and generate sales sufficient to operate new, relocated or expanded stores profitably.\nWhile we opened stores in existing markets during fiscal 2015, 2014, and 2013, we also opened stores in new markets during that time period. These markets may have different competitive conditions, consumer trends and discretionary spending patterns than our existing markets, which may cause our new stores in these markets to be less successful than stores in our existing markets.\nIncreases in fuel prices and changes in transportation industry regulations or conditions may increase our freight costs and thus our cost of sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nOur freight cost is impacted by changes in fuel prices through surcharges. Fuel prices and surcharges affect freight cost both on inbound freight from vendors to our distribution center and outbound freight from our distribution center to our stores. In addition, the U.S. government requires drivers of over-the-road trucks to take certain rest periods which reduce the available amount of time they can drive during a 24-hour period. Changes in trucking industry conditions, such as truck driver shortages and highway congestion, could increase freight costs. High fuel prices or surcharges, as well as stringent driver regulations and changes in transportation industry conditions, may increase freight costs and thereby increase our cost of sales.\nIf we are not able to generate strong cash flows from our operations or to continue to access credit markets, we will not be able to support capital expansion, operations and debt repayment.\nOur business is dependent upon our operations generating strong cash flows to support capital expansion requirements and general operating activities. In addition, we have a credit agreement providing for a revolving credit facility in the amount of up to $180.0 million. The revolving credit facility contains certain restrictive covenants, and if borrowing availability falls below certain\nthresholds, a financial covenant. If we are unable to comply with the revolving credit facility, we may not be able to obtain an alternate source of funding on satisfactory terms, if at all. Our inability to continue to generate sufficient cash flows to support these activities or the lack of availability of financing in adequate amounts and on appropriate terms could adversely affect our financial performance.\nAn increase in the cost or a disruption in the flow of our imported products may significantly decrease our sales and profits.\nMerchandise manufactured and imported from overseas represents the majority of our total product purchases acquired both domestically and internationally. A disruption in the shipping of imported merchandise or an increase in the cost of those products may significantly decrease our sales and profits. In addition, if imported merchandise becomes more expensive or unavailable, the transition to alternative sources may not occur in time to meet our demands. Products from alternative sources may also be of lesser quality and more expensive than those we currently import.\nRisks associated with our reliance on imported products include disruptions in the shipping and importation or increases in the costs of imported products because of factors such as:\n\u00b7\nraw material shortages;\n\u00b7\nwork stoppages;\n\u00b7\nstrikes and political unrest;\n\u00b7\nproblems with oceanic shipping, including shipping container shortages;\n\u00b7\nincreased customs inspections of import shipments or other factors causing delays in shipments;\n\u00b7\neconomic crises;\n\u00b7\ninternational disputes and wars; loss of \u201cmost favored nation\u201d trading status by the United States in relation to a particular foreign country;\n\u00b7\nimport duties;\n\u00b7\nimport quotas and other trade sanctions; and\n\u00b7\nincreases in shipping rates.\nThe products we buy abroad are sometimes priced in foreign currencies and, therefore, we are affected by fluctuating exchange rates. In the past, we have entered into foreign currency exchange contracts with major financial institutions to hedge these fluctuations. We might not be able to successfully protect ourselves in the future against currency rate fluctuations, and our financial performance could suffer as a result. You should read Item 7 \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and Item 7A \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d for more information about our foreign currency exchange rate exposure and hedging activities.\nOur success depends upon our marketing, advertising and promotional efforts. If we are unable to implement them successfully, or if our competitors are more effective than we are, our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe use marketing and promotional programs to attract customers to our stores and to encourage purchases by our customers. We use various media for our promotional efforts, including print, database marketing, email, direct marketing, and other electronic communications such as online social networks. If we fail to choose the appropriate medium for our efforts, or fail to implement and execute new marketing opportunities, our competitors may be able to attract some of our customers and cause them to decrease purchases from us and increase purchases elsewhere, which would negatively impact our net sales. Changes in the amount and degree of promotional intensity or merchandising strategy by our competitors could cause us to have some difficulties in retaining existing customers and attracting new customers.\nIf we do not attract, train and retain quality associates in appropriate numbers, including key associates and management, our performance could be adversely affected.\nOur performance is dependent on recruiting, developing, training and retaining quality sales, distribution center and other associates in large numbers, as well as, experienced buying and management personnel. Many of our associates are in entry level or part-time positions with historically high rates of turnover. Our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling costs is subject to external factors, such as unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates, minimum wage legislation and changing demographics. In the event of increasing wage rates, if we do not increase our wages competitively, our customer service could suffer because of a\ndeclining quality of our workforce, or our earnings would decrease if we increase our wage rates whether in response to market demands or new minimum wage legislation. Changes that adversely impact our ability to attract and retain quality associates and management personnel could adversely affect our performance.\nOur results of operations are subject to seasonal and quarterly fluctuations, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results or the market price of our common stock.\nOur business is subject to seasonality with a higher level of net sales and operating income generated during the quarter ended December 31, which includes the holiday shopping season. Net sales in the quarters ended December 31, 2014, 2013, and 2012, accounted for approximately 33%, 33%, and 34%, respectively, of our annual net sales for such years. For more information about our seasonality, please read Item 7 \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Quarterly Results and Seasonality.\u201d\nBecause a significant percentage of our net sales and operating income are generated in the quarter ending December 31, we have limited ability to compensate for shortfalls in December quarter sales or earnings by changes in our operations or strategies in other quarters. A significant shortfall in results for the quarter ending December 31 of any year could have a material adverse effect on our annual results of operations and on the market price of our common stock. In addition, in anticipation of higher sales during this period, we purchase substantial amounts of seasonal inventory and hire many temporary employees. An excess of seasonal merchandise inventory could result if our net sales during this principal selling season were to fall below either seasonal norms or expectations. If our December quarter sales results were substantially below expectations, our financial performance and operating results could be adversely affected by unanticipated markdowns, particularly in seasonal merchandise. Lower than anticipated sales in the principal selling season would also negatively affect our ability to absorb the increased seasonal labor costs.\nOur quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate significantly based on additional factors, such as:\n\u00b7\nthe timing of new store openings;\n\u00b7\nthe amount of net sales contributed by new and existing stores;\n\u00b7\nthe success of our store expansion and relocation program;\n\u00b7\nthe timing of certain holidays and advertised events;\n\u00b7\nchanges in our merchandise mix;\n\u00b7\ngeneral economic, industry and weather conditions that affect consumer spending; and\n\u00b7\nactions of competitors, including promotional activity.\nThese factors could also have a material adverse effect on our annual results of operations and on the market price of our common stock.\nIf we are unable to maintain and protect our information technology systems and technologies, we could suffer disruptions in our business, damage to our reputation with customers, and incur substantial costs and liability.\nThe operation of business is heavily dependent upon the implementation, integrity, security, and successful functioning of our computer networks and information systems, including the point-of-sale systems in our stores, data centers that process transactions, and various software applications used in our operations. Our systems are subject to damage or interruption from weather events, power outages, telecommunications or computer failures, computer viruses, security breaches, employee errors and similar occurrences. A failure of our systems to operate effectively as a result of damage to, interruption, or failure of any of these systems could result in data loss, a failure to meet our reporting obligations, or material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements, or cause losses due to disruption of our business operations and loss of customer confidence. These adverse situations could also lead to loss of sales or profits or cause us to incur additional repair, replacement and development costs.\nIf we fail to protect the security of information about our business and our customers, suppliers, business partners and employees, we could damage our reputation and our business, incur substantial additional costs and become subject to litigation and government investigations and enforcement actions.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, and personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, on our computer networks and information systems. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure and that\nof our service providers may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Cyber threats are rapidly evolving and are becoming increasingly sophisticated. Any such attack or breach could compromise our security and remain undetected for a period of time, and confidential information could be misappropriated, resulting in a loss of customers\u2019, suppliers\u2019, business partners\u2019 or employees\u2019 personal information, negative publicity, harm to our business and reputation, and potentially causing us to incur costs to reimburse third parties for damages and potentially subjecting us to government investigations and enforcement actions. In addition, the regulatory environment surrounding data and information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, as new and revised requirements are frequently imposed across our business. For example, during 2015, we will be required to comply with new chip card standards. Compliance with more demanding privacy and information security laws and standards may result in significant expense due to increased investment in technology and the development of new operational processes, and implementing new initiatives could result in system disruptions. We maintain cyber risk insurance, but this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our losses from any future breaches of our systems.\nWe are subject to various government regulations, changes in the existing laws and regulations and new laws and regulations which may adversely affect our operations and financial performance.\nThe development and operation of our stores are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations in many areas of our business, including, but not limited to, those that impose restrictions, levy a fee or tax, or require a permit or license, or other regulatory approval, and building and zoning requirements. Difficulties or failures in obtaining required permits, licenses or other regulatory approvals could delay or prevent the opening of a new store, and the suspension of, or inability to renew, a license or permit could interrupt operations at an existing store. We are also subject to laws governing our relationship with employees, including minimum wage requirements, overtime, health insurance mandates, working and safety conditions, and immigration status requirements. Additionally, potential changes in federal labor laws, including \u201ccard check\u201d regulations, could result in portions of our workforce being subjected to greater organized labor influence. This could result in an increase to our labor costs. A significant portion of our store personnel are paid at rates related to the minimum wage established by federal, state and municipal law. Additionally, we are subject to certain laws and regulations that govern our handling of customers\u2019 personal information. A failure to protect the integrity and security of our customers\u2019 personal information could expose us to private litigation and government investigations and enforcement actions, as well as materially damage our reputation with our customers. While we endeavor to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, governmental and regulatory bodies may change such laws and regulations in the future which may require us to incur substantial cost increases. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we may be subject to various sanctions, penalties or fines and may be required to cease operations until we achieve compliance which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results and operations.\nWe face litigation risks from customers, employees, and other third parties in the ordinary course of business.\nOur business is subject to the risk of litigation by customers, current and former employees, suppliers, stockholders and others through private actions, class actions, administrative proceedings, regulatory actions, or other litigation. The outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits and regulatory actions, is difficult to assess or quantify. Plaintiffs in these types of lawsuits may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts, and the magnitude of the potential loss relating to such lawsuits may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. The cost to defend future litigation may be significant. There may also be adverse publicity associated with litigation that could decrease customer acceptance of merchandise offerings, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are ultimately found liable.\nWe face risks with respect to product liability claims and product recalls, which could adversely affect our reputation, our business, and our consolidated results of operations.\nWe purchase merchandise from third parties and offer this merchandise to customers for sale. This merchandise could be subject to recalls and other actions by regulatory authorities. Changes in laws and regulations could also impact the type of merchandise we offer to customers. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, issues that result in recalls of merchandise. In addition, individuals have asserted claims, and may in the future assert claims, that they have sustained injuries from third-party merchandise offered by us, and we may be subject to future lawsuits relating to these claims. There is a risk that these claims or liabilities may exceed, or fall outside the scope of, our insurance coverage. Any of the issues mentioned above could result in damage to our reputation, diversion of development and management resources, or reduced sales and increased costs, any of which could harm our business.\nOur stores may be adversely affected by local conditions, natural disasters, and other events.\nCertain regions in which our stores are located may be subject to adverse local conditions, natural disasters, and other events. If severe weather, such as heavy snowfall or extreme temperatures, discourages or restricts customers in a particular region from traveling to our stores, our sales could be adversely affected. If severe weather conditions occur during the second quarter of the year,\nthe adverse impact to our sales and profitability could be even greater than at other times during the year because we generate a significant portion of our sales and profits during these periods. Natural disasters including tornados, hurricanes, floods, and earthquakes may damage our stores or other operations, which may adversely affect our consolidated financial results. Additionally, demographic shifts in the areas where our stores are located could adversely impact our consolidated financial results and operations.\nOur results of operations may be negatively affected by inventory shrinkage.\nWe are subject to the risk of inventory loss and theft. Although our inventory shrinkage rates have not fluctuated significantly in recent years, we cannot assure you that actual rates of inventory loss and theft in the future will be within our estimates or that the measures we are taking will effectively reduce the problem of inventory shrinkage. Although some level of inventory shrinkage is an unavoidable cost of doing business, if we were to experience higher rates of inventory shrinkage or incur increased security costs to combat inventory theft, our results of operations could be affected adversely.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur certificate of incorporation, and bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our Board of Directors.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws will have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. These provisions include the following:\n\u00b7\nthe ability of our Board of Directors to issue shares of our common stock and preferred stock without stockholder approval (subject to applicable NASDAQ requirements);\n\u00b7\na requirement that stockholder meetings may only be called by our President, Chief Executive Officer, the Chairman of the Board or at the written request of a majority of the directors then in office and not our stockholders;\n\u00b7\na prohibition of cumulative voting in the election of directors, which would otherwise allow less than a majority of stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u00b7\nthe ability of our Board of Directors to make, alter or repeal our bylaws without further stockholder approval; and\n\u00b7\nthe requirement for advance notice for nominations for directors to our Board of Directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nBecause we do not presently have plans to pay dividends on our common stock, stockholders must look solely to appreciation of our common stock to realize a gain on their investment.\nOn February 1, 2008, our Board of Directors voted to terminate the declaration of an annual cash dividend. The Board of Directors will consider the full range of alternatives with regard to the use of any excess cash flow in the future. Our future dividend policy is within the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon various factors, including our business, financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements and investment opportunities. Accordingly, stockholders must look solely to appreciation of our common stock to realize a gain on their investment. This appreciation may not occur.\nThe price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially over the past several years and may continue to fluctuate substantially in the future.\nFrom June 30, 2014 to June 30, 2015, the trading prices of our common stock ranged from a low of $11.20 per share to a high of $22.88 per share. We expect our stock to continue to be subject to fluctuations as a result of a variety of factors, including factors beyond our control, which have been included throughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We may fail to meet the expectations of our stockholders or securities analysts at some time in the future, and our stock price could decline as well.", "PERMNO": 86866, "SIC": 5331, "TIC": "TUESQ"}
