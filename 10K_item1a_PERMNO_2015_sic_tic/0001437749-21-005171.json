Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the information set forth below. The following risk factors describe situations in which our business, financial condition and/or results of operations could be materially harmed, and the value of our securities may be adversely affected. You should also refer to other information included or incorporated by reference in this report.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is adversely affecting the businesses, financial conditions and operating results of the companies in which we have an ownership interest, as well as our ability to monetize such interests, and it may also cause us to increase the amount of additional capital we will need to provide to such companies.\nThe current economic and market conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic are negatively impacting the companies in which we have ownership interests, including, without limitation, their operations, supply chains, sales infrastructures and the demand for their products and services. This is negatively affecting their businesses, financial conditions and operating results. As a result, we may be required to provide additional capital to such companies, which may cause us to face liquidity issues that will constrain our ability to execute our business strategy and limit our ability to provide financial support to all of our existing companies in the amounts that we desire. We are also experiencing a more challenging mergers and acquisitions market in general for such companies, which has resulted in lower valuation expectations and extended exit timelines for such companies, which, in turn, could negatively affect the amount and timing of the monetization opportunities for such companies and our ability to return value to shareholders.\nThe intended monetization of our company interests and the return of value to shareholders are subject to factors beyond our control.\nIn January 2018, we announced that we will not deploy any capital into new companies. We will instead focus on supporting, and maximizing monetization opportunities for, our existing company interests to return value to shareholders. However, this strategic plan may require providing additional capital and operational support to such existing companies and we may not be able to sell our company interests during any specific time frame or otherwise on desirable terms, if at all, and there can be no assurance as to how long this process will take or the results that this process will yield. There can be no assurance as to whether we will realize the value of escrowed proceeds, holdbacks or other contingent consideration, if any, associated with the sale of our company interests. Additionally, there can be no assurance that we will be able to satisfy our liabilities during this process. Further, the method, timing and amount of any return of value resulting from the monetization of existing company interests will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on market and business conditions and our overall liabilities, capital structure and liquidity position.\nA disposition of one or more of our company interests may occur at a time that will yield less value than if we held such interests for a longer period of time.\nOur companies are at various stages in their lifecycles. The value of our interests in our companies at any point in time is highly dependent on the progress and success such companies have made at such time with respect to the development and marketing of their products and services and that value may fluctuate significantly. In order to effect our strategy of monetizing our interests in our companies, we may dispose of such interests at a time prior to the applicable company reaching its maximum value. Doing so will result in a return of value to shareholders that is less than that which may have been returned if we retained our interests in such company for a longer period of time\nOur principal business strategy depends upon our ability to make good decisions regarding the deployment of capital into, and subsequent disposition of, our existing company interests and, ultimately, the performance of such companies, which is uncertain.\nIf we make poor decisions regarding the deployment of capital into, and subsequent disposition of, our existing companies, our business strategy will not succeed. If such companies do not succeed, the value of our assets could be significantly reduced and require substantial impairments or write-offs and our results of operations and the price of our common stock would be adversely affected. The risks relating to our companies include:\n\u2022\nmost of our companies have a history of operating losses and/or limited operating history;\n\u2022\nthe intense competition affecting the products and services our companies offer could adversely affect their businesses, financial condition, results of operations and prospects for growth;\n\u2022\nthe inability to adapt to changing marketplaces;\n\u2022\nthe inability to manage growth;\n\u2022\nthe need for additional capital to fund their operations, which we may not be able to fund or which may not be available from third parties on acceptable terms, if at all;\n\u2022\nthe inability to protect their proprietary rights and/or infringing on the proprietary rights of others;\n\u2022\nthat our companies could face legal liabilities from claims made against them based upon their operations, products or work;\n\u2022\nthe impact of economic downturns on their operations, results and growth prospects;\n\u2022\nthe inability to attract and retain qualified personnel;\n\u2022\nthe existence of government regulations and legal uncertainties may place financial burdens on the businesses of our companies; and\n\u2022\nthe inability to plan for and manage catastrophic events.\nThese and other risks are discussed in detail under the caption \u201cRisks Related to Our Companies\u201d below.\nAs we execute against our strategy, a significant amount of our deployed capital may be concentrated in companies operating in the same or similar industries, limiting our diversification.\nOur capital deployments could be concentrated in several companies that operate in the same or similar industries. This may cause us to be more susceptible to any single economic, regulatory or other occurrence affecting those particular industries than we would otherwise be if our companies operated in more diversified industries.\nOur business model does not rely upon, or plan for, the receipt of operating cash flows from our companies. Our companies do not provide us with cash flow from their operations. We rely on cash on hand, liquidity events and our ability to generate cash from capital raising activities to finance our operations.\nWe need capital to fund the capital needs of our existing companies. We also need cash to finance our corporate overhead and meet our existing funding commitments. As a result, we have substantial cash requirements. Our companies do not provide us with cash flow from their operations. To the extent our companies generate any cash from operations, they generally retain the funds to develop their own businesses. As a result, we must rely on cash on hand, company liquidity events and new capital raising activities to meet our cash needs. If we are unable to find ways of monetizing our holdings of company interests or raising additional capital on attractive terms, we may face liquidity issues that will require us to constrain our ability to execute our business strategy and limit our ability to provide financial support to our existing companies.\nWe may be unable to obtain maximum value for our holdings or to sell our holdings on a timely basis.\nWe hold significant positions in our companies. If we were to divest all or part of our holdings in a company, we may have to sell our interests at a relative discount to intrinsic value. For companies with publicly traded stock, we may be unable to sell our holdings at then-quoted market prices. The trading volume and public float in the common stock of a publicly traded company in which we have an interest may be small relative to our holdings. As a result, any significant open-market divestiture by us of our holdings in such a company, if possible at all, would likely have a material adverse effect on the market price of its common stock and on our proceeds from such a divestiture. Additionally, we may not be able to take our companies public as a means of monetizing our position or creating shareholder value. Registration and other requirements under applicable securities laws and contractual restrictions also may adversely affect our ability to dispose of our company holdings on a timely basis.\nOur success is dependent on our senior management.\nOur success is dependent on our senior management team\u2019s ability to execute our strategy. In connection with our new strategy announced in 2018, we made a series of management changes intended to streamline our organizational structure and reduce our operating costs and since then we have made, and may make, further management changes from time to time. A loss of one or more of the remaining members of our senior management team without adequate replacement could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur business strategy may not be successful if valuations in the market sectors in which our companies participate decline.\nOur strategy involves creating value for our shareholders by helping our companies build value and, if appropriate, accessing the public and private capital markets. Therefore, our success is dependent on the value of our companies as determined by the public and private capital markets. Many factors, including reduced market interest, may cause the market value of our companies to decline. If valuations in the market sectors in which our companies participate decline, their access to the public and private capital markets on terms acceptable to them may be limited.\nOur companies could make business decisions that are not in our best interests or with which we do not agree, which could impair the value of our holdings.\nAlthough we currently own a significant, influential interest in some of our companies, we do not maintain a controlling interest in any of our companies. Acquisitions of interests in companies in which we share or have no control, and the dilution of our interests in or a further reduction of our control of companies, will involve additional risks that could cause the performance of our interests and our operating results to suffer, including:\n\u2022\nthe management teams or other equity or debt holders of our companies having economic or business interests or objectives that are different from ours; and\n\u2022\nthe companies not taking our advice with respect to the financial or operating issues they may encounter.\nOur inability to control our companies also could prevent us from assisting them, financially or otherwise, or could prevent us from liquidating our interests in them at a time or at a price that is favorable to us. Additionally, our companies may not act in ways that are consistent with our business strategy. These factors could hamper our ability to maximize returns on our interests and cause us to incur losses on our interests in these companies.\nWe may have to buy, sell or retain assets when we would otherwise not wish to do so in order to avoid registration under the Investment Company Act.\nThe Investment Company Act of 1940 regulates companies which are engaged primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities. Under the Investment Company Act, a company may be deemed to be an investment company if it owns investment securities with a value exceeding 40% of the value of its total assets (excluding government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis, unless an exemption or safe harbor applies. We refer to this test as the \u201c40% Test.\u201d Securities issued by companies other than consolidated companies are generally considered \u201cinvestment securities\u201d for purposes of the Investment Company Act, unless other circumstances exist which actively involve the company holding such interests in the management of the underlying company. We are a company that partners with growth-stage companies to build value; we are not engaged primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities. We are in compliance with the 40% Test. Consequently, we do not believe that we are an investment company under the Investment Company Act.\nWe monitor our compliance with the 40% Test and seek to conduct our business activities to comply with this test. It is not feasible for us to be regulated as an investment company because the Investment Company Act rules are inconsistent with our strategy of actively helping our companies in their efforts to build value. In order to continue to comply with the 40% Test, we may need to take various actions which we would otherwise not pursue. For example, we may be limited in the manner or timing in which we sell our interests in a company. Our ownership levels also may be affected if our companies are acquired by third parties or if our companies issue stock which dilutes our ownership interest. The actions we may need to take to address these issues while maintaining compliance with the 40% Test could adversely affect our ability to create and realize value at our companies.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic may adversely affect parties with obligations to us, including the subtenant of our previous office space.\nIn March 2019, we entered into a sublease of our prior corporate headquarters office space beginning in June 2019. The term of the sublease is through April 2026, the same as our underlying lease. Fixed sublease payments to us are escalating over the term of the sublease. We remain obligated under the original lease for such office space and, in the event the subtenant of such office space fails to satisfy its obligations under the sublease, we would be required to satisfy our obligations directly to the landlord under such original lease.\nRisks Related to Our Companies\nMost of our companies have a history of operating losses and/or limited operating history and may never be profitable.\nMost of our companies have a history of operating losses and/or limited operating history, have significant historical losses and may never be profitable. Many have incurred substantial costs to develop and market their products, have incurred net losses and cannot fund their cash needs from operations. We expect that the operating expenses of certain of our companies will increase substantially in the foreseeable future as they continue to develop products and services, increase sales and marketing efforts, and expand operations.\nOur companies face intense competition, which could adversely affect their business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects for growth.\nThere is intense competition in the technology marketplaces, and we expect competition to intensify in the future. Our business, financial condition, and results of operations will be materially adversely affected if our companies are not able to compete successfully. Many of the present and potential competitors may have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than those of our companies. This may place our companies at a disadvantage in responding to the offerings of their competitors, technological changes or changes in client requirements. Also, our companies may be at a competitive disadvantage because many of their competitors have greater name recognition, more extensive client bases and a broader range of product offerings. In addition, our companies may compete against one another.\nThe success or failure of many of our companies is dependent upon the ultimate effectiveness of newly-created technologies, medical devices, financial services, healthcare diagnostics, etc.\nOur companies\u2019 business strategies are often highly dependent upon the successful launch and commercialization of an innovative technology or device, including, without limitation, technologies or devices used in healthcare, financial services or digital media. Despite all of our efforts to understand the research and development underlying the innovation or creation of such technologies and devices before we deploy capital into a company, sometimes the performance of the technology or device does not match our expectations or those of such company. In those situations, it is likely that we will incur a partial or total loss of the capital which we deployed in such company.\nOur companies may fail if they do not adapt to changing marketplaces.\nIf our companies fail to adapt to changes in technology and customer and supplier demands, they may not become or remain profitable. There is no assurance that the products and services of our companies will achieve or maintain market penetration or commercial success, or that the businesses of our companies will be successful.\nThe technology marketplaces are characterized by:\n\u2022\nrapidly changing technology;\n\u2022\nevolving industry standards;\n\u2022\nfrequent introduction of new products and services;\n\u2022\nshifting distribution channels;\n\u2022\nevolving government regulation;\n\u2022\nfrequently changing intellectual property landscapes; and\n\u2022\nchanging customer demands.\nOur future success will depend on our companies\u2019 ability to adapt to these evolving marketplaces. They may not be able to adequately or economically adapt their products and services, develop new products and services or establish and maintain effective distribution channels for their products and services. If our companies are unable to offer competitive products and services or maintain effective distribution channels, they will sell fewer products and services and forego potential revenue, possibly causing them to lose money. In addition, we and our companies may not be able to respond to the marketplace changes in an economically efficient manner, and our companies may become or remain unprofitable.\nOur companies may grow rapidly, including through acquisitions of other businesses, and may be unable to manage their growth.\nWe expect some of our companies to grow rapidly, including through acquisitions of other businesses. Such growth often places considerable operational, managerial, integration and financial strain on a business. To successfully manage such growth, our companies must, among other things:\n\u2022\nimprove, upgrade and expand their business infrastructures;\n\u2022 successfully integrate and operate any newly acquired businesses;\n\u2022\nscale up production operations;\n\u2022\ndevelop appropriate financial reporting controls;\n\u2022\nattract and retain qualified personnel; and\n\u2022\nmaintain appropriate levels of liquidity.\nIf our companies are unable to manage their growth successfully, their ability to respond effectively to competition and to achieve or maintain profitability will be adversely affected.\nBased on our business model, some or all of our companies will need to raise additional capital to fund their operations at any given time. We may not be able to, or decline to, fund some or all of such amounts and such amounts may not be available from third parties on acceptable terms, if at all. Further, if our companies do raise additional capital from third parties, either debt or equity, such capital may rank senior to, or dilute, our interests in such companies.\nWe cannot be certain that our companies will be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms when needed, if at all. We may not be able to, or decline to, provide our companies with sufficient capital resources to enable them to reach a cash-flow positive position or a sale of the company. General economic disruptions and downturns may also negatively affect the ability of some of our companies to fund their operations from other stockholders and capital sources. We also may fail to accurately project the capital needs of companies. If our companies need capital, but are not able to raise capital from us or other outside sources, they may need to cease or scale back operations. In such event, our interest in any such company will become less valuable. If our companies raise additional capital from third parties, either debt or equity, such capital may be dilutive, making our interests less valuable or if such capital ranks senior to the capital we have deployed, such capital may entitle its holders to receive returns of capital before we are entitled to receive any return of our deployed capital. Also, in the event of any insolvency, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or bankruptcy of one or more our companies, holders of such company\u2019s instruments that rank senior to our deployed capital will typically be entitled to receive payment in full before we receive any return of our deployed capital. After returning such senior capital, such company may not have any remaining assets to use for returning capital to us, causing us to lose some or all of our deployed capital in such company.\nEconomic disruptions and downturns may negatively affect our companies\u2019 plans and their results of operations.\nMany of our companies are largely dependent upon outside sources of capital to fund their operations. Disruptions in the availability of capital from such sources will negatively affect the ability of such companies to pursue their business models and will force such companies to revise their growth and development plans accordingly. Any such changes will, in turn, negatively affect our ability to realize the value of our capital deployments in such companies.\nIn addition, downturns in the economy as well as possible governmental responses to such downturns and/or to specific situations in the economy could affect the business prospects of certain of our companies, including, but not limited to, in the following ways: weaknesses in the financial services industries; reduced business and/or consumer spending; and/or systemic changes in the ways the healthcare system operates in the United States.\nSome of our companies may be unable to protect their proprietary rights and may infringe on the proprietary rights of others.\nOur companies assert various forms of intellectual property protection. Intellectual property may constitute an important part of our companies\u2019 assets and competitive strengths. Federal law, most typically copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws, generally protects intellectual property rights. Although we expect that our companies will take reasonable efforts to protect the rights to their intellectual property, third parties may develop similar intellectual property independently. Moreover, the complexity of international trade secret, copyright, trademark and patent law, coupled with the limited resources of our companies and the demands of quick delivery of products and services to market, create a risk that our companies\u2019 efforts to prevent misappropriation of their technology will prove inadequate.\nSome of our companies also license intellectual property from third parties and it is possible that they could become subject to infringement actions based upon their use of the intellectual property licensed from those third parties. Our companies generally obtain representations as to the origin and ownership of such licensed intellectual property. However, this may not adequately protect them. Any claims against our companies\u2019 proprietary rights, with or without merit, could subject the companies to costly litigation and divert their technical and management personnel from other business concerns. If our companies incur costly litigation and their personnel are not effectively deployed, the expenses and losses incurred by our companies will increase and their profits, if any, will decrease.\nThird parties have and may assert infringement or other intellectual property claims against our companies based on their patents or other intellectual property claims. Even though we believe our companies\u2019 products do not infringe any third party\u2019s patents, they may have to pay substantial damages, possibly including treble damages, if it is ultimately determined that they do. They may have to obtain a license to sell their products if it is determined that their products infringe on another person\u2019s intellectual property. Our companies might be prohibited from selling their products before they obtain a license, which, if available at all, may require them to pay substantial royalties. Even if infringement claims against our companies are without merit, defending these types of lawsuits takes significant time, is expensive and may divert management attention from other business concerns.\nCertain of our companies could face legal liabilities from claims made against their operations, products or work.\nBecause the manufacture and sale of certain company products entail an inherent risk of product liability, certain of our companies maintain product liability insurance. Although none of our current companies have experienced any material losses in this regard, there can be no assurance that they will be able to maintain or acquire adequate product liability insurance in the future and any product liability claim could have a material adverse effect on a company\u2019s financial stability, revenues and results of operations. In addition, many of the engagements of our companies involve projects that are critical to the operation of their clients\u2019 businesses. If our companies fail to meet their contractual obligations, they could be subject to legal liability, which could adversely affect their business, operating results and financial condition. Our companies\u2019 contracts typically include provisions designed to limit their exposure to legal claims relating to their services and products. However, these provisions may not protect our companies or may not be enforceable. Also, some of our companies depend on their relationships with their clients and their reputation for high-quality services and integrity to retain and attract clients. As a result, claims made against our companies\u2019 work may damage their reputation, which in turn could impact their ability to compete for new work and negatively impact their revenue and profitability.\nOur companies\u2019 success depends on their ability to attract and retain qualified personnel.\nOur companies depend upon their ability to attract and retain senior management and key personnel, including trained technical and marketing personnel. Our companies also will need to continue to hire additional personnel as they expand. Although our current companies have not been the subject of a work stoppage, any future work stoppage could have a material adverse effect on their respective operations. A shortage in the availability of the requisite qualified personnel or work stoppage would limit the ability of our companies to grow, to increase sales of their existing products and services, and to launch new products and services.\nGovernment regulations and legal uncertainties may place financial burdens on the businesses of our companies.\nManufacturers of medical diagnostic devices and operators of laboratory facilities are subject to strict federal and state regulation regarding validation and the quality of manufacturing and laboratory facilities. Failure to comply with these quality regulation systems requirements could result in civil or criminal penalties or enforcement proceedings, including the recall of a product or a \u201ccease distribution\u201d order. The enactment of any additional laws or regulations that affect healthcare insurance policy and reimbursement (including Medicare reimbursement) could negatively affect some of our companies. If Medicare or private payers change the rates at which our companies or their customers are reimbursed by insurance providers for their products, such changes could adversely impact our companies.\nSome of our companies may be subject to significant environmental, health, data security and safety regulation.\nSome of our companies may be subject to licensing and regulation under federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment and human health and safety, including laws and regulations relating to the handling, transportation and disposal of medical specimens, infectious and hazardous waste and radioactive materials, as well as to the safety and health of manufacturing and laboratory employees. In addition, some of our companies are subject to federal, state and local financial securities and data security regulations, including, without limitation, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended, the California Consumer Privacy Act and the European General Data Protection Regulation, which impose varying degrees of additional obligations, costs and risks upon such companies, including the imposition of significant penalties in the event of any non-compliance. Further, the federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration has established extensive requirements relating to workplace safety. Compliance with such regulations could increase operating costs at certain of our companies, and the failure to comply could negatively affect the operations and results of some of our companies.\nCatastrophic events may disrupt our companies\u2019 businesses.\nSome of our companies are highly automated businesses and rely on their network infrastructure, various software applications and many internal technology systems and data networks for their customer support, development, sales and marketing and accounting and finance functions. Further, some of our companies provide services to their customers from data center facilities in multiple locations. Some of these data centers are operated by third parties, and the companies have limited control over those facilities. A disruption or failure of these systems or data centers in the event of a natural disaster, telecommunications failure, power outage, cyber-attack, war, terrorist attack or other catastrophic event could cause system interruptions, reputational harm, delays in product development, breaches of data security and loss of critical data. Such an event could also prevent the companies from fulfilling customer orders or maintaining certain service level requirements, particularly in respect of their SaaS offerings. While certain of our companies have developed certain disaster recovery plans and maintain backup systems to reduce the potentially adverse effect of such events, a catastrophic event that resulted in the destruction or disruption of any of their data centers or their critical business or information technology systems could severely affect their ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, their business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe cannot provide assurance that our companies\u2019 disaster recovery plans will address all of the issues they may encounter in the event of a disaster or other unanticipated issue, and their business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate them for losses that may occur from any of the foregoing. In the event that a natural disaster, terrorist attack or other catastrophic event were to destroy any part of their facilities or interrupt their operations for any extended period of time, or if harsh weather or health conditions prevent them from delivering products in a timely manner, their business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to an Investment in our Securities\nFluctuations in the price of the common stock of our publicly traded holdings may affect the price of our common stock.\nFrom time to time, we may hold equity interests in companies that are publicly traded. Fluctuations in the market prices of the common stock of publicly traded holdings may affect the price of our common stock. Historically, the market prices of our publicly traded holdings have been highly volatile and subject to fluctuations unrelated or disproportionate to operating performance.\nThe continuing costs and burdens associated with being a public company will constitute a much larger percentage of our expenses and we may in the future delist our common stock with the New York Stock Exchange and seek to deregister our common stock with the SEC.\nWe will remain a public company and will continue to be subject to the listing standards of the New York Stock Exchange and SEC rules and regulations, including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The costs and burdens of being a public company will be a significant and continually increasing portion of our expenses if we are able to monetize our company interests. As part of such monetization efforts, we will likely in the future, once the majority of our company interests have been monetized, delist our common stock from the New York Stock Exchange and seek to deregister our common stock with the SEC. However, there can be no assurance as to the timing of such transactions, or whether such transactions will be completed at all, and we will continue to face the costs and burdens of being a public company until such time as our common stock is delisted with the New York Stock Exchange and deregistered with the SEC.\nEconomic disruptions and downturns may have negative repercussions for us.\nEvents in the United States and international capital markets, debt markets and economies may negatively impact our stock price and our ability to pursue certain tactical and strategic initiatives, such as accessing additional public or private equity or debt financing for us or for our companies and selling our interests in companies on terms acceptable to us and in time frames consistent with our expectations.\nWe cannot provide assurance that material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will not be identified in the future.\nWe cannot assure you that material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will not be identified in the future. Any failure to maintain or implement required new or improved controls, or any difficulties we encounter in their implementation, could result in a material weakness, or could result in material misstatements in our Consolidated Financial Statements. These misstatements could result in a restatement of our Consolidated Financial Statements, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and/or cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, leading to a decline in our stock price.", "PERMNO": 46340, "SIC": 6799, "TIC": "SFE"}
