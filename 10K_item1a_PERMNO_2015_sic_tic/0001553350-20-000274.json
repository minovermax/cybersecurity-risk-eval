{"cik": "1282224", "company": "Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-30", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nRisks Related to our Business and Financial Condition\nManagement has determined that certain factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nThe financial statements included with this report are presented under the assumption that we will continue as a going concern, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business over a reasonable length of time. Management has determined that certain factors raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, such as incurring substantial net losses and losses from operations for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. As of December 31, 2019, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $2.9 million, of which $0.7 million is a guaranty for certain leases. Management is planning to raise any necessary additional capital to fund our operating expenses through loans and additional sales of our common stock, securities convertible into our common stock, debt securities or a combination of such financing alternatives; however, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising any necessary additional capital. If we are not successful in raising additional capital, we may not have enough financial resources to support our business and operations and, as a result, may not be able to continue as a going concern and could be forced to liquidate. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainties. Please also see Note 2 to our audited consolidated financial statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe have a history of net losses and may continue to incur net losses.\nWe have a history of net losses and may be unable to generate sufficient revenue to achieve profitability in the future. For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, our net loss was $1,193,377 and $2,913,321. Our accumulated deficit was $96,024,243 and $94,529,174 at December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Our ability to generate net profit in the future will depend on our ability to realize the financial benefits from the operations of 42West, The Door, Shore Fire, Viewpoint and to successfully produce and commercialize multiple web series or films, as no single project is likely to generate sufficient revenue to cover our operating expenses. If we are unable to generate net profit at some point, we will not be able to meet our debt service or working capital requirements. As a result, we may need to (i) issue additional equity, which could substantially dilute the value of your share holdings, (ii) sell a portion or all of our assets, including any project rights which might have otherwise generated revenue, or (iii) cease operations.\nWe currently have substantial indebtedness which may adversely affect our cash flow and business operations and may affect our ability to continue to operate as a going concern.\nWe currently have a substantial amount of debt. We do not currently have sufficient assets to repay such debt in full when due, and our available cash flow may not be adequate to maintain our current operations if we are unable to repay, extend or refinance such indebtedness. The table below sets forth our total principal amount of debt and stockholders\u2019 equity as of December 31, 2019 and 2018. Approximately $3.0 million of our total debt as of December 31, 2019 represented the fair value of the put options in connection with the 42West acquisition, which may or may not be exercised by the sellers. Approximately $3.3 million of our indebtedness as of December 31, 2019 was incurred by Max Steel Productions, LLC. Max Steel Productions, LLC is a variable interest entity (or VIE) created in connection with the financing and production of Max Steel (the \u201cMax Steel VIE\u201d). We are not a party to the indebtedness of our VIE, however, if a lender were to successfully assert that we are liable to the lender for the payment of Max Steel VIE\u2019s debt despite the lack of contractual obligation, we do not have sufficient funds to repay this loan, which would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. Approximately $4.4 million of our debt is related to convertible notes payable, $1.4 million to non-convertible notes payable and $1.7 million is a line of credit with Bank United.\nOur indebtedness could have important negative consequences, including:\n\u00b7\nour ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, future productions or other purposes may be impaired or such financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all;\n\u00b7\nwe may have to pay higher interest rates upon obtaining future financing, thereby reducing our cash flows; and\n\u00b7\nwe may need a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness, reducing the funds that would otherwise be available for operations and future business opportunities.\nOur ability to service our indebtedness will depend upon, among other things, our future financial and operating performance and our ability to obtain additional financing, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions, the profitability of our content production and entertainment publicity and marketing businesses and other factors contained in these Risk Factors, some of which are beyond our control.\nIf we are not able to generate sufficient cash to service our current or future indebtedness, we will be forced to take actions such as reducing or delaying digital or film productions, delaying or abandoning potential acquisitions, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness or seeking additional debt or equity capital or bankruptcy protection. We may not be able to effect any of these remedies on satisfactory terms or at all and our indebtedness may affect our ability to continue to operate as a going concern.\nOur business and operations, and the operations of our customers, may be adversely affected by epidemics and pandemics, such as the recent COVID-19 outbreak.\nWe may face risks related to health epidemics and pandemics or other outbreaks of communicable diseases, which could result in a widespread health crisis that could adversely affect general commercial activity and the economies and financial markets of the country as a whole. For example, the recent outbreak of COVID-19, which began in China, has been declared by the World Health Organization to be a \u201cpandemic,\u201d has spread across the globe, including the United States of America, where we conduct most of our business. A health epidemic or pandemic or other outbreak of communicable diseases, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic, poses the risk that we or our customers, suppliers and other business partners may be disrupted or prevented from conducting business activities for certain periods of time, the durations of which are uncertain, and may otherwise experience significant impairments of business activities, including due to, among other things, operational shutdowns or suspensions that may be requested or mandated by national or local governmental authorities or self-imposed by us, our customers, suppliers or other business partners. As an example, our subsidiary, The Door, operates in the food and hospitality industry, which is being adversely affected by the government imposed shut down of restaurants and hotels throughout the United States. While it is not possible at this time to estimate the impact that COVID-19 could have on our business, customers, suppliers or other business partners, the continued spread of COVID-19, the measures taken by the local and federal government, actions taken to protect employees, and the impact of the pandemic on various business activities could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nLitigation or legal proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities.\nWe may in the future become party to litigation claims and legal proceedings. We face litigation risks regarding a variety of issues, including without limitation, copyright infringement, allegations against clients or events we provide marketing services for, alleged violations of federal and state labor and employment laws, securities laws, and other matters. These proceedings may be time consuming, expensive and disruptive to normal business operations. The defense of such lawsuits could result in significant expense and the diversion of our management\u2019s time and attention from the operation of our business. Costs we incur to defend or to satisfy a judgment or settlement of these claims may not be covered by insurance or could exceed the amount of that coverage or increase our insurance costs and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows.\nOur management has determined that our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal controls over financial reporting are not effective as we have identified material weaknesses in our internal controls.\nAs disclosed in Part II, Item 9A. Controls and Procedures of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, management concluded that for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective and we identified several material weaknesses. Our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nWe have commenced our remediation efforts as discussed in Part II, 9A. Controls and Procedures of this Annual Report on Form 10-K to address the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting and ineffective disclosure controls and procedures. If our remedial measures are insufficient, or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal controls occur in the future, we could be required to restate our financial results, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, restrict our ability to access the capital markets, require us to expend significant resources to correct the weakness or deficiencies, harm our reputation and otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence. In addition, we could be subject to, among other things, regulatory or enforcement actions by the Securities and Exchange Commission, (the \u201cSEC\u201d or the \u201cCommission\u201d).\nWe rely on information technology systems that are susceptible to cybersecurity risks. In the event of a cybersecurity incident, we could experience operational interruptions, incur substantial additional costs, become subject to legal or regulatory proceedings or suffer damage to our reputation.\nWe rely on information technologies and infrastructure to manage our businesses, including digital storage of marketing strategies and client information, films and digital programming and delivery of digital marketing services for our businesses. Data maintained in digital form is subject to the risk of intrusion, tampering and theft. The incidence of malicious technology-related events, such as cyberattacks, computer hacking, computer viruses, worms or other destructive or disruptive software, denial of service attacks or other malicious activities is on the rise worldwide. Power outages, equipment failure, natural disasters (including extreme weather), terrorist activities or human error may also affect our systems and result in disruption of our services or loss or improper disclosure of personal data, business information or other confidential information.\nLikewise, data privacy breaches, as well as improper use of social media, by employees and others may pose a risk that sensitive data, such as personally identifiable information, strategic plans and trade secrets, could be exposed to third parties or to the general public. We also utilize third parties, including third-party \u201ccloud\u201d computing services, to store, transfer or process data, and system failures or network disruptions or breaches in the systems of such third parties could adversely affect our reputation or business. Any such breaches or breakdowns could lead to business interruption, exposure of our or our clients\u2019 proprietary or confidential information, data corruption, damage to our reputation, exposure to legal and regulatory proceedings and other costs. Such events could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, we could be adversely affected if any of our significant customers or suppliers experience any similar events that disrupt their business operations or damage their reputation. Efforts to develop, implement and maintain security measures are costly, may not be successful in preventing these events from occurring and require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. Although we maintain monitoring practices and protections of our information technology to reduce these risks, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent the risk of a security breach of our databases or systems that could adversely affect our business.\nRisks Related to Our Entertainment Publicity and Marketing Business\nOur business could be adversely affected if we fail to retain the principal sellers, and other key employees of 42West, The Door and Shore Fire and the clients they serve.\nThe success of our entertainment publicity and marketing business operated by 42West, The Door and Shore Fire substantially depends on our ability to retain the services of the former owners and certain key employees of 42West, The Door and Shore Fire. If we lose the services of one or more of these individuals, our ability to successfully implement our business plan with respect to our entertainment publicity and marketing business and the value of our common stock could be materially adversely affected. Although we entered into employment agreements with each of the principal sellers, there can be no assurance that they will serve the terms of their respective employment agreements or choose to remain with us following the expiration of such terms. In addition, the employees of 42West, The Door and Shore Fire, and their skills and relationships with clients, are among our most valuable assets. In June of 2018, three of 42West\u2019s most senior publicists and their related staff left the firm to form their own company. Their departures resulted in a significant decrease in revenues. An important aspect of the business\u2019 competitiveness is its ability to retain such key employees. If 42West, The Door or Shore Fire fail to hire and retain a sufficient number of these key employees, it may have a material adverse effect on our overall business and results of operations.\n42West, The Door and Shore Fire\u2019s talent rosters currently include some of the best known and most highly respected members of the entertainment, hospitality, and musical communities. These include major studios and networks, corporations, well-known consumer brands, celebrity chefs, leading restaurant and hotel brands, and recording artists. These clients often form highly loyal relationships with certain public relations and marketing professionals rather than with a particular firm. The employment agreements with the principal sellers currently contain non-competition provisions that prohibit the principal sellers from continuing to provide services to such clients should they leave our company, however, clients are free to engage other public relations and marketing professionals and there can be no assurance that they will choose to remain with our company. The success of 42West, The Door, and Shore Fire, therefore, depend on our ability to continue to successfully maintain such client relationships should the principal sellers or other key employees leave our company. If we are unable to retain the current 42West, The Door, and Shore Fire clients or attract new clients, then we could suffer a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\n42West, The Door, Shore Fire and Viewpoint operate in a highly competitive industry.\nThe entertainment publicity and marketing business is highly competitive. Through 42West, The Door and Shore Fire, we must compete with other agencies, and with other providers of marketing and publicity services, in order to maintain existing client relationships and to win new clients. Through Viewpoint, we compete against other creative branding agencies, as well as in-house creative teams at many of our clients. The client\u2019s perception of the quality of an agency\u2019s creative work and the agency\u2019s reputation are critical factors in determining its competitive position.\nThe success of our entertainment publicity and marketing business depends on its ability to consistently and effectively deliver marketing and public relations services to its clients.\n42West, The Door and Shore Fire\u2019s success depends on its ability to effectively and consistently staff and execute client engagements to achieve the clients\u2019 unique personal or professional goals. 42West, The Door and Shore Fire work to design customized communications or publicity campaigns tailored to the particular needs and objectives of particular projects. In some of its engagements, 42West, The Door and Shore Fire rely on other third parties to provide some of the services to its clients, and we cannot guarantee that these third parties will effectively deliver their services or that we will have adequate recourse against these third parties in the event they fail to effectively deliver their services. Other contingencies and events outside of our control may also impact 42West, The Door and Shore Fire\u2019s ability to provide its services. 42West, The Door and Shore Fire\u2019s failure to effectively and timely staff, coordinate and execute its client engagements may adversely impact existing client relationships, the amount or timing of payments from clients, its reputation in the marketplace and ability to secure additional business and our resulting financial performance. In addition, our contractual arrangements with our clients may not provide us with sufficient protections against claims for lost profits or other claims for damages.\nIf we are unable to adapt to changing client demands, social and cultural trends or emerging technologies, we may not remain competitive and our business, revenues and operating results could suffer.\nWe operate in an industry characterized by rapidly changing client expectations, marketing technologies, and social mores and cultural trends that impact our target audiences. The entertainment industry continues to undergo significant developments as advances in technologies and new methods of message delivery and consumption emerge. These developments drive changes in our target audiences\u2019 behavior to which we must adapt in order to reach our target audiences. In addition, our success depends on our ability to anticipate and respond to changing social mores and cultural trends that impact the entertainment industry and our target audiences. We must adapt our business to these trends, as well as shifting patterns of content consumption and changing behaviors and preferences of our target audiences, through the adoption and exploitation of new technologies. If we cannot successfully exploit emerging technologies or if the marketing strategies we choose misinterpret cultural or social trends and prove to be incorrect or ineffective, any of these could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects.\nA significant labor dispute in our clients\u2019 industries could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAn industry-wide strike or other job action by or affecting the Writers Guild, Screen Actors Guild or other major entertainment industry union could reduce the supply of original entertainment content, which would in turn reduce the demand for our talent and entertainment marketing services. An extensive work stoppage would affect feature film production as well as television and commercial production and could have a material adverse effect on our clients and the motion picture production industry in general. For example, on November 5, 2007, the Writers Guild declared a strike affecting the script writing for television shows and films. The strike, which lasted until February 12, 2008, significantly affected the entertainment industry which consequently, had a material adverse impact on revenue generated by public relations and entertainment marketing agencies. Contracts between entertainment industry unions and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which we refer to as AMPTP, expire from time to time. The failure to finalize and ratify a new agreement with the AMPTP or the failure to enter into new commercial contracts upon expiration of the current contracts could lead to a strike or other job action. Any such severe or prolonged work stoppage could have an adverse effect on the television and/or motion picture production industries and could severely impair our clients\u2019 prospects. Any resulting decrease in demand for our talent and entertainment marketing and other public relations services would have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and results of operations.\nClients may terminate or reduce their relationships with us on short notice.\nAs is customary in the industry, 42West, The Door and Shore Fire\u2019s agreements with their respective clients generally provide for termination by either party on relatively short notice, usually 30 days. Consequently, these clients may choose to reduce or terminate their relationships with us, on a relatively short time frame and for any reason. If a significant number of the 42West, The Door or Shore Fire clients were to reduce the volume of business they conducted with us or terminate their relationships with us completely, this could have a material adverse effect upon our business and results of operations. Viewpoint\u2019s revenue is derived on a project by project basis. Clients may decide to use other creative branding and production companies for their projects which would have an adverse effect upon our business and results of operations.\n42West\u2019s, The Door\u2019s, Shore Fire\u2019s and Viewpoint\u2019s ability to generate new business from new and existing clients may be limited.\nTo increase their revenues, 42West, The Door, Shore Fire and Viewpoint need to obtain additional clients or generate demand for additional services from existing clients. 42West, The Door, Shore Fire and Viewpoints ability to generate initial demand for its services from new clients and additional demand from existing clients is subject to such clients\u2019 and potential clients\u2019 needs, trends in the entertainment industry, financial conditions, strategic plans and internal resources of corporate clients, as well as the quality of 42West, The Door, Shore Fire and Viewpoints employees, services and reputation. To the extent 42West, The Door, Shore Fire and Viewpoint cannot generate new business from new or existing clients due to these limitations, their ability to grow their respective businesses, and our ability to increase our revenues, will be limited.\nRevenues from our Entertainment Publicity and Marketing segment are susceptible to declines as a result of unfavorable economic conditions.\nEconomic downturns often severely affect the marketing services industry. Some of our corporate clients may respond to weak economic performance by reducing their marketing budgets, which are generally discretionary in nature and easier to reduce in the short-term than other expenses related to operations. In addition, economic downturns could lead to reduced public demand for varying forms of entertainment for which we are engaged to provide public relations and media strategy and promotional services. Such reduced demand for our services could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations.\nIf our clients experience financial distress, or seek to change or delay payment terms, it could negatively affect our own financial position and results.\nWe have a large and diverse client base, and at any given time, one or more of our clients may experience financial difficulty, file for bankruptcy protection or go out of business. Unfavorable economic and financial conditions, such as the current events surrounding the COVID-19 global outbreak, could result in an increase in client financial difficulties that affect us. As an example, the temporary closure of restaurants and hotels due to the pandemic will most likely adversely affect the revenues of our subsidiary, The Door. The direct impact on us could include reduced revenues, write-offs of accounts receivable and expenditures billable to clients, and negatively impact our operating cash flow. While we currently cannot estimate what those effects will be, if they are severe, the indirect impact could include impairments of intangible assets, credit facility covenant violations and reduced liquidity.\nRisks Related to Our Content Production Business\nOur content production business requires a substantial investment of capital, and failure to access sufficient capital while awaiting delayed revenues will have a material adverse effect on our results of operation.\nThe production, acquisition and distribution of film or digital media content require significant capital. The budget for the projects we intend to produce will each require between $6 and $8 million to produce. In addition, if a distributor does not provide the funds for the distribution and marketing of our film, we will require additional capital to distribute and market the film. We estimate that distribution and marketing fees will be approximately $10,000 per theatrical screen. A significant amount of time may elapse between our expenditure of funds and the receipt of revenues from our productions. Our content production business does not have a traditional credit facility with a financial institution on which to depend for our liquidity needs, and a time lapse may require us to fund a significant portion of our capital requirements through loans and additional issuances of our common stock, securities convertible into our common stock, debt securities or a combination of such financing alternatives. There can be no assurance that any additional financing will be available to us as and when required, or on terms that will be acceptable to us. Our inability to raise capital necessary to sustain our operations while awaiting delayed revenues would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and results of operations.\nOur success is highly dependent on audience acceptance of our films and digital media productions, which is extremely difficult to predict and, therefore, inherently risky.\nWe cannot predict the economic success of any of our films because the revenue derived from the distribution of a film (which does not necessarily directly correlate with the production or distribution costs incurred) depends primarily upon its acceptance by the public, which cannot be accurately predicted. The economic success of a film also depends upon the public\u2019s acceptance of competing films, the availability of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure-time activities, general economic conditions and other tangible and intangible factors, all of which can change and cannot be predicted with certainty.\nThe economic success of a film is largely determined by our ability to produce content and develop stories and characters that appeal to a broad audience and by the effective marketing of the film. The theatrical performance of a film is a key factor in predicting revenue from post-theatrical markets. If we are unable to accurately judge audience acceptance of our film content or to have the film effectively marketed, the commercial success of the film will be in doubt, which could result in costs not being recouped or anticipated profits not being realized. Moreover, we cannot assure you that any particular feature film will generate enough revenue to offset its distribution, fulfillment services and marketing costs, in which case we would not receive any revenues for such film from our distributors.\nIn addition, changing consumer tastes affect our ability to predict which digital media productions will be popular with web audiences. As we invest in various digital projects, stars and directors, it is highly likely that at least some of the digital projects in which we invest will not appeal to our target audiences. If we are unable to produce web content that appeals to our target audiences, the costs of such digital media productions could exceed revenues generated and anticipated profits may not be realized. Our failure to realize anticipated profits could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe have in the past and may, in the future, incur significant write-offs if our feature films and other projects do not perform well enough to recoup production, marketing, distribution and other costs.\nWe are required to amortize capitalized production costs over the expected revenue streams as we recognize revenue from our films or other projects. The amount of production costs that will be amortized each quarter depends on, among other things, how much future revenue we expect to receive from each project. Unamortized production costs are evaluated for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the capitalized production costs may be below their fair value. If estimated remaining revenue is not sufficient to recover the unamortized production costs, the unamortized production costs will be written down to fair value. In any given quarter, if we lower our previous forecast with respect to total anticipated revenue from any individual feature film or other project, we may be required to accelerate amortization or record impairment charges with respect to the unamortized costs, even if we have previously recorded impairment charges for such film or other project. For example, in 2019, we recorded $0.6 million impairment of the capitalized production costs for our feature film, Max Steel. In addition, certain GAAP guidance requires us to impair costs that have been capitalized for projects that are not set for production within three years of capitalizing the cost. In 2019 and 2018, we impaired the cost of several scripts based on this guidance. Such impairment charges have had, and in the future could have, a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur content production business is substantially dependent upon the success of a limited number of film releases and digital media productions, if any, in any given year and our inability to release any film or digital media productions or the unexpected delay or commercial failure of any one of them could have a material adverse effect on our financial results and cash flows.\nOur content production business is currently substantially dependent upon the success of a limited number of film releases and digital media productions, if any, in any given year. The unexpected delay in release or commercial failure of just one of these films or digital media productions, or our inability to release any productions at all, could have a significant adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows in both the year of release and in the future. Historically, feature films that are successful in the domestic theatrical market are generally also successful in the international theatrical and ancillary markets, although each film is different and there is no way to guarantee such results. If our films fail to achieve domestic box office success, their success in the international box office and ancillary markets and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected. Further, we can make no assurances that the historical correlation between results in the domestic box office and results in the international box office and ancillary markets will continue in the future. If we are unable to release any film or digital media productions in a given year, or if the feature films we release do not perform well in the domestic or international theatrical markets and ancillary markets, or our digital media productions do not perform as anticipated, the failure to release any productions, or the failure of any one of the productions we release, could a material adverse effect on our financial results and cash flows.\nDelays, cost overruns, cancellation or abandonment of the completion or release of our web series or films may have an adverse effect on our business.\nThere are substantial financial risks relating to production, completion and release of web series and feature films. Actual costs may exceed their budgets due to factors such as labor disputes, unavailability of a star performer, equipment shortages, disputes with production teams or adverse weather conditions, any of which may cause cost overruns and delay or hamper film completion. We are typically responsible for paying all production costs in accordance with a budget and receive a fixed producer\u2019s fee for our services plus a portion of any project income. However, to the extent that delays or cost overruns result in us not completing the web series or film within budget, there may not be enough funds left to pay us our producer\u2019s fee, to generate any project income or complete the project at all. If this were to occur, it would significantly and adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.\nWe rely on third party distributors to distribute our films and their failure to perform or promote our films could negatively impact our ability to generate revenues and have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nOur films are primarily distributed and marketed by third party distributors. If any of these third-party distributors fails to perform under their respective arrangements, such failure could negatively impact the success of our films and have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation and ability to generate revenues.\nWe generally do not control the timing and manner in which our distributors distribute our films; their decisions regarding the timing of release and promotional support are important in determining success. Any decision by those distributors not to distribute or promote one of our films or to promote our competitors\u2019 films or related products to a greater extent than they promote ours could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows and operating results. Additionally, because third parties are the principal distributors of our movies, the amount of revenue that is recognized from films in any given period is dependent on the timing, accuracy and sufficiency of the information received from our distributors. As is typical in the film industry, our distributors may make adjustments in future periods to information previously provided to us that could have a material impact on our operating results in later periods. In 2018, our domestic distributor of Max Steel and Believe, Open Road Films, LLC (\u201cOpen Road\u201d) filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11. The assets of Open Road were purchased by Raven Capital Management (\u201cRaven Capital\u201d) which now has the rights to distribute the films under the same arrangements as Open Road. There is no guaranty that Raven Capital will be successful in distributing Max Steel and Believe.\nOur success depends on the services of our Chief Executive Officer.\nOur success greatly depends on the skills, experience and efforts of our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. O\u2019Dowd. We do not have an employment agreement with Mr. O\u2019Dowd. If Mr. O\u2019Dowd resigns or becomes unable to continue in his present role and is not adequately replaced, the loss of his services could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.\nThe popularity and commercial success of our digital media productions and feature films are subject to numerous factors, over which we may have limited or no control.\nThe popularity and commercial success of our digital media productions and films depends on many factors including, but not limited to, the key talent involved, the timing of release, the promotion and marketing of the digital media production or film, the quality and acceptance of other competing productions released into the marketplace at or near the same time, the availability of alternative forms of entertainment, general economic conditions, the genre and specific subject matter of the digital media production or film, its critical acclaim and the breadth, timing and format of its initial release. We cannot predict the impact of such factors on any digital media production or film, and many are factors that are beyond our control. As a result of these factors and many others, our digital media productions and films may not be as successful as we anticipate, and as a result, our results of operations may suffer.\nThe creation of content for the entertainment industry is highly competitive and we will be competing with companies with much greater resources than we have.\nThe business in which we engage is highly competitive. Our content production business operations are subject to competition from companies which, in many instances, have greater development, production and distribution and capital resources than us. We compete for the services of writers, producers, directors, actors and other artists to produce our digital media and motion picture content, as well as for advertisement dollars. Larger companies have a broader and more diverse selection of scripts than we do, which translates to a greater probability that they will be able to more closely fit the demands and interests of advertisers than we can.\nAs a small independent producer, we compete with major U.S. and international studios. Most of the major U.S. studios are part of large diversified corporate groups with a variety of other operations that can provide both the means of distributing their products and stable sources of earnings that may allow them better to offset fluctuations in the financial performance of their film and other operations. In addition, the major studios have more resources with which to compete for ideas, storylines and scripts created by third parties, as well as for actors, directors and other personnel required for production. Such competition for the industry\u2019s talent and resources may negatively affect our ability to acquire, develop, produce, advertise and distribute digital media and motion picture content.\nWe must successfully respond to rapid technological changes and alternative forms of delivery or storage to remain competitive.\nThe entertainment industry continues to undergo significant developments as advances in technologies and new methods of product delivery and storage, and certain changes in consumer behavior driven by these developments emerge. New technologies affect the demand for our content, the manner in which our content is distributed to consumers, the sources and nature of competing content offerings and the time and manner in which consumers acquire and view our content. We and our distributors must adapt our businesses to shifting patterns of content consumption and changing consumer behavior and preferences through the adoption and exploitation of new technologies. If we cannot successfully exploit these and other emerging technologies, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects.\nOur business may be affected by changes in consumer discretionary spending in the U.S. or internationally.\nOur success depends on our ability to distribute or otherwise generate income from our current and future motion pictures and digital productions. Our industry is subject to discretionary consumer spending, which is influenced by general economic conditions, consumer confidence and the availability of discretionary income. Changes in economic conditions affecting potential distributors or viewers of our motion pictures could reduce our ability to generate income from our motion pictures. Furthermore, weak economic conditions and geopolitical and economic uncertainties in international regions and countries where our movie productions are distributed could lead to lower consumer spending for our content, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have in the past and may, in the future, be adversely affected by union activity.\nWe retain the services of actors who are covered by collective bargaining agreements with Screen Actors Guild - American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, which we refer to as SAG-AFTRA, and we may also become signatories to certain guilds such as Directors Guild of America and Writers Guild of America in order to allow us to hire directors and talent for our productions. Collective bargaining agreements are industry-wide agreements, and we lack practical control over the negotiations and terms of these agreements. In addition, our digital projects fall within SAG-AFTRA\u2019s definition of \u201cnew media\u201d, which is an emerging category covered by its New Media and Interactive Media Agreements for actors. As such, our ability to retain actors is subject to uncertainties that arise from SAG-AFTRA\u2019s administration of this relatively new category of collective bargaining agreements. Such uncertainties have resulted and may continue to result in delays in production of our digital projects.\nIn addition, if negotiations to renew expiring collective bargaining agreements are not successful or become unproductive, the union could take actions such as strikes, work slowdowns or work stoppages. Strikes, work slowdowns or work stoppages or the possibility of such actions could result in delays in production of our digital projects. We could also incur higher costs from such actions, new collective bargaining agreements or the renewal of collective bargaining agreements on less favorable terms. Depending on their duration, union activity or labor disputes could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOthers may assert intellectual property infringement claims or liability claims for digital media or film content against us which may force us to incur substantial legal expenses.\nThere is a possibility that others may claim that our productions and production techniques misappropriate or infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties with respect to their previously developed web series, films, stories, characters, other entertainment or intellectual property. In addition, as distributors of digital media and film content, we may face potential liability for such claims as defamation, invasion of privacy, negligence, copyright or trademark infringement or other claims based on the nature and content of the materials distributed. If successfully asserted, our insurance may not be adequate to cover any of the foregoing claims. Irrespective of the validity or the successful assertion of such claims, we could incur significant costs and diversion of resources in defending against them, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nIf we fail to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights adequately, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur ability to compete depends, in part, upon successful protection of our intellectual property. We attempt to protect proprietary and intellectual property rights to our productions through available copyright and trademark laws and distribution arrangements with companies for limited durations. Unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our intellectual property or to obtain and use property that we regard as proprietary. We cannot assure you that our means of protecting our proprietary rights will be adequate. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as the laws of the United States. Intellectual property protections may also be unavailable, limited or difficult to enforce in some countries, which could make it easier for competitors to steal our intellectual property. Our failure to protect adequately our intellectual property and proprietary rights could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Acquisitions\nWe are subject to risks associated with acquisitions and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions.\nWe have in the past completed acquisitions, and may in the future consummate additional acquisitions and otherwise engage in discussions and activities with respect to possible acquisitions, intended to complement or expand our business, some of which may be significant transactions for us. Identifying suitable acquisition candidates can be difficult, time-consuming and costly, and we may not be able to identify suitable candidates or complete acquisitions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis or at all.\nEven if we complete an acquisition, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of such transaction. Our recent acquisitions have required, and any similar future transactions may also require, significant efforts and expenditures, including with respect to integrating the acquired business with our historical business. We may encounter unexpected difficulties, or incur unexpected costs, in connection with acquisition activities and integration efforts, including, without limitation:\n\u00b7\ndiversion of management attention from managing our historical core business;\n\u00b7\npotential disruption of our historical core business or of the acquired business;\n\u00b7\nthe strain on, and need to continue to expand, our existing operational, technical, financial and administrative infrastructure;\n\u00b7\ninability to achieve synergies as planned;\n\u00b7\nchallenges in controlling additional costs and expenses in connection with and as a result of the acquisition;\n\u00b7\ndilution to existing shareholders from the issuance of equity securities;\n\u00b7\nbecoming subject to adverse tax consequences or substantial depreciation;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in assimilating employees and corporate cultures or in integrating systems and controls;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in anticipating and responding to actions that may be taken by competitors;\n\u00b7\ndifficulties in realizing the anticipated benefits of the transaction;\n\u00b7\ninability to generate sufficient revenue from acquisitions to offset the associated acquisition costs;\n\u00b7\npotential loss of key employees, key clients or other partners of the acquired business as a result of the change of ownership; and\n\u00b7\nthe assumption of and exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the acquired businesses.\nIf any of our acquisitions do not perform as anticipated for any of the reasons noted above or otherwise, there could be a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nAny due diligence conducted by us in connection with potential future acquisition may not reveal all relevant considerations or liabilities of the target business, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe conduct such due diligence with respect to our acquisitions as we deem reasonably practicable and appropriate. The objective of the due diligence process is to identify material issues and liabilities that may affect the decision to proceed with any one particular acquisition target or the consideration payable for an acquisition. We also use information revealed during the due diligence process to formulate our business and operational planning for, and our valuation of, any target company or business. While conducting due diligence and assessing a potential acquisition, we may rely on publicly available information, if any, information provided by the relevant target company to the extent such company is willing or able to provide such information and, in some circumstances, third party investigations.\nThere can be no assurance that the due diligence undertaken with respect to an acquisition, will reveal all relevant facts that may be necessary to evaluate such acquisition including the determination of the price we may pay for an acquisition target or to formulate a business strategy. Furthermore, the information provided during due diligence may be incomplete, inadequate or inaccurate. As part of the due diligence process, we will also make subjective judgments regarding the results of operations, financial condition and prospects of a potential target. Our due diligence investigation of a particular acquisition target may not uncover all material issues and liabilities to which we may become subject. If our due diligence investigation fails to correctly identify material issues and liabilities that may be present in a target company or business, or if we consider such material risks to be commercially acceptable relative to the opportunity, and we proceed with an acquisition, we may subsequently incur substantial impairment charges or other losses.\nIn addition, following an acquisition, including those already completed, we may be subject to significant, previously undisclosed liabilities of the acquired business that were not identified during due diligence. Any such liabilities could contribute to poor operational performance, undermine any attempt to restructure the acquired company or business in line with our business plan and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nLosses incurred by us subsequent to completion of an acquisition may not be indemnifiable by the seller or may exceed the seller\u2019s indemnification obligations.\nAs discussed above, there may be liabilities assumed in any acquisition that we did not discover or that we underestimated in the course of performing our due diligence. Although a seller generally will have indemnification obligations to us under an acquisition agreement, these obligations are usually subject to financial limitations, such as general deductibles and maximum recovery amounts, as well as time limitations. We cannot assure you that our right to indemnification from any seller will be enforceable, collectible or sufficient in amount, scope or duration to fully offset the amount of any losses that we incur with respect to a particular acquisition. Any such liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe recognized a goodwill impairment charge for the year ended December 31, 2018 and may be required to recognize additional goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges in the future.\nWe acquire other companies and intangible assets and may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions, which could cause an impairment of goodwill or intangibles. We review amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. We test goodwill for impairment at least annually. Events or changes indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable include reduced future cash flow estimates, slower growth rates in industry segments in which we participate and a decline in our stock price and market capitalization. We may be required to record a significant charge in our consolidated financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined, negatively affecting our results of operations. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we recorded approximately $1.9 million in charges for the impairment of goodwill for 42West based on a reduced cash flow estimate.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock and Preferred Stock\nWe have recently issued, and may in the future issue, a significant amount of equity securities and, as a result, your ownership interest in our company has been, and may in the future be, substantially diluted and your investment in our common stock could suffer a material decline in value.\nFrom January 1, 2018 to December 31, 2019, the number of shares of our common stock issued and outstanding has increased from 10,565,789 to 17,892,900 shares. During this period, we issued approximately 1,979,904 shares of our common stock as consideration for 42West, The Door, Shore Fire and Viewpoint acquisitions. We will issue an additional 971,735 shares of our common stock to the sellers of 42West for the earn out (net of indemnifications) that was earned in 2017. On August 14, 2019 we exchanged 44,740 put rights held by one of the sellers of 42West for 385,514 shares of common stock. We will issue 26,821 shares of our common stock for the working capital adjustment to the sellers of The Door. Furthermore, we may issue up to 1,538,462 shares of our common stock to the sellers of The Door if the applicable earn out financial target is achieved in the following two years. We will issue to the Shore Fire seller the equivalent of $200,000 of our common stock at the trading stock price on each of the first and second anniversaries of the acquisition of Shore Fire. During the year ended December 31, 2019, certain holders of convertible notes exercised their right to convert all or a portion of their convertible notes and we issued 433,794 shares of common stock. As of December 31, 2019, we had outstanding convertible notes payable that as of the date of this report are still outstanding in the aggregate principal amount of $2,352,500, which are currently convertible into 3,372,612 shares of our common stock (calculated based on either a 30-trading-day average price per share, 90-trading-day average price per share as of March 6, 2020 or $0.78 per share based on the terms of the convertible notes payable). As of December 31, 2019, we had convertible notes payable in the amount of $1.1 million that were converted subsequent to year end for 1,877,811 shares of our common stock. On October 21, 2019, we issued 2,700,000 shares of our common stock in a public offering at a purchase price of $0.78 per share. As a result of these past issuances and potential future issuances, your ownership interest in the Company has been, and may in the future be, substantially diluted.\nThe market price for our common stock has been volatile, and these issuances could cause the price of our common stock to continue to fluctuate substantially. In addition, we have historically experienced significantly low trading volume. Once restricted stock issued in either private placements or to the sellers of the companies we acquired becomes freely tradable, these shareholders may decide to sell their shares of common stock and, if our stock is thinly traded, this could have a material adverse effect on its market price.\nWe currently have an effective shelf registration statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC under which we may offer from time to time any combination of common stock, warrants and units. In the near term, we will need to raise additional capital and may seek to do so by selling additional securities under the shelf registration statement, conducting one or more private placements of equity securities, securities convertible into equity securities or debt securities, or through a combination of one or more of such financing alternatives. Such issuances of additional securities would further dilute the equity interests of our existing shareholders, perhaps substantially, and may further exacerbate any or all of the above risks.\nThe Series C Convertible Preferred Stock has anti-dilution protections and super voting rights that may adversely affect our shareholders.\nFor a period of five years from March 7, 2016, the date of issuance, the Series C Convertible Preferred Stock, which are all held by Mr. O\u2019Dowd, will have certain anti-dilution protections. Upon triggers specified in the Series C Certificate of Designation, the number of shares of common stock into which any Series C Convertible Preferred Stock held by Mr. O\u2019Dowd (or any entity directly or indirectly controlled by Mr. O\u2019Dowd) can be converted will be increased, such that the total number of shares of common stock held by Mr. O\u2019Dowd (or any entity directly or indirectly controlled by Mr. O\u2019Dowd) (based on the number of shares of common stock held as of the date of issuance of such Series C Convertible Preferred Stock) will be preserved at the same percentage of shares of common stock outstanding held by such persons on such date. As a result, your ownership interests may be further diluted.\nExcept as required by law, holders of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock will only have voting rights once the independent directors of the Board determine that an optional conversion threshold (as defined in the Series C Certificate of Designation) has occurred. Upon such determination by the Board, a holder of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock (Mr. O\u2019Dowd) will be entitled to super voting rights of three votes for each share of common stock into which such holder\u2019s shares of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock could then be converted. Holders of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock will be entitled to vote together as a single class on all matters upon which common stockholders are entitled to vote. Your voting rights will be diluted as a result of these super voting rights. In addition, the anti-dilution protections may result in an increase in the number of shares of common stock into which Series C Convertible Preferred Stock held by Mr. O\u2019Dowd and certain eligible persons can be converted, which could further dilute your percentage of voting rights.\nIf we are unable to maintain compliance with Nasdaq listing requirements, our stock could be delisted, and the trading price, volume and marketability of our stock could be adversely affected.\nOur common stock and certain of our warrants are listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market. We cannot assure you, that we will be able to maintain compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s current listing standards, or that Nasdaq will not implement additional listing standards with which we will be unable to comply. On October 17, 2019, we received a deficiency notice from Nasdaq informing us that our common stock failed to comply with the $1 minimum bid price required for continued listing on Nasdaq under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) based upon the closing bid price of the Common Stock for the 30 consecutive business days prior to the date of the notice from Nasdaq. Nasdaq provides us an initial cure period of six months or until April 14, 2020 to regain compliance which requires us to have a closing bid price of our common stock that meets or exceeds $1.00 per share for a minimum of ten days prior to such date. If we are unable to regain compliance by April 14, 2020, we may be eligible for an additional 180 calendar day compliance period to demonstrate compliance with the minimum bid requirement. There is no assurance that we can regain compliance of the minimum bid requirement before April 14, 2020 or that Nasdaq will grant us an additional 180 calendar day compliance period. Failure to maintain compliance with Nasdaq listing requirements could result in the delisting of our shares from Nasdaq, which could have a material adverse effect on the trading price, volume and marketability of our common stock. Furthermore, a delisting could adversely affect our ability to issue additional securities and obtain additional financing in the future or result in a loss of confidence by investors or employees.\nAccounting for the put rights and contingent consideration could cause variability in the results we report.\nIn connection with the 42West acquisition, we granted put rights to the sellers to cause us to purchase up to an aggregate of 1,187,087 (including the shares from the earn out consideration) of their shares of common stock received as consideration for a purchase price equal to $9.22 per share during certain specified exercise periods set forth in the put agreements up until December 2020. As of the date of this report, the sellers have exercised an aggregate of 895,653 shares of common stock pursuant to the put rights. We have also purchased 120,451 shares of common stock and may purchase up to an additional 20,246 shares of common stock, at a purchase price of $9.22, from certain 42West employees with change of control provisions in their employment agreements, who received shares of our common stock at the time of the 42West acquisition and will receive additional shares in 2019 related to the earn out consideration. The sellers of The Door may also earn up to 1,538,462 shares of common stock if certain financial targets are achieved over a four-year period. The put rights are an embedded derivative within our common stock requiring certain fair value measurements at each reporting period. We record the fair value of the put right liability and the contingent consideration liability in the consolidated balance sheets and we record changes to the liability against earnings or loss in the consolidated statements of operations. The put rights and contingent consideration are inherently difficult to value. We could have substantial variability in the related periodic fair value measurements, which would affect our operating results and in turn could impact our stock price.", "PERMNO": 17140, "SIC": 8700, "TIC": "DLPN"}
