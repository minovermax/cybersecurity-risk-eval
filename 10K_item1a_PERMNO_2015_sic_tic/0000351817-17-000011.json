Risk Factors\nRisks Related to our Emergence from Chapter 11 Bankruptcy\nWe emerged from bankruptcy on April 22, 2016, which could adversely affect our business and relationships.\nIt is possible that our having filed for bankruptcy and our emergence from the Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings could adversely affect our business and relationships with customers, employees and suppliers. Due to uncertainties, many risks exist, including the following:\n\u2022\nkey suppliers could terminate their relationship or require financial assurances or enhanced performance\u037e\n\u2022\nthe ability to renew existing contracts and compete for new business may be adversely affected\u037e\n\u2022\nthe ability to attract, motivate and/or retain key executives and employees may be adversely affected\u037e\n\u2022\nemployees may be distracted from performance of their duties or more easily attracted to other employment opportunities\u037e and\n\u2022\ncompetitors may take business away from us, and our ability to attract and retain customers may be negatively impacted.\nThe occurrence of one or more of these events could have a material and adverse effect on our operations, financial condition and reputation. We cannot assure you that having been subject to bankruptcy protection will not adversely affect our operations in the future.\nOur actual financial results after emergence from bankruptcy will not be comparable to our historical financial information as a result of the implementation of the plan of reorganization and the transactions contemplated thereby and our adoption of fresh start accounting.\nIn connection with the disclosure statement we filed with the bankruptcy court, and the hearing to consider confirmation of the plan of reorganization, we prepared projected financial information to demonstrate to the bankruptcy court the feasibility of the plan of reorganization and our ability to continue operations upon our emergence from bankruptcy. Those projections were prepared solely for the purpose of the bankruptcy proceedings and have not been, and will not be, updated on an ongoing basis and should not be relied upon by investors. At the time they were prepared, the projections reflected numerous assumptions concerning our anticipated future performance and with respect to prevailing and anticipated market and economic conditions that were and remain beyond our control and that may not materialize. Projections are inherently subject to substantial and numerous uncertainties and to a wide variety of significant business, economic and competitive risks and the assumptions underlying the projections and/or valuation estimates may prove to be wrong in material respects. Actual results will likely vary significantly from those contemplated by the projections. As a result, investors should not rely on these projections.\nIn addition, upon our emergence from bankruptcy, we adopted fresh start accounting. Accordingly, our future financial conditions and results of operations will not be comparable to the financial condition or results of operations reflected in the Company\u2019s historical financial statements. The lack of comparable historical financial information may discourage investors from purchasing our common stock.\nThere is a limited trading market for our securities and the market price of our securities is subject to volatility.\nUpon our emergence from bankruptcy, our old common stock was cancelled and we issued new common stock. Our common stock is currently quoted on the OTCQX Market. The market price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to, and the level of trading that develops with our common stock may be affected by, numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include, among other things, our new capital structure as a result of the transactions contemplated by the plan of reorganization, our limited trading history subsequent to our emergence from bankruptcy, our limited trading volume, the concentration of holdings of our common stock, the lack of comparable historical financial information due to our adoption of fresh start accounting, actual or anticipated variations in our operating results and cash flow, the nature and content of our earnings releases, announcements or events that impact our products, customers, competitors or markets, business conditions in our markets and the general state of the securities markets and the market for energy-related stocks, as well as general economic and market conditions and other factors that may affect our future results, including those described in this Part II, Item 1A of this Report. No assurance can be given that an active market will develop for the common stock or as to the liquidity of the trading market for the common stock. The common stock may be traded only infrequently in transactions arranged through brokers or otherwise, and reliable market quotations may not be available. Holders of our common stock may experience difficulty in reselling, or an inability to sell, their shares. In addition, if an active trading market does not develop or is not maintained, significant sales of our common stock, or the expectation of these sales, could materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe Company entered into an agreement with certain purchasers of our common stock in a recent private placement offering to list on a national securities exchange by July 25, 2017. However, no assurances can be given regarding the Company\u2019s ability to meet this deadline.\nUpon our emergence from bankruptcy, the composition of our Board of Directors and our stockholders changed significantly.\nPursuant to the plan of reorganization, the composition of the Board and our stockholders changed significantly. The Board is now made up of six directors, none of whom served on the Board prior to emergence from bankruptcy. Our directors are also in large part nominated pursuant to a director nomination agreement among the Company and many of our large institutional stockholders that previously owned our unsecured high yield senior notes and received our common stock pursuant to the plan of reorganization. The new directors have different backgrounds, experiences and perspectives from those individuals who previously served on the Board and, thus, may have different views on the issues that will determine the future of the Company. As a result, the future strategy and plans of the Company may differ materially from those of the past.\nThere may be circumstances in which the interests of our significant stockholders could be in conflict with the interests of our other stockholders.\nFunds associated with Strategic Value Partners LLC, (\"SVP\") and DW Partners, LP (\u201cDW\u201d) currently own approximately 38.9% and 14.4%, respectively, of our outstanding common stock. SVP currently has a right to nominate two of our directors under our director nominating agreement. DW, together with other former noteholders who received our common stock pursuant to our plan of reorganization, collectively hold the current right to nominate two additional directors. Our current board is limited to seven directors under the terms of the director nomination agreement. Circumstances may arise in which these stockholders may have an interest in pursuing or preventing acquisitions, divestitures or other transactions, including the issuance of additional shares or debt, that, in their judgment, could enhance their investment in us or another company in which they invest. Such transactions might adversely affect us or other holders of our common stock. Furthermore, we have entered into a director nomination agreement with each of SVP, DW and other former holders of our senior notes that provides for certain continuing nomination rights subject to conditions on share ownership. In addition, our significant concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our common shares because investors may perceive disadvantages in owning shares in companies with significant stockholders.\nWe do not expect to pay dividends in the near future.\nWe do not anticipate that cash dividends or other distributions will be paid with respect to our common stock in the foreseeable future. In addition, restrictive covenants in certain debt instruments to which we are, or may be, a party, may limit our ability to pay dividends or for us to receive dividends from our operating companies, any of which may negatively impact the trading price of our common stock.\nA small number of institutional investors controls significant percentage of our voting power and possess negative control or veto rights with respect to certain proposed Company transactions\nA small group of institutional investors, who are parties to our director nomination agreement currently, beneficially own a percentage majority of our issued and outstanding common stock. Consequently, such investors are able to strongly influence all matters that require approval by our stockholders, including the election and removal of directors, changes to our organizational documents and approval of acquisition offers and other significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership limits our other stockholders\u2019 ability to influence corporate matters. In addition, the institutional holders that are parties to the director nomination agreement possess negative control or veto rights under the Company\u2019s Certificate of Incorporation with respect to certain transactions the Company may propose to undertake for so long as such parties collectively hold 50% or more of the Company\u2019s issued and outstanding shares of common stock. Such parties are entitled to notice of certain proposed transactions which may be vetoed if such parties who collectively hold at least 50% of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock object to such action. These transactions the veto rights of the parties to the director nomination agreement include:\n\u2022\nthe sale or other disposition of assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, in any single transaction or series of related transactions, with a fair market value in the aggregate in excess of $75 million, other than certain intercompany ordinary course transactions;\n\u2022\nany sale, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, winding up, bankruptcy event, reorganization, consolidation, or merger of the Company or any of its subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nissuing or repurchasing any shares of our common stock or other equity securities (or securities convertible into or exercisable for equity securities) in an amount that is in the aggregate in excess of $5 million, other than pursuant to employee benefit and incentive plans (including certain repurchases of capital stock to satisfy withholding or similar taxes in connection with any exercise of equity rights) and the issuance of shares of common stock upon exercise of our outstanding warrants;\n\u2022\nincurring any indebtedness for borrowed money (including through capital leases, the issuance of debt securities or the guarantee of indebtedness of another person or entity), in any single transaction or series of related transactions, that is in the aggregate in excess of $75 million other than indebtedness incurred to refinance indebtedness issued for less than $75 million, intercompany indebtedness, and certain other obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business;\n\u2022\nentering into any proposed transaction or series of related transactions involving a \u201cChange of Control\u201d of the Company (for purposes of this provision, \u201cChange of Control\u201d shall mean any transaction resulting in any person or group (as such terms are defined in Sections 13(d) and 14(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) acquiring \u201cbeneficial ownership\u201d (as defined in Rules 13d-3 and 13d-5 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) of more than 50% of the total outstanding equity interests of the Company (measured by voting power rather than number of shares);\n\u2022\nentering into or consummating any material acquisition of businesses, companies or assets (whether through sales or leases) or joint ventures, in any single transaction or series of related transactions, in the aggregate in excess of $75 million;\n\u2022\nincreasing or decreasing the size of the Board;\n\u2022\namending the Certificate of Incorporation or the Bylaws of the Company; or\n\u2022\nentering into any arrangements or transactions with affiliates of the Company.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and our bylaws may make it difficult for stockholders to change the composition of our Board and may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that some stockholders may consider beneficial.\nCertain provisions of our Certificate of Incorporation (the \u201cCharter\u201d) and our Bylaws and our existing director nomination agreement may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control if our Board determines that such changes in control are not in the best interests of the Company and our stockholders. The provisions in our Charter and Bylaws and our existing director nomination agreement include, among other things, those that:\n\u2022\nprovide for a classified board of directors\u037e\n\u2022\nauthorize our Board to issue preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms, including preferences and voting rights, of those shares without stockholder approval\u037e\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice procedures for nominating directors or presenting matters at stockholder meetings\u037e\n\u2022\nprovide SVP and certain other institutional stockholders the right to nominate up to four of our directors;\n\u2022\nlimit the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders; and\n\u2022\nprovide veto rights to certain stockholders as detailed in our Charter, including any transaction that may constitute a change of control, as defined in the Charter.\nWhile these provisions have the effect of encouraging persons seeking to acquire control of the Company to negotiate with our Board, they could enable the Board to hinder or frustrate a transaction that some, or a majority, of the stockholders may believe to be in their best interests and, in that case, may prevent or discourage attempts to remove and replace incumbent directors. These provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our Board, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. Furthermore, we have entered into a director nomination agreement with each of SVP, DW and other former holders of our senior notes that provides for certain continuing nomination rights subject to conditions on share ownership.\nThe ability to attract and retain key personnel is critical to the success of our business and may be affected by our emergence from bankruptcy.\nThe success of our business depends on key personnel. The ability to attract and retain these key personnel may be difficult in light of our emergence from bankruptcy, the uncertainties currently facing the business and changes we may make to the organizational structure to adjust to changing circumstances. We may need to enter into retention or other arrangements that could be costly to maintain. If executives, managers or other key personnel resign, retire or are terminated, or their service is otherwise interrupted, we may not be able to replace them in a timely manner and we could experience significant declines in productivity.\nRisks Related to the Business:\nOil and natural gas prices are volatile, and a substantial or extended decline in oil and natural gas prices would adversely affect our financial results and impede our growth.\nOil and natural gas prices historically have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future. For example, oil and gas prices declined severely during 2015 with continued lower prices through 2016. The WTI crude oil price per barrel for the period from October 1, 2014 to December 31, 2016 ranged from a high of $91.02 to a low of $26.19, a decrease of 66.8%, and the NYMEX natural gas price per MMBtu for the period October 1, 2014 to December 31, 2016 ranged from a high of $4.41 to a low of $1.49, a decrease of 66.2%. As of December 31, 2016, the spot market price for WTI was $53.75 while the spot market price for natural gas was $3.71. Prices for oil and natural gas fluctuate widely in response to relatively minor changes in the supply and demand for oil and natural gas, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors beyond our control, such as:\n\u2022\ndomestic and foreign supplies of oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nprice and quantity of foreign imports of oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nactions of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other state-controlled oil companies relating to oil and natural gas price and production controls;\n\u2022\nlevel of consumer product demand, including as a result of competition from alternative energy sources;\n\u2022\nlevel of global oil and natural gas exploration and production activity;\n\u2022\ndomestic and foreign governmental regulations;\n\u2022\nlevel of global oil and natural gas inventories;\n\u2022\npolitical conditions in or affecting other oil-producing and natural gas-producing countries, including the current conflicts in the Middle East and conditions in South America, Africa and Russia;\n\u2022\nweather conditions;\n\u2022\ntechnological advances affecting oil and natural gas production and consumption;\n\u2022\noverall U.S. and global economic conditions; and\n\u2022\nprice and availability of alternative fuels.\nOur financial condition, revenues, profitability and the carrying value of our properties depend upon the prevailing prices and demand for oil and natural gas. The speed and severity of the decline in oil prices during our 2015 fiscal year and the continued lower prices through 2016 has materially affected our results of operations and our estimates of our proved oil and natural gas reserves. Any sustained periods of low prices for oil and natural gas are likely to materially and adversely affect our financial position, the quantities of oil and natural gas reserves that we can economically produce, our cash flow available for capital expenditures and our ability to access funds through the capital markets, if they are available at all.\nInsufficient capital could lead to declines in our cash flow or in our oil and natural gas reserves, or a loss of properties.\nThe oil and natural gas industry is capital intensive. Our 2017 capital expenditure budget, including expenditures for leasehold acquisitions, drilling and infrastructure and fulfillment of abandonment obligations is expected to be in the range of $85.0 million and $95.0 million. Cash flow from operations is a principal source of our financing of our future capital expenditures. Insufficient cash flow from operations and inability to access capital could lead to losing leases that require us to drill new wells in order to maintain the lease. Lower liquidity and other capital constraints may make it difficult to drill those wells prior to the lease expiration dates, which could result in our losing reserves and production.\nMost of our undeveloped leasehold acreage is subject to leases that will expire over the next several years unless production is established on units containing the acreage.\nWe own leasehold interests in areas not currently held by production. Unless production in paying quantities is established or we exercise an extension option on units containing certain of these leases during their terms, the leases will expire. If our leases expire, we will lose our right to develop the related properties. We have leases on 71,158 gross acres (66,575 net acres) that could potentially expire during fiscal year 2017, representing approximately 54% of our net undeveloped acreage.\nOur drilling plans for areas not currently held by production are subject to change based upon various factors. Many of these factors are beyond our control, including drilling results, oil and natural gas prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints and regulatory approvals. On our acreage that we do not operate, we have less control over the timing of drilling; therefore there is additional risk of expirations occurring in those sections.\nIf low commodity prices continue for an extended period, our liquidity would be significantly reduced.\nWhile substantially all of our $906 million of long-term unsecured indebtedness was discharged upon confirmation of our Plan, we will continue to have substantial capital needs following our emergence from bankruptcy, including in connection with our existing secured indebtedness and the continued development of our operations. As a result, we will need additional capital in the future to fund our operations, implement our business plan and fulfill our abandonment obligations. An extended period of low commodity prices would substantially reduce our cash flows and would likely reduce liquidity to a level that would make it increasingly difficult to operate our business.\nWe have written down the carrying values on our oil and gas properties in 2014, 2015 and 2016 and could incur additional write-downs in the future.\nThe SEC accounting rules require that on a quarterly basis we review the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties for possible write-down or impairment (the \"ceiling test\"). Any capital costs in excess of the ceiling amount must be permanently written down. For the period of April 23, 2016 through December 31, 2016 (successor), period of January 1, 2016 through April 22, 2016 (predecessor), the year ended December 31, 2015 (predecessor) and year ended December 31, 2014 (predecessor), we reported non-cash write-downs on a before-tax basis of, $133.5 million, $77.7 million, $1.6 billion ($1.5 billion after-tax) and $445.4 million ($287.3 million after-tax) respectively, on our oil and gas properties. If oil and natural gas prices decline in the future we could be required to record additional non-cash write-downs of our oil and gas properties. Refer to Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements in this Form 10-K for further discussion of the ceiling test calculation.\nEstimates of proved reserves are uncertain, and revenues from production may vary significantly from expectations.\nThe quantities and values of our proved reserves included in our 2016 estimates of proved reserves are only estimates and subject to numerous uncertainties. The accuracy of any reserves estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation. These estimates depend on assumptions regarding quantities and production rates of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves, future prices for oil and natural gas, timing and amounts of development expenditures and operating expenses, all of which will vary from those assumed in our estimates. If the variances in these assumptions are significant, many of which are based upon extrinsic events we cannot control, they could significantly affect these estimates and could result in the actual amounts of oil and natural gas ultimately recovered and future net cash flows being materially different from the estimates in our reserves reports. These estimates may not accurately predict the present value of future net cash flows from our oil and natural gas reserves.\nFederal, state and local legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and additional operating restrictions or delays in the completion of oil and natural gas wells and adversely affect the Company\u2019s production.\nHydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of gas and/or oil from dense subsurface rock formations. The hydraulic fracturing process involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into targeted subsurface formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. The Company is expected to use hydraulic fracturing techniques in certain of its operations. Hydraulic fracturing typically is regulated by state oil and gas commissions or similar state agencies, but several federal agencies have asserted regulatory authority over certain aspects of the process. For example, in 2014, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) asserted regulatory authority pursuant to the Safe Drinking Water Act\u2019s (\u201cSDWA\u201d) Underground Injection Control (\u201cUIC\u201d) program over hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel and issued guidance covering such activities. The EPA also issued final federal Clean Air Act (\u201cCAA\u201d) regulations in 2012 that include New Source Performance Standards (\u201cNSPS\u201d) for completions of hydraulically fractured natural gas wells, compressors, controls, dehydrators, storage tanks, natural gas processing plants, and certain other equipment. In June 2016, the EPA published final rules establishing new emissions standards for methane and additional standards for volatile organic compounds (\u201cVOCs\u201d) from certain new, modified and reconstructed equipment and processes in the oil and natural gas source category, including production, processing, transmission and storage activities, and is formally seeking additional information from oil and natural gas exploration and production operators as necessary to eventually expand these final rules to include existing equipment and processes. In addition, in June 2016, the EPA published an effluent limit guideline final rule prohibiting the discharge of wastewater from onshore unconventional oil and natural gas extraction facilities to publicly owned wastewater treatment plants and, in 2014, published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking regarding Toxic Substances Control Act reporting of the chemical substances and mixtures used in hydraulic fracturing. Also, the federal Bureau of Land Management (\u201cBLM\u201d) published a final rule in March 2015 that established new or more stringent standards relating to hydraulic fracturing on federal and American Indian lands but, in June 2016, a Wyoming federal judge struck down this final rule, finding that the BLM lacked authority to promulgate the rule. That decision is currently being appealed by the federal government.\nThe U.S. Congress has from time to time considered legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process. In addition, certain states, including Texas, have adopted, and other states are considering adopting legal requirements that could impose new or more stringent permitting, public disclosure, or well construction requirements on hydraulic fracturing activities. States could elect to prohibit high volume hydraulic fracturing altogether, following the approach taken by the State of New York in 2015. Local governments also may seek to adopt ordinances within their jurisdictions regulating the time, place and manner of drilling activities in general or hydraulic fracturing activities in particular. If new or more stringent federal, state, or local legal restrictions relating to the hydraulic fracturing process are adopted in areas where the Company operates the Company could incur potentially significant added costs to comply with such requirements, experience delays or curtailment in the pursuit of exploration, development or production activities, and perhaps even be precluded from drilling wells.\nIn December 2016, the EPA released its final report on the potential impacts of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water resources. The final report concluded that \u201cwater cycle\u201d activities associated with hydraulic fracturing may impact drinking water resources \u201cunder some circumstances,\u201d noting that the following hydraulic fracturing water cycle activities and local- or regional-scale factors are more likely than others to result in more frequent or more severe impacts: water withdrawals for fracturing in times or areas of low water availability; surface spills during the management of fracturing fluids, chemicals or produced water; injection of fracturing fluids into wells with inadequate mechanical integrity; injection of fracturing fluids directly into groundwater resources; discharge of inadequately treated fracturing wastewater to surface waters; and disposal or storage of fracturing wastewater in unlined pits. While this EPA report did not find a direct link between hydraulic fracturing itself and contamination of groundwater resources, any future studies relating to hydraulic fracturing, depending on their degree of pursuit and any meaningful results obtained, could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing.\nOur ability to produce crude oil and natural gas economically and in commercial quantities could be impaired if we are unable to acquire adequate supplies of water for our drilling operations or are unable to dispose of or recycle the water we use economically and in an environmentally safe manner.\nOur operations include the need of water for use in oil and natural gas exploration and production activities. The Company\u2019s access to water may be limited due to reasons such as prolonged drought, private third party competition for water in localized areas, or the Company\u2019s inability to acquire or maintain water sourcing permits or other rights. In addition, some state and local governmental authorities have begun to monitor or restrict the use of water subject to their jurisdiction for hydraulic fracturing to ensure adequate local water supply. Any such decrease in the availability of water could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and financial condition and operations. Moreover, any inability by the Company to locate or contractually acquire and sustain the receipt of sufficient amounts of water could adversely impact the Company\u2019s exploration and production operations and have a corresponding adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business and financial condition.\nFederal or state legislative and regulatory initiatives related to induced seismicity could result in operating restrictions or delays that could adversely affect the Company\u2019s production of oil and natural gas.\nOperations associated with our production and development activities generate drilling muds, produced waters and other waste streams, some of which may be disposed of by means of injection into underground wells situated in non-producing subsurface formations. These disposal wells are regulated pursuant to the UIC program established under the SDWA and analogous state laws. The UIC program requires permits from the EPA or an analogous state agency for construction and operation of such disposal wells, establishes minimum standards for disposal well operations, and restricts the types and quantities of fluids that may be disposed. While these permits are issued pursuant to existing laws and regulations, these legal requirements are subject to change based on concerns of the public or governmental authorities regarding such disposal activities. One such concern relates to recent seismic events near underground disposal wells used for the disposal by injection of produced water or certain other oilfield fluids resulting from oil and natural gas activities. When caused by human activity, such events are called induced seismicity. Developing research suggests that the link between seismic activity and produced water disposal may vary by region, and that only a very small fraction of the tens of thousands of injection wells have been suspected to be, or may have been, the likely cause of induced seismicity. In March 2016, the United States Geological Survey identified six states with the most significant hazards from induced seismicity: Oklahoma, Kansas, Texas, Colorado, New Mexico, and Arkansas.\nIn response to concerns regarding induced seismicity, regulators in some states have imposed, or are considering imposing, additional requirements in the permitting of produced water disposal wells or otherwise to assess any relationship between seismicity and the use of such wells. For example, Oklahoma issued new rules for produced water disposal wells in 2014 that imposed certain permitting and operating restrictions and reporting requirements on disposal wells in proximity to faults and also, from time to time, is developing and implementing plans directing certain wells where seismic incidents have occurred to restrict or suspend disposal well operations. The Texas Railroad Commission adopted similar rules for the permitting of produced water disposal\nwells in 2014. These developments could result in additional regulation and restrictions on the use of injection wells in connection with Company activities to dispose of produced water and certain other oilfield fluids. Increased regulation and attention given to induced seismicity also could lead to greater opposition, including litigation, to oil and natural gas activities utilizing injection wells for waste disposal. Any one or more of these developments may result in the Company having to limit disposal well volumes, disposal rates or locations, or require third party disposal well operators the Company may engage to dispose of produced water generated by Company activities to shut down disposal wells, which development could adversely affect the Company\u2019s production or result in the Company incurring increased costs and delays with respect to Company operations.\nClimate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of greenhouse gases could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and gas the Company produces.\nClimate change continues to attract considerable public and scientific attention. As a result, numerous proposals have been made and are likely to continue to be made at the international, national, regional and state levels of government to monitor and limit emissions of greenhouse gases (\u201cGHGs\u201d). These efforts have included consideration of cap-and-trade programs, carbon taxes, GHG reporting and tracking programs, and regulations that directly limit GHG emissions from certain sources.\nAt the federal level, no comprehensive climate change legislation has been implemented to date. The EPA has, however, adopted regulations under the CAA that, among other things, establish certain permits and construction reviews designed to allow operations while ensuring the Prevention of Significant Deterioration of air quality by GHG emissions from large stationary sources that are already potential sources of significant, or criteria, pollutant emissions. The Company\u2019s operations could become subject to these permitting requirements and be required to install \"best available control technology\" to limit emissions of GHGs from any new or significantly modified facilities that the Company may seek to construct in the future if they would otherwise emit large volumes of GHGs as well as criteria pollutants from such sources. The EPA has also adopted rules requiring the reporting of GHG emissions on an annual basis from specified GHG emission sources in the United States, including onshore and offshore oil and gas production facilities, which may include certain Company operations. Federal agencies also have begun directly regulating emissions of methane, a GHG, from oil and natural gas operations. In June 2016, the EPA published NSPS, known as Subpart OOOOa, that require certain new, modified or reconstructed facilities in the oil and natural gas sector to reduce these methane gas and VOC emissions. These Subpart OOOOa standards will expand previously issued NSPS published by the EPA in 2012 and known as Subpart OOOO, by using certain equipment-specific emissions control practices, requiring additional controls for pneumatic controllers and pumps as well as compressors and imposing leak detection and repair requirements for natural gas compressor and booster stations. Moreover, in November 2016, the EPA issued a final Information Collection Request seeking information about methane emissions from facilities and operations in the oil and natural gas industry. The EPA has indicated that it intends to use the information from this request to develop Existing Source Performance Standards for the oil and gas industry. Once adopted, these standards would not be imposed directly on regulated entities. Instead, they would become guidelines that the states must consider in developing their own rules for regulating sources within their borders. The EPA has indicated that this information may also be used to develop standards for certain kinds of new and modified equipment and facilities not currently covered under Subpart OOOOa. Additionally, in December 2015, the United States joined the international community at the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, France that proposed an agreement requiring member countries to review and \"represent a progression\" in their intended nationally determined contributions, which set GHG emission reduction goals every five years beginning in 2020 (the \"Paris Agreement\"). The Paris Agreement was signed by the United States in April 2016 and entered into force in November 2016; however, this agreement does not create any binding obligations for nations to limit their GHG emissions, but rather includes pledges to voluntarily limit or reduce future emissions.\nThe adoption and implementation of any international, federal or state legislation or regulations that requires reporting of GHGs or otherwise restricts emissions of GHGs from the Company\u2019s equipment and operations could require the Company to incur increased operating costs, such as costs to purchase and operate emissions control systems, acquire emissions allowances or comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements, including the imposition of a carbon tax, which one or more developments could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, such new legislation or regulatory programs could also increase the cost to the consumer, and thereby reduce demand for oil and gas, which could reduce the demand for, or lower the value of, the oil and gas the Company produces. Finally, it should be noted that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods and other climatic events. If any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s operations. At this time, the Company has not developed a comprehensive plan to address the legal, economic, social, or physical impacts of climate change on the Company\u2019s operations.\nA worldwide financial downturn or negative credit market conditions may have lasting effects on our liquidity, business and financial condition that we cannot control or predict.\nGlobal economic conditions may adversely affect the financial viability of and increase the credit risk associated with our purchasers, suppliers, insurers, and commodity derivative counterparties to perform under the terms of contracts or financial arrangements we have with them. Although we have heightened our level of scrutiny of our contractual counterparties, our assessment of the risk of non-performance by various parties is subject to sudden swings in the financial and credit markets. This same crisis may adversely impact insurers and their ability to pay current and future insurance claims that we may have.\nOur future access to capital could be limited due to tightening credit markets that could affect our ability to fund our future capital projects. In addition, long-term restriction upon or freezing of the capital markets and legislation related to financial and banking reform may affect short-term or long-term liquidity.\nOur oil and natural gas exploration and production business involves high risks and we may suffer uninsured losses.\nThese risks include blowouts, explosions, adverse weather effects and pollution and other environmental damage, any of which could result in substantial losses to the Company due to injury or loss of life, damage to or destruction of wells, production facilities or other property, clean-up responsibilities, regulatory investigations and penalties and suspension of operations. Although the Company currently maintains insurance coverage that it considers reasonable and that is similar to that maintained by comparable companies in the oil and gas industry, it is not fully insured against certain of these risks, such as business interruption, either because such insurance is not available or because of the high premium costs and deductibles associated with obtaining and carrying such insurance.\nDrilling wells is speculative and capital intensive.\nDeveloping and exploring properties for oil and natural gas requires significant capital expenditures and involves a high degree of financial risk, including the risk that no commercially productive oil or natural gas reservoirs will be encountered. The budgeted costs of drilling, completing, and operating wells are often exceeded and can increase significantly when drilling costs rise. Drilling may be unsuccessful for many reasons, including title problems, weather, cost overruns, equipment shortages, and mechanical difficulties. Moreover, the successful drilling or completion of an oil or natural gas well does not ensure a profit on investment. Exploratory wells bear a much greater risk of loss than development wells.\nWe may incur substantial losses and be subject to substantial liability claims as a result of our oil and natural gas operations.\nWe are not insured against all risks. Losses and liabilities arising from uninsured and underinsured events could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Our oil and natural gas exploration and production activities are subject to all of the operating risks associated with drilling for and producing oil and natural gas, including the possibility of:\n\u2022\nhurricanes, tropical storms or other natural disasters;\n\u2022\nenvironmental hazards, such as natural gas leaks, oil spills, pipeline or tank ruptures, encountering naturally occurring radioactive materials, and unauthorized discharges of brine, well stimulation and completion fluids, toxic gases or other pollutants into the surface and subsurface environment;\n\u2022\nabnormally pressured formations;\n\u2022\nmechanical difficulties, such as stuck oil field drilling and service tools and casing collapse;\n\u2022\nfires and explosions; and\n\u2022\npersonal injuries and death.\nAny of these risks could adversely affect our ability to conduct operations or result in substantial losses. We may elect not to obtain insurance if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. If a significant accident or other event occurs and is not fully covered by insurance, it could adversely affect our financial condition.\nPollution and property contamination arising from the Company\u2019s operations and the nearby operations of other oil and gas operators could expose the Company to significant costs and liabilities.\nThe performance of the Company\u2019s operations may result in significant environmental costs and liabilities as a result of handling of petroleum hydrocarbons and wastes, because of air emissions and wastewater or other fluid discharges related to operations, and due to historical industry operations and waste disposal practices. Spills or other unauthorized releases of regulated substances by or resulting from the Company\u2019s operations, or the nearby operations of other oil and gas operators, could expose the Company to material losses, expenditures and liabilities under environmental laws and regulations. Certain of these laws may impose strict liability, which means that in some situations the Company could be exposed to liability as a result of the Company\u2019s\nconduct that was lawful at the time it occurred or the conduct of, or conditions caused by, prior operators or other third parties. Neighboring landowners and other third parties may file claims against the Company for personal injury or property damage allegedly caused by the release of pollutants into the environment. Moreover, environmental laws and regulations generally have become more stringent in recent years and are expected to continue to do so, which could result in the occurrence of delays or cancellation in the permitting or performance of new or expanded projects, or more stringent or costly well drilling, construction, completion or water management activities or waste handling, storage, transport, disposal or cleanup requirements. Any one or more of such developments could require the Company to make significant expenditures to attain and maintain compliance and may otherwise have a material adverse effect on the oil and gas exploration and production industry in general in addition to the Company\u2019s own results of operations, competitive position or financial condition. The Company may not be able to recover some or any of its costs with respect to such developments from insurance.\nGovernment regulation of the Company\u2019s activities could adversely affect the Company and its operations.\nThe oil and gas business is subject to extensive governmental regulation under which, among other things, rates of production from oil and gas wells may be regulated. Governmental regulation also may affect the market for the Company\u2019s production and operations. Costs of compliance with governmental regulation are significant, and the cost of compliance with new and emerging laws and regulations and the incurrence of associated liabilities could adversely affect the results of the Company. We cannot predict the timing or impact of new or changed laws, regulations, or permit requirements or changes in the ways that such laws, regulations, or permit requirements are enforced, interpreted or administered. For example, various governmental agencies, including the EPA and analogous state agencies, the BLM, and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission can enact or change, begin to force compliance with, or otherwise modify their enforcement, interpretation or administration of, certain regulations that could adversely affect the Company.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are subject to environmental and worker safety and health laws and regulations that may expose the Company to significant costs and liabilities and could delay the pace or restrict the scope of the Company\u2019s operations.\nThe Company\u2019s oil and gas exploration, production and development operations are subject to stringent federal, regional, state and local laws and regulations governing worker safety and health, the release or disposal of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. Numerous governmental entities, including the EPA and analogous state agencies, have the power to enforce compliance with these laws and regulations, which may require the Company to take actions resulting in costly capital and operating expenditures at its wells and properties. These laws and regulations may restrict or affect the Company\u2019s business in many ways, including applying specific health and safety criteria addressing worker protection, requiring the acquisition of a permit before drilling or other regulated activities commence, restricting the types, quantities and concentration of substances that can be released into the environment, limiting or prohibiting construction or drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands and other protected areas, and imposing substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from the Company\u2019s operations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of sanctions, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the imposition of investigative, remedial or corrective action obligations, the occurrence of delays in the permitting or development or expansion of projects, and the issuance of orders enjoining performance of some or all of the Company\u2019s operations in a particular area.\nThe trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment, and changes in environmental laws and regulations or re-interpretation of enforcement policies may result in increased costs and liabilities, delays or restrictions in the Company\u2019s operations. For example, during October 2015, the EPA issued a final rule lowering the National Ambient Air Quality Standard for ground-level ozone to 70 parts per billion for the 8-hour primary and secondary ozone standards. The EPA is required to make attainment and non-attainment designations for specific geographic locations under the revised standards by October 1, 2017, and states may implement more stringent regulations, which could apply to the Company\u2019s operations. In a second example, in May of 2015, the EPA released a final rule outlining its position on federal jurisdiction over waters of the United States under the Federal Water Pollution Control Act. This interpretation by the EPA may constitute an expansion of federal jurisdiction over waters of the United States. The rule was stayed nationwide by the U.S. Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in October 2015 as that appellate court and several other courts considered lawsuits opposing implementation of the rule. Litigation surrounding this rule is on-going. Any expansion to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act jurisdiction in areas where Company\u2019s operations are conducted could, among other things, require installation of new emission controls on some of the Company\u2019s equipment, result in longer permitting timelines, and increase the Company\u2019s capital expenditures and operating costs, which could adversely impact the Company\u2019s business. In a third example, following the filing of a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia in May 2016 by several non-governmental environmental groups against the EPA for the agency\u2019s failure to timely assess its Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (\u201cRCRA\u201d) Subtitle D criteria regulations for oil and gas wastes, EPA and the environmental groups entered into an agreement that was finalized in a consent decree issued by the District Court on December 28, 2016. Under the decree, the EPA is required to propose no later than March 15, 2019, a rulemaking for revision of certain Subtitle D criteria regulations pertaining to oil and gas wastes or sign a determination\nthat revision of the regulations is not necessary. If EPA proposes a rulemaking for revised oil and gas waste regulations, the Consent Decree requires that the EPA take final action following notice and comment rulemaking no later than July 15, 2021. A loss of the RCRA exclusion for drilling fluids, produced waters and related wastes could result in an increase in the Company\u2019s costs to manage and dispose of wastes generated from its operations, which could effect on the Company\u2019s operations and financial position. The Company may be unable to pass on increased compliance costs arising out of its activities as a result of these developments to its customers.\nLaws and regulations pertaining to threatened and endangered species or protective of environmentally sensitive areas could delay or restrict the Company\u2019s operations and cause it to incur substantial costs.\nThe Company\u2019s activities may be adversely affected by seasonal or permanent restrictions or costly mitigation measures imposed under various federal and state statutes in order to protect endangered or threatened species and their habitats, migratory birds, wetlands and natural resources. Federal statutes, as amended from time to time, that are protective of these species, birds and environmental sensitive areas include the Endangered Species Act (\u201cESA\u201d), the Migratory Bird Treaty Act (\u201cMBTA\u201d), the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, and the Oil Pollution Act of 1990. For example, to the extent that species are listed under the ESA or similar state laws, or are protected under the MBTA, live in the areas where the Company\u2019s activities are conducted, the Company\u2019s ability to conduct or expand operations and construct facilities could be limited or be forced to incur material additional costs. Moreover, the Company\u2019s activities may be delayed, restricted or precluded in protected habitat areas or during certain seasons, such as breeding and nesting seasons.\nAdditionally, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (\u201cFWS\u201d) may designate new or increased critical habitat areas that it believes are necessary for survival of threatened or endangered species, which designation could result in material restrictions to federal land use and private land use and could delay or prohibit land access or oil and natural gas development. Moreover, as a result of one or more settlements approved by the federal government, the FWS must make determinations on the listing of numerous specified species as endangered or threatened under the ESA under specific timelines. The designation of previously unidentified endangered or threatened species could indirectly cause the Company to incur additional costs, cause the Company\u2019s operations to become subject to operating restrictions or bans, and limit future development activity in affected areas. If harm to protected species or damages to wetlands, habitat or natural resources occur or may occur, government entities or, at times, private parties may act to prevent oil and natural gas exploration or development activities or seek damages for harm to species, habitat or natural resources resulting from drilling or construction or releases of oil, wastes, hazardous substances or other regulated materials, and, in some cases, may seek criminal penalties. The designation of previously unprotected species as threatened or endangered in areas where the Company conducts operations could cause the Company to incur increased costs arising from species protection measures or time delays or limitations on the Company\u2019s activities.\nEnactment of executive, legislative or regulatory proposals under consideration could negatively affect our business.\nNumerous executive, legislative and regulatory proposals affecting the oil and gas industry have been introduced, are anticipated to be introduced, or are otherwise under consideration, by the President, Congress, state legislatures and various federal and state agencies. Among these proposals are: (1) proposed legislation (none of which has passed) to repeal various tax deductions available to oil and gas producers as discussed in more detail below and (2) the Pipeline Safety, Regulatory Certainty, and Job Creation Act enacted in 2011, which increases penalties, grants new authority to impose damage prevention and incident notification requirements, and directs the PHMSA to prescribe minimum safety standards for CO2 pipelines.\nThe foregoing described proposals, including other applicable proposals, could affect our operations and the costs thereof. The trend toward stricter standards, increased oversight and regulation and more extensive permit requirements, along with any future laws and regulations, could result in increased costs or additional operating restrictions which could have an effect on the Company, its operations, the demand for oil and natural gas, or the prices at which it can be sold. However, until such legislation or regulations are enacted or adopted into law and thereafter implemented, it is not possible to gauge their impact on our future operations or our results of operations and financial condition.\nCertain U.S. federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to natural gas and oil exploration and development may be eliminated as a result of future legislation.\nIn past years, legislation has been proposed that would, if enacted into law, make significant changes to U.S. tax laws, including to certain key U.S. federal income tax provisions currently available to oil and gas companies. Such legislative changes have included, but not been limited to, (i) the repeal of the percentage depletion allowance for oil and gas properties, (ii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs, (iii) the elimination of the deduction for certain domestic production activities, and (iv) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. Congress\ncould consider, and could include, some or all of these proposals as part of tax reform legislation, to accompany lower federal income tax rates. Moreover, other more general features of tax reform legislation, including changes to cost recovery rules and to the deductibility of interest expense, may be developed that also would change the taxation of oil and gas companies. It is unclear whether these or similar changes will be enacted and, if enacted, how soon any such changes could take effect. The passage of any legislation as a result of these proposals or any similar changes in U.S. federal income tax laws could eliminate or postpone certain tax deductions that currently are available with respect to oil and gas development, or increase costs, and any such changes could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations and cash flows\nLegal proceedings could result in liability affecting our results of operations.\nMost oil and gas companies, such as us, are involved in various legal proceedings, such as title, royalty, environmental or contractual disputes, in the ordinary course of business. We defend ourselves vigorously in all such matters, if appropriate.\nBecause we maintain a portfolio of assets in the various areas in which we operate, the complexity and types of legal proceedings with which we may become involved may vary, and we could incur significant legal and support expenses in different jurisdictions. If we are not able to successfully defend ourselves, there could be a delay or even halt in our exploration, development or production activities or other business plans, resulting in a reduction in reserves, loss of production and reduced cash flows. Legal proceedings could result in a substantial liability. In addition, legal proceedings distract management and other personnel from their primary responsibilities.\nA cyber incident could result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption, and/or financial loss.\nOur business has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct day-to-day operations, including certain of our exploration, development and production activities. We depend on digital technology to estimate quantities of oil and gas reserves, process and record financial and operating data, analyze seismic and drilling information and in many other activities related to our business. Our technologies, systems and networks may become the target of cyber-attacks or information security breaches that could result in the disruption of our business operations, damage to our properties and/or injuries. For example, unauthorized access to our seismic data, reserves information or other proprietary information could lead to data corruption, communication interruption, or other operational disruptions in our drilling or production operations.\nTo date we are not aware of any material losses relating to cyber-attacks, however there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future. As cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any cyber vulnerabilities.", "PERMNO": 66739, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "SBOW"}
