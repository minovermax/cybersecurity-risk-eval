{"cik": "1392972", "company": "PROS Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-12", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nWe operate in a dynamic environment that involves numerous risks and uncertainties. The following section describes some of the risks that may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, and the trading price of our common stock; these risks are categories and not listed in terms of their importance or level of risk.\nStrategic, Commercial and Operational Risks\nWe must successfully navigate the demand, supply and operational challenges associated with the ongoing coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, and the duration and extent to which this will impact our future results of operations and overall financial performance remains uncertain.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted, and we expect will continue to adversely impact, many aspects of our business. Governmental authorities have implemented or reinstated numerous severe measures in an attempt to contain the spread of COVID-19, including travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, physical distancing, shelter-in-place orders, and business limitations and shutdowns. Compliance with these measures by us and by our prospects, customers, suppliers and other counterparties has impacted our business, and this impact could last for an indefinite period of time. The economic impact of COVID-19 has adversely impacted a number of our prospects and customers, who have experienced, and may continue to experience, downturns or uncertainty in their own businesses. In particular, our travel industry customers experienced unprecedented declines in demand globally in 2020, which may remain suppressed for some time. To address these financial difficulties, some prospects and customers decreased, and may continue to decrease, spending on technology initiatives, stalled or halted implementation projects, and in limited cases filed for bankruptcy protection. As a result, we may be unable to collect receivables from or renew subscription agreements with those customers significantly impacted by COVID-19. In addition, certain customers have requested, and we expect will continue to request, concessions from existing contracts, and the extent and impact of future requests is uncertain. If a significant number of our customers are unable to make their contractually obligated payments to us, file for bankruptcy protection, or elect to renew their current contracts with us at lower usage levels, this would have an adverse impact on our subscription revenue, business and financial condition. COVID-19 may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described herein, including risks associated with our customers and supply chain.\nAs compared to our expectations prior to COVID-19, the economic impact of COVID-19 adversely impacted our revenue, customer bookings, bad debt expense and operating cash flow during the year ended December 31, 2020. We expect that customer bookings and the related revenue and cash flows will continue to be lower than anticipated during the pandemic, particularly new demand for our airline solutions. In response, we have postponed or canceled, and may continue to postpone or cancel, planned investments in our business, which may impact our product development and rate of innovation, either of which could seriously harm our business. The impact of COVID-19 will likely continue even after the pandemic is contained. For example, airline travel demand may remain suppressed and recovery may not follow a linear path. As there are no comparable recent events that provide guidance as to the effect, extent or duration of the current pandemic, or the resultant personal, economic and governmental reactions, we are unable to forecast the impact of COVID-19 on our bookings, revenue, results from operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows, and may have to take additional actions in the future that could further harm our business and financial performance. Although we expect that current cash and cash equivalent balances and cash flows that are generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs and other capital and liquidity requirements for at least the next 12 months, if our access to capital is restricted or our borrowing costs increase, our operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted.\nTo support the health and well-being of our employees and communities, we implemented and expect to continue a work-from-home policy for substantially all our employees and materially limited business travel, and we may take further actions that alter our operations as required by governmental authorities, or which we determine are in our best interests. While almost all of our operations have been performed remotely since March 2020, and we have not experienced any material interruptions to our operations to date, there is no guarantee that we will continue to be as effective while working remotely. The disruptions caused by COVID-19, including the limitations on meeting in-person with existing and potential customers and amongst our teams because our team is dispersed, may result in inefficiencies, delays and additional costs in our product development, sales, marketing, product implementations and customer service efforts that we cannot fully mitigate through remote work arrangements. Many employees have additional personal needs to attend to such as looking after children as a result of school closures or adjusted school calendars or family who become sick, and employees may continue to become sick themselves and be unable to work. To date, employee illnesses have not materially impacted our operations. However, if one or more of our senior leaders were unable to carry our their duties due to COVID-19, it could have a significant adverse impact on our operations. Similarly, our business practice modifications in response to the pandemic could present challenges to maintaining our corporate culture, including employee engagement, development and productivity. Where local regulations permit, we have provided limited access to our offices for our employees, and when appropriate, we anticipate that we will fully\nreopen our offices. Planning for the reopening of our offices has required and will likely continue to require non-trivial investments to manage additional risks and operational challenges, including in the design, implementation and enforcement of new workplace safety protocols. These efforts may divert management attention, and the protocols may create logistical challenges for our employees which could adversely impact employee productivity and morale. Even if we follow what we believe to be best practices, our measures may not prevent the transmission of COVID-19. Any incidents of actual or perceived transmission may expose us to liability from employee claims, adversely impact employee productivity and morale, and result in negative publicity and reputational harm.\nThe impacts of COVID-19 on our business continue to be uncertain, evolving, dynamic and dependent on numerous unpredictable factors outside of our control, including:\n\u2022the spread, duration and severity of COVID-19 and the mutations or variations thereof as a public health matter and its impact on governments, businesses and society generally and our clients, partners and our business;\n\u2022the duration, impact and effectiveness of measures taken by governments, businesses and society in response to COVID-19, including the effectiveness of vaccines, the rate at which vaccines are administered, and the effectiveness of fiscal and monetary stimulus programs and other legislative and regulatory measures;\n\u2022the impact of COVID-19 on overall long-term demand for air travel, including the impact on demand for business travel as a result of increased usage of videoconferencing and other technologies;\n\u2022the impact of COVID-19 on the financial health and operations of our current and prospective customers and partners, including the increase in business failures among our customers and other businesses;\n\u2022the pace and extent to which our customers and other businesses reduce their personnel;\n\u2022the possibility of failure of our operating facilities, computer systems or communication systems;\n\u2022the willingness of current and prospective clients to invest in our products and services; and\n\u2022the satisfaction of current and prospective customers with product and service remote delivery and support.\nIf we are not able to respond to and manage the impact of such events effectively, our results of operations, financial performance, and overall business will be harmed. We continue to evaluate the nature and extent of the impact of COVID-19 to our business.\nIf our security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to a customer\u2019s data, our data or our IT systems, our solutions may be perceived as not being secure, customers may limit or stop using our solutions and we may incur significant legal and financial exposure and liabilities.\nOur solutions involve the storage, and to a more limited extent, the transmission of our customers\u2019 proprietary information, including personal and other sensitive data. We have incurred, and expect to continue to incur significant costs to maintain security measures designed to prevent, eliminate or alleviate known security vulnerabilities, data theft, data corruption, computer viruses, malicious software programs, attacks by third parties or similar disruptive problems (each a \"Security Incident\"), and obtain third-party security attestations regarding those security measures. Despite the implementation of these security measures and third-party security attestations, if these measures are breached as a result of third-party action, employee error or misconduct or otherwise, we could experience a Security Incident that could result in someone obtaining unauthorized access to our IT systems, customers\u2019 data or our data, including our intellectual property and other confidential business information. Because the techniques used to compromise systems change frequently, may exploit vulnerabilities, and may not be recognized until launched, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures. We cannot predict the extent, frequency or impact of these problems on us. Any Security Incident could result in interruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers, as well as loss of confidence in the security of our solutions and services, damage to our reputation, negative impact to our future sales, disruption of our business, increases to our information security costs, and could lead to indemnity obligations, legal liability and other costs. In the normal course of our business, we experience Security Incidents and have increased risk given our all remote workforce due to COVID-19. To date, however, the identified Security Incidents have neither been material or significant to us, including to our business operations, nor had a material financial impact. There can be no assurance that future Security Incidents will not be material or significant.\nFailure to increase business from our customers and sustain our historical renewal rates and pricing could adversely affect our future revenue and operating results.\nMany of our existing customers initially purchase our software solutions for a specific business segment or geographic location within their organization, and over time we partner with them to add business segments and geographic locations within their organization. These customers might not choose to make additional purchases of our software solutions or to expand their existing software solutions to other business segments. In addition, as we deploy new applications and features for our software solutions or introduce new software solutions, our current customers may not purchase these new offerings. If we fail to generate additional business from our existing customers, our revenue could grow at a slower rate or even decrease.\nOur subscription agreements are typically for an initial term of three years, and our legacy maintenance and support agreements are typically renewed for annual terms. Our customers have no obligation to renew their software subscriptions after the expiration of their initial term, and some customers elect not to renew. Subscription revenue represented the majority of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2020. Maintenance and support revenue from our legacy on-premises software products continues to decline as a percentage of total revenue, representing approximately 18%, 23% and 33% of our total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nWe may not accurately predict future customer renewal rates, which can decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including customers\u2019 level of satisfaction with our services, our ability to continue to regularly add functionality, the reliability (including uptime) of our subscription services, the prices of our services, the actual or perceived information security of our systems and services, mergers and acquisitions of our customers, reductions in our customers\u2019 spending levels, or declines in customer activity as a result of economic downturns or uncertainty in financial markets. COVID-19 has had a negative impact on our revenue retention, particularly for our travel industry customers. If our customers choose not to renew their subscription, maintenance and support agreements with us on favorable terms or at all, our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.\nIf we fail to manage our growth effectively, we may be unable to execute our business plan, maintain high levels of service and operational controls or adequately address competitive challenges.\nOver the past several years, we have experienced substantial growth in our customers, headcount and operations. Despite the challenges posed by COVID-19, we expect to continue to expand our customer base, headcount and operations over time. This growth has placed, and future growth will place, a significant strain on our management, general and administrative resources and operational infrastructure. Our success will depend in part on our ability to effectively manage this growth and scale our operations. To manage this growth, we have and will continue to need to improve our operational, financial, management controls, reporting systems and procedures. As we continue to grow, we also need to ensure that our policies and procedures evolve to reflect our current operations and are appropriately communicated to and observed by employees, and that we continue to appropriately manage our assets. Failure to effectively manage growth could adversely impact our business performance and operating results.\nWe depend on third-party data centers, software, data and other unrelated service providers and any disruption from such third-party providers could impair the delivery of our service and negatively affect our business.\nOur cloud products are dependent upon third-party hardware, software and cloud hosting vendors, including Microsoft Azure, IBM Softlayer and Amazon Web Services, all of which must inter-operate for end users to achieve their computing goals. We utilize third-party data center hosting facilities, cloud platform providers, and other service providers to host and deliver our subscription services as well as for our own business operations. We host our cloud products from data centers in a variety of countries, including the United States, the Netherlands, Ireland, Germany, United Arab Emirates, Australia and other countries. While we control and generally have exclusive access to our servers and all of the components of our network that are located in our external data centers, we do not control the operation of these facilities and they are vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunications failures and similar events. They may also be subject to Security Incidents, break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism and similar misconduct. Despite our failover capabilities, standard protocols and other precautions, the occurrence of a natural disaster or an act of terrorism, a decision to close the facilities without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems at these facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our service. In addition, these providers have no obligation to renew their agreements with us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we are unable to renew these agreements on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or if one of our data center operators is acquired, we may be required to transfer our servers and other infrastructure to new data center facilities, and we may incur significant costs and possible service interruption in connection with doing so.\nCertain of our applications are essential to our customers\u2019 ability to quote, price, and/or sell their products and services. Interruption in our service may affect the availability, accuracy or timeliness of quotes, pricing or other information and could require us to issue service credits to our customers, damage our reputation, cause our customers to terminate their use of our solutions, require us to indemnify our customers against certain losses, and prevent us from gaining additional business from current or future customers. In addition, certain of our applications require access to our customer\u2019s data which may be held by third parties, some of whom are, or may become, our competitors. For example, many of our travel industry products rely upon access to airline data held by large airline IT providers which compete against certain of our airline products. Certain of these competitors have in the past, and may again in the future, make it difficult for our airline customers to access their data in a timely and/or cost-effective manner.\nAny disruption from our third-party data center, software, data or other service providers could impair the delivery of our service and negatively affect our business, damage our reputation, negatively impact our future sales and lead to legal liability and other costs.\nImplementation projects involve risks which can negatively impact the effectiveness of our software, resulting in harm to our reputation, business and financial performance.\nThe implementation of certain of our software solutions involve complex, large-scale projects that require substantial support operations, significant resources and reliance on factors beyond our control. For example, the success of certain of our implementation projects is dependent upon the quality of data used by our software solutions and the commitment of customers\u2019 resources and personnel to the projects. We may not be able to correct or compensate for weaknesses or problems in data, or any lack of our customers\u2019 commitment and investment in personnel and resources. Further, various factors, including our customers\u2019 business, integration, migration and security requirements, or errors by us, our partners, or our customers, may cause implementations to be delayed, inefficient or otherwise unsuccessful. For example, changes in customer requirements, delays, or deviations from our recommended best practices have and continue to occur during implementation projects. As a result, we may incur significant costs in connection with the implementation of our products. If we are unable to successfully manage the implementation of our software solutions, and as a result those products or implementations do not meet customer needs, expectations or timeline, we may become involved in disputes with our customers, may be unable to sell additional products or secure a renewal of the customer\u2019s subscription, and our business reputation and financial performance may be significantly harmed. If an implementation project for a large customer or a number of customers is substantially delayed or canceled, our ability to recognize the associated revenue and our operating results could be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to manage our cloud operations, we may be subject to liabilities and our reputation and operating results may be adversely affected.\nWe have experienced substantial growth in the number of customers and data volumes serviced by our cloud infrastructure in recent years. While we have designed our cloud infrastructure to meet the current and anticipated future performance and accessibility needs of our customers, we must manage our cloud operations in order to handle changes in hardware and software parameters, spikes in customer usage and new versions of our software. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, system disruptions, outages and other cloud infrastructure performance problems. These problems may be caused by a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors, viruses, security attacks (internal or external), fraud, spikes in customer usage, denial of service issues and other Security Incidents. In some instances, we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these performance problems within an acceptable period of time. Our customer agreements typically provide service level commitments on a monthly basis and for certain of our products we also offer response time commitments. If we are unable to meet the stated service level or response time commitments, or if we suffer extended periods of unavailability for our solutions, we may be contractually obligated to issue service credits or refunds to customers for prepaid and unused subscription services, or customers may choose to terminate or not renew contracts. Any extended service outages or other performance problems could also result in damage to our reputation or our customers\u2019 businesses, cause our customers to elect not to renew or to delay or withhold payment to us, loss of future sales, lead to customers making other claims against us that could harm our subscription revenues, result in an increase in our provision for doubtful accounts, increase collection cycles for our accounts receivable or lead to the expense and risk of litigation.\nIf we fail to protect our intellectual property adequately, our business may be harmed.\nOur success and ability to compete depends in part on our ability to protect our intellectual property. We rely upon a combination of trade secrets, confidentiality policies, nondisclosure and other contractual arrangements, and patent, copyright and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights. We cannot, however, be certain that steps we take to protect our intellectual property are adequate.\nWe may be required to spend significant resources to protect our intellectual property rights. Litigation brought to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights could be costly, time-consuming, and distracting to management and could result in the impairment or loss of portions of our intellectual property. Furthermore, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights may be met with defenses, counterclaims, and countersuits attacking the validity and enforceability of our intellectual property rights. The procurement and enforcement of certain intellectual property rights involves complex legal and factual considerations, and the associated legal standards are not always applied predictably or uniformly, can change, and may not provide adequate remedies. As a result, we may not be able to obtain or adequately enforce our intellectual property rights, and other companies may be better able to develop products that compete with ours. Our failure to secure, protect, and enforce our intellectual property rights could adversely affect our brand, competitive business position, business prospects, operating results and financial condition.\nOur use of third-party software creates dependencies outside of our control.\nWe use third-party software in our software solutions. If our relations with any of these third parties are impaired, or if we are unable to obtain or develop a replacement for the software, our business could be harmed. The operation of our solutions could be impaired if errors occur in the third-party software that we utilize. It may be more difficult for us to correct any defects in third-party software because the software is not within our control. Accordingly, our business could be adversely affected in the event of any errors in this software. There can be no assurance that these third parties continue to invest the appropriate levels of resources in their products and services to maintain and enhance the capabilities of their software.\nWe may enter into acquisitions that may be difficult to integrate, fail to achieve our strategic objectives, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value or divert management attention.\nWe have completed four acquisitions since 2013, and we plan to continue to acquire other businesses, technologies and products that we intend to complement or enhance our existing business, solutions, services and technologies. We cannot provide assurance that the acquisitions we have made or may make in the future will provide us with the benefits or achieve the results we anticipated when entering into the transaction(s). Acquisitions are typically accompanied by a number of risks, including:\n\u2022difficulties in integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired companies;\n\u2022difficulties in maintaining acceptable standards, controls, procedures and policies, including integrating financial reporting and operating systems, particularly with respect to foreign and/or public subsidiaries;\n\u2022disruption of ongoing business and distraction of management;\n\u2022inability to maintain relationships with customers of the acquired business;\n\u2022impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of any integration of new management and other personnel;\n\u2022difficulties in incorporating acquired technology and rights into our solutions and services;\n\u2022unexpected expenses resulting from the acquisition; and\n\u2022potential unknown liabilities associated with the acquisition.\nIn addition, we may incur debt, acquisition-related costs and expenses, restructuring charges and write-offs as a result of acquisitions. Acquisitions may also result in goodwill and other intangible assets that are subject to impairment tests, which could result in future impairment charges. In addition, we have in the past, and may in the future, enter into negotiations for acquisitions that are not ultimately consummated. Those negotiations could result in diversion of management time and significant out-of-pocket costs. If we fail to evaluate and execute acquisitions successfully, we may not be able to achieve our anticipated level of growth and our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nCatastrophic events may disrupt our operations.\nOur headquarters are located in Houston, Texas, and we conduct business in other domestic and international locations. We also rely on our network and third-party infrastructure and enterprise applications for our sales, marketing, development, services, operational support and hosted services. A disruption, infiltration or failure of these systems or third-\nparty hosted services in the event of a major hurricane, earthquake, fire, flood or other weather event, power loss, telecommunications failure, software or hardware malfunctions, pandemics (including the COVID-19 pandemic), cyber-attack, war, terrorist attack or other catastrophic event that our business continuity and disaster recovery plans do not adequately address, could cause system interruptions, reputational harm, loss of intellectual property, delays in our product development, lengthy interruptions in our services, breaches of data security and loss of critical data. Any of these events could prevent us from fulfilling our customer obligations or could negatively impact a country or region in which we sell our products, which could in turn decrease that country\u2019s or region\u2019s demand for our products. Even though we carry business interruption insurance and typically have provisions in our contracts that protect us in certain events, we might suffer losses from business interruptions that exceed the coverage under our insurance policies or for which we do not have coverage. Any natural disaster or other catastrophic event could create a negative perception in the marketplace, delay our product innovations, or lead to lengthy interruptions in our services, breaches of data security, and losses of critical data, all of which could have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nWe are a multinational corporation exposed to risks inherent in international operations.\nThe majority of our revenues are derived from our customers outside the U.S. To date, the majority of our sales have been denominated in U.S. dollars, although the majority of our expenses that we incur in our international operations are denominated in local currencies. To date, we have not used risk management techniques or \"hedged\" the risks associated with fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Consequently, our results of operations and financial condition, including our revenue and operating margins, can be subject to losses from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, as well as regulatory, political, social and economic developments or instability in the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate. For additional financial information about geographic areas, see Note 19 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOur operations outside the U.S. are subject to risks inherent in doing business internationally, requiring resources and management attention, and may subject us to new or larger levels of regulatory, economic, foreign currency exchange, tax and political risks. We have customers in over 60 countries internationally, which we service through our operations in the U.S., Australia, Bulgaria, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, United Arab Emirates and United Kingdom. We expect our international operations to continue to grow. Among the risks we believe are most likely to affect us with respect to our international operations are:\n\u2022economic conditions in various parts of the world;\n\u2022sustained disruption to international travel from the COVID-19 pandemic and variations or mutations thereof as well as any other outbreaks of contagious diseases;\n\u2022differing labor and employment regulations, especially where labor laws are generally more advantageous to employees as compared to the U.S.;\n\u2022the difficulty of managing and staffing our international operations and the increased travel, infrastructure and legal compliance costs associated with multiple international locations;\n\u2022unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, including changes in laws governing the flow of data across international borders;\n\u2022less favorable intellectual property laws;\n\u2022new and different sources of competition;\n\u2022compliance with multiple, conflicting, ambiguous or evolving governmental laws and regulations, including privacy, anti-corruption, import/export, antitrust, and industry-specific laws and regulations and our ability to identify and respond timely to compliance issues when they occur;\n\u2022vetting and monitoring our third-party business partners in new and evolving markets to confirm they maintain standards consistent with our brand and reputation;\n\u2022multiple, conflicting and changing tax laws and regulations that may affect both our international and domestic tax liabilities and result in increased complexity and costs;\n\u2022availability of sufficient network connectivity required for certain of our products;\n\u2022difficulties in enforcing contracts and collecting accounts receivable, especially in developing countries; and\n\u2022tariffs and trade barriers, data sovereignty, import and export controls and other regulatory or contractual limitations on our ability to sell or develop our solutions in certain foreign markets.\nIf we continue to expand our business globally, our success will depend, in large part, on our ability to anticipate and effectively manage these and other risks associated with our international operations. Our failure to manage any of these risks successfully could harm our international operations and reduce our international sales, adversely affecting our business, operating results and financial condition.\nMarket and Competition Risks\nAny downturn in sales to our target markets could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur success is highly dependent upon our ability to sell our software solutions to customers in our target industries, including automotive and industrial manufacturing, transportation and logistics, chemicals and energy, food and beverage, healthcare, high tech and travel. If we are unable to sell our software solutions effectively to customers in these industries, we may not be able to grow our business. For example, COVID-19 has had a dramatic adverse impact on the travel industry and the timing and pace of recovery is unpredictable as further described above.\nWe have historically been subject to lengthy sales cycles, and delays or failures to complete sales may harm our business and cause our revenue and operating income to decline in the future.\nWhile our sales cycle times have continued to improve relative to our historical averages since we shifted to a cloud strategy in 2015, our sales cycles may take a month to over a year for large enterprise customers. A large enterprise customer\u2019s decision to use our solutions typically involves a number of internal approvals, and sales to those prospective customers generally require us to provide greater levels of education about the benefits of our solutions. We expend substantial resources during our sales cycles with no assurance that a sale may ultimately result. The length of each individual sales cycle depends on many factors, a number of which we cannot control, including the prospective customer's internal evaluation and approval process requirements, as well as the prospective customer's budget and/or resource constraints. Any unexpected lengthening of the sales cycle or failure to secure anticipated orders could negatively affect our revenue. Any significant failure to generate sales after incurring costs related to our sales process could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to develop or acquire new functionality and software solutions, we may not be able to grow our business and it could be harmed.\nBecause the markets in which we compete are characterized by rapid technological developments, newly emerging and changing customer requirements, and frequent solution introductions, updates and functional enhancements, we spend substantial amounts of time and money to enhance our existing software solutions and research and develop new solutions. We must introduce enhancements to our existing software solutions and bring new solutions to the market to meet our business plan, maintain or improve our competitive position, keep pace with technological developments, satisfy increasing customer requirements and increase awareness for our software. New functionality and solutions we develop may not be introduced timely and may not achieve market acceptance sufficient to generate material revenue. Furthermore, our competitors could be heavily investing in research and development and may develop and market new solutions that may compete with, and may reduce the demand for, our software solutions. We may not be successful in developing or acquiring, marketing and selling new functionality or solutions, or delivering updates and upgrades that meet changing industry standards and customer demands. In addition, we may experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development, marketing and selling of such functionality or solutions. If we are unable to develop or acquire new functionality, enhance our existing software solutions, develop and market new solutions or adapt to changing industry requirements to meet market demand, we may not be able to grow our business and our revenue and operating results would be adversely affected. Furthermore, because our software solutions are intended to interoperate with a variety of third-party enterprise software solutions, we must continue to modify and enhance our software to keep pace with changes in such solutions. Any inability of our software to operate effectively with third-party software necessary to provide effective solutions to our customers, could reduce the demand for our software solutions, result in customer dissatisfaction and limit our revenue.\nThe markets in which we participate are intensely competitive, and if we do not compete effectively, our operating results could be harmed.\nThe markets for enterprise software applications for selling improvement (including configure-price-quote solutions and pricing), airline revenue optimization (including revenue management solutions), and airline eCommerce (including shopping, merchandising and retail solutions) are competitive, fragmented and rapidly evolving. We expect additional competition from other established and emerging companies as the markets in which we compete continue to develop and expand, as well as through industry consolidation, including through a merger or partnership of two or more of our competitors or the acquisition of a competitor by a larger company. Some of our current and potential competitors may have larger installed bases of users, longer operating histories, broader distribution, greater name recognition, and have significantly greater resources than we have. As a result, these companies may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer demands, and devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products.\nCompetition could seriously impede our ability to sell our software solutions and services on terms favorable to us. Our current and potential competitors may develop and market new technologies that render our existing or future solutions obsolete, unmarketable or less competitive. In addition, if these competitors develop solutions with similar or superior functionality to our solutions, or if they offer solutions with similar functionality at a substantially lower prices than our solutions, we may need to decrease the prices for our solutions in order to remain competitive. If we are unable to maintain our current pricing due to competitive pressures, our margins could be reduced and our operating results could be adversely affected. If we do not compete successfully against current or future competitors, competitive pressures could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe focus primarily on selling improvement, pricing, revenue management and airline eCommerce software, and if the markets for this software develop more slowly than we expect, our business could be harmed.\nWe derive most of our revenue from providing our software solutions for selling improvement (including our configure-price-quote solutions), pricing, airline revenue optimization (including our revenue management solutions), and airline eCommerce (including our shopping, merchandising and retail solutions), as well as providing implementation services and ongoing customer support. The selling improvement, pricing, revenue management and airline eCommerce markets are evolving rapidly, and it is uncertain whether software for these markets will achieve and sustain high levels of demand. Our success depends on the willingness of businesses in our target markets to use selling improvement, pricing, revenue management and airline eCommerce software. Some businesses may be reluctant or unwilling to implement such software for a number of reasons, including failure to understand the potential returns of improving their processes and lack of knowledge about the potential benefits that such software may provide. Some businesses may elect to improve their sales and pricing processes through solutions obtained from their existing enterprise software providers, whose solutions are designed principally to address functional areas other than what our solutions provide. If businesses do not embrace the benefits of selling improvement, pricing, revenue management and airline eCommerce software, the market for such software may not continue to develop or may develop more slowly than we expect, either of which would significantly and adversely affect our revenue and operating results.\nHuman Capital Risks\nIf we cannot maintain our corporate culture, we could lose the innovation, teamwork and passion that we believe contribute to our success, and our business may be harmed.\nWe invest substantial time and resources in building and maintaining our culture and developing our personnel; however, as we continue to scale our business both organically and through potential acquisitions, it may be increasingly difficult to maintain our culture. As stated above, since March 2020 our workforce has been primarily working virtually from home during the COVID-19 pandemic, and we plan to evolve to a more flexible, virtual first workforce over time post-pandemic. While we have implemented many wellness, development and supportive programs for our workforce, the dramatic shift in workplace and workstyle increases the risk to our culture. Any failure to preserve our culture could negatively affect our future success, including our ability to retain and recruit personnel and to effectively pursue our strategic objectives.\nWe may lose key members of our management team or sales, development or operations personnel, and may be unable to attract and retain employees we need to support our operations and growth.\nOur future success depends upon the performance and service of our executive officers and other key personnel. From time to time, there may be changes in our executive management team resulting from the hiring or departure of executives. For example, Mr. Rechan joined as our Chief Operating Officer in 2020, and two of our previous executive officers retired in the past twelve months. Changes in our executive management team may be disruptive to our business. Our future success depends on our ability to continue to timely identify, attract and retain highly qualified personnel and effectively plan for succession for key roles, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so. We have continued to add a significant number of new personnel to support our continued growth, and their ability to learn our business and manage it effectively is important to our continued growth and expansion. In addition, given the highly sophisticated artificial intelligence included in our solutions, the pool of data scientists and software developers qualified to work on our solutions is limited. The implementation of certain of our software solutions requires highly-qualified personnel, and hiring and retaining such personnel to support our growth may be challenging. Competition for qualified personnel is intense, and we compete for these individuals with other companies that may have greater resources than we do. If our key personnel are unable to effectively manage our business, or if we fail to identify, attract and retain additional qualified personnel, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nFailure to adequately expand and train our direct and indirect sales force may impede our growth.\nTo date, substantially all of our revenue has been attributable to the efforts of our direct sales force. We believe that our future growth will depend, to a significant extent, on the continued development of our direct sales force, and our sales team's ability to manage and retain our existing customer base, expand our sales to existing customers and obtain new customers. Our ability to achieve significant revenue growth in the future will depend, in large part, on our success in recruiting, training and retaining a sufficient number of direct sales personnel. New hires require significant training and may take a number of months before becoming fully productive, if at all. If we are unable to develop sufficient numbers of productive direct sales personnel, our growth may be impeded.\nIn addition to our direct sales force, we have developed, and expect to expand, our indirect sales force via channel partners, such as management consulting firms, systems integrators and other resellers, to market, sell and/or implement our solutions. We anticipate that channel partners will become an increasingly important driver of our sales growth, particularly as more channel partners become resellers of our solutions. We expect to invest significant resources to identify, establish, train and retain successful strategic resell partner relationships. If we are unable to establish and maintain our partner relationships, or otherwise develop and expand our indirect distribution channel, our sales growth rates may be limited.\nRegulatory, Compliance and Litigation Risks\nEvolving data privacy, cyber security and data localization laws impact our business and expose us to increased liability.\nPersonal privacy, data localization and data security have become significant issues in the United States, Europe, and in many other jurisdictions. We provide our cloud software solutions globally, including in countries that have, or may adopt in the future, stringent data privacy, cyber security or data localization laws. For example, the EU\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) imposes substantial requirements regarding the handling of personal data and provides for robust regulatory enforcement and sanctions for non-compliance. As another example, the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d) provides data privacy rights for consumers which creates new and uncertain operational requirements for our business.\nPrivacy, data localization and data security laws may be subject to interpretation, may be applied differently across jurisdictions resulting in inconsistent or conflicting requirements, and are likely to continue to evolve in the future. For example, in July 2020 the Court of Justice of the European Union (\"CJEU\") invalidated the U.S./EU Privacy Shield framework that allowed participating companies to transfer personal data from EU member states to the U.S. While we instead rely on Standard Contractual Clauses for such transfers, the CJEU ruling made clear that these transfer mechanisms will be subject to additional scrutiny. Although we have implemented measures designed to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to our business, our ongoing efforts to comply with the GDPR, the CCPA and other changes in laws and regulations entail substantial expenses and may divert resources from other initiatives. These changes have in the past increased, and may continue to increase, our cost of providing our products and services, could limit us from offering certain solutions in certain jurisdictions, could adversely affect our sales cycles, and could impact our new technology innovation. In addition, our cloud software solutions store data on behalf of our customers, and if our customers fail to comply with contractual obligations or applicable laws and regulations, such non-compliance could result in litigation or reputational harm to us. Any perceived\ninability to adequately address privacy, data localization or cyber security compliance or to comply with more complex and numerous laws and regulations, even if unfounded, could result in liability to us and indemnification obligations, damage our reputation, inhibit sales of our solutions or harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny unauthorized, and potentially improper, actions of our personnel could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe recognition of our revenue depends on, among other things, the terms negotiated in our contracts with our customers. Our personnel may act outside of their authority and negotiate additional terms without our knowledge. We have implemented policies to help prevent and discourage such conduct, but there can be no assurance that such policies would be followed. For instance, in the event that our sales personnel negotiate terms that do not appear in the contract and of which we are unaware, whether such additional terms are written or verbal, we could be prevented from recognizing revenue in accordance with our plans. Furthermore, depending on when we learn of unauthorized actions and the size of the transactions involved, we may have to restate revenue for a previously reported period, which could seriously harm our business, operating results, financial condition and reputation with current and potential customers and investors.\nIntellectual property litigation and infringement claims may cause us to incur significant expense or prevent us from selling our software solutions.\nOur industry is characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, trademarks and copyrights, and by litigation based on allegations of infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. A third-party may assert that our technology violates its intellectual property rights, or we may become the subject of a material intellectual property dispute. Selling improvement (including configure-price-quote), pricing, airline revenue optimization (including revenue management) and airline eCommerce (including shopping, merchandising and retail) solutions may become increasingly subject to infringement claims as the number of such commercially available solutions increases and the functionality of these solutions overlaps. In addition, changes in patent laws in the U.S. may affect the scope, strength and enforceability of our patent rights or the nature of proceedings which may be brought by us related to our patent rights. Future litigation may involve patent holding companies or other adverse patent owners who have no relevant product revenue and against whom our own potential patents may therefore provide little or no deterrence. Regardless of the merit of any particular claim that our technology violates the intellectual property rights of others, responding to such claims may require us to:\n\u2022incur substantial expenses and expend significant management efforts to defend such claims;\n\u2022pay damages, potentially including treble damages, if we are found to have willfully infringed such parties\u2019 patents or copyrights;\n\u2022cease making, selling or using products that are alleged to incorporate the intellectual property of others;\n\u2022distract management and other key personnel from performing their duties for us;\n\u2022enter into potentially unfavorable royalty or license agreements in order to obtain the right to use necessary technologies; and\n\u2022expend additional development resources to redesign our solutions.\nAny licenses required as a result of litigation under any patent may not be made available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. In addition, some licenses may be nonexclusive, and therefore our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us. If we fail to obtain a required license or are unable to design around a patent, we may be unable to effectively develop or market our solutions, which could limit our ability to generate revenue or maintain profitability.\nOur contract terms generally obligate us to indemnify and hold our customers harmless from certain costs arising from third-party claims brought against our customers alleging that the use of our solutions infringe intellectual property rights of others. If we are unable to resolve our legal obligations by settling or paying an infringement claim, we may be required to compensate our customers.\nOur use of open source software may subject our software solutions to general release or re-engineering.\nWe use open source software in our solutions. From time to time, there have been claims challenging the ownership of open source software against companies that incorporate open source software into their products. As a result, we could be\nsubject to lawsuits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software. Some open source licenses contain requirements that we make available source code for modifications or derivative works we create based upon the open source software and that we license such modifications or derivative works under the terms of a particular open source license or other license granting third parties certain rights of further use. If we combine our proprietary software solutions with open source software in a certain manner, we could, under certain of the open source licenses, be required to release the source code of our proprietary software solutions. In addition to risks related to license requirements, usage of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or controls on origin of the software. In addition, open source license terms may be ambiguous and many of the risks associated with usage of open source cannot be eliminated, and could, if not properly addressed, negatively affect our business. If we were found to have inappropriately used open source software, we may be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our software, to re-engineer our solutions, to discontinue the sale of our solutions in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis or take other remedial action that may divert resources away from our development efforts, any of which could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nDefects or errors in our software solutions could harm our reputation, impair our ability to sell our solutions and result in significant costs to us.\nOur software solutions are complex and may contain undetected defects or errors. Several of our solutions have recently been developed and may therefore be more likely to contain undetected defects or errors. In addition, we frequently develop enhancements to our software solutions that may contain defects. We have not suffered significant harm from any defects or errors to date. We have in the past issued, and may in the future need to issue, corrective releases of our solutions to correct defects or errors. The occurrence of any defects or errors could result in:\n\u2022delayed market acceptance and lost sales of our software solutions;\n\u2022delays in payment to us by customers;\n\u2022damage to our reputation;\n\u2022diversion of our resources;\n\u2022legal claims, including product liability claims, against us;\n\u2022increased maintenance and support expenses; and\n\u2022increased insurance costs.\nOur agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our liability for defects and errors in our software solutions and damages relating to such defects and errors, but these provisions may not be enforced by a court or otherwise effectively protect us from legal claims. Our liability insurance may not be adequate to cover all of the costs resulting from these legal claims. Moreover, we cannot provide assurance that our current liability insurance coverage would continue to be available on acceptable terms. In addition, the insurer may deny coverage on any future claims. The successful assertion against us of one or more large claims that exceeds available insurance coverage, or the occurrence of changes in our insurance policies, including premium increases or the imposition of large deductible or co-insurance requirements, could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. Furthermore, even if we prevail in any litigation, we are likely to incur substantial costs and our management\u2019s attention may be diverted from our operations.\nBusiness Model and Capital Structure Risks\nWe incurred indebtedness by issuing convertible notes, and our debt repayment obligations may adversely affect our financial condition and cash flows from operations in the future.\nIn September 2020, we issued $150.0 million principal amount of 2.25% convertible senior notes (\"2027 Notes\") due September 15, 2027, unless earlier redeemed, purchased or converted in accordance with their terms prior to such date. Interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year. As of December 31, 2020, the entire $150.0 million of aggregate principal amount of 2027 Notes are outstanding.\nIn May 2019, we issued $143.8 million principal amount of 1.0% convertible senior notes (\"2024 Notes\" and together with the 2027 Notes, the \"Notes\") due May 15, 2024, unless earlier redeemed, purchased or converted in accordance with their\nterms prior to such date. Interest is payable semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year. As of December 31, 2020, the entire $143.8 million of aggregate principal amount of 2024 Notes are outstanding.\nOur indebtedness could have important consequences because it may impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes. Our ability to meet our debt obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors. We cannot control many of these factors. Our future operations may not generate sufficient cash to enable us to repay our debt. If we fail to comply with any covenants contained in the agreements governing any of our debt, or make a payment on any of our debt when due, we could be in default on such debt, which could, in turn, result in such debt and our other indebtedness becoming immediately payable in full. If we are at any time unable to pay our indebtedness when due, we may be required to renegotiate the terms of the indebtedness, seek to refinance all or a portion of the indebtedness, and/or obtain additional financing. There can be no assurance that, in the future, we will be able to successfully renegotiate such terms, that any such refinancing would be possible or that any additional financing could be obtained on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us.\nOur quarterly results may vary and may not fully reflect the performance of our business.\nWe generally recognize revenue from customers ratably over the terms of their subscription agreements. As a result, most of the revenue we report in each quarter is the result of agreements entered into during prior quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed subscriptions in any quarter may not be reflected in our revenue for that quarter, but will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. Accordingly, the effect of significant downturns in sales, our failure to achieve our internal sales targets, a decline in the market demand of our services or decreases in our retention rate may not be fully reflected in our operating results until future periods. For example, the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic may not be fully reflected in our results of operations until future periods. Our subscription model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as subscription revenue from additional sales must be recognized over the applicable subscription term. We may be unable to timely adjust our cost structure to reflect changes in revenues. In addition, a significant majority of our costs are expensed as incurred, while subscription revenues are recognized over the term of the customer agreement. As a result, increased sales growth could result in our recognition of more costs than revenues in the earlier periods of the terms of our agreements. In addition, we expect to continue to experience some seasonal variations in our cash flows from operating activities, including, as a result of the timing of payment of payroll taxes, performance bonuses to our employees and costs associated with annual company-wide events, each of which have historically been highest in our first fiscal quarter. Therefore, the results of any prior quarterly periods should not be relied upon as an indication of our future operating performance.\nIf we fail to migrate customers with on-premises software licenses to our latest cloud software solutions, our future revenue may be limited and our costs to provide support to those customers may increase.\nCustomers with on-premises licenses for our legacy software may need to migrate to our current cloud solutions to take advantage of our latest features, functionality and security which are only available via the PROS cloud. Although we intend to continue to support our legacy on-premises software customers under perpetual licenses for the foreseeable future, we continue to focus on migrating such customers to our cloud solutions. Historically, customers who purchased on-premises licenses for our solutions may have invested substantial personnel and financial resources in our legacy software. In addition, when considering whether to migrate, these customers may evaluate alternative solutions due to the additional change management and implementation costs associated with migrating to cloud-based applications. When on-premises software customers delay or decline to migrate to our cloud solutions, our internal development and customer support teams find it increasingly difficult and costly to support a declining number of on-premises customers. In addition, if our legacy on-premises license customers delay or decline to migrate to our cloud solutions, choose alternative solutions or otherwise choose to not continue doing business with us by, for example, canceling maintenance, our future revenue may be limited.\nWe have experienced losses since we transitioned to a cloud strategy in 2015, and may continue to incur losses for longer than we expect.\nWe expect our expenses to continue to exceed our revenues in the near term as we continue to make investments as part of our cloud strategy, particularly in new product development, sales, marketing, security, privacy and cloud operations. Our ability to return to profitability depends on our ability to: continue to drive subscription sales, enhance our existing products and develop new products, scale our sales and marketing and product development organizations, successfully execute our marketing and sales strategies, renew our subscription agreements with existing customers, and manage our expenses. If we are not able to execute on these actions, our business may not grow as we anticipate, our operating results could be adversely affected and we may continue to incur net losses in the future. Additionally, our new initiatives may not generate sufficient\nrevenue and cash flows to recoup our investments in them. If any of these events were to occur, it could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets become impaired, we could be required to record a significant charge to earnings.\nUnder GAAP, we review our goodwill and amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable. GAAP requires us to test for goodwill impairment at least annually. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets may not be recoverable include declines in stock price, market capitalization or cash flows and slower growth rates in our industry. We could be required to record a significant charge to earnings in our financial statements during the period in which any impairment of our goodwill or amortizable intangible assets were determined, negatively impacting our results of operations.\nRisks relating to Ownership of our Common Stock\nMarket volatility may affect our stock price and the value of your investment.\nThe market price for our common stock, and the software industry generally, has been and is likely to continue to be volatile. Volatility could make it difficult to trade shares of our common stock at predictable prices or times. Many factors could cause the market price of our common stock to be volatile, including the following:\n\u2022variations in our quarterly or annual operating results;\n\u2022decreases in market valuations of comparable companies;\n\u2022fluctuations in stock market prices and volumes;\n\u2022decreases in financial estimates by equity research analysts;\n\u2022announcements by our competitors of significant contracts, new solutions or enhancements, acquisitions, distribution partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u2022departure of key personnel;\n\u2022changes in governmental regulations and standards affecting the software industry and our software solutions;\n\u2022sales of common stock or other securities by us in the future;\n\u2022damages, settlements, legal fees and other costs related to litigation, claims and other contingencies;\n\u2022deterioration of the general U.S. and global economic condition; and\n\u2022other risks described elsewhere in this section.\nIn the past, securities class action litigation often has been initiated against a company following a period of volatility in the market price of the company\u2019s securities. If class action litigation is initiated against us, we may incur substantial costs and our management\u2019s attention could be diverted from our operations. All of these factors could cause the market price of our stock to decline, and you may lose some or all of your investment.\nOur directors, executive officers, and certain significant stockholders hold a significant portion of our outstanding shares.\nAt December 31, 2020, our directors and executive officers collectively control approximately 10% of our issued and outstanding common shares, and together with certain significant stockholders, including investment funds associated with Brown Capital Management, LLC, Vanguard Group Inc., BlackRock, Inc., Conestoga Capital Advisors, LLC and Fred Alger Management, LLC, control approximately 53% of our issued and outstanding common shares. In the event that these stockholders each independently decided to vote for or against matters requiring stockholder approval, they could influence such matters in ways that may not align with your specific interests as a stockholder, including the election of directors and\napproval of significant corporate transactions. This concentration of ownership could affect the market price of our shares if there is a sale by this group of stockholders, and could also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us even if such change of control could be beneficial to you as a stockholder.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us more difficult and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws and Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law contain provisions that might enable our management to resist a takeover of our company. These provisions include the following:\n\u2022the division of our board of directors into three classes to be elected on a staggered basis, one class each year;\n\u2022a prohibition on actions by written consent of our stockholders;\n\u2022the elimination of the right of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022a requirement that stockholders provide advance notice of any stockholder nominations of directors or any proposal of new business to be considered at any meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022a requirement that a supermajority vote be obtained to amend or repeal certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation; and\n\u2022the ability of our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval.\nIn addition, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which limits the ability of stockholders owning in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock to merge or combine with us. Although we believe these provisions collectively provide for an opportunity to obtain higher bids by requiring potential acquirors to negotiate with our board of directors, they would apply even if an offer were considered beneficial by some stockholders. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe do not currently anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. We currently anticipate that we will retain all of our available cash, if any, for use as working capital, repayment of debt and for other general corporate purposes. Consequently, stockholders must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment.", "PERMNO": 92143, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "PRO"}
