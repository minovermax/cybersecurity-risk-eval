RISK FACTORS\n\ufeff\nThe following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forward-looking information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Any of the following risks could materially adversely affect our business, operations, industry or financial position or our future financial performance. While the Company believes it has identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting its business, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be significant that may adversely affect its business, operations, industry, financial position and financial performance in the future.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nThe ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic and measures taken in response thereto have adversely affected the Company\u2019s results of operations and its financial condition, and the full impact of the pandemic will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\n\ufeff\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has materially and adversely impacted the worldwide economy and financial markets, which could lead to a prolonged economic recession. In response, the federal and state governments in the U.S. have taken unprecedented monetary and fiscal policy actions across all sectors of the U.S. economy, and there is significant uncertainty as to the timing of stabilization and recovery. The Company\u2019s business, results of operations, and financial condition were adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2020, especially beginning in mid-March, and such impact continues into the first quarter of fiscal year 2021. The COVID-19 pandemic and both public and private measures taken to contain it have negatively affected the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity, all of which may continue or worsen. The following are some of the issues that the Company continues to face:\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\nProlonged recessionary concerns. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a significant reduction of economic activity in the U.S., as well as a significant increase in unemployment, which could lead to a prolonged economic recession;\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\nInterruptions in the operations of industries in which the Company\u2019s products are used, including EMS. Consumer and business discretionary spending has been significantly curtailed and may worsen, all of which adversely impacts some of the Company\u2019s customers\u2019 businesses, financial condition, and liquidity; even when certain government and regulatory restrictions are lifted, consumer discretionary spending, and demand for the Company\u2019s customers\u2019 products, may continue to be challenged due to uncertainty in the marketplace;\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\nThe Company\u2019s facilities have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Company has experienced plant closings or reduced operations in the following locations: Elk Grove Village, Illinois U.S., Union City, California U.S., Suzhou, China; Acuna, Coahuila MX; Chihuahua, Chihuahua MX; and Tijuana, Baja California MX. While all of the Company\u2019s facilities are currently operational, it has experienced and continues to experience employee absences that negatively affect production capabilities, revenues, and cash flow. The Company has and will continue to take actions to manage its expenses and to conserve its financial resources;\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\nActual and potential delays in customer payments, defaults on the Company\u2019s customer credit arrangements; or other failures by third parties such as suppliers, and distributors to meet their obligations to the Company due to their economic circumstances. The financial markets have also been adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, potentially causing operational cash flow issues for the Company, and potentially causing similar issues for the Company\u2019s customers, including, but not limited to, affecting their ability to meet their payment obligations to us;\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\nAdapting business practices. The Company has and will continue to take actions to manage its expenses and to conserve its financial resources. The spread of COVID-19 has caused the Company to modify its business practices, particularly with respect to its liquidity position and near-term cost structure. The Company\u2019s future strategies, prospects, and plans for growth may also be negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\nPotential impact on the Company\u2019s ability to meet obligations under credit facilities. The pandemic could impact the Company\u2019s ability to meet its obligations under its credit agreement and other outstanding debt, which may require the Company to seek covenant relief for a limited period of time. Although there can be no assurance that such relief would be available, if such relief is available, the Company\u2019s lenders may, in exchange, increase the\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\ncost of borrowing, apply more stringent covenants, restrict merger and acquisition activity, and require other terms and conditions that may limit its business and financing activities; and\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\nInterruptions in manufacturing or distribution of the Company\u2019s products. Outbreaks in the communities in which the Company operates could affect its ability to operate its manufacturing or distribution activities, and the Company\u2019s suppliers could experience similar interruptions.\n\ufeff\nThe full extent to which COVID-19 impacts the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including, but not limited to, the duration and spread of the outbreak within the U.S., China, Mexico, Vietnam and Taiwan, its severity, the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. Even after COVID-19 has subsided, the Company may continue to experience materially adverse impacts to its business as a result of its global economic impact, including any recession that has occurred or may occur in the future. There are no comparable recent events which may provide guidance as to the effect of the spread of COVID-19, and, as a result, the ultimate impact of COVID-19, or a similar health epidemic or pandemic, is highly uncertain and subject to change. The Company does not yet know the full extent of the impacts on its business, its operations or the global economy as a whole. However, the effects could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations. While it continues to monitor the business metrics that it has historically used to predict its financial performance, it is uncertain as to whether these metrics will continue to function as they have in the past.\n\ufeff\nThe Company experiences variable operating results.\n\ufeff\nThe Company\u2019s results of operations have varied and may continue to fluctuate significantly from period to period, including on a quarterly basis. Consequently, results of operations in any period should not be considered indicative of the results for any future period, and fluctuations in operating results may also result in fluctuations in the price of the Company\u2019s common stock.\n\ufeff\nThe Company\u2019s quarterly and annual results may vary significantly depending on numerous factors, many of which are beyond the Company\u2019s control. Some of these factors include:\n\ufeff\n- changes in sales mix to customers\n- changes in availability and rising component costs\n- volume of customer orders relative to capacity\n- market demand and acceptance of our customers\u2019 products\n- price erosion within the EMS marketplace\n- capital equipment requirements needed to remain technologically competitive\n- volatility in the U.S. and international economic and financial markets\n\ufeff\nThe price of the Company\u2019s stock is volatile.\n\ufeff\nThe price of the Company\u2019s common stock historically has experienced significant volatility due to fluctuations in the Company\u2019s revenue and earnings, other factors relating to the Company\u2019s operations, the market\u2019s changing expectations for the Company\u2019s growth, overall equity market conditions and other factors unrelated to the Company\u2019s operations. In addition, the limited float of the Company\u2019s common stock and the limited number of market makers also affect the volatility of the Company\u2019s common stock. Such fluctuations are expected to continue in the future.\n\ufeff\nOur customers have competitive challenges, including rapid technological changes, pricing pressure and decreasing demand from their customers, which could adversely affect their business and the Company\u2019s.\n\ufeff\nFactors affecting the industries that utilize our customers\u2019 products could negatively impact our customers and the Company. These factors include:\n\ufeff\n- increased competition among our customers and their competitors\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n- the inability of our customers to develop and market their products\n- recessionary periods in our customers\u2019 markets\n- the potential that our customers\u2019 products become obsolete\n- our customers\u2019 inability to react to rapidly changing technology\n\ufeff\nAny such factor or a combination of factors could negatively impact our customers\u2019 need for or ability to pay for our products, which could, in turn, affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\n\ufeff\nIf any of the Company\u2019s customers have financial difficulties, the Company could encounter delays or defaults in the payment of amounts owed for accounts receivable and inventory obligations. This could have a significant adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\n\ufeff\nThe Company\u2019s customer base is concentrated.\n\ufeff\nSales to the Company\u2019s five largest customers accounted for 51.4% and 49.7% of net sales for the fiscal years ended April 30, 2020, and April 30, 2019, respectively. For the fiscal year ended April 30, 2020, two customers accounted for 16.7% and 14.1% of net sales of the Company, and 3.6% and 5.0%, respectively, of accounts receivable. For the fiscal year ended April 30, 2019, two customers accounted for 15.9% and 15.8% of net sales of the Company and 3.9% and 11.5%, respectively, of accounts receivable. Significant reductions in sales to any of the Company\u2019s major customers or the loss of a major customer could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s operations. If the Company cannot replace cancelled or reduced orders, sales will decline, which could have a material impact on the results of operations. There can be no assurance that the Company will retain any or all of its largest customers. This risk may be further complicated by pricing pressures and intense competition prevalent in our industry.\n\ufeff\nThe Company faces intense industry competition and downward pricing pressures.\n\ufeff\nThe EMS industry is highly fragmented and characterized by intense competition. Many of the Company\u2019s competitors have greater experience, as well as greater manufacturing, purchasing, marketing and financial resources than the Company. Competition from existing or potential new competitors may have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations. The introduction of lower priced competitive products, significant price reductions by the Company\u2019s competitors or significant pricing pressures from its customers could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nThe Company\u2019s ability to secure and maintain sufficient credit arrangements is key to its continued operations.\n\ufeff\nOn March 31, 2017, the Company entered into a $35,000,000 senior secured credit facility with U.S. Bank, which expires on March 31, 2022. The credit facility is collateralized by substantially all of the Company\u2019s domestically located assets. The facility allows the Company to choose among interest rates at which it may borrow funds: the bank fixed rate of five percent or LIBOR plus one and one half percent (effectively 2.33% at April 30, 2020). Interest is due monthly.\n\ufeff\nOn July 16, 2018, the Company and U.S. Bank entered into an amendment of the revolving line of credit under the senior secured credit facility. The amended revolving credit facility allows the Company to borrow up to the lesser of (i) $45,000,000 (the \u201cRevolving Line Cap\u201d) less reserves or (ii) the Borrowing Base, but no more than 90% of the Company\u2019s Revolving Line Cap, except that the 90% limitation will expire if (i) the Company\u2019s actual revolving loans for 90 consecutive days after the amendment\u2019s effective date are less than 80% of the Company\u2019s Borrowing Base and (ii) the Company maintains a Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of 1.2 to 1.0 for four consecutive quarters. The amendment also imposes sublimits on categories of inventory of $10,500,000 on raw materials, $10,000,000 on finished goods and $28,000,000 on all eligible inventory.\n\ufeff\nOn December 13, 2018, the Company and U.S. Bank entered into an amendment of the revolving credit facility. The amendment provides an exception to otherwise ineligible foreign receivables for up to $3,000,000 of receivables paid by certain enumerated account debtors outside of the U.S. and Canada.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nOn April 23, 2020, the Company entered into a loan with U.S. Bank, as lender, pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program of the CARES Act as administered by the U.S. Small Business Administration (the \u201cSBA\u201d) in the amount of $6,282,973. The loan, in the form of a promissory note, matures on April 23, 2022. No additional collateral or guarantees were provided by the Company for the loan. The PPP loan provides for customary events of default. Under the CARES Act, loan forgiveness is available for the sum of documented payroll costs, rent payments, mortgage interest and covered utilities during the 24-week period beginning on the date of loan disbursement. The Company may be required to repay any portion of the outstanding principal that is not forgiven, along with accrued interest, and it cannot provide any assurance that it will be eligible for loan forgiveness, or that any amount of the PPP Loan will ultimately be forgiven by the SBA. All aspects of the PPP loan are subject to review by the SBA, including without limitation, the Company\u2019s eligibility for and the size of the loan. The review procedures have not been made public. The Company cannot predict the outcome of that review nor be assured that all or any part of the loan will be forgiven. To the extent that all or part of the PPP loan is not forgiven, the Company will be required to make payments, including interest accruing at an annual interest rate of 1.0% beginning on the date of disbursement\n\ufeff\nOn July 15, 2020 and August 7, 2020, the Company and U.S. Bank entered into amendments of the revolving credit facility. The amendments revise the Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio.\n\ufeff\nAs of April 30, 2020, there was $26,884,494 outstanding and $13,850,575 of unused availability under the U.S. Bank facility compared to an outstanding balance of $35,727,212 and $6,645,730 of unused availability at April 30, 2019.\n\ufeff\nOn March 15, 2019, the Company\u2019s wholly-owned subsidiary, SigmaTron Electronic Technology Co., Ltd., entered into a credit facility with China Construction Bank. Under the agreement SigmaTron Electronic Technology Co., Ltd. can borrow up to 5,000,000 Renminbi, approximately $709,000 as of April 30, 2020, and the facility is collateralized by Wujiang SigmaTron Electronic Co., Ltd.\u2019s manufacturing building. Interest is payable monthly and the facility bears a fixed interest rate of 6.09%. The term of the facility extends to March 14, 2024. As of April 30, 2020 the outstanding balance under the facility was $304,658. There was no outstanding balance under the facility at April 30, 2019.\n\ufeff\nThe Company is in compliance with its financial covenant and other restrictive covenants as of April 30, 2020.\n\ufeff\nAdverse market conditions could reduce our future sales and earnings per share.\n\ufeff\nUncertainty over the erosion of global consumer confidence amidst concerns about volatile energy costs, geopolitical issues, the availability and cost of credit, declining asset values, inflation, rising unemployment, and the stability and solvency of financial institutions, financial markets, businesses, and sovereign nations has slowed global economic growth and resulted in recessions in many countries, including in the United States, Europe and certain countries in Asia over the past several years. The economic recovery of recent years is fragile and recessionary conditions have returned. Any of these potential negative economic conditions may reduce demand for the Company\u2019s customers\u2019 products and adversely affect the Company\u2019s sales. Consequently, the Company\u2019s past operating results, earnings and cash flows may not be indicative of the Company\u2019s future operating results, earnings and cash flows.\n\ufeff\nThe Company may not be entitled to forgiveness of its recently received Paycheck Protection Program Loan (\u201cPPP loan\u201d), and its application for the PPP loan could in the future be determined to have been impermissible.\nOn April 23, 2020 the Company received proceeds of $6,282,973 from a loan under the PPP of the CARES Act, which it has used to retain current employees, maintain payroll and make lease and utility payments. The PPP loan matures on April 23, 2022 if not forgiven and bears annual interest at a rate of 1.0%. Due to the size of the PPP loan, it is subject to review, which introduces an additional layer of uncertainty.\n\ufeff\nUnder the CARES Act, small businesses may apply for a PPP loan if they employ no more than 500 employees, or are a business in an industry that has an employee-based size standard established by the SBA that is greater than 500 employees. The Company operates under NAICS Code 334418 where the minimum employee threshold is 750. In establishing eligibility for a PPP loan, the Company has considered its U.S. Resident\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nheadcount based on the SBA rules in place at the time of the application, which the Company believes is within the eligibility threshold.\n\ufeff\nUnder the CARES Act, forgiveness of a PPP loan is available for the sum of documented payroll costs, covered rent payments, covered mortgage interest and covered utilities during the 24-week period beginning on the date of loan approval. The Company may be required to repay any portion of the outstanding principal that is not forgiven, along with accrued interest, and it cannot provide any assurance that it will be eligible for loan forgiveness, or that any amount of the PPP loan will ultimately be forgiven by the SBA. If the loan is not forgiven, the Company will be required to pay the lender equal monthly payments of principal and interest as required to fully amortize by April 23, 2022 any principal amount outstanding on the PPP loan. In order to apply for the PPP loan, the Company was required to certify, that the current economic uncertainty, including, among other factors, the short term customer demand reduction, made the PPP loan request necessary to support its ongoing operations. The Company made this certification in good faith after analyzing, among other things, the continued employment of its entire U.S. workforce, certain obvious \u201cwork-from-home\u201d limitations associated with the nature of its business, and its ability to meet fixed cost obligations, in light of customer concerns. Furthermore, the Company considered its classification as a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d under SEC rules and its need for additional funding to continue operations, and its lack of ability to currently access alternative forms of capital in the current market environment to fund working capital requirements. Based on this analysis, it believes that it satisfied all eligibility criteria for the PPP loan, and that the receipt of the PPP loan is consistent with the broad objectives of the CARES Act. If, despite the Company\u2019s actions and certification that it satisfied all eligibility requirements for the PPP loan, it is later determined that it violated applicable laws or was otherwise ineligible to receive the PPP loan, it may be required to repay the PPP loan in its entirety in a lump sum or be subject to additional penalties, which could also result in adverse publicity and damage to the Company\u2019s reputation. If these events were to transpire, they could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\ufeff\nChanges in U.S. trade policy, including the imposition of tariffs and the resulting consequences, may have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nThe U.S. government has indicated its intent to adopt a new approach to trade policy and in some cases to renegotiate, or potentially terminate, certain existing bilateral or multi-lateral trade agreements. It has also initiated tariffs on certain foreign goods, including steel and aluminum and other raw materials utilized by the Company. Changes in U.S. trade policy could result in one or more of the U.S.\u2019 trading partners adopting responsive trade policy making it more difficult or costly for the Company to import our products from those countries. This in turn could require us to increase prices to our customers which may reduce demand, or, if we are unable to increase prices, result in a lower margin on products sold.\n\ufeff\nChina and the European Union have imposed tariffs on U.S. products in retaliation for new U.S. tariffs. Additional tariffs could be imposed by China and the European Union in response to proposed increased tariffs on products imported from China and the European Union. There is also a concern that the imposition of additional tariffs by the United States could result in the adoption of additional tariffs by other countries. The resulting trade war could have a significant adverse effect on world trade and the world economy. To the extent that trade tariffs and other restrictions imposed by the United States increase the price of, or limit the amount of steel, aluminum and other raw materials utilized by the Company imported into the United States, the costs of our raw materials may be adversely affected and the demand from our customers for products and services may be diminished, which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\n\ufeff\nWe cannot predict future trade policy or the terms of any renegotiated trade agreements and their impact on our business. The adoption and expansion of trade restrictions, the occurrence of a trade war, or other governmental action related to tariffs or trade agreements or policies has the potential to adversely impact demand for our products, our costs, our customers, our suppliers, and the U.S. economy, which in turn could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nThe Company may not be able to achieve the expected benefits of the proposed business combination between the Company and Wagz (the \u201cacquisition\u201d), including anticipated revenue and cost synergies, and costs associated with achieving synergies or integrating Wagz may exceed its expectations.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nThe Company may not be able to achieve the expected benefits of the Wagz acquisition, including anticipated revenue and cost synergies. There can be no assurance that the Wagz acquisition will be beneficial to the Company. Moreover, the Company may not be able to integrate the assets acquired in the Wagz acquisition or achieve our expected cost synergies without increases in costs or other difficulties. Although Wagz will be a stand-alone operation of SigmaTron, the integration process may be complex, costly and time-consuming. The Company expects to incur expenses in connection with the integration of the Wagz acquisition. While it is anticipated that certain expenses will be incurred to achieve operational synergies, such expenses are difficult to estimate accurately, and may exceed current estimates. Accordingly, the benefits from the Wagz acquisition may be offset by costs incurred or delays in integrating the businesses. Any unexpected costs or delays incurred in connection with the integration of the Wagz acquisition could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects, as well as the market price of its common stock.\n\ufeff\nThe overall integration of the businesses may result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses, loss of customer relationships, and diversion of management\u2019s attention. In addition, even if the operations of the Company\u2019s business and Wagz\u2019s business are integrated successfully, the Company may not realize the full benefits of the Wagz acquisition, including the synergies, cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that it expects. These benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame, or at all.\n\ufeff\nAn adverse change in the interest rates for our borrowings could adversely affect our results of operations.\n\ufeff\nThe Company pays interest on outstanding borrowings under its senior secured credit facility and certain other long-term debt obligations at interest rates that fluctuate. An adverse change in the Company\u2019s interest rates could have a material adverse effect on its results of operations.\n\ufeff\nThe phase-out of the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), or the replacement of LIBOR with a different reference rate or modification of the method used to calculate LIBOR, may adversely affect interest rates which may have an adverse impact on the Company.\n\ufeff\nLIBOR is the basic rate of interest used in lending between banks on the London interbank market and is widely used as a reference for setting the interest rate on loans globally. The Company uses LIBOR as a reference rate in its senior secured credit facility. The interest rate for the Company\u2019s senior secured credit facility is calculated using LIBOR. The Company\u2019s revolving credit facility contains a stated minimum value for LIBOR, and as of April 30, 2020, the Company had $26,884,494 in outstanding indebtedness indexed to LIBOR.\n\ufeff\nIn July 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. It is unclear whether LIBOR will cease to exist at that time or if new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee (\u201cARRC\u201d) has proposed that the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) as the rate that represents best practice as the alternative to LIBOR for use in financial and other derivatives contracts that are currently indexed to United States dollar LIBOR. ARRC has proposed a paced market transition plan to SOFR from LIBOR and organizations are currently working on industry wide and company specific transition plans as it relates to financial and other derivative contracts exposed to LIBOR. Uncertainty exists as to the transition process and broad acceptance of SOFR as the primary alternative to LIBOR. At this time, due to a lack of consensus existing as to what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, it is impossible to predict the effect of any such alternatives on the Company\u2019s liquidity. However, if LIBOR ceases to exist or a new method of calculating LIBOR is adopted, the Company may need to renegotiate its credit agreements that utilize LIBOR as a factor in determining the interest rate to replace LIBOR with the new standard that is established. In addition, these changes may have an adverse impact on the value of or interest earned on any LIBOR-based marketable securities, loans and derivatives that are included in the Company\u2019s financial assets and liabilities, which may have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nIf the security of the Company\u2019s systems is breached or otherwise subjected to unauthorized access, the Company\u2019s reputation may be severely harmed and it may be exposed to liability.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nThe Company\u2019s system stores confidential information which includes its financial information, its customers\u2019 proprietary email distribution lists, product information, supplier information, and other critical data. Any accidental or willful security breach or other unauthorized access could expose the Company to liability for the loss of such information, adverse regulatory action by federal and state governments, time-consuming and expensive litigation and other possible liabilities as well as negative publicity, which could severely damage the Company\u2019s reputation. If security measures are breached because of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise, or if design flaws in its software are exposed and exploited, and, as a result, a third party obtains unauthorized access to any of the Company\u2019s customer data, its relationships with its customers may be severely damaged, and the Company could incur significant liability. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until they are launched against a target, the Company and its third-party hosting facilities may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures. In addition, many states have enacted laws requiring companies to notify customers of data security breaches involving their data. These mandatory disclosures regarding a security breach often lead to widespread negative publicity, which may cause the Company\u2019s customers to lose confidence in the effectiveness of its data security measures. Any security breach whether actual or perceived, could harm the Company\u2019s reputation, could cause it to lose customers and may negatively impact its ability to acquire new customers.\n\ufeff\nWith the increased use of technologies such as the Internet to conduct business, a company is susceptible to operational, information security and related risks. In general, cyber incidents can result from deliberate attacks or unintentional events. Cyberattacks include, but are not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital systems (e.g., through \u201chacking\u201d or malicious software coding) for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption (e.g., ransomware attacks). Cyberattacks may also be carried out in a manner that does not require gaining unauthorized access, such as causing denial-of-service attacks on websites (i.e., efforts to make network services unavailable to intended users). Cyber incidents affecting the Company or its service providers have the ability to cause disruptions and impact business operations, potentially resulting in financial losses, interference with the Company\u2019s ability to conduct business in the ordinary course, violations of applicable privacy and other laws, regulatory fines, penalties, reputational damage, reimbursement or other compensation costs, additional compliance costs and, in extreme cases, have caused companies to cease doing business. Cyber events also can affect counterparties or entities with which the Company does business, governmental and other regulatory authorities, banks, insurance companies and other financial institutions, among others. In addition, substantial costs may be incurred in order to prevent any cyber incidents in the future. While the Company has established risk management systems to prevent such cyber incidents, there are inherent limitations in such systems including the possibility that the Company has not prepared for certain risks that have not been or are not possible to have been identified. Further, the Company may be able to influence, but cannot control, the cyber security plans and systems put in place by its service providers or any other third parties whose operations may affect the Company. The Company could be negatively impacted as a result.\n\ufeff\nThe availability of raw components or an increase in their price may affect the Company\u2019s operations and profits.\n\ufeff\nThe Company relies on numerous third-party suppliers for components used in the Company\u2019s production process. Certain of these components are available only from single-sources or a limited number of suppliers. In addition, a customer\u2019s specifications may require the Company to obtain components from a single-source or a small number of suppliers. The loss of any such suppliers could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations. Further, the Company could operate at a cost disadvantage compared to competitors who have greater buying power from suppliers. The Company does not enter into long-term purchase agreements with major or single-source suppliers, but the Company frequently places cancellable scheduled purchase orders with suppliers that extend out as far as one year. The current component market place remains volatile. Lead times have recently shortened but lead times for certain select components can still exceed 24 to 36 weeks. The Company\u2019s orders for components are always based on the changing needs of its customers.\n\ufeff\nMost of the Company\u2019s customers production schedules are volatile, which makes it difficult to schedule production and achieve maximum efficiency at the Company\u2019s manufacturing facilities and manage inventory levels.\n\ufeff\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nThe volume and timing of sales to the Company\u2019s customers may vary due to:\n\ufeff\n- customers\u2019 attempts to manage their inventory\n- variation in demand for the Company\u2019s customers\u2019 products\n- design changes, or\n- acquisitions of or consolidation among customers\n\ufeff\nMany of the Company\u2019s customers do not commit to firm production schedules. The Company\u2019s inability to forecast the level of customer orders with certainty can make it difficult to schedule production and maximize utilization of manufacturing capacity and manage inventory levels. The Company could be required to increase or decrease staffing and more closely manage other expenses in order to meet the anticipated demand of its customers. Orders from the Company\u2019s customers could be cancelled or delivery schedules could be deferred as a result of changes in our customers\u2019 demand, thereby adversely affecting the Company\u2019s results of operations in any given period.\n\ufeff\nAdverse changes in the economy or political conditions could negatively impact the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\n\ufeff\nThe Company\u2019s sales and gross margins depend significantly on market demand for its customers\u2019 products. The uncertainty in the U.S. and international economic and political environments could result in a decline in demand for our customers\u2019 products in any industry. Further, any adverse changes in tax rates and laws or trade policies affecting our customers could result in decreasing gross margins. Any of these factors could negatively impact the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company and its customers may be unable to keep current with the industry\u2019s technological changes.\n\ufeff\nThe market for the Company\u2019s manufacturing services is characterized by rapidly changing technology and continuing product development. The future success of the Company\u2019s business will depend in large part upon our customers\u2019 ability to maintain and enhance their technological capabilities, develop and market manufacturing services which meet changing customer needs and successfully anticipate or respond to technological changes in manufacturing processes on a cost-effective and timely basis.\n\ufeff\nThere is a risk of fluctuation of various currencies integral to the Company\u2019s operations.\n\ufeff\nThe Company purchases some of its material components and funds some of its operations in foreign currencies. From time to time the currencies fluctuate against the U.S. Dollar. Such fluctuations could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations and performance. The impact of currency fluctuations for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2020, resulted in net foreign currency transaction losses of $285,654 compared to net foreign currency losses of approximately $434,000 in the prior year. These fluctuations are expected to continue and could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations. The Company did not, and is not expected to, utilize derivatives or hedge foreign currencies to reduce the risk of such fluctuations.\nThe Company has foreign operations that may pose additional risks.\n\ufeff\nThe Company has substantial manufacturing operations in multiple countries. Therefore, the Company\u2019s foreign businesses and results of operations are dependent upon numerous related factors, including the stability of the foreign economies, the political climate, relations with the United States, prevailing worker wages, the legal authority of the Company to operate and expand its business in a foreign country, the ability to identify, hire, train and retain qualified personnel and operating management in Mexico, China and Vietnam, and the Company\u2019s ability to manage disruptions resulting from foreign government lockdowns and other actions taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\ufeff\nThe Company obtains many of its materials and components through its IPO in Taipei, Taiwan. The Company\u2019s access to these materials and components is dependent on the continued viability of its Asian suppliers.\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nApproximately 16% of the total assets of the Company are located in foreign jurisdictions outside the United States as of April 30, 2020, of which 10% and 4% of the total assets were located in China and Mexico, respectively, and 2% in other foreign locations. As of April 30, 2019, approximately 13% of the total assets were located in foreign jurisdictions, of which 8% and 4% were located in China and Mexico, respectively, and 1% in other foreign locations.\n\ufeff\nThe Company depends on management and skilled personnel.\n\ufeff\nThe Company depends significantly on its President/CEO and other executive officers. The Company\u2019s employees generally are not bound by employment agreements and the Company cannot assure that it will retain its executive officers or skilled personnel. The loss of the services of any of these key employees could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s business and results of operations. In addition, despite significant competition, continued growth and expansion of the Company\u2019s EMS business will require that the Company attract, motivate and retain additional skilled and experienced personnel. The Company\u2019s future growth depends on the contributions and abilities of key executives and skilled, experienced employees. The Company\u2019s future growth also depends on its ability to recruit and retain high-quality employees. A failure to obtain or retain the number of skilled employees necessary to support the Company\u2019s efforts, a loss of key employees or a significant shortage of skilled, experienced employees could jeopardize its ability to meet its growth targets.\nFavorable labor relations are important to the Company.\n\ufeff\nThe Company currently has labor union contracts with its employees constituting approximately 46% and 48% of its workforce for fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively. Although the Company believes its labor relations are good, any labor disruptions, whether union-related or otherwise, could significantly impair the Company\u2019s business, substantially increase the Company\u2019s costs or otherwise have a material impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\n\ufeff\nFailure to comply with environmental regulations could subject the Company to liability.\n\ufeff\nThe Company is subject to a variety of environmental regulations relating to the use, storage, discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals used during its manufacturing process. To date, the cost to the Company of such compliance has not had a material impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations. However, there can be no assurance that violations will not occur in the future as a result of human error, equipment failure or other causes. Further, the Company cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of environmental legislation or regulatory requirements that could be imposed or how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted. Compliance with more stringent laws or regulations, as well as more vigorous enforcement policies of regulatory agencies, could require substantial expenditures by the Company and could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. Any failure by the Company to comply with present or future regulations could subject it to future liabilities or the suspension of production which could have a material negative impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\n\ufeff\nConflict minerals regulations may cause the Company to incur additional expenses and could increase the cost of components contained in its products and adversely affect its inventory supply chain.\n\ufeff\nThe Dodd-Frank Act, and the rules promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) thereunder, require the Company to determine and report annually whether any conflict minerals contained in our products originated from the DRC or an adjoining country. The Dodd-Frank Act and these rules could affect our ability to source components that contain conflict minerals at acceptable prices and could impact the availability of conflict minerals, since there may be only a limited number of suppliers of conflict-free conflict minerals. Our customers may require that our products contain only conflict-free conflict minerals, and our revenues and margins may be negatively impacted if we are unable to meet this requirement at a reasonable price or are unable to pass through any increased costs associated with meeting this requirement. Additionally, the Company may suffer reputational harm with our customers and other stakeholders if our products are not conflict-free. The Company could incur significant costs in the event we are unable to manufacture products\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nthat contain only conflict-free conflict minerals or to the extent that we are required to make changes to products, processes, or sources of supply due to the foregoing requirements or pressures.\n\ufeff\nCustomer relationships with start-up companies present more risk.\n\ufeff\nA small portion of the Company\u2019s current customer base is comprised of start-up companies. Customer relationships with start-up companies may present heightened risk due to the lack of product history. Slow market acceptance of their products could result in demand fluctuations causing inventory levels to rise. Further, the current economic environment could make it difficult for such emerging companies to obtain additional funding. This may result in additional credit risk including, but not limited to, the collection of trade account receivables and payment for their inventory. If the Company does not have adequate allowances recorded, the results of operations may be negatively affected.\n\ufeff\nChanges in securities laws and regulations may increase costs.\n\ufeff\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and listing requirements subsequently adopted by Nasdaq in response to Sarbanes-Oxley, have required changes in corporate governance practices, internal control policies and securities disclosure and compliance practices of public companies. More recently the Dodd-Frank Act requires changes to our corporate governance, compliance practices and securities disclosures. Compliance following the implementation of these rules has increased our legal, financial and accounting costs. The Company expects increased costs related to these new regulations to continue, including, but not limited to, legal, financial and accounting costs. These developments may result in the Company having difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified members of the board or qualified officers. Further, the costs associated with the compliance with and implementation of procedures under these laws and related rules could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nInadequate internal control over financial reporting could result in a reduction in the value of our common stock.\n\ufeff\nIf the Company identifies and reports a material weakness in its internal control over financial reporting, shareholders and the Company\u2019s lenders could lose confidence in the reliability of the Company\u2019s financial statements. This could have a material adverse impact on the value of the Company\u2019s stock and the Company\u2019s liquidity.\n\ufeff\nDisclosure and internal controls may not detect all errors or fraud.\n\ufeff\nThe Company\u2019s disclosure controls and internal controls can provide only reasonable assurance that the procedures will meet the control objectives. Controls are limited in their effectiveness by human error, including faulty judgments in decision-making. Further, controls can be circumvented by collusion of two or more people or by management override of controls. Therefore, the Company\u2019s management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, cannot conclude with certainty that the Company\u2019s disclosure controls and internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud.\n\ufeff\nAny litigation, even where a claim is without merit, could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources.\n\ufeff\nIn the past, the Company has been notified of claims relating to various matters including contractual matters, labor issues or other matters arising in the ordinary course of business. In the event of any such claim, the Company may be required to spend a significant amount of money and resources, even where the claim is without merit. Accordingly, the resolution of such disputes, even those encountered in the ordinary course of business, could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, consolidated financial conditions and results of operations.\n\ufeff", "PERMNO": 80274, "SIC": 3672, "TIC": "SGMA"}
