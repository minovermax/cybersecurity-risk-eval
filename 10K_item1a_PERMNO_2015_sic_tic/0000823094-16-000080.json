{"cik": "823094", "company": "SOTHEBYS", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-26", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A: RISK FACTORS\nBefore you make an investment decision with respect to Sotheby's Common Stock, you should carefully consider all of the information included in this Form 10-K and the subsequent periodic filings with the SEC. In particular, you should carefully consider the risk factors described below and the risks and uncertainties related to \"Forward Looking Statements,\" any of which could have a material adverse affect on Sotheby's business, results of operations, financial condition and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward looking statements are made in this annual report. The following risk factors, which are not ranked in any particular order, should be read in conjunction with the balance of this annual report, including the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included in this report.\nThe global economy, the financial markets and political conditions of various countries may negatively affect Sotheby's business and clients, as well as the supply of and demand for works of art.\nThe international art market is influenced over time by the overall strength and stability of the global economy and the financial markets of various countries, although this correlation may not be immediately evident. In addition, global political conditions and world events may affect Sotheby's business through their effect on the economies of various countries, as well as on the willingness of potential buyers and sellers to purchase and sell art in the wake of economic uncertainty. Sotheby's business can be particularly influenced by the economies, financial markets and political conditions of the U.S., the U.K., China, and the other major countries or territories of Europe and Asia (including the Middle East). Accordingly, weakness in those economies and financial markets can adversely affect the supply of and demand for works of art and Sotheby's business. Furthermore, global political conditions may also influence the enactment of legislation that could adversely impact Sotheby's business.\nCompetition in the international art market is intense and may adversely impact Sotheby's business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nSotheby's competes with other auctioneers and art dealers to obtain valuable consignments to offer for sale either at auction or through private sale. The level of competition is intense and can adversely impact Sotheby's ability to obtain valuable consignments for sale, as well as the commission margins achieved on such consignments.\nSotheby's cannot be assured of the amount and quality of property consigned for sale, which may cause significant variability in its results of operations.\nThe amount and quality of property consigned for sale is influenced by a number of factors not within Sotheby's control. Many major consignments, and specifically single-owner sale consignments, often become available as a result of the death or financial or marital difficulties of the owner, all of which are unpredictable and may cause significant variability in Sotheby's results of operations from period to period.\nThe demand for art is unpredictable, which may cause significant variability in Sotheby's results of operations.\nThe demand for art is influenced not only by overall economic conditions, but also by changing trends in the art market as to which collecting categories and artists are most sought after and by the collecting preferences of individual collectors. These conditions and trends are difficult to predict and may adversely impact the ability of Sotheby's to obtain and sell consigned property, potentially causing significant variability in Sotheby's results of operations from period to period.\nSotheby's relies on a small number of clients who make a significant contribution to its revenues, profitability, and operating cash flows.\nSotheby's is a global art services business that caters to a select group of the world's most discerning art collectors. Accordingly, Sotheby's revenues, profitability, and operating cash flows are highly dependent upon its ability to develop and maintain relationships with this small group of clients, as well as the financial strength of these clients.\nTax matters may cause significant variability in Sotheby's results of operations.\nSotheby's operates in many tax jurisdictions throughout the world and the provision for income taxes involves a significant amount of judgment regarding the interpretation of relevant facts and laws in the jurisdictions in which Sotheby's operates. Sotheby's effective income tax rate and recorded tax balances can significantly change between periods due to a number of complex factors including, but not limited to: (i) future changes in applicable laws, including the European Commission\u2019s investigations on illegal state aid and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development project on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting, which may result in changes to long-standing tax principles; (ii) projected levels of taxable income; (iii) changes in the jurisdictional mix of forecasted and/or actual pre-tax income; (iv) increases or decreases to valuation allowances recorded against deferred tax assets; (v) tax audits conducted by various tax authorities; (vi) adjustments to income taxes upon the finalization of income tax returns; (vii) the ability to claim foreign tax credits; (viii) estimates of U.S. and foreign cash, (ix) working capital and investment needs, (x) the repatriation of foreign earnings for which Sotheby's has not previously provided income taxes; and (xi) tax planning strategies.\nSotheby's clients reside in various tax jurisdictions throughout the world. To the extent that there are changes to tax laws or tax reporting obligations in any of these jurisdictions, such changes could adversely impact the ability and/or willingness of clients to purchase or sell works of art through Sotheby's. Additionally, Sotheby's is subject to laws and regulations in many countries involving sales, use, value-added and other indirect taxes which are assessed by various governmental authorities and imposed on certain revenue-producing transactions between Sotheby's and its clients. The application of these laws and regulations to Sotheby's unique business and global client base, and the estimation of any related liabilities, is complex and requires a significant amount of judgment. These indirect tax liabilities are generally not those of Sotheby's unless it fails to collect the correct amount of sales, use, value-added, or other indirect taxes. Failure to collect the correct amount of indirect tax on a transaction may expose Sotheby's to claims from tax authorities.\nThe loss of key personnel could adversely impact Sotheby's ability to compete.\nSotheby's is largely a service business in which the ability of its employees to develop and maintain relationships with potential sellers and buyers of works of art is essential to its success. Moreover, Sotheby's business is unique, making it important to retain key specialists and members of management. Accordingly, Sotheby's business is highly dependent upon its success in attracting and retaining qualified personnel.\nOn November 13, 2015, Sotheby's announced a series of regional voluntary separation incentive programs aimed at reducing headcount and associated compensation costs. Employee transitions under these programs commenced on December 31, 2015 and will occur throughout 2016. Sotheby's currently expects that the programs will result in a net reduction of approximately 5% of its global headcount of approximately 1,600 employees prior to the implementation of the Programs. The loss of employees as a result of these programs could adversely impact Sotheby's ability to compete.\nThe business plans and strategic initiatives being implemented by Sotheby's may not succeed.\nSotheby's future operating results are dependent, in part, on management's success in implementing its business plans and strategic initiatives. The inability of Sotheby's to successfully implement its business plans and strategic initiatives, including the integration of Art Agency, Partners (see Note 24 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements), could result in, among other things, the loss of clients and the impairment of assets. Also, Sotheby's short-term operating results and liquidity could be unfavorably impacted by the implementation of its business plans and strategic initiatives.\nGovernment laws and regulations may restrict or limit Sotheby's business or impact the value of its real estate assets.\nMany of Sotheby's activities are subject to laws and regulations including, but not limited to, import and export regulations, cultural property regulations, data protection and privacy laws, anti-money laundering laws, antitrust laws, copyright and resale royalty laws, laws and regulations involving sales, use, value-added and other indirect taxes, and regulations related to the use of real estate. In addition, Sotheby's is subject to local auction regulations, such as New York City Auction Regulations Subchapter M of Title 6 \u00a7\u00a7 2-121-2-125, et. seq. Such regulations currently do not impose a material impediment to the worldwide business of Sotheby's, but do affect the art market generally. A material adverse change in such regulations, such as the American Royalties Too Act of 2014 introduced in the U.S. Congress, which would impose a 5% resale royalty (with a cap of $35,000) on sales of art through large auction houses, could affect Sotheby's business. Additionally, export and import laws and cultural property ownership laws could affect the availability of certain kinds of property for sale at Sotheby's principal auction locations, increase the cost of moving property to such locations, or expose Sotheby's to legal claims or government inquiries.\nSotheby's joint venture and wholly-owned subsidiary in China are foreign-invested enterprises under Chinese law. As such, enforcement of certain of Sotheby's rights within these entities are subject to approval from the Chinese government, which could limit the ability of the entities to operate and succeed.\nSotheby's operates an equity joint venture with Beijing GeHua Art Company in China and, in 2014, established a wholly-owned subsidiary in China after obtaining the license required to operate as a Foreign-Invested Commercial Enterprise. Because these entities are foreign-invested enterprises under Chinese law, enforcement of certain of Sotheby's rights within these entities is subject to approval from the Chinese government. For example, all changes in ownership and constitution of the joint venture will be subject to approval by the Chinese government, including in the event Sotheby's is seeking to terminate the joint venture agreement, exercise its put option, or wind-up the joint venture. Accordingly, Sotheby's ability to successfully operate its business in China could be constrained by the Chinese government and other unforeseen circumstances.\nSotheby's ability to collect auction receivables may be adversely impacted by buyers from emerging markets, as well as by the banking and foreign currency laws and regulations and judicial systems of the countries in which it operates and in which its clients reside.\nSotheby's operates in 40 countries and has a worldwide client base that has grown in recent years due in part to an increase in the activity of buyers from emerging markets, in particular, China. The collection of auction receivables related to buyers from emerging markets may be adversely impacted by the buyer's lack of familiarity with the auction process and the buyer's financial condition. Sotheby's ability to collect auction receivables may also be adversely impacted by the banking and foreign currency laws and regulations regarding the movement of funds out of certain countries, as well as by Sotheby's ability to enforce its rights as a creditor in jurisdictions where the applicable laws and regulations may be less defined, particularly in emerging markets.\nSotheby's capital allocation and financial policies may impact its liquidity, financial condition, market capitalization and business, and Sotheby's ongoing ability to return capital to its shareholders (and the size and timing of such return) is subject to ongoing business variables.\nThe actions taken by management based on its review of Sotheby's capital allocation and financial policies may impact its current and future liquidity, financial condition, market capitalization, and business. In addition, the amount and timing of any potential return of capital to shareholders depends on various factors, including the amount of excess cash generated by the business in the future, the ability to continue to finance the Finance segment loan portfolio with debt, the business initiatives contemplated and implemented by management, and the amount of capital that may be required to support Sotheby's future liquidity needs, among other factors.\nForeign currency exchange rate movements can significantly impact Sotheby's results of operations and financial condition.\nSotheby's has operations throughout the world. Approximately 53% of Sotheby's total revenues were earned outside of the U.S. in 2015, including 27% of its total revenues earned in the U.K. Additionally, Sotheby's has significant assets and liabilities denominated in the Pound Sterling, the Euro, and the Swiss Franc. Revenues, expenses, gains, and losses recorded in foreign currencies are translated using the monthly average exchange rates prevailing during the period in which they are recognized. Assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Accordingly, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly for the Pound Sterling, the Euro, and the Swiss Franc, can significantly impact Sotheby's results of operations and financial condition.\nSubject to management approval under Sotheby's internal corporate governance policy, Sotheby's may pay a consignor the net sale proceeds from an auction or private sale before payment is collected from the buyer and/or may allow the buyer to take possession of purchased property before payment is received. In these situations, Sotheby's is exposed to losses in the event the buyer does not make payment.\nUnder the standard terms and conditions of its auction and private sales, Sotheby's is not obligated to pay the consignor for property that has not been paid for by the buyer. However, in certain instances and subject to management approval under Sotheby's internal corporate governance policy, the consignor may be paid the net sale proceeds before payment is collected from the buyer while Sotheby's retains possession of the property. In such situations, if the buyer does not make payment, Sotheby's will take title to the property, but could be exposed to losses if the value of the property declines. In certain other situations and subject to management approval under Sotheby's internal corporate governance policy, the buyer is allowed to take possession of purchased property before making payment. In these situations, Sotheby's is liable to the seller for the net sale proceeds whether or not the buyer makes payment and would incur losses in the event of buyer default. See Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information about auction and private sale receivables.\nSotheby's could be exposed to losses in the event of title or authenticity claims.\nThe assessment of property offered for auction or private sale can involve potential claims regarding title and authenticity. Items sold by Sotheby's may be subject to statutory warranties as to title and to a limited guarantee as to authenticity under the Conditions of Sale and Terms of Guarantee that are published in Sotheby's auction sale catalogues and the terms stated in, and the laws applicable to, agreements governing private sale transactions. The authentication of the items offered by Sotheby's is based on scholarship and research, but necessarily requires a degree of judgment from Sotheby's specialists. In the event of a title or authenticity claim against Sotheby's, Sotheby's may have recourse against the seller of the property and may have the benefit of insurance, but a claim could nevertheless expose Sotheby's to losses and to reputational risk.\nAuction guarantees create the risk of loss resulting from the potential inaccurate valuation of art.\nAs discussed above, the market for fine art, decorative art, and jewelry is not a highly liquid trading market and, as a result, the valuation of these items is inherently subjective. Accordingly, Sotheby's is at risk with respect to management's ability to estimate the likely selling prices of property offered with auction guarantees. If management's judgments about the likely selling prices of property offered with auction guarantees prove to be inaccurate, there could be a significant adverse impact on Sotheby's results, financial condition, and liquidity. See Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information related to auction guarantees.\nSotheby's could be exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance by its counterparties in auction guarantee risk and reward sharing arrangements.\nIn certain situations, Sotheby's reduces its financial exposure under auction guarantees through risk and reward sharing arrangements. Sotheby's counterparties to these risk and reward sharing arrangements are typically major international art dealers or major art collectors. Sotheby's could be exposed to losses in the event any of these counterparties do not perform according to the terms of these contractual arrangements. See Note 16 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information related to auction guarantees.\nDemand for art-related financing is unpredictable, which may cause variability in the operating results of Sotheby's Finance segment.\nSotheby's business is, in part, dependent on the demand for art-related financing, which can be significantly influenced by overall economic conditions and by the often unpredictable financial requirements of owners of major art collections. Accordingly, the operating results of Sotheby's Finance segment are subject to variability from period to period.\nThe ability of Sotheby's to realize proceeds from the sale of collateral for Finance segment loans may be delayed or limited.\nIn situations when there are competing claims on the collateral for Finance segment loans and/or when a borrower becomes subject to bankruptcy or insolvency laws, Sotheby's ability to realize proceeds from the sale of its collateral may be limited or delayed.\nThe value of the property held in inventory and the property pledged as collateral for Finance segment loans is subjective and often fluctuates, exposing Sotheby's to losses and significant variability in its results of operations.\nThe market for fine art, decorative art, and jewelry is not a highly liquid trading market. As a result, the valuation of these items is inherently subjective and their realizable value often fluctuates over time. Accordingly, Sotheby's is at risk both as to the realizable value of the property held in inventory and as to the realizable value of the property pledged as collateral for Finance segment loans. In estimating the realizable value of art held in inventory and art pledged as collateral for Finance segment loans, management considers the following complex array of factors: (i) whether the property is expected to be offered at auction or sold privately, and the timing of any such sale; (ii) the supply and demand for the property, taking into account current art market conditions, as well as changing trends as to which collecting categories and artists are most sought after; (iii) recent sale prices achieved for comparable items within a particular collecting category and/or by a particular artist, (iv) the state of the global economy and financial markets; and (v) management's intent and ability to hold the property in order to maximize the realizable value. If there is evidence that the estimated realizable value of a specific item held in inventory is less than its carrying value, a loss is recorded to reflect management's revised estimate of realizable value. In addition, if the estimated realizable value of the property pledged as collateral for a Finance segment loan is less than the corresponding loan balance, management assesses whether it is necessary to record a loss to reduce the carrying value of the loan, after taking into account the ability of the borrower to repay any shortfall between the value of the collateral and the amount of the loan. These factors may cause significant variability in Sotheby's results of operations from period to period.\nThe low rate of historic losses on the Finance segment loan portfolio may not be indicative of future loan loss experience.\nSotheby's has historically incurred minimal losses on the Finance segment loan portfolio. However, despite management's stringent loan underwriting standards, Sotheby's previous loan loss experience may not be indicative of the future performance of the loan portfolio.\nThe collateral supporting the Finance segment loan portfolio is concentrated within certain collecting categories. A material decline in these markets could impair Sotheby's ability to collect the principal and interest owed on certain loans and could require repayments of borrowings on such affected loans under Sotheby's revolving credit facility.\nThe collateral supporting the Finance segment loan portfolio is concentrated within certain collecting categories. Although management believes the Finance segment loan portfolio is sufficiently collateralized due to its current aggregate loan-to-value ratio of 50%, a material decline in these markets could impair Sotheby's ability to collect the principal and interest owed on certain loans. Additionally, the eligibility of individual Finance segment loans included in the borrowing base of Sotheby's revolving credit facility requires a minimum loan-to-value ratio of 60%. A material decline in the value of Finance segment loan collateral could result in an increase in the loan-to-value ratio above 60% for individual loans and could require repayment of a portion of the borrowings associated with such loans.\nSotheby's could be exposed to losses and/or reputational harm as a result of various claims and lawsuits incidental to the ordinary course of its business.\nSotheby's becomes involved in various legal proceedings, lawsuits, and other claims incidental to the ordinary course of its business. Management is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes in these matters, as well as potential ranges of probable or reasonably possible losses. A determination of the amount of losses, if any, to be recorded or disclosed as a result of these contingencies is based on a careful analysis of each individual exposure with, in some cases, the assistance of outside legal counsel. The amount of losses recorded or disclosed for such contingencies may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or a change in settlement strategy.\nSotheby's could be exposed to reputational harm as a result of wrongful actions by certain third parties.\nSotheby's is involved in various business arrangements and ventures with unaffiliated third parties. Wrongful actions by such parties could harm Sotheby's brand and reputation.\nA breach of the security measures protecting Sotheby's global network of information systems and those of certain third-party service providers utilized by Sotheby's could adversely impact its operations, reputation and brand.\nThe protection of client, employee and company data is extremely important to Sotheby's. The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is becoming increasingly demanding and frequently changing in the jurisdictions in which Sotheby's does business. Clients and employees have expectations that Sotheby's will protect their information from cyber-attacks and other security breaches. Sotheby's has implemented systems and processes that are designed to protect personal and company information and to prevent data losses, however, these measures cannot provide absolute security, and Sotheby's systems may be vulnerable to cyber-security breaches such as viruses, break-ins, and similar disruptions from unauthorized intrusions. In addition, Sotheby's is dependent on a global network of information systems to conduct its business and is committed to maintaining a strong infrastructure to secure these systems. As part of its information systems infrastructure, Sotheby's relies increasingly upon third-party service providers to perform services related to its live auction bidding platform, retail wine and other e-commerce, video broadcasting, website content distribution, marketing, and to store, process and transmit information including client, employee and company information. Any failure on Sotheby's part or by these third-party service providers to maintain the security of Sotheby's confidential data and its client and employee personal information could result in business disruption, damage to reputation, financial obligations, lawsuits, sizable fines and costs, and loss of employee and client confidence in Sotheby's, and thus could have a material adverse impact on Sotheby's business and financial condition, and adversely affect results of operations. A significant security breach could require future expenditures to implement additional security measures to protect against new privacy threats or to comply with state, federal and international laws aimed at addressing those threats.\nDue to the nature of its business, valuable works of art are exhibited and stored at Sotheby's facilities around the world. Such works of art could be subject to damage or theft, which could have a material adverse effect on Sotheby's business and reputation.\nValuable works of art are exhibited and stored at Sotheby's facilities around the world. Although Sotheby's maintains state of the art security measures at its premises, valuable artworks may be subject to damage or theft. The damage or theft of valuable property despite these security measures could have a material adverse impact on Sotheby's business and reputation.\nInsurance coverage for artwork may become more difficult to obtain, exposing Sotheby's to losses for artwork in Sotheby's possession.\nSotheby's maintains insurance coverage for the works of art it owns, works of art consigned by clients, and all other property that may be in Sotheby's custody, which are exhibited and stored at Sotheby's facilities around the world. An inability to adequately insure such works of art due to limited capacity of the global art insurance market could, in the future, have a material adverse impact on Sotheby's business.\nSotheby's business continuity plans may not be effective in addressing the impact of unexpected events that could impact its business.\nSotheby's inability to successfully implement its business continuity plans in the wake of an unexpected event, such as an act of God or a terrorist attack occurring in or near one of its major selling and/or sourcing offices and/or any other unexpected event, could disrupt its ability to operate and adversely impact its operations.\nFuture costs and obligations related to Sotheby's U.K. Pension Plan are dependent on unpredictable factors, which may cause significant variability in employee benefit costs.\nFuture costs and obligations related to Sotheby's defined benefit pension plan in the U.K. are heavily influenced by changes in interest rates, investment performance in the debt and equity markets, changes in statutory requirements in the U.K., and actuarial assumptions, each of which is unpredictable and may cause significant variability in Sotheby's employee benefit costs.", "PERMNO": 75316, "SIC": 7389, "TIC": "BID"}
