Risk Factors\nRISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our securities carries a significant degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following risks, as well as the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our historical financial statements and related notes included elsewhere herein, before you decide to purchase our securities. Any one of these risks and uncertainties has the potential to cause material adverse effects on our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results which could cause actual results to differ materially from any forward-looking statements expressed by us and a significant decrease in the value of our common shares and warrants. Refer to \u201cCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\u201d.\nWe may not be successful in preventing the material adverse effects that any of the following risks and uncertainties may cause. These potential risks and uncertainties may not be a complete list of the risks and uncertainties facing us. There may be additional risks and uncertainties that we are presently unaware of, or presently consider immaterial, that may become material in the future and have a material adverse effect on us. You could lose all or a significant portion of your investment due to any of these risks and uncertainties.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have a relatively limited operating history and limited revenues to date and thus are subject to risks of business development and you have no basis on which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective.\nBecause we have a relatively limited operating history and limited revenues to date, you should consider and evaluate our operating prospects in light of the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered by early-stage operating companies in rapidly evolving markets. These risks include:\n\u25cf that we may not have sufficient capital to achieve our growth strategy;\n\u25cf that we may not develop our product and service offerings in a manner that enables us to be profitable and meet our customers\u2019 requirements;\n\u25cf that our growth strategy may not be successful; and\n\u25cf that fluctuations in our operating results will be significant relative to our revenues.\nOur future growth will depend substantially on our ability to address these and the other risks described in this section. If we do not successfully address these risks, our business could be significantly harmed.\nWe have a history of operating losses and our auditors have indicated that there is a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nTo date, we have not been profitable and have incurred significant losses and cash flow deficits. For the fiscal year ended May 31, 2018 and the period from April 17, 2017 (inception) to May 31, 2017, we reported net losses of $8,862 and $672, respectively, and negative cash flow from operating activities of $470,153 and $672, respectively. For the nine months ended February 28, 2019 and 2018, we reported a net loss of $3,095,960 and net income of $4,165, respectively, and negative cash flow from operating activities of $823,847 and $38,299, respectively. As of February 28, 2019, we had an aggregate accumulated deficit of approximately $3,105,494. We anticipate that we will continue to report losses and negative cash flow. As a result of these net losses and cash flow deficits as well as our dependence on private equity and financings, our independent auditors have indicated that there is a substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern in Note 2 of our unaudited consolidated financial statements for the nine-months ended February 28, 2019.\nOur consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty. These adjustments would likely include substantial impairment of the carrying amount of our assets and potential contingent liabilities that may arise if we are unable to fulfill various operational commitments. In addition, the value of our securities, would be greatly impaired. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon generating sufficient cash flow from operations and obtaining additional capital and financing. If our ability to generate cash flow from operations is delayed or reduced and we are unable to raise additional funding from other sources, we may be unable to continue in business. For further discussion about our ability to continue as a going concern and our plan for future liquidity, see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Ability to Continue as a Going Concern.\u201d\nWe are a holding company and depend upon our subsidiaries for our cash flows.\nWe are a holding company. All of our operations are conducted, and almost all of our assets are owned, by our subsidiaries. Consequently, our cash flows and our ability to meet our obligations depend upon the cash flows of our subsidiaries and the payment of funds by these subsidiaries to us in the form of dividends, distributions or otherwise. The ability of our subsidiaries to make any payments to us depends on their earnings, the terms of their indebtedness, including the terms of any credit facilities and legal restrictions. Any failure to receive dividends or distributions from our subsidiaries when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nFuture acquisitions or strategic investments could disrupt our business and harm our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe may in the future explore potential acquisitions of companies or strategic investments to strengthen our business. Even if we identify an appropriate acquisition candidate, we may not be successful in negotiating the terms or financing of the acquisition, and our due diligence may fail to identify all of the problems, liabilities or other shortcomings or challenges of an acquired business.\nAcquisitions involve numerous risks, any of which could harm our business, including:\n\u25cf straining our financial resources to acquire a company;\n\u25cf anticipated benefits may not materialize as rapidly as we expect, or at all;\n\u25cf diversion of management time and focus from operating our business to address acquisition integration challenges;\n\u25cf retention of employees from the acquired company;\n\u25cf cultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into our organization;\n\u25cf integration of the acquired company\u2019s accounting, management information, human resources and other administrative systems;\n\u25cf the need to implement or improve controls, procedures and policies at a business that prior to the acquisition may have lacked effective controls, procedures and policies; and\n\u25cf litigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims from terminated employees, former stockholders or other third parties.\nFailure to appropriately mitigate these risks or other issues related to such strategic investments and acquisitions could result in reducing or completely eliminating any anticipated benefits of transactions, and harm our business generally. Future acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, amortization expenses or the impairment of goodwill, any of which could have a material adverse effect on business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe may require additional funding for our growth plans, and such funding may result in a dilution of your investment.\nWe attempted to estimate our funding requirements in order to implement our growth plans. If the costs of implementing such plans should exceed these estimates significantly or if we come across opportunities to grow through expansion plans which cannot be predicted at this time, and our funds generated from our operations prove insufficient for such purposes, we may need to raise additional funds to meet these funding requirements.\nThese additional funds may be raised by issuing equity or debt securities or by borrowing from banks or other resources. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain any additional financing on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If we fail to obtain additional financing on terms that are acceptable to us, we will not be able to implement such plans fully if at all. Such financing even if obtained, may be accompanied by conditions that limit our ability to pay dividends or require us to seek lenders\u2019 consent for payment of dividends, or restrict our freedom to operate our business by requiring lender\u2019s consent for certain corporate actions.\nFurther, if we raise additional funds by way of a rights offering or through the issuance of new shares, any shareholders who are unable or unwilling to participate in such an additional round of fund raising may suffer dilution in their investment.\nWe may become subject to the requirements of the Investment Company Act, which would limit our business operations and require us to spend significant resources to comply with such act.\nThe Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the \u201cInvestment Company Act\u201d), defines an \u201cinvestment company\u201d as an issuer that is engaged in the business of investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading in securities and owns investment securities having a value exceeding 40 percent of the issuer\u2019s unconsolidated assets, excluding cash items and securities issued by the federal government. While we believe that a reasonable investor would not conclude that we are engaged primarily in investing in securities based on our business plan focused on operating a global virtual reality gaming and fully integrated esports platform, operating corporate owned as well as franchising Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers in United States, and making acquisitions in the active entertainment industry in the United States, the composition of our assets after the Acquisition and Transactions, including our ownership of equity shares in Simplicity Esports LLC and Smaaash Private, could contribute to a conclusion that we meet the threshold definition of an investment company. While the Investment Company Act also has several exclusions and exceptions that we would seek to rely upon to avoid being deemed an investment company, our reliance on any such exclusions or exceptions may be misplaced resulting in violation of the Investment Company Act, the consequences of which can be significant. For example, investment companies that fail to register under the Investment Company Act are prohibited from conducting business in interstate commerce, which includes selling securities or entering into other contracts in interstate commerce. Section 47(b) of the Investment Company Act provides that a contract made, or whose performance involves, a violation of the Investment Company Act is unenforceable by either party unless a court finds that enforcement would produce a more equitable result than non-enforcement. Similarly, a court may not deny rescission to any party seeking to rescind a contract that violates the Investment Company Act, unless the court finds that denial of rescission would produce more equitable result than granting rescission.\nIf we are deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act, Rule 3a-2 of the Investment Company Act provides that inadvertent or transient investment companies will not be treated as investment companies subject to the provisions of the Investment Company Act, provided the issuer has the requisite intent to be engaged in a non-investment business, evidenced by the issuer\u2019s business activities and an appropriate resolution of the issuer\u2019s board of directors, within one year from the commencement of the earlier of (1) the date on which the issuer owns securities and/or cash having a value exceeding 50% of the value of such issuer\u2019s total assets on either a consolidated or unconsolidated basis, or (2) the date on which an issuer owns or proposes to acquire investment securities (as defined in section 3(a) of the Investment Company Act) having a value exceeding 40% of the value of such issuer\u2019s total assets (exclusive of government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. If the Company becomes an inadvertent investment company, and fails to meet the requirements of the transient investment company exemption under Rule 3a-2 of the Investment Company Act, then we will be required to register as an investment company with the SEC.\nWe may not have sufficient capital to fund our ongoing operations, effectively pursue our strategy or sustain our growth initiatives.\nAfter the consummation of the acquisition of Simplicity Esports LLC, our remaining liquidity and capital resources may not be sufficient to allow us to fund our ongoing operations, effectively pursue our strategy or sustain our growth initiatives. If we require additional capital resources, we may seek such funds directly from third party sources; however, we may not be able to obtain sufficient equity capital and/or debt financing from third parties to allow us to fund our expected ongoing operations or we may not be able to obtain such equity capital or debt financing on acceptable terms or conditions. Factors affecting the availability of equity capital or debt financing to us on acceptable terms and conditions include:\n\u25cf Our current and future financial results and position;\n\u25cf the collateral availability of our otherwise unsecured assets;\n\u25cf the market\u2019s, investors and lenders\u2019 view of our industry and products;\n\u25cf the perception in the equity and debt markets of our ability to execute our business plan or achieve our operating results expectations; and\n\u25cf the price, volatility and trading volume and history of our Common Stock.\nIf we are unable to obtain the equity capital or debt financing necessary to fund our ongoing operations, pursue our strategy and sustain our growth initiatives, we may be forced to scale back our operations or our expansion initiatives, and our business and operating results will be materially adversely affected.\nOur growth strategy depends on the availability of suitable locations for our Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers and our ability to open new Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers and operate them profitably.\nA key element of our growth strategy is to extend our brand by opening corporate owned as well as franchising retail Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers in locations in the United States that we believe will provide attractive returns on investment. We have initially identified five sites for potential Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers, in the United States, however, desirable locations for additional Simplicity Esports Gaming Center openings may not be available at an acceptable cost when we identify a particular opportunity for a new Simplicity Esports Gaming Center.\nIn addition, our ability to open new Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers on a timely and cost-effective basis, or at all, is dependent on a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including our ability or the ability of the selected franchisee to:\n\u25cf reach acceptable agreements regarding the lease of the locations;\n\u25cf comply with applicable zoning, licensing, land use and environmental regulations;\n\u25cf raise or have available an adequate amount of cash or currently available financing for construction and opening costs;\n\u25cf timely hire, train and retain the skilled management and other employees necessary to meet staffing needs;\n\u25cf obtain, for acceptable cost, required permits and approvals, including liquor licenses; and\n\u25cf efficiently manage the amount of time and money used to build and open each new Simplicity Esports Gaming Center.\nIf we succeed in opening new Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers on a timely and cost-effective basis, we may nonetheless be unable to attract enough customers to the new Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers because potential customers may be unfamiliar with our Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers or concepts, or our entertainment and menu options might not appeal to them. Our new Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers may not meet or exceed our performance targets, including target cash-on-cash returns. New Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers may even operate at a loss, which could have a significant adverse effect on our overall operating results.\nOur operations of Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers are significantly dependent on changes in public and customer tastes and discretionary spending patterns. Our inability to successfully anticipate customer preferences or to gain popularity for such Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers games may negatively impact our profitability.\nOur success depends significantly on public and customer tastes and preferences, which can be unpredictable. If we are unable to successfully anticipate customer preferences or increase the popularity of the games offered at the Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers, the per capita revenue and overall customer expenditures at the Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers may decrease, and thereby negatively impact our profitability. In response to such developments, we may need to increase our marketing and product development efforts and expenditures, adjust our game or product sale pricing, modify the games themselves, or take other actions, which may further erode our profit margins, or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In particular, we may need to expend considerable cost and effort in carrying out extensive research and development to assess the potential interest in a game, testing and launching new games, and to remain abreast with continually evolving technology and trends, as well as the success and popularity of Simplicity stream team\u2019s casters, influencers and personalities among Simplicity Esports LLC\u2019s dedicated fan base.\nWhile we may incur significant expenditures of this nature, including in the future as we continue to expand our operations, there can be no assurance that any such expenditures or investments by us will yield expected or commensurate returns or results, within a reasonable or anticipated time, or at all.\nThe nature of our business exposes us to negative publicity or customer complaints, including in relation to, among other things, accidents, injuries or thefts at the Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers, or health and safety concerns arising from improper use of our game equipment or at our food and beverage venues.\nOur business inherently exposes us to negative publicity or customer complaints as a result of accidents, injuries, or in extreme cases, deaths, arising from instances of air-borne, water-borne or food-borne contagion or illness, food contamination, spoilage, tampering, equipment failure, improper use of our equipment, fire, explosion, terrorist attacks or civil riots, and other safety or security issues, such as kidnapping, or associated risks arising from other actual or perceived non-compliance with safety, quality or service standards or norms in relation to the various game, entertainment and food and beverage attractions at the Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers. Even isolated or sporadic incidents or accidents may have a negative impact on our brand image and reputation, and the Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers\u2019 or games\u2019 or our own popularity with customers. The considerable expansion of social media in recent years has compounded the effect of any potential negative publicity.\nWe cannot guarantee that its employee training, internal controls and other precautions will be sufficient to prevent any such occurrence at the Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers, in relation to our Simplicity global virtual reality gaming and fully integrated esports platform, or to control or mitigate any negative consequences. In addition, we or our franchisees rely on third-party security and housekeeping staff for certain non-core functions, as well as certain technology vendors and partners. Although we monitors vendors and partners and, in certain cases, may have a contractual indemnity or recourse in case of any default on their part, our ability to assure a safe and satisfactory experience to our customers is necessarily limited to the extent of our or our franchisees\u2019, dependence on third parties, from time to time. Moreover, we may not be able to distance or insulate ourselves from any adverse publicity or reputational damage arising from any act, omission or negligence on the part of a vendor or other third party, which may negatively affect a customer\u2019s experience at any of the Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers.\nWe or our franchisees may not be able to operate in the United States, or obtain and maintain licenses and permits necessary for such operation, in compliance with laws, regulations and other requirements, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nEach Simplicity Esports Gaming Center will be subject to licensing and regulation by alcoholic beverage control, amusement, health, sanitation, safety, building code and fire agencies in the country, state, county and/or municipality in which the Simplicity Esports Gaming Center is located. In the United States, each Simplicity Esports Gaming Center with a restaurant or bar will be required to obtain a license to sell alcoholic beverages on the premises from a state authority and, in certain locations, county and municipal authorities. Typically, licenses must be renewed annually and may be revoked or suspended for cause at any time. In some states, the loss of a license for cause with respect to one Simplicity Esports Gaming Center may lead to the loss of licenses at all Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers in that state and could make it more difficult to obtain additional licenses in that state. Alcoholic beverage control regulations relate to numerous aspects of the daily operations of each Simplicity Esports Gaming Center, including minimum age of patrons and employees, hours of operation, advertising, wholesale purchasing, inventory control and handling and storage and dispensing of alcoholic beverages. Our failure or a failure by a franchisee in obtaining and maintaining the required licenses, permits and approvals at any one Simplicity Esports Gaming Center could impact the continuing operations of existing Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers, or delay or prevent the opening of new Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers. Although we do not anticipate any material difficulties occurring in the future, the failure to receive or retain a liquor license, or any other required permit or license, in a particular location, or to continue to qualify for, or renew licenses, could have a material adverse effect on operations and our ability to obtain such a license or permit in other locations.\nAs a result of operating certain entertainment games and attractions, including skill-based games that offer redemption prizes, the Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers in the United States are subject to amusement licensing and regulation by the countries, states, provinces, counties and municipalities in which our Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers are located. These laws and regulations can vary significantly by country, state, province, county, and municipality and, in some jurisdictions, may require us to modify our business operations or alter the mix of redemption games and simulators we offer. Moreover, as more states in the United States and local communities implement legalized gambling, the laws and corresponding enabling regulations may also be applicable to our redemption games and regulators may create new licensing requirements, taxes or fees, or restrictions on the various types of redemption games we offer. Furthermore, other states, provinces, counties and municipalities may make changes to existing laws to further regulate legalized gaming and illegal gambling. Adoption of these laws, or adverse interpretation of existing laws, after we have established a Simplicity Esports Gaming Center in the jurisdiction could require the existing center in these jurisdictions to alter the mix of games, modify certain games, change the mix of prizes that we may offer or terminate the use of specific games, any of which could adversely affect our operations.\nWe are also subject to laws and regulations governing our relationship with our employees, including those related to minimum wage requirements, exempt status, overtime, health insurance mandates, working and safety conditions, immigration status requirements, child labor, and non-discrimination. Additionally, changes in federal labor laws, including card verification regulations, could result in portions of our workforce being subjected to greater organized labor influence, which could result in an increase to our labor costs. A significant portion of Simplicity Esports Gaming Center personnel will be paid at minimum wage rates established by federal, state and municipal law. Increases in the minimum wage result in higher labor costs, which may be only partially offset by price increases and operational efficiencies.\nWe are also subject to the rules and regulations of the Federal Trade Commission and various state laws regulating the offer and sale of franchises. The Federal Trade Commission and various state laws require that we furnish a franchise disclosure document containing certain information to prospective franchisees, and a number of states require registration of the franchise disclosure document with state authorities. State laws that regulate the franchisor-franchisee relationship presently exist in a substantial number of states, and bills have been introduced in Congress from time to time that would provide for federal regulation of the franchisor-franchisee relationship. The state laws often limit, among other things, the duration and scope of non-competition provisions, the ability of a franchisor to terminate or refuse to renew a franchise and the ability of a franchisor to designate sources of supply. We shall endeavor to make sure that any franchise disclosure document we provide, together with any applicable state versions or supplements, and franchising procedures, comply in all material respects with both the Federal Trade Commission guidelines and all applicable state laws regulating franchising in those states in which we have offered franchises.\nIf we and our franchisees fail to comply with such laws and regulations, we may be subject to various sanctions and/or penalties and fines or may be required to cease operations until we achieve compliance, which could have an adverse effect on our business and our financial results.\nOur growth through franchising may not occur as rapidly as we currently anticipate and may be subject to additional risks.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we will continue to seek franchisees to operate Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers in certain strategic domestic locations or venues. We believe that our ability to recruit, retain and contract with qualified franchisees will be increasingly important to our operations as we expand. Our franchisees are dependent upon the availability of adequate sources of financing in order to meet their development obligations. Such financing may not be available to our franchisees, or only available upon disadvantageous terms. Our franchise strategy may not enhance our results of operations.\nExpanding through franchising exposes our business and brand to risks because the quality of the franchised operations will be beyond our immediate control, including risks associated with our confidential information, intellectual properties (including trademarks) and brand reputation. Even if we have contractual remedies to cause franchisees to maintain operational standards, enforcing those remedies may require litigation and therefore our image and reputation may suffer, unless and until such litigation is successfully concluded.\nWe could face liability from or as a result of our franchisees.\nVarious state and federal laws will govern the relationship between us and our franchisees and the potential sale of a franchise. If we fail to comply with these laws, we could be liable for damages to franchisees and fines or other penalties. A franchisee or government agency may bring legal action against us based on the franchisee/franchisor relationship. Also, under the franchise business model, we may face claims and liabilities based on vicarious liability, joint-employer liability, or other theories or liabilities. Such legal actions could result in expensive litigation with our franchisees or government agencies that could adversely affect both our profit and our important relations with our franchisees. In addition, regulatory or legal developments could result in changes to laws or the franchisor/franchisee relationship that could negatively impact the franchise business model and, accordingly, our profit.\nWe may not be able to compete favorably in the highly competitive out-of-home and home-based entertainment market in the United States, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nThe out-of-home entertainment market in the United States is highly competitive. Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers that we or our franchisees operate will compete for customers\u2019 discretionary entertainment dollars with providers of out-of-home entertainment, including localized attraction facilities such as movie theatres, sporting events, bowling alleys, sports activity centers, arcades and entertainment centers, nightclubs and restaurants as well as theme parks. Many of the entities operating these businesses are larger and have significantly greater financial resources, a greater number of locations, have been in business longer, have greater name and brand recognition and are better established in the local markets where Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers are planned to be located. As a result, they may be able to invest greater resources than we can in attracting customers and succeed in attracting customers who would otherwise come to the Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers we or our franchisees operate. In the United States, the legalization of casino gambling in geographic areas near any future Simplicity Esports Gaming Center would create the possibility for adult entertainment alternatives, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. We will also face competition from local, regional and national establishments that offer entertainment experiences similar to us. Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers we or our franchisees operate will also face competition from increasingly sophisticated home-based forms of entertainment, such as internet and video gaming and home movie streaming and delivery. If we fail to compete favorably in the competitive out-of-home and home-based entertainment markets it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur senior management team has limited experience in establishing, operating, licensing rights to and franchising entertainment centers and related products.\nThe members of our senior management team have extensive backgrounds in finance and the management of financial services businesses, however, they have limited prior experience in establishing, operating, licensing rights to and franchising entertainment centers. We will need to expand our management team, to include individuals with expertise in establishing and operating entertainment centers as well as individuals with expertise in product licensing and franchise operations. If we are unable to recruit professionals with acceptable backgrounds in establishing and operating entertainment centers and with backgrounds in product licensing and financing, we may not be able to pursue our growth strategy which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur success depends upon our ability to recruit and retain qualified management and operating personnel at Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers.\nWe and our franchisees must attract, retain and motivate a sufficient number of qualified management and operating personnel in order to maintain consistency in our service, hospitality, quality and atmosphere of our Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers. Qualified management and operating personnel are typically in high demand. If we and our franchisees are unable to attract and retain a satisfactory number of qualified management and operating personnel, labor shortages could delay the planned openings of new Simplicity Esports Gaming Centers which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur business and operations are subject to various risks relating to the acquisitions of target companies. Our inability to complete and successfully integrate the future acquisition targets may affect our growth strategy, market share, profitability or competitive position.\nWe plan to expand through future acquisitions of companies along with organic growth. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully integrate the acquired businesses into our existing operations as planned. We may be adversely impacted by liabilities that we assume from these acquisitions, including known and unknown obligations, intellectual property or other assets, terminated employees, current or former clients, or other third parties, and we may fail to identify or adequately assess the magnitude of certain liabilities, shortcomings or other circumstances prior to the acquisitions, which could result in unexpected legal or regulatory exposure, unfavorable accounting treatment, unexpected increases in taxes, or other adverse effects on our business.\nOur insurance coverage may not adequately protect us against all future risks, which may adversely affect our business and prospects.\nWe maintain insurance coverage, including for fire, acts of god and perils, terrorism, burglary, money, loss of profit, fidelity guarantee, fixed glass and sanitary fitting, electronic equipment, machinery breakdown, portable equipment, sign boards, commercial general liability, marine transit, and directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance, as well as employee health and medical insurance, with standard exclusions in each instance. While we maintain insurance in amounts that we consider reasonably sufficient for a business of our nature and scale, with insurers that we consider reliable and credit worthy, we may face losses and liabilities that are uninsurable by their nature, or that are not covered, fully or at all, under our existing insurance policies. Moreover, coverage under such insurance policies would generally be subject to certain standard or negotiated exclusions or qualifications and, therefore, any future insurance claims by us may not be honored by our insurers in full, or at all. In addition, our premium payments under our insurance policies may require a significant investment by us.\nTo the extent that we suffers loss or damage for which we did not obtain insurance, that is not covered by insurance or that exceeds our insurance coverage, the loss will have to be borne by us and our business, cash flow, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be adversely affected.\nChanges in laws or regulations, or a failure to comply with any laws and regulations, may adversely affect our business, investments and results of operations.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations enacted by national, regional and local governments. In particular, we will be required to comply with certain SEC and other legal requirements. Compliance with, and monitoring of, applicable laws and regulations may be difficult, time consuming and costly. Those laws and regulations and their interpretation and application may also change from time to time and those changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, investments and results of operations. In addition, a failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations, as interpreted and applied, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe are dependent upon our executive officers and directors and their departure could adversely affect our ability to operate.\nOur operations are dependent upon a relatively small group of individuals and, in particular, our executive officers and directors. We believe that our success depends on the continued service of our executive officers and directors. In addition, our executive officers and directors are not required to commit any specified amount of time to our affairs and, accordingly, will have conflicts of interest in allocating management time among various business activities, including identifying potential business combinations and monitoring the related due diligence. We do not have an employment agreement with, or key-man insurance on the life of, any of our directors or executive officers. The unexpected loss of the services of one or more of our directors or executive officers could have a detrimental effect on us.\nOur executive officers, directors, security holders and their respective affiliates may have competitive pecuniary interests that conflict with our interests.\nWe have not adopted a policy that expressly prohibits our directors, executive officers, security holders or affiliates from having a direct or indirect pecuniary or financial interest in any investment to be acquired or disposed of by us or in any transaction to which we are a party or have an interest. Nor do we have a policy that expressly prohibits any such persons from engaging for their own account in business activities of the types conducted by us. Accordingly, such persons or entities may have a conflict between their interests and ours.\nWe are an emerging growth company within the meaning of the Securities Act, and if we take advantage of certain exemptions from disclosure requirements available to emerging growth companies, this could make our securities less attractive to investors and may make it more difficult to compare our performance with other public companies.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d within the meaning of the Securities Act, as modified by the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the \u201cJOBS Act\u201d), and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor internal controls attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. As a result, our stockholders may not have access to certain information they may deem important. We could be an emerging growth company for up to five years, although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier, including if the market value of our Common Stock held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of any June 30 before that time, in which case we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the following December 31. We cannot predict whether investors will find our securities less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our securities less attractive as a result of our reliance on these exemptions, the trading prices of our securities may be lower than they otherwise would be, there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the trading prices of our securities may be more volatile.\nFurther, Section 102(b)(1) of the JOBS Act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies (that is, those that have not had a Securities Act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d) are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards. The JOBS Act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to non-emerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable. We have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies, we, as an emerging growth company, can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard. This may make comparison of our financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used.\nCompliance obligations under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act may require substantial financial and management resources.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we evaluate and report on our system of internal controls beginning with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended May 31, 2019. As long as we remain an emerging growth company, we will not be required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement on our internal control over financial reporting.\nProvisions in our third amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, and Delaware law may inhibit a takeover of us, which could limit the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for our Common Stock and could entrench management.\nOur third amended and restated certificate of incorporation, as amended, contains provisions that may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals that stockholders may consider to be in their best interests. These provisions include a staggered board of directors and the ability of the board of directors to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred shares, which may make more difficult the removal of management and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our securities.\nIf we fail to keep pace with changing industry technology and consumer preferences, we will be at a competitive disadvantage.\nThe Simplicity products and services compete within industries that are characterized by swiftly changing technology, evolving industry standards, frequent new and enhanced product introductions, rapidly changing consumer preferences and product obsolescence. In order to continue to compete effectively, we need to respond quickly to technological changes and to understand their impact on customers\u2019 preferences. We may take significant time and resources to respond to these technological changes and changes in consumer preferences. Our business and results of operations may be negatively impacted if our products and services fail to keep pace with these changes.\nA failure or unanticipated delay in securing any necessary or desired certification for Simplicity Esports LLC\u2019s products from government or regulatory organizations could impair distribution of Simplicity Esports LLC\u2019s products and materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn order for certain Simplicity Esports LLC\u2019s products to be commercially distributed for use in certain target markets, they must first be certified by certain government or regulatory organizations, such as the Underwriters Laboratory (UL) in the U.S. and the Technischer \u00dcberwachungs-Verein (T\u00dcV) and Conforme Europ\u00e9ene (CE) in Europe. A failure or unanticipated delay in securing any necessary or desired certification for the Simplicity Esports LLC\u2019s products could impair sales of Simplicity Esports LLC\u2019s products and materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nVarious product safety laws and governmental regulations applicable to the distributor of Simplicity Esports LLC\u2019s products may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur distribution of Simplicity Esports LLC\u2019s products will be subject to numerous federal, state, provincial, local and foreign laws and regulations, including laws and regulations with respect to product safety, including regulations enforced by the United States Consumer Products Safety Commission. We and our franchisees could incur costs in complying with these regulations and, if they fail to comply, could incur significant penalties. A failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, or concerns about product safety, may also lead to a recall or post-manufacture repair of selected Simplicity Esports LLC\u2019s products, resulting in the rejection of the products by our franchisees, lost sales, increased customer service and support costs, and costly litigation.\nRisks Relating to Our Esports Business\nOur esports business faces intense and wide-ranging competition, which may have a material negative effect on our business and results of operations.\nThe success of an esports business, like the esports business of Simplicity Esports LLC, is dependent upon the performance and/or popularity of its teams. Simplicity Esports LLC\u2019s teams compete, in varying respects and degrees, with other live sporting events, and with sporting events delivered over television networks, radio, the Internet and online services, mobile applications and other alternative sources. For example, our esports teams compete for attendance, viewership and advertising with a wide range of alternatives available in major metropolitan areas. During some or all of the esports season, our teams face competition, in varying respects and degrees, from professional and collegiate basketball, hockey, baseball, football, and soccer, among others.\nAs a result of the large number of options available, we face strong competition for the sports and gaming fan. We must compete with other esports teams, traditional sports teams and sporting events, in varying respects and degrees, including on the basis of the quality of the teams we field, their success in the leagues, tournaments and genres in which they compete, our ability to provide an entertaining environment at any esports games that we host at our centers, prices charged for tickets and the viewing availability of our teams on multiple media alternatives. Given the nature of esports and sports in general, there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively, including with companies that may have greater resources than we have, and as a consequence, our business and results of operations may be materially negatively affected by competition.\nOur businesses are substantially dependent on the continued popularity and/or competitive success of Simplicity Esports LLC\u2019s teams, which cannot be assured.\nOur future financial results will be dependent on the Simplicity teams becoming and remaining popular with our fan base and, in varying degrees, on the team achieving in-game success, which can generate fan enthusiasm, resulting in sustained ticket and merchandise sales during the season. Furthermore, success in the regular season at certain tournaments may qualify one or more of our esports teams for participation in post-season playoffs, which provides us with additional revenue from prize money by increasing the number of games played by our sports teams and, more importantly, by generating increased excitement and interest in our esports teams, which can improve attendance in subsequent seasons. There can be no assurance that any of our esports teams, will develop a significant fan base, maintain continued popularity or compete in post-season play in the future.\nThe actions of the various esports leagues and tournaments may have a material negative effect on our business and results of operations.\nThe governing bodies of the various esports leagues and tournaments, under certain circumstances, can take actions that they deem to be in the best interests of their respective leagues or tournaments, which may not necessarily be consistent with maximizing our results of operations and which could affect our esports teams in ways that are different than the impact on other esports teams. For example they can take actions relating to the rights to telecast the games of league members or tournament participants, including the Simplicity team, licensing of the rights to produce and sell merchandise bearing the logos and/or other intellectual property of our esports teams and the leagues or tournaments, and the internet-based activities of our esports teams. Certain of these decisions by the esports leagues and tournaments could have a material negative effect on our business and results of operations. From time to time, we may disagree with or challenge actions that the leagues or tournaments take or the power and authority they assert.\nWe may be unable to effectively manage the growth in the scope and complexity of our business, including our expansion into the esports business which is untested and into adjacent business opportunities.\nOur future success depends, in part, on our ability to manage our expanded business, including through the acquisition of Simplicity, and our aspirations for continued expansion. We intend to dedicate resources to a new business model that is largely untested, as is the case with esports. We do not know to what extent our future expansions will be successful. Further, even if successful, the growth of our business could create significant challenges for our management, operational, and financial resources, and could increase existing strain on, and divert focus from, our core businesses. If not managed effectively, this growth could result in the over-extension of our operating infrastructure, and our management systems, information technology systems, and internal controls and procedures may not be adequate to support this growth. Failure to adequately manage our growth in any of these ways may cause damage to our brand, damage our reputation or otherwise negatively impact our business.\nOur industry is subject to rapid technological change, and if we do not adapt to, and appropriately allocate our resources among, emerging technologies and business models, our business may be negatively impacted.\nTechnology changes rapidly in the interactive entertainment industry. We must continually anticipate and adapt our products, services and business models to emerging technologies and delivery platforms in order to stay competitive. Forecasting our revenues and profitability for these new products, services and business models is inherently uncertain and volatile, and if we invest in the development of interactive entertainment products or services incorporating a new technology or for a new platform that does not achieve significant commercial success, whether because of competition or otherwise, we may not recover the often substantial \u201cup front\u201d costs of developing and marketing those products and services, or recover the opportunity cost of diverting management and financial resources away from other products or services. Further, our competitors may adapt to an emerging technology or business model more quickly or effectively than we do, creating products that are technologically superior to ours, more appealing to consumers, or both.\nIf, on the other hand, we elect not to pursue the development of products or services incorporating a new technology or for new platforms, or otherwise elect not to pursue new business models, that achieve significant commercial success, it may have adverse consequences. It may take significant time and resources to shift product development resources to that technology, platform or business model, as the case may be, and may be more difficult to compete against existing products and services incorporating that technology or for that platform or against companies using that business model.\nWe may encounter difficulties in integrating Simplicity Esports LLC\u2019s esports businesses or otherwise realizing the anticipated benefits of the transaction.\nAs part of our business strategy, from time to time, we acquire, make investments in, or enter into strategic alliances and joint ventures with, complementary businesses, such as the acquisition of the Simplicity esports business. The acquisition of Simplicity Esports LLC involves significant risks and uncertainties, including: (i) the potential for Simplicity Esports LLC\u2019s business to underperform relative to our expectations and the acquisition price, (ii) the potential for Simplicity Esports LLC\u2019s business to cause our financial results to differ from expectations in any given period, or over the longer-term, (iii) unexpected tax consequences from the acquisition, or the tax treatment of Simplicity Esports LLC\u2019s business\u2019s operations going forward, giving rise to incremental tax liabilities that are difficult to predict, (iv) difficulty in integrating Simplicity Esports LLC\u2019s business, its operations and its employees in an efficient and effective manner, (v) any unknown liabilities or internal control deficiencies assumed as part of the acquisition, and (vi) the potential loss of key employees of Simplicity Esports LLC\u2019s businesses. Further, the transaction may involve the risk that our senior management\u2019s attention will be excessively diverted from our other operations, the risk that the gaming industry does not evolve as anticipated and that any intellectual property or personnel skills acquired do not prove to be those needed for our future success, and the risk that our strategic objectives, cost savings or other anticipated benefits are otherwise not achieved.\nOur business may be harmed if our licensing partners, or other third parties with whom we do business, act in ways that put our brand at risk.\nWe anticipate that our business partners shall be given access to sensitive and proprietary information or control over our intellectual property in order to provide services and support to our teams. These third parties may misappropriate our information or intellectual property and engage in unauthorized use of it or otherwise act in a way that places our brand at risk. The failure of these third parties to provide adequate services and technologies, the failure of third parties to adequately maintain or update their services and technologies or the misappropriation or misuse of this information or intellectual property could result in a disruption to our business operations or an adverse effect on our reputation, and may negatively impact our business.\nOur business is highly dependent on the success and availability of video game platforms manufactured by third parties.\nWe expect to derive a substantial portion of our revenues from esports games played on game platforms manufactured by third parties, such as Sony\u2019s PS4, Microsoft\u2019s Xbox One, and Nintendo\u2019s Wii U and Switch, and PCs. The success of our business will be driven in large part by our ability to accurately predict which platforms will be successful in the marketplace. We also rely on the availability of an adequate supply of these video game consoles and the continued support for these consoles by their manufacturers. We may be required to commit significant resources well in advance of the anticipated introduction of a new platform. If increased costs are not offset by higher revenues and other cost efficiencies, our business could be negatively impacted. If the platforms for which we invested resources do not attain significant market acceptance, we may not be able to recover our costs, which could be significant.\nThe games we support are subject to scrutiny regarding the appropriateness of their content. If the publishers and distributors we partner with fail to receive their target ratings for certain titles, or if retailers refuse to sell such titles due to what they perceive to be objectionable content, it could have a negative impact on our business.\nConsole and PC games are subject to ratings by the Entertainment Software Rating Board (the \u201cESRB\u201d), a self-regulatory body based in the U.S. that provides U.S. and Canadian consumers of interactive entertainment software with ratings information, including information on the content in such software, such as violence, nudity or sexual content, along with an assessment of the suitability of the content for certain age groups. Certain other countries have also established content rating systems as prerequisites for product sales in those countries. In addition, certain stores use other ratings systems, such as Apple\u2019s use of its proprietary \u201cApp Rating System\u201d and Google Play\u2019s use of the International Age Rating Coalition (IARC) rating system. If the software publishers that supply our games are unable to obtain the ratings they have targeted for their products, it could have a negative impact on our business. In some instances, the software publishers and developers may be required to modify their products to comply with the requirements of the rating systems, which could delay or disrupt the release of any given product, or may prevent its sale altogether in certain territories, which would limited its availability for use in the games that our teams play.\nWe will depend on servers to operate our games with online features. If we were to lose server functionality for any reason, our business may be negatively impacted.\nOur business at our game centers will rely on the continuous operation of servers, some of which are owned and operated by third parties. Although we shall strive to maintain more than sufficient server capacity, and provide for active redundancy in the event of limited hardware failure, any broad-based catastrophic server malfunction, a significant service-disrupting attack or intrusion by hackers that circumvents security measures, a failure of disaster recovery service or the failure of a company on which we are relying for server capacity to provide that capacity for whatever reason would likely degrade or interrupt the functionality of our games with online features, and could prevent the operation of such games altogether, any of which could result in the loss of sales for, or in, such games.\nWe also rely on networks operated by third parties, such as the PlayStation Network, Xbox Live and Steam, for the functionality of the games we use which have online features. An extended interruption to any of these services could adversely affect our ability to operate our games with online features, negatively impacting our business.\nFurther, insufficient server capacity could also negatively impact our business. Conversely, if we overestimate the amount of server capacity required by our business, we may incur unnecessary additional operating costs.\nRisks Related to Smaaash Private\nSmaaash Private has significant indebtedness and the imposition of certain restrictive covenants in Smaaash Private debt financing arrangements may increase Smaaash Private\u2019s susceptibility to interest rate fluctuations, adversely impact Smaaash Private\u2019s financial condition and results of operations, as well as restrict Smaaash Private\u2019s operational flexibility.\nAs on December 31, 2017, Smaaash Private\u2019s outstanding indebtedness on a consolidated basis aggregated to $44.10 million, including $44.05 million of secured debt and $0.05 million of unsecured debt, Smaaash Private may incur additional indebtedness in the future.\nSmaaash Private\u2019s significant indebtedness and the imposition of certain restrictive covenants in Smaaash Private\u2019s debt financing arrangements may increase Smaaash Private\u2019s susceptibility to interest rate fluctuations, adversely impact Smaaash Private\u2019s financial condition and results of operations, as well as restricting Smaaash Private\u2019s operational flexibility.\nThe possible implications of Smaaash Private\u2019s significant indebtedness may include, but are not limited to, the following:\n- a portion of Smaaash Private\u2019s cash flows may be used towards repayment of Smaaash Private\u2019s existing debt, which will reduce the availability of cash to fund Smaaash Private\u2019s working capital requirements, capital expenditures, planned expansions or acquisitions or other strategic objectives, and general corporate purposes;\n- Smaaash Private\u2019s ability to obtain additional funding in the future at reasonable, or less restrictive, terms may be restricted;\n- fluctuations in market interest rates may affect the cost of Smaaash Private\u2019s borrowings, as Smaaash Private\u2019s loans are, currently as well as typically, at variable interest rates;\n- Smaaash Private\u2019s ability to declare dividends, while any actual payments are due under the terms of Smaaash Private\u2019s borrowings;\n- Smaaash Private may be more vulnerable to economic downturns;\n- Smaaash Private\u2019s ability to withstand competitive pressures may be limited;\n- Smaaash Private may have reduced operational flexibility in responding to business, regulatory and economic conditions and developments; and\n- Smaaash Private\u2019s requirement to obtain lenders\u2019 consents for various activities, including, but not limited to, any change in control or ownership of Smaaash Private.\nSmaaash Private is continually expanding and so may need to continually raise capital. If Smaaash Private is unable to raise capital on commercially favorable terms, including due to Smaaash Private\u2019s high debt-equity ratio, Smaaash Private\u2019s growth trajectory might be affected.\nSmaaash Private is in the process of expansion and may need additional capital despite the fact that it has a significant portion of debt on its books. Due, in part, to Smaaash Private\u2019s significant debt there are various reasons for it not being able to raise capital on commercially favorable terms including, but not limited to (i) high debt to equity ratio, (ii) trends in global capital and credit markets, and (iii) existing debt terms. Smaaash Private\u2019s inability to maintain or obtain sufficient cash flow, credit facilities and other sources of funds, in a timely manner, or at all, to meet Smaaash Private\u2019s expansion strategy requirements could adversely affect Smaaash Private\u2019s growth trajectory.\nThe high fixed cost structure of Smaaash Private\u2019s operations can result in significantly lower margins if Smaaash Private\u2019s revenues should decline, which may adversely affect Smaaash Private\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nSmaaash Private\u2019s total aggregate expenditure was $18.9 million for fiscal year 2017, the most recent year for which data is available to us. A large proportion of Smaaash Private\u2019s expenses are fixed expenses, including the cost of full-time employees, fixed rentals, interest costs, security and insurance, which do not vary significantly with retail traffic at Smaaash Centers. These expenses may continue to increase, in the aggregate, from year to year, particularly as Smaaash Private continue to expand its network of Smaaash Centers in the future. In the event that Smaaash Private\u2019s expenses increase at a faster rate than Smaaash Private\u2019s revenues and if Smaaash Private is unable to rationalize Smaaash Private\u2019s costs or realize efficiencies of scale, Smaaash Private may not be able to pass on such costs to Smaaash Private\u2019s customers or offset its expenses. In such case, Smaaash Private may experience a decline in its profit margins and, in general, an adverse impact on its business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nSmaaash Private has significant capital expenditure requirements, and inability to raise adequate financing on commercially acceptable terms may limit Smaaash Private\u2019s strategic initiatives and growth prospects.\nSmaaash Private\u2019s business is inherently capital intensive. Smaaash Private\u2019s total capital expenditure was $19.23 million in fiscal year 2017, the most recent year for which data is available to us. Smaaash Private is required to undertake capital investments on a regular basis, to introduce new games and entertainment options, or to improve existing games and entertainment options and, particularly, when Smaaash Private opens new Smaaash Centers. In addition, Smaaash Private must incur expenditures to maintain and improve supporting or complementary infrastructure and services at Smaaash Centers, including Smaaash Private\u2019s food and beverage venues, parking and other facilities. The actual amounts and timing of Smaaash Private\u2019s future capital expenditure may differ from Smaaash Private\u2019s estimates, from time to time, including on account of, among other things, availability of land for future expansion, interest rates, future cash flows being less than Smaaash Private had estimated, fluctuations in currency exchange rates or commodity prices, unforeseen delays or cost overruns on Smaaash Private\u2019s part or on the part of any of Smaaash Private\u2019s equipment or technology supply or other vendors or partners, technological advances, design changes, inability to obtain or delay in obtaining requisite regulatory approvals or third party consents such as from lenders or lessors or others, unanticipated expenses, delays in Smaaash Private\u2019s payments from corporate customers in Smaaash Private\u2019s product sales business or issues with the credit worthiness of such customers, general economic conditions, market developments and new opportunities or challenges in the industry, or in the geographies in which Smaaash Private operate. Smaaash Private\u2019s capital expenditures and investments may rise in the future, given Smaaash Private\u2019s expansion plans as well as the scope of Smaaash Private\u2019s existing operations. The financing required by Smaaash Private for such capital expenditures and investments may not be available to it on commercially acceptable terms or at all, or Smaaash Private\u2019s ability to seek additional financing in the future may be restricted due to the terms of Smaaash Private\u2019s existing or future borrowings, or regulatory constraints on equity or debt capital raising, or a range of macroeconomic factors, including interest rates.\nSmaaash Private\u2019s inability to raise adequate financing on commercially acceptable terms, or at all, in the future may limit Smaaash Private\u2019s strategic initiatives and growth prospects. In addition, there can be no assurance that Smaaash Private\u2019s capital investment will yield the planned returns at any time in the future, at expected rates, or at all. In any such event, Smaaash Private\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects may be adversely affected.\nSmaaash Private, as well as its affiliated companies, have unsecured borrowings from time to time, which may be repayable on demand, including on the occurrence of an event of default in the terms of such financing agreements. Any unexpected calls for repayment of a significant amount of such borrowings may impact Smaaash Private\u2019s ability to manage its debt service obligations.\nSmaaash Private, as well as Smaaash Private\u2019s affiliates, have unsecured borrowings from time to time, which may be repayable on demand, including on the occurrence of an actual or alleged event of default. Any unexpected calls for repayment of a significant amount of such borrowings may impact Smaaash Private\u2019s ability to manage its debt service obligations. Any failure to service such indebtedness or comply with any obligations under such financing agreements may cause it to incur penalty interest or may result in the termination of one or more of Smaaash Private\u2019s credit facilities or acceleration or cross-acceleration of payments under such credit facilities, as well as the declaration of an event of default or cross-default, which may adversely affect Smaaash Private\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operation and prospects.\nSmaaash Private has a relatively limited operating history and may not be able to sustain Smaaash Private\u2019s growth levels in the future.\nSmaaash Private commenced commercial operations at Smaaash Private\u2019s first Smaaash Center in Mumbai in November 2012, and all of Smaaash Private\u2019s other Smaaash Centers have commenced commercial operations within the last three fiscal years. Smaaash Private\u2019s first international Smaaash Center, in the Mall of America, in Minnesota, U.S.A. was opened in December 2016. Consequently, Smaaash Private currently has relatively limited operating experience, particularly, overseas, and may encounter challenges in further expansion, including its proposed overseas expansion.\nConsequently, it may be difficult to evaluate Smaaash Private\u2019s past performance and prospects. Smaaash Private may not be able to sustain any historical growth rates in the future, and may not be able to leverage its experience in its existing markets in order to grow Smaaash Private\u2019s business in new markets.\nSmaaash Private has entered, and may continue to enter, into certain related party transactions. There can be no assurance that Smaaash Private could not have achieved more favorable terms, if such transactions had not been entered into with related parties, or that Smaaash Private will be able to maintain existing terms in the future, where the terms are or may be more favorable than if the transactions had not been entered into with related parties.\nSmaaash Private has entered into various transactions with related parties. While Smaaash Private believes that all such transactions have been conducted on an arm\u2019s length basis and contain commercially reasonable terms, Smaaash Private may have been able to achieve more favorable terms had such transactions been entered into with unrelated parties. It is also likely that Smaaash Private may enter into related party transactions in the future. Although all material related party transactions that Smaaash Private may enter into, will be subject to board or shareholder approval, as necessary under the Companies Act 2013, there can be no assurance that such transactions, individually or in the aggregate, will not have an adverse effect on Smaaash Private\u2019s financial condition and results of operations or that Smaaash Private could not have achieved more favorable terms if such transactions had not been entered into with related parties. Such related party transactions may potentially involve conflicts of interest.\nSuch transactions, individually or in the aggregate, may not always be in the best interests of Smaaash Private\u2019s minority shareholders and will not have an adverse effect on Smaaash Private\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows\nSince a majority of Smaaash Private\u2019s directors, officers and assets reside or are located outside of the United States, we may have difficulty enforcing judgments against Smaaash Private, its directors and officers.\nSmaaash Private is incorporated under the laws of India. Further, Smaaash Private conducts substantially all of its operations in India. The majority of its directors and officers, reside outside the United States, and a majority of Smaaash Private\u2019s assets and some or all of the assets of such persons are located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult or impossible to effect service of process within the United States upon Smaaash Private or those persons, or to recover against Smaaash Private or those persons on judgments of United States courts, including judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the United States federal securities laws. An award of punitive damages by a United States courts based upon United States federal securities laws is likely to be construed by Indian courts to be penal in nature and therefore unenforceable in India. Further, no claim may be brought in India against Smaaash Private or its directors and officers in the first instance for a violation of United States federal securities laws because these laws have no extraterritorial application under Indian law and are not enforceable in India. However, an Indian court may impose civil liability, including the possibility of monetary damages, on Smaaash Private or its directors and officers if the facts alleged in a complaint constitute or give rise to a cause of action under Indian law. Moreover, it is unlikely that a courts in India would award damages on the same basis as a foreign courts if an action were brought in India or that the Indian courts would enforce foreign judgments if it viewed the amount of damages as excessive or inconsistent with Indian practice or public policy.\nThe courts of India will not automatically enforce judgments of United States courts obtained in actions against Smaaash Private or its directors and officers, predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the United States federal securities laws, or entertain actions brought in India against Smaaash Private or such persons predicated solely upon United States federal securities laws. Further, the United States has not been declared by the Government of India to be a reciprocating territory for the purposes of enforcement of foreign judgments, and there are grounds upon which Indian courts may decline to enforce the judgments of United States courts. Some remedies available under the laws of United States jurisdictions, including remedies available under the United States federal securities laws, may not be allowed in Indian courts if contrary to public policy in India. Because judgments of United States courts are not automatically enforceable in India, it may be difficult for you to recover against Smaaash Private or its directors and officers or some experts named in this proxy statement/prospectus based upon such judgments. In India, prior approval of the RBI is required in order to repatriate any amount recovered pursuant to such judgments. See \u201cEnforceability of Civil Liabilities.\u201d\nRisks Related to Our Ownership of Smaaash Private\u2019s Share Equity\nSmaaash Private\u2019s principal stockholders and management own a significant percentage of its share equity stock and will be able to exert significant control over matters subject to shareholder approval.\nShripal Morakhia and AHA Holdings Private Limited, his affiliated entity, and FW Metis, Smaaash Private\u2019s principal shareholders, beneficially own approximately 24.34% and 21.23%, respectively, of Smaaash Private\u2019s share equity after the Transactions. Accordingly, these shareholders have significant influence over the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval, including the election of directors, any merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of its assets or any other significant corporate transaction. The interests of these shareholders may not be the same as or may even conflict with Smaaash Private\u2019s interests. The concentration in ownership may have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change in control of Smaaash Private and deprive Smaaash Private\u2019s shareholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their equity shares as part of a sale of Smaaash Private.\nThere is currently no trading market for Smaaash\u2019s equity shares and liquidity of the equity shares is limited.\nSmaaash\u2019s equity shares of are not registered under the securities laws of India, the United States or any state or other jurisdiction, and accordingly there is no public trading market for the equity shares that we received in the Transaction and no public trading market is expected to develop in the foreseeable future. Therefore, we may not be able to readily sell or transfer the Smaaash Private equity shares that we own.\nRisk Factors Relating to Our Securities and Capital Structure\nWe have not paid dividends on our Common Stock in the past and do not expect to pay dividends on our Common Stock in the future. Any return on investment in our common stock may be limited to the value of our Common Stock.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on our Common Stock and do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our Common Stock in the foreseeable future. The payment of dividends on our Common Stock would depend on earnings, financial condition, and other business and economic factors affecting us at such time as our board of directors may consider relevant. If we do not pay dividends on our Common Stock, our Common Stock may be less valuable because a return on your investment will only occur if its stock price appreciates.\nTrading on the OTC Markets is volatile and sporadic, which could depress the market price of our common stock and make it difficult for our security holders to resell their common stock and/or warrants.\nOur Common Stock and Public Warrants are quoted on the OTCQB tier of the OTC Markets Group, Inc. (\u201cOTC Markets\u201d). Trading in securities quoted on the OTC Markets is often thin and characterized by wide fluctuations in trading prices, due to many factors, some of which may have little to do with our operations or business prospects. This volatility could depress the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to operating performance. Moreover, the OTC Markets is not a stock exchange, and trading of securities on the OTC Markets is often more sporadic than the trading of securities listed on a quotation system like Nasdaq Capital Market or a stock exchange like the NYSE American. These factors may result in investors having difficulty reselling any shares of our common stock.\nOur stock price is likely to be highly volatile because of several factors, including a limited public float.\nThe market price of our Common Stock and Public Warrants have been volatile in the past and the market price of our Common Stock and Public Warrants and Private Placement Warrants are likely to be highly volatile in the future. You may not be able to resell shares of our Common Stock and/or Private Placement Warrants following periods of volatility because of the market\u2019s adverse reaction to volatility.\nOther factors that could cause such volatility may include, among other things:\n\u25cf actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u25cf we may have a low trading volume for a number of reasons, including that a large portion of our stock is closely held;\n\u25cf overall stock market fluctuations;\n\u25cf announcements concerning our business or those of our competitors;\n\u25cf actual or perceived limitations on our ability to raise capital when we require it, and to raise such capital on favorable terms;\n\u25cf conditions or trends in the industry;\n\u25cf litigation;\n\u25cf changes in market valuations of other similar companies;\n\u25cf future sales of common stock;\n\u25cf departure of key personnel or failure to hire key personnel; and\n\u25cf general market conditions.\nAny of these factors could have a significant and adverse impact on the market price of our Common Stock and/or Private Placement Warrants. In addition, the stock market in general has at times experienced extreme volatility and rapid decline that has often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our Common Stock and/or Private Placement Warrants, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about the Company, its business, or its market, or if they change their recommendations regarding our securities adversely, the price and trading volume of our securities could decline.\nThe trading market for our securities will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us, our business, our market, or our competitors. Securities and industry analysts do not currently, and may never, publish research on the Company. If no securities or industry analysts commence coverage of the Company, our stock price and trading volume would likely be negatively impacted. If any of the analysts who may cover the Company change their recommendation regarding our securities adversely, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, the price of our securities would likely decline. If any analyst who may cover the Company were to cease coverage of the Company or fail to regularly publish reports on it, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nOur common stock has in the past been a \u201cpenny stock\u201d under SEC rules, and our warrants may be subject to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules. It may be more difficult to resell securities classified as \u201cpenny stock.\u201d\nIn the past, our common stock was a \u201cpenny stock\u201d under applicable SEC rules (generally defined as non-exchange traded stock with a per-share price below $5.00). Unless we successfully list our common stock and our warrants on a national stock exchange, or maintain a per-share price above $5.00, these rules impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers that recommend the purchase or sale of penny stocks to persons other than those who qualify as \u201cestablished customers\u201d or \u201caccredited investors.\u201d For example, broker-dealers must determine the appropriateness for non-qualifying persons of investments in penny stocks. Broker-dealers must also provide, prior to a transaction in a penny stock not otherwise exempt from the rules, a standardized risk disclosure document that provides information about penny stocks and the risks in the penny stock market. The broker-dealer also must provide the customer with current bid and offer quotations for the penny stock, disclose the compensation of the broker-dealer and its salesperson in the transaction, furnish monthly account statements showing the market value of each penny stock held in the customer\u2019s account, provide a special written determination that the penny stock is a suitable investment for the purchaser, and receive the purchaser\u2019s written agreement to the transaction.\nLegal remedies available to an investor in \u201cpenny stocks\u201d may include the following:\n\u25cf If a \u201cpenny stock\u201d is sold to the investor in violation of the requirements listed above, or other federal or states securities laws, the investor may be able to cancel the purchase and receive a refund of the investment.\n\u25cf If a \u201cpenny stock\u201d is sold to the investor in a fraudulent manner, the investor may be able to sue the persons and firms that committed the fraud for damages.\nHowever, investors who have signed arbitration agreements may have to pursue their claims through arbitration.\nThese requirements may have the effect of reducing the level of trading activity, if any, in the secondary market for a security that becomes subject to the penny stock rules. The additional burdens imposed upon broker-dealers by such requirements may discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our securities, which could severely limit the market price and liquidity of our securities. These requirements may restrict the ability of broker-dealers to sell our common stock or our Private Placement Warrants and may affect your ability to resell our common stock and our Private Placement Warrants.\nMany brokerage firms will discourage or refrain from recommending investments in penny stocks. Most institutional investors will not invest in penny stocks. In addition, many individual investors will not invest in penny stocks due, among other reasons, to the increased financial risk generally associated with these investments.\nFor these reasons, penny stocks may have a limited market and, consequently, limited liquidity. We can give no assurance at what time, if ever, our common stock or our Private Placement Warrants will not be classified as a \u201cpenny stock\u201d in the future.\nA sale of a substantial number of shares of our Common Stock may cause the price of the Common Stock to decline.\nIf our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our Common Stock in the public market, the market price of our Common Stock could fall. These sales also may make it more difficult for us to sell our equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem reasonable or appropriate. This risk is significant because of concentrated positions of our Common Stock held by a small group of investors.\nBecause certain of our stockholders control a significant number of shares of our Common Stock, they may have effective control over actions requiring stockholder approval.\nOur directors, executive officers and principal stockholders, and their respective affiliates, beneficially own approximately 59.2% of our outstanding shares of Common Stock. Accordingly, our executive officers, directors and principal stockholders, and their respective affiliates, will have significant influence on the ability to control the Company and the outcome of issues submitted to our stockholders.\nIf the benefits of any proposed acquisition of do not meet the expectations of investors, stockholders or financial analysts, the market price of our Common Stock may decline.\nIf the benefits of any proposed acquisition of do not meet the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the market price of our Common Stock prior to the closing of the proposed acquisition may decline. The market values of our Common Stock at the time of the proposed acquisition may vary significantly from their prices on the date the acquisition target was identified.\nIn addition, broad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of our Common Stock irrespective of our operating performance. The stock market in general has experienced price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the particular companies affected. The trading prices and valuations of these stocks, and of our securities, may not be predictable. A loss of investor confidence in the market for retail stocks or the stocks of other companies which investors perceive to be similar to us could depress our stock price regardless of our business, prospects, financial conditions or results of operations. A decline in the market price of our securities also could adversely affect our ability to issue additional securities and our ability to obtain additional financing in the future.\nChanges in accounting principles and guidance, or their interpretation, could result in unfavorable accounting charges or effects, including changes to our previously filed financial statements, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. These principles are subject to interpretation by the SEC and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting principles and guidance. A change in these principles or guidance, or in their interpretations, may have a significant effect on our reported results and retroactively affect previously reported results.\nBeing a public company results in additional expenses, diverts management\u2019s attention and could also adversely affect our ability to attract and retain qualified directors.\nAs a public reporting company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d). These requirements generate significant accounting, legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more difficult, time consuming or costly and may place significant strain on our personnel and resources. The Exchange Act requires, among other things, that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting. In order to establish the requisite disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting, significant resources and management oversight are required.\nAs a result, management\u2019s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could have an adverse and even material effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. These rules and regulations may also make it more difficult and expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance. If we are unable to obtain appropriate director and officer insurance, our ability to recruit and retain qualified officers and directors, especially those directors who may be deemed independent, could be adversely impacted.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and our election to delay adoption of new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies may result in our financial statements not being comparable to those of some other public companies. As a result of this and other reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, our securities may be less attractive to investors.\nAs a public reporting company with less than $1,070,000,000 in revenue during our last fiscal year, we qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the Jumpstart our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the \u201cJOBS Act\u201d). An emerging growth company may take advantage of certain reduced reporting requirements and is relieved of certain other significant requirements that are otherwise generally applicable to public companies. In particular, as an emerging growth company we:\n\u25cf are not required to obtain an attestation and report from our auditors on our management\u2019s assessment of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002;\n\u25cf are not required to provide a detailed narrative disclosure discussing our compensation principles, objectives and elements and analyzing how those elements fit with our principles and objectives (commonly referred to as \u201ccompensation discussion and analysis\u201d);\n\u25cf are not required to obtain a non-binding advisory vote from our stockholders on executive compensation or golden parachute arrangements (commonly referred to as the \u201csay-on-pay,\u201d \u201csay-on-frequency\u201d and \u201csay-on-golden-parachute\u201d votes);\n\u25cf are exempt from certain executive compensation disclosure provisions requiring a pay-for-performance graph and CEO pay ratio disclosure;\n\u25cf may present only two years of audited financial statements and only two years of related Management\u2019s Discussion & Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\u201cMD&A\u201d); and\n\u25cf are eligible to claim longer phase-in periods for the adoption of new or revised financial accounting standards under \u00a7107 of the JOBS Act.\nWe intend to take advantage of all of these reduced reporting requirements and exemptions, including the longer phase-in periods for the adoption of new or revised financial accounting standards under \u00a7107 of the JOBS Act. Our election to use the phase-in periods may make it difficult to compare our financial statements to those of non-emerging growth companies and other emerging growth companies that have opted out of the phase-in periods under \u00a7107 of the JOBS Act.\nCertain of these reduced reporting requirements and exemptions were already available to us due to the fact that we also qualify as a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d under SEC rules. For instance, smaller reporting companies are not required to obtain an auditor attestation and report regarding management\u2019s assessment of internal control over financial reporting; are not required to provide a compensation discussion and analysis; are not required to provide a pay-for-performance graph or Chief Executive Officer pay ratio disclosure; and may present only two years of audited financial statements and related MD&A disclosure.\nUnder the JOBS Act, we may take advantage of the above-described reduced reporting requirements and exemptions for up to five years after our initial sale of common equity pursuant to a registration statement declared effective under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d), or such earlier time that we no longer meet the definition of an emerging growth company. In this regard, the JOBS Act provides that we would cease to be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d if we have more than $1,070,000,000 in annual revenues, have more than $700 million in market value of our Common Stock held by non-affiliates, or issue more than $1.0 billion in principal amount of non-convertible debt over a three-year period. Further, under current SEC rules we will continue to qualify as a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d for so long as we have a public float (i.e., the market value of common equity held by non-affiliates) of less than $75 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter.\nWe cannot predict if investors will find our securities less attractive due to our reliance on these exemptions.\nFailure to establish and maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price.\nWe are required to comply with the SEC\u2019s rules implementing Sections 302 and 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which require management to certify financial and other information in our quarterly and annual reports and provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of controls over financial reporting. Though we are required to disclose changes made in our internal controls and procedures on a quarterly basis, we will not be required to make our first annual assessment of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 until year-end 2017. However, as an emerging growth company, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to formally attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 until the end of the fiscal year for which our second annual report is due or the date we are no longer an emerging growth company. At such time, our independent registered public accounting firm may issue a report that is adverse in the event it is not satisfied with the level at which our controls are documented, designed or operating.\nTo comply with the requirements of being a public company, we have undertaken various actions, and may need to take additional actions, such as implementing new internal controls and procedures and hiring additional accounting or internal audit staff. Testing and maintaining internal control can divert our management\u2019s attention from other matters that are important to the operation of our business. Additionally, when evaluating our internal control over financial reporting, we may identify material weaknesses that we may not be able to remediate in time to meet the applicable deadline imposed upon us for compliance with the requirements of Section 404. If we identify any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or are unable to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner or assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting once we are no longer an emerging growth company, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our Common Stock could be negatively affected, and we could become subject to investigations by the Financial Industry Regulatory Agency, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources.\nAnti-takeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt.\nThe Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or changes in our management without the consent of our board of directors. These provisions include:\n\u25cf no cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u25cf the exclusive right of our board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors or the resignation, death, or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors;\n\u25cf the ability of our board of directors to determine whether to issue shares of our preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer;\n\u25cf limiting the liability of, and providing indemnification to, our directors and officers;\n\u25cf controlling the procedures for the conduct and scheduling of stockholder meetings;\n\u25cf providing that directors may be removed prior to the expiration of their terms by stockholders only for cause; and\n\u25cf advance notice procedures that stockholders must comply with in order to nominate candidates to our board of directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of the Company.\nThese provisions, alone or together, could delay hostile takeovers and changes in control of the Company or changes in our board of directors and management.\nAny provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our security holders to receive a premium for their securities and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our securities.\nIn the event that our common stock price does not exceed the exercise price of the Private Placement Warrants during the period when the Private Placement Warrants are exercisable, the Private Placement Warrants may not have any value.\nThe warrants will be immediately exercisable and expire on the fifth anniversary of the date of issuance. The Private Placement Warrants will have an initial exercise price per share equal to $11.50. In the event that our common stock price does not exceed the exercise price of the Private Placement Warrants during the period when the Private Placement Warrants are exercisable, the Private Placement Warrants may not have any value.\nThere is no established trading market for the Private Placement Warrants and the market for the Private Placement Warrants may be highly volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance. We do not intend to list the Private Placement Warrants, nor do we expect the Private Placement Warrants to be quoted, on any securities exchange.\nThere must be a current registration statement in order for you to exercise the Private Placement Warrants.\nHolders of Private Placement Warrants will be able to exercise the Private Placement Warrants only if a current registration statement relating to the common stock underlying the Private Placement Warrants is then in effect. Although we will attempt to maintain the effectiveness of a current registration statement covering the common stock underlying the Private Placement Warrants, there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so. If the registration statement covering the shares issuable upon exercise of the Private Placement Warrants is no longer effective, the Private Placement Warrants may only be exercised on a \u201ccashless\u201d basis and will be issued with restrictive legends unless such shares are eligible for sale under Rule 144 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.\nHolders of our Private Placement Warrants will have no rights as a common stockholder until they acquire our common stock.\nUntil you acquire shares of our common stock upon exercise of your Private Placement Warrants, you will have no rights with respect to our common stock. Upon exercise of your Private Placement Warrants, you will be entitled to exercise the rights of a common stockholder only as to matters for which the record date occurs after the exercise date.", "PERMNO": 16988, "SIC": 7900, "TIC": "WINR"}
