{"cik": "886346", "company": "KADANT INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business, results of operations and financial condition, and an investment in our securities, are subject to a number of risks. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material, but are not the only risks and uncertainties we face. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies, including overall economic and industry conditions. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to produce a level of general uncertainty and, in some cases, adverse changes in global economic conditions and has heightened, and in some cases manifested, certain of the risks we normally face in operating our business, including those disclosed herein. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are not material may also impair our business, consolidated financial condition and results of operations.\nKadant Inc.\nRisks Related to our Business and Industry\nAdverse changes in global and local economic conditions may negatively affect our industry, business and results of operations.\nWe sell products worldwide to global process industries and a significant portion of our revenue is from customers based in North America, Europe and China. Uncertainties in global and regional economic outlooks have negatively affected, and may in the future negatively affect, demand for our customers' products and, as a consequence, our products and services, especially our capital equipment systems and products, and our operating results. Also, uncertainty regarding economic conditions has caused, and may in the future cause, liquidity and credit issues for many businesses, including our customers and suppliers in the pulp and paper industry as well as other process industries, and may result in their inability to fund projects, capacity expansion plans, and to some extent, routine operations and capital expenditures. These conditions have resulted, and may in the future result, in a number of structural changes in process industries, including decreased spending, mill closures, consolidations, and bankruptcies, all of which negatively affect our business, revenue, and profitability. Financial and economic turmoil affecting the worldwide economy or the banking system and financial markets, in particular due to political or economic developments, could cause the expectations for our business to differ materially in the future.\nRevenues from the sale of large capital equipment and systems projects are often difficult to predict accurately, especially in periods of economic uncertainty, and large capital equipment projects require significant investment requiring our customers to secure financing, which may be difficult.\nWe manufacture capital equipment and systems used in process industries, including the paper, fluid handling, wood processing and material handling industries. Approximately 35% of our revenue in 2021 was from the sale of capital equipment to be used in process industries. The demand for capital equipment is variable and depends on a number of factors, including consumer demand for end products, existing manufacturing capacity, the level of capital spending by our customers and economic conditions. As a consequence, our bookings and revenues for capital projects tend to be variable and difficult to predict. It is especially difficult to accurately forecast our operating results during periods of economic uncertainty. Our customers curtail their capital and operating spending during periods of economic uncertainty and are cautious about resuming spending as market conditions improve. Levels of consumer spending on non-durable goods, demand for food and beverage packaging, and demand for new housing and remodeling are all factors that affect paper and wood processing companies' demand for our products. Expansion of bulk material handling capacity and infrastructure spending are factors that affect demand for material handling equipment. Reductions in demand levels in any of these areas can negatively impact our business. As companies in our customers' industries consolidate operations in response to market weakness, they frequently reduce capacity, increase downtime, defer maintenance and upgrades, and postpone or even cancel capacity additions or expansion projects. Capacity growth and investment can be uneven and the larger paper producers have delayed, and may in the future delay, additional new capacity start-ups in reaction to softer market conditions. In general, as significant capacity additions come online and the economic growth rate slows, paper producers have deferred and could in the future defer further investments or the delivery of previously-ordered equipment until the market absorbs the new production.\nLarge capital equipment projects require a significant investment and may require our customers to secure financing from external sources. Our financial performance will be negatively impacted if there are delays in customers securing financing or our customers become unable to secure such financing due to any number of factors, including a tightening of monetary policy or regime-based sanctions such as those imposed on Russia and China. Financing delays of our customers can cause us to delay booking pending orders as well as the shipment of some orders. The inability of our customers to obtain credit may affect our ability to recognize revenue and income, particularly on large capital equipment orders from new customers for which we may require letters of credit. We may also be unable to issue letters of credit to our customers, which are required in some cases to guarantee performance, during periods of economic uncertainty. This has negatively affected our bookings and revenues in the past, particularly in China, and may negatively affect our operating results in the future.\nWe have significant international sales and operations and face risks related to health epidemics and pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic, which has and continues to present challenges to our business and results of operations.\nOur business and operations have been and may continue to be challenged by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and may be challenged by other adverse public health developments, including disruptions or restrictions on our employees\u2019 and other service providers\u2019 ability to travel, reductions in our workforce, temporary closures of our facilities or the facilities of our customers, suppliers or other vendors in our supply chain, potentially including single source suppliers, and other disruptions in the supply chain. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted and other disease outbreaks could impact global trade and reduce demand for our products, and adversely affect the U.S. or global economy and capital markets.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has negatively affected the global economy, disrupted global supply chains, resulted in significant travel and transport restrictions, including mandated closures and orders to \u201cshelter-in-place,\u201d and initially created significant disruption of the financial markets. The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected, and may adversely affect in the\nKadant Inc.\nfuture, our business and results of operations, as government authorities have imposed, and may in the future impose, temporary mandatory closures of our facilities, travel restrictions, work-from-home orders, vaccine or testing mandates and social distancing protocols and other restrictions that have impacted our ability to adequately staff and maintain our operations at normal levels. Additionally, our financial results have been adversely impacted and may be adversely impacted in the future by decreased levels of bookings, customer-requested delays on certain capital projects and service work, customer downtime and shutdowns, and visitation restrictions at many customer facilities, all of which have affected and may adversely affect in the future our ability to recognize revenue for sales of our products and services. We may also incur future costs related to COVID-19, such as increased employee benefit costs if a significant number of our employees contract COVID-19 and require hospitalization or other costly medical treatment, or expenses related to repeated cleaning and sanitizing of our facilities, which may also adversely affect our financial results. In March 2020, we experienced a significant decrease in market capitalization due to a decline in our stock price, and the overall U.S. stock market also declined significantly amid market volatility driven by the uncertainty surrounding the outbreak of COVID-19. The future impact of the COVID-19 pandemic could include further disruption and volatility in the global capital markets, which, depending on future developments, could impact our capital resources and liquidity in the future.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has evolved and continues to evolve rapidly. As a result, we cannot reasonably estimate the scope of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including the potential impact of emerging variants or the response of government authorities to any such variants or other developments, on our business and the adverse effect and impact the COVID-19 pandemic may ultimately have on our business and our stock price. For instance, we may face additional requests from customers to delay the production or delivery of our products, particularly capital equipment products, which would affect our ability to recognize revenue for sales of such products. Other customers may decide not to proceed with large capital equipment orders in order to conserve their cash. A delay on our part of the production of our products may lead to liquidated damages owed to our customers. Further implementation, extension or renewal of government-mandated closures, \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d orders or vaccine or testing mandates related to the COVID-19 pandemic may create further disruption to our operations, our workforce, the supply chain, and our customer and vendor operations. The evolving effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy are uncertain, and we may be further adversely affected by general economic conditions, even if government mandates are repealed. The impact of COVID-19 could worsen if new and more virulent or transmissible variants emerge which result in a resurgence of COVID-19 infection in affected regions.\nIn addition, travel, commercial and other similar restrictions put in place by various government authorities in response to COVID-19 have contributed to global supply disruptions and we have, and may in the future, incur costs to mitigate such disruptions, which could be significant. New information may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 or any of its variants, the pace and method through which it is transmitted, contained and/or treated, and the nature of the approach of the local governments in the jurisdictions in which we operate to handling the outbreak, any of which could impact our employees, operations, suppliers, customers and/or operating and financial results, including our ability to determine our quarterly results. We operate in 20 countries and the government responses in each of those countries have differed and resulted in varying levels of containment of COVID-19, degree and duration of closures, and nature of safety precautions, all of which we have and will continue to manage. Although we have worked and continue to work diligently to ensure that our global facilities can operate with minimal disruption, mitigate the impact of the outbreak on our employees\u2019 health and safety, and address the supply chain impact on ourselves and our customers, the full extent to which COVID-19 has affected and will affect the global economy and our results will depend on future developments and factors that cannot be predicted.\nImplementing our acquisition strategy involves risks, and our failure to successfully implement this strategy could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe expect that a significant driver of our growth over the next several years will be the acquisition of technologies and businesses that complement or augment our existing products and services or may involve entry into a new process industry. We continue to actively pursue acquisition opportunities, some of which may be material to our business and financial performance, and involve significant cash expenditures and the incurrence of significant debt. Although we have been successful with this strategy in the past, we may not be able to grow our business in the future through acquisitions for a number of reasons, including:\n-\ndifficulties identifying and executing acquisitions, including our ability to conduct and complete due diligence, difficulties in negotiations with the counterparty, and inability to obtain regulatory and antitrust approvals;\n-\ncompetition with other prospective buyers resulting in our inability to complete an acquisition or in our paying a substantial premium over the fair value of the net assets of the acquired business;\n-\naccess to and availability of capital;\n-\ndifficulty in integrating operations, technologies, products and the key employees of the acquired business;\n-\ninability to maintain existing customers of the acquired business or to sell the products and services of the acquired business to our existing customers;\n-\ninability to retain key management of the acquired business;\nKadant Inc.\n-\ndiversion of management's attention from other business concerns;\n-\ninability to improve the revenues and profitability or realize the expected cost savings and synergies;\n-\nassumption of significant liabilities, some of which may be unknown at the time of acquisition; and\n-\nidentification of internal control deficiencies of the acquired business.\nWe are required to record acquisition-related costs in the period incurred. Once completed, acquisitions may involve significant integration costs. These acquisition-related costs could be significant in a reporting period and have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nAny acquisition we complete may be made at a substantial premium over the fair value of the net identifiable assets of the acquired business. We are required to assess the realizability of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets annually, and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that goodwill and intangible assets, including definite-lived intangible assets, may be impaired. These events or circumstances would generally include operating losses or a significant decline in earnings associated with the acquired business or assets, and our ability to realize the value of goodwill and intangible assets will depend on the future cash flows of these businesses. We may incur impairment charges to write down the value of our goodwill and acquired intangible assets in the future if the assets are not deemed recoverable, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nWe manufacture equipment used in the production of forest products, including lumber and OSB, and our financial performance may be adversely affected by decreased levels of residential construction activity.\nWe manufacture debarkers, stranders and related equipment used in the production of lumber and OSB. Our customers produce these products principally for new residential construction, home repair and remodeling activities. As such, the operating results for our Industrial Processing segment correlate to a significant degree to the level of this residential construction activity, primarily in North America and, to a lesser extent, in Europe. Residential construction activity is influenced by a number of factors, including the supply of and demand for new and existing homes, new housing starts, unemployment rates, interest rate levels, availability of mortgage financing, mortgage foreclosure rates, availability of construction labor and suitable land, seasonal and unusual weather conditions, general economic conditions and consumer confidence. A significant increase in long-term interest rates, changes in tax policy on the deductibility of mortgage interest, tightened lending standards, high unemployment rates and other factors that reduce the level of residential construction activity could have a negative effect on our financial performance.\nThe OSB market is highly concentrated and the market for building products is highly competitive. The loss of a significant customer or our customers' reductions in capital spending or OSB production could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.\nThe OSB market is highly concentrated and there are a limited number of OSB manufacturers. As a percentage of our Industrial Processing segment revenues, the two largest OSB customers accounted for 11% in 2021 and 9% in both 2020 and 2019. The loss of one or more of these OSB customers to a competitor could adversely affect our revenues and profitability. In addition, the market for building products is highly competitive. Products that compete with OSB include other wood panel products and substitutes for wood building products, such as nonfiber-based alternatives. For example, plastic, wood/plastic or composite materials may be used by builders as alternatives to OSB products. Changes in component prices, such as energy, chemicals, wood-based fibers, and nonfiber alternatives can change the competitive position of OSB relative to other available alternatives and could increase substitution. Our customers' OSB production can be adversely affected by lower-cost producers of other wood panel products and substitutes for wood building products. Lower demand for OSB products or a decline in the profitability of one or more of our customers could result in a reduction in spending on capital equipment or the shutdown or closure of an OSB mill, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.\nOur Wood Processing product line can be materially impacted by changes to the global timber supply.\nChanges in the environment that affect natural resources such as timber may have significant effects on the sales of wood processing equipment by our Industrial Processing segment. Approximately 23% of our revenue in 2021 was from our Wood Processing product line. Changes in the environment like wildfires and damage from pests such as the mountain pine beetle have affected tracts of land in Western Canada that could have otherwise been logged by the forestry industry. Reduction in availability of timber can result in decreased logging activity, mill closures, and lower operating rates at mills, as well as reduced capital expenditures. A reduction in capital expenditures by mills would likely lead to a decrease in demand for new wood processing equipment, which would in turn affect demand for parts, as our wood processing customers are likely to reduce utilization of equipment, reduce inventories, redistribute parts from closed mills and delay rebuilds and other maintenance during industry downturns. In addition to declining orders for wood processing products, adverse economic\nKadant Inc.\nconditions for our wood processing customers may make it more difficult for us to collect accounts receivable in a timely manner, or at all, which may adversely affect our working capital.\nThe development and increasing use of digital media has had, and will continue to have, an adverse impact on our Flow Control and Industrial Processing segments.\nDevelopments in digital media have adversely affected demand for newsprint and for printing and writing grades of paper, particularly in North America and Europe, a trend which is expected to continue. Approximately 8% of our revenue in 2021 was from customers producing newsprint and printing and writing grades of paper. Significant declines in the production of printing and writing paper grades have also led to a drop in the construction of recycled tissue mills, as those mills use printing and writing grades of waste paper as their fiber source. The increased use of digital media has had, and will continue to have, an adverse effect on demand for our products in those markets.\nOur Material Handling segment can be materially impacted by cyclical economic conditions affecting the global mining industry.\nChanges in economic conditions affecting the global mining industry can occur abruptly and unpredictably, which may have significant effects on the sales of original equipment by our subsidiary, SMH, which comprises a substantial portion of our Material Handling segment. Approximately 4% of our revenue in 2021 was from SMH's mining customers. Cyclicality for original equipment sales is driven primarily by price volatility of the commodities that are mined using SMH\u2019s equipment, including coal, salt, aggregates, potash, copper, iron ore and trona, or their substitutes, as well as product life cycles, competitive pressures and other economic factors affecting the mining industry, such as company consolidation, increased regulation and competition affecting demand for commodities, and the broader economy, including changes in government monetary or fiscal policies and from market expectations with respect to such policies. Falling commodity prices have in the past and may in the future lead to reduced capital expenditures by SMH\u2019s customers, reductions in the production levels of existing mines, a contraction in the number of existing mines and the closure of less efficient mines. Reduced capital expenditures and decreased mining activity by SMH\u2019s customers are likely to lead to a decrease in demand for new mining equipment, and may result in a decrease in demand for parts as SMH\u2019s customers are likely to reduce utilization of equipment, reduce inventories, redistribute parts from closed mines and delay rebuilds and other maintenance during industry downturns. In addition to declining orders for SMH\u2019s products, adverse economic conditions for SMH\u2019s customers may make it more difficult for SMH to collect accounts receivable in a timely manner, or at all, which may adversely affect our working capital. As a result of this cyclicality in the global mining industry, SMH may experience significant fluctuations in its business, results of operations and financial condition, and we expect SMH\u2019s business to continue to be subject to these fluctuations in the future.\nA sizable portion of our Material Handling segment is dependent on continued demand for coal, which is subject to economic and environmental risks.\nApproximately 4% and 2% of the Material Handling segment's 2021 revenues came from its thermal and metallurgical coal-mining customers, respectively. Many of these customers supply coal for the generation of electricity and/or steel production. Demand for electricity and steel is affected by the global level of economic activity and economic growth. The pursuit of the most cost-effective form of electricity generation continues to take place throughout the world and coal-fired electricity generation faces intense price competition from other energy sources, particularly natural gas. In addition, coal combustion typically generates significant greenhouse gas emissions and governmental and private sector goals and mandates to reduce greenhouse gas emissions may increasingly affect the mix of electricity generation sources. Further developments in connection with legislation, regulations, international agreements or other limits on greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental impacts or costs from coal combustion, both in the United States and in other countries, could diminish demand for coal as a fuel for electricity generation. If lower greenhouse gas emitting forms of electricity generation, such as nuclear, solar, natural gas or wind power, become more prevalent or cost effective, or diminished economic activity reduces demand for electricity and steel, demand for coal will decline. Reduced demand for coal could result in reduced demand for SMH\u2019s mining equipment and could adversely affect our overall business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure of our information systems or breaches of data security and cybertheft could impact our business.\nWe operate a geographically dispersed business and rely on the electronic storage and transmission of proprietary and confidential information, including technical and financial information, among our operations, customers and suppliers. We also rely on information technology (IT), including IT services from third parties, in certain of our solutions, products, and services for customers as well as our enterprise infrastructure. Despite our security measures and internal controls, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to unauthorized access or attacks by nation states, hackers or cyber criminals or breaches due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions, such as business email compromises, phishing and other cyber-related fraud. Our systems could be compromised by malware (including ransomware), cyberattacks,\nKadant Inc.\nand other events, ranging from widespread, non-targeted, global cyber threats to targeted advanced persistent threats. These threats could be indicators of an increased risk to our products, solutions, services, manufacturing, and IT infrastructure. Recent global cyberattacks have been perpetuated by the compromise of software updates to widely used software products, including some products that we use, which increases the risk that vulnerabilities or malicious content could be inserted into our products or IT infrastructure. We maintain a cybersecurity insurance policy that provides limited coverage for some, but not all potential risks and liabilities associated with cyberattacks and other events, which may not be fully insurable. While we continuously seek to improve the security attributes of our products, solutions, services and IT infrastructure, we cannot eliminate risk or ensure that we will not be harmed by cyberattacks or disruptions.\nIn some global cyberattacks, malware has been spread from one party to another via network connections that the parties had previously authorized. Our business uses IT resources on a dispersed, global basis for a wide variety of functions including development, engineering, manufacturing, sales, accounting, and human resources. Our vendors, partners, employees and customers have access to, and share, information across multiple locations via various digital technologies. In addition, we rely on partners and vendors for a wide range of outsourced activities, including cloud providers, as part of our internal IT infrastructure and our commercial offerings. Secure connectivity is important to these ongoing operations. To a significant extent, the security of systems to which we connect depends on how such systems are designed, installed, protected, configured, updated and monitored, much of which is typically outside of our control. Also, our partners and vendors frequently have access to our confidential information as well as confidential information about our customers, employees, and others. We design our security architecture to reduce the risk that a compromise of our partners\u2019 infrastructure, for example a cloud platform, could lead to a compromise of our internal systems or customer networks, but this risk cannot be eliminated and vulnerabilities at third parties could result in unknown risk exposure to our business.\nAs part of our ongoing effort to upgrade our current information systems, we are implementing enterprise resource planning software to manage certain of our business operations. As we implement and add functionality, problems could arise that we have not foreseen. System failures, network disruptions, and breaches of data security could limit our ability to conduct business as usual, including our ability to communicate and transact business with our customers and suppliers; result in the loss or misuse of this information, including credit card numbers or other personal information, the loss of business or customers, or damage to our brand or reputation; or interrupt or delay reporting of our financial results. Such system failures or unauthorized access could be caused by external theft or attack, misconduct by our employees, suppliers, or competitors, or natural disasters.\nIn addition, the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures, such as to comply with local privacy laws such as the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation, or various similar U.S. federal and state laws, could be significant.\nThe current cyber threat environment indicates increased risk for all companies. Like other global companies, we have experienced cyber threats and incidents, although none have been material or had a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition. Our information security efforts include major programs designed to address security governance, product security, identification and protection of critical assets, insider risk, third-party risk, and cyber defense operations. We believe these measures reduce, but cannot eliminate, the risk of an information security incident. Any significant security incidents could have an adverse impact on sales, harm our reputation and cause us to incur legal liability and increased costs to address such events and related security concerns.\nIt may be difficult for us to implement our strategies for improving internal growth.\nSome of the markets in which we compete are mature and have relatively low growth rates. We pursue a number of strategies to improve our internal growth, including:\n-\nstrengthening our presence in selected geographic markets, including emerging markets and existing markets where we see opportunities;\n-\nfocusing on parts and consumables sales;\n-\nusing low-cost manufacturing bases, such as China, India and Mexico;\n-\nallocating research and development funding to products with higher growth prospects;\n-\ndeveloping new applications for our technologies;\n-\ncombining sales and marketing operations in appropriate markets to compete more effectively;\n-\nfinding new markets for our products and expanding into different verticals or process industries;\n-\ncontinuing to develop cross-selling opportunities for our products and services to take advantage of our depth of product offerings; and\n-\ncorporate efficiency programs, such as Lean manufacturing and the \u201c80/20\u201d rule (the Pareto Principle).\nWe may not be able to successfully implement these strategies, or achieve cost savings or desired efficiencies, and these strategies may not result in the expected growth of our business.\nKadant Inc.\nSupply chain constraints, inflationary pressure, price increases and shortages in raw materials and components, and dependency upon certain suppliers for such raw materials and components could adversely impact our operating results.\nSome of our businesses have been and may continue to be impacted by supply chain constraints, resulting in inflationary pressure on material costs, longer lead times, port congestion, and increased freight costs. In addition, current or future governmental policies may increase the risk of inflation which could further increase the costs of raw materials and components for our businesses. If we are unable to mitigate the impact of supply chain constraints and inflationary pressure through price increases or other measures our results of operations and financial condition could be negatively impacted.\nWe use a variety of raw materials, including a significant amount of stainless steel, carbon steel, commodities and critical components to manufacture our products. Increases in the prices of such raw materials, commodities and critical components could adversely affect our operating results if we were unable to fully offset the effect of these increased costs through price increases, productivity improvements, or cost reduction programs.\nSome of our businesses depend on a limited number of suppliers to provide critical components used in the manufacture of our products. If we are unable to obtain sufficient supplies of these components or these sources of supply cease to be available to us, we could experience shortages in critical components or be unable to meet our commitments to customers. Alternative sources of supply could be more expensive, or in some cases, we could be unable to locate such alternative sources. We believe our current sources of raw materials, commodities and critical components will generally be sufficient for our needs in the foreseeable future. However, our operating results could be negatively impacted if supply is insufficient for our operations or if we are unable to expand supply as needed.\nWhile our businesses are working to alleviate supply chain constraints through various measures, we are unable to predict the impact of these constraints on the timing of revenue and operating costs of our business in the future.\nWe are subject to intense competition in all our markets.\nWe believe that the principal competitive factors affecting the markets for our products include technical expertise and process knowledge, product innovation, automation, product quality, and price. Our competitors include a number of large multinational corporations that may have substantially greater financial, marketing, and other resources than we do. As a result, they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies, such as those related to factory digitalization, the industrial internet of things, and smart technology, and changes in customer requirements, or to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their services and products. Competitors' technologies may prove to be superior to ours. Our current products, those under development, and our ability to develop new technologies may not be sufficient to enable us to compete effectively. Competition, especially in China, has increased as new companies enter the market and existing competitors expand their product lines and manufacturing operations.\nChanges in our tax provision or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenue and earnings from our international operations, and are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Changes in U.S. and foreign income tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation, could result in higher or lower income tax rates assessed or changes in the taxability of certain revenues or the deductibility of certain expenses, thereby affecting our income tax expense and profitability. A number of factors may cause our effective tax rate to fluctuate, including: changes in tax rates in various jurisdictions; unanticipated changes in the amount of profit in jurisdictions in which the statutory tax rates may be higher or lower than the U.S. tax rate; the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities; changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; adjustments to income taxes upon finalization of various tax returns; increases in expenses not deductible for tax purposes, including impairments of goodwill in connection with acquisitions; and changes in available tax credits or our ability to utilize foreign tax credits. Any of these factors could cause us to experience an effective tax rate significantly different from that of prior periods or current expectations, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows.\nIf we are unable to successfully manage our manufacturing operations, our ability to deliver products to our customers could be disrupted and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nEquipment and operating systems necessary for our manufacturing businesses may break down, perform poorly, or fail. Any such disruption could cause losses in efficiencies, delays in shipments of our products and the loss of sales and customers, and insurance proceeds may not adequately compensate us for our losses.\nIn order to enhance the efficiency and cost effectiveness of our manufacturing operations, and to better serve customers located in various countries, as we have in the past, we may in the future move product lines from one of our plants to another and consolidate manufacturing operations in certain of our plants. Even if we successfully move our manufacturing processes, there is no assurance that the cost savings and efficiencies we anticipate will be achieved.\nChanges in zoning laws in China are requiring us to relocate certain of our manufacturing facilities. For example, we received a request by local Chinese authorities to relocate one of our facilities, and have negotiated with the Chinese\nKadant Inc.\ngovernment regarding the relocation of such facility. Such relocation, and any relocations required in the future, may increase our costs and could have a material impact on our manufacturing operations.\nIn addition, our manufacture of certain products is concentrated in specific geographic locations. As a result of such concentration, we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of any disruptions (including natural disasters), regulations or delays that impact those geographic locations, which may negatively impact our ability to manufacture products produced in those locations and have an adverse effect on our business results.\nWe may be required to reorganize our operations in response to changing conditions in the worldwide economy and the industries we serve, and such actions may require significant expenditures and may not be successful.\nWe have undertaken various restructuring measures in the past in response to changing market conditions in the countries in which we operate and we may engage in additional cost reduction programs in the future. The costs of these programs may be significant and we may not recoup the costs of these programs. In connection with any future plant closures, delays or failures in the transition of production from existing facilities to facilities in other geographic regions could also adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, it is difficult to accurately forecast our financial performance in periods of economic uncertainty in a region or globally, and the efforts we have made or may make to align our cost structure may not be sufficient or able to keep pace with rapidly changing business conditions. Our profitability may decline if our restructuring efforts do not sufficiently reduce our future costs and position us to maintain or increase our sales.\nOur future success is substantially dependent on the continued service of our senior management and other key employees and effective succession planning.\nOur future success is substantially dependent on the continued service of our senior management and other key employees. The loss of the services or retirement of our senior management or other key employees could make it more difficult to successfully operate our business and achieve our business goals. We also may be unable to attract qualified personnel or retain existing management, product development, sales, operational and other support personnel that are critical to our success, which could result in harm to key customer relationships, loss of key information, expertise, or know-how, and unanticipated recruitment and training costs. In addition, effective succession planning is also a key factor for our future success. Our failure to continue to enable the effective transfer of knowledge and facilitate smooth transitions with regard to key management employees, including in connection with our succession planning, could adversely affect our long-term strategic planning and execution and negatively affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects. If we fail to enable the effective transfer of knowledge and facilitate smooth transitions for key personnel, the operating results and future growth for our business could be adversely affected, and the morale and productivity of the workforce could be disrupted.\nOur inability to protect our intellectual property or defend ourselves against the intellectual property claims of others could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, litigation to enforce our intellectual property and contractual rights or defend ourselves could result in significant litigation or licensing expense.\nWe seek patent and trade secret protection for significant new technologies, products, and processes because of the length of time and expense associated with bringing new products through the development process and into the marketplace. We own numerous U.S. and foreign patents and we intend to file additional applications, as appropriate, for patents covering our products. Patents may not be issued for any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us, and the claims allowed under any issued patents may not be sufficiently broad to protect our technology. Any issued patents owned by or licensed to us may be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented, and the rights under these patents may not provide us with competitive advantages. In addition, competitors may design around our technology, copy our technology or develop competing technologies. Intellectual property rights may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries, which could make it easier for competitors to capture increased market share. In addition, as our patents expire, we rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how to protect our products. We cannot be sure the steps we have taken, or will take in the future, will be adequate to deter misappropriation of our proprietary information and intellectual property. Of particular concern are developing countries, such as China and India, where the laws, courts, and administrative agencies may not protect our intellectual property rights as fully as in the United States or Europe.\nWe seek to protect trade secrets and proprietary know-how, in part, through confidentiality and non-competition agreements with our collaborators, employees, and consultants. These agreements may be breached, we may not have adequate remedies for any breach, and our trade secrets and proprietary know-how may otherwise become known or be independently developed by our competitors, or our competitors may otherwise gain access to our intellectual property.\nOthers may assert intellectual property infringement claims against us or our customers. We may provide a limited intellectual property indemnity in connection with our terms and conditions of sale to our customers and in other types of contracts with third parties. Indemnification payments and legal expenses to defend claims could be costly.\nKadant Inc.\nWe could incur substantial costs to defend ourselves in suits brought against us, including for alleged infringement of third-party rights, or in suits in which we may assert our intellectual property or contractual rights against others. An unfavorable outcome of any such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nSMH holds numerous U.S. and foreign patents, including foreign counterparts to its U.S. patents, and licenses the trademarked brand name of one of its significant products, Link-Belt\u00ae, from a third party. If the third party were to terminate that license agreement, we would lose the right to use the Link-Belt\u00ae trademark in the marketplace and cease to benefit from any of its associated goodwill.\nEffects of climate change may adversely impact our business.\nClimate change may pose environmental risks that could harm our results of operations and affect the way we conduct business. Many of our operations are located in regions that may become increasingly vulnerable due to climate change, which may cause extreme weather conditions such as more intense hurricanes, thunderstorms, tornadoes and snow or ice storms, winds, and rainfall, as well as rising sea levels and increased volatility in seasonal temperatures. Extreme weather conditions or weather-driven natural disasters could impact our ability to maintain our operations in those areas. For example, we have manufacturing locations in the southeastern United States, which region has experienced record hurricanes in recent years reportedly due to the effects of climate change. Climate change could also affect demand for our products by our customers that are affected by weather and weather-driven events, including seasonal changes in outdoor working conditions and rainfall levels. Climate change has also been cited as contributing to the increased likelihood around the world of hot and dry conditions in which wildfires and the destructive mountain pine beetle thrive. As a result of the effects of climate change, our customers in the forestry industry may face damage to assets and losses from business interruption, which could lead to the reduced operation or closure of mills, and disruption of supply chains of which we may be a part. These risks could harm our business and results of operations.\nOur insurance coverage may be inadequate or expensive.\nWe are subject to claims in the ordinary course of business. It is not always possible to prevent or detect activities giving rise to claims, and the precautions we take may not be effective in all cases. We maintain insurance policies that provide limited coverage for some, but not all, potential risks and liabilities associated with our business. We may not obtain insurance if we believe the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. As a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain insurance policies can increase substantially, and in some instances, certain insurance may become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. As a result, we may not be able to renew our existing insurance policies or procure other desirable insurance on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. In addition, certain risks generally are not fully insurable. Even where insurance coverage applies, insurers may contest their obligations to make payments. Our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected by losses and liabilities from uninsured or under-insured events, as well as by delays in the payment of insurance proceeds, or the failure by insurers to make payments.\nRisks Related to our Foreign Operations\nOur global operations subject us to various risks that may adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are a leading global supplier of equipment and critical components used in process industries worldwide. We sell our products globally, including sales to customers in China, South America, Russia and India, and operate multiple manufacturing operations worldwide, including operations in Canada, China, Europe, Mexico, India and Brazil. International revenues and operations are subject to a number of risks which vary by geographic region, including the following:\n-\nagreements may be difficult to enforce and receivables difficult to collect through a foreign country's legal system;\n-\nforeign customers may have longer payment cycles;\n-\nforeign countries may impose additional withholding taxes or otherwise tax our foreign income;\n-\neconomic sanctions, trade embargoes, tariffs, currency restrictions or other adverse trade regulations;\n-\nenvironmental and other regulations can adversely impact our ability to operate our facilities;\n-\ndisruption from climate change, natural disaster, including earthquakes and/or tornadoes, fires, war, terrorist activity, and other force majeure events beyond our control;\n-\nchanges in zoning laws that may require relocation of our manufacturing operations;\n-\ndisruption from fast-spreading health epidemics and pandemics which have and may continue to result in widespread interruption of our business operations and those of our customers, supplier and vendors;\n-\nworsening economic conditions may result in worker unrest, labor actions, and potential work stoppages;\n-\npolitical and/or civil unrest may disrupt commercial activities of ours or our customers;\nKadant Inc.\n-\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and foreign interest rates beyond our control;\n-\nit may be difficult to repatriate funds, due to unfavorable domestic and foreign tax consequences or other restrictions or limitations imposed by foreign governments; and\n-\nthe protection of intellectual property in foreign countries may be more difficult to enforce.\nOperating globally subjects us to various risks that may adversely affect our results of operations in the future.\nPolicies of the Chinese government may negatively impact our business.\nWe operate significant manufacturing facilities in China. In 2021, our sales to China were $82.1 million, or 10%, of our revenue. Our Chinese manufacturing facilities provide low-cost sourcing to many of our subsidiaries. Changes in the policies of the Chinese government, devaluation of the Chinese currency, restrictions on the expatriation of cash, political unrest, unstable economic conditions, or other developments in China or in U.S.-China relations that are adverse to trade, including enactment of protectionist legislation or trade or currency restrictions, could negatively impact our business and operating results. Policies of the Chinese government to target slower economic growth may negatively affect our business in China if customers are unable to expand capacity or obtain financing for expansion or improvement projects. The United States has restricted investment in certain companies with ties to the Chinese military; if such restrictions are expanded, or if investment was otherwise restricted, our business would be negatively affected.\nPolicies of the Chinese government to advance internal political priorities may potentially negatively affect our business in any number of ways that we may not foresee. For example, the Chinese government has imposed a ban on all recovered paper imports effective as of January 1, 2021. According to Fastmarkets RISI, the Chinese government's actions have led to a severe shortage of recovered paper in China, which has forced mills to incur additional downtime. Chinese containerboard producers have been looking to build capacity for fiber in Southeast Asia, with the intent to ship pulp back to China for further processing. These policies have and could in the future continue to have a significant influence on the price, nature and availability of the type of paper imported into China, could have a negative effect on the operating capacity of our customers in China, and have and may in the future continue to affect the demand for our products and our operating results in China and the surrounding region.\nOur sales of capital equipment in China tend to be more variable and are subject to a number of uncertainties.\nOur bookings and revenues from China have tended to be more variable than in other geographic regions. The Chinese pulp and paper industry has experienced periods of significant capacity expansion to meet demand followed by periods of reduced activity while overcapacity is absorbed. These cycles result in periods of significant bookings activity for our capital products and increased revenues followed by a significant decrease in bookings or potential delays in shipments and order placements by our customers as they attempt to balance supply and demand.\nOrders from customers in China, particularly for large stock-preparation systems that have been tailored to a customer's specific requirements, have credit risks higher than we generally incur elsewhere, and some orders are subject to the receipt of financing approvals from the Chinese government or can be impacted by the availability of credit and more restrictive monetary policies. We generally do not record bookings for signed contracts from customers in China for large stock-preparation systems until we receive the down payments for such contracts. The timing of the receipt of these orders and the down payments are uncertain and there is no assurance that we will be able to recognize revenue on these contracts. We may experience a loss if a contract is canceled prior to the receipt of a down payment if we have commenced engineering or other work associated with the contract or we may not be able to retain a down payment. We typically have inventory awaiting shipment to customers and could incur a loss if contracts are canceled and we cannot re-sell the equipment. In addition, we may experience a loss if the contract is canceled, or the customer does not fulfill its obligations under the contract, prior to the receipt of a letter of credit or final payments covering the remaining balance of the contract, which could represent a significant portion of the total order. As a result of these factors, our revenues recognized in China have varied, and will in the future vary from period to period and be difficult to predict.\nOur results of operations may be adversely affected by currency fluctuations.\nAs a multinational corporation, we are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates that impact our business in many ways. We are exposed to both translation as well as transaction risk associated with transactions denominated in currencies that differ from our subsidiaries' functional currencies. Although most of our subsidiaries' costs are denominated in the same currency as their revenues, changes in the relative values of currencies occur from time to time and can adversely affect our operating results. Some of the foreign currency translation risk is mitigated when foreign subsidiaries have revenue and expenses in the same foreign currency. Further, certain foreign subsidiaries may hold U.S. dollar assets or liabilities which, as the U.S. dollar strengthens versus the applicable functional currencies, will result in currency transaction gains on assets or losses on liabilities. While some foreign currency transaction risks can be hedged using derivatives or other financial instruments, or may be insurable, such attempts to mitigate these risks may be costly and may not always be successful.\nKadant Inc.\nWhen we translate the local currency results of our foreign subsidiaries into U.S. dollars during a period in which the U.S. dollar is strengthening, our financial results will reflect decreases due to foreign currency translation. In addition, our consolidated financial results are adversely affected when foreign governments devalue their currencies. Our major foreign currency translation exposures involve the currencies in Europe, China, Brazil, Canada, and Mexico. For example, China's central bank has previously devalued the renminbi to boost the Chinese economy, which had a negative translation impact on our consolidated revenues and may in the future have a negative translation impact if this recurs. The overall favorable or unfavorable effect of foreign currency translation on our financial results will vary by quarter. We do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments to hedge this type of foreign currency translation risk.\nEconomic conditions and regulatory changes caused by the United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the European Union could adversely affect our business.\nThe United Kingdom's (U.K.) exit from the European Union (E.U.), referred to as Brexit, which was effective as of January 31, 2020, and the related transition period which ended on December 31, 2020, has caused, and may from time to time cause volatility in the global stock markets, currency exchange rate fluctuations, effects on cross border trade and labor, and political and regulatory uncertainty in the U.K. and across Europe generally.\nThe global economic uncertainty that has occurred and may continue to occur may cause our customers to closely monitor their costs and reduce their spending budgets. Our revenues to customers in the U.K. represented approximately 3% of total revenues in 2021. All of these events, should they occur, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Regulation of our Business and Industry\nOperating globally subjects us to changes in government regulations and policies in multiple jurisdictions around the world, including those related to tariffs and trade barriers, taxation, exchange controls and political risks.\nChanges in government policies, political unrest, economic sanctions, trade embargoes, or other adverse trade regulations can negatively impact our business. Non-U.S. markets contribute a substantial portion of our revenues, and we intend to continue expanding our presence in these regions. For example, we operate businesses in Mexico and Canada, and we benefited from the North American Free Trade Agreement, which has been replaced by the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), from which we also benefit. If the United States were to withdraw from or materially modify the USMCA or impose significant tariffs or taxes on goods imported into the United States, the cost of our products could significantly increase or no longer be priced competitively, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIn addition, the Office of the United States Trade Representative has imposed tariffs on a wide variety of products from China, including pulp and paper machinery equipment, pursuant to Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974. The tariffs on pulp and paper machinery are set at 25%. In addition, the U.S. Department of Commerce has imposed tariffs of 25% on numerous categories of steel imports, and 10% on numerous categories of aluminum imports, from most countries under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. While we try to mitigate the impact of the existing and other proposed tariffs through pricing and sourcing strategies, we cannot be certain how our customers and competitors will react to the actions we take. The tariffs have and could in the future negatively affect our ability to compete against competitors who do not manufacture in China and/or are not subject to the tariffs.\nThe United States has tightened trade sanctions targeting countries like China and Russia. For example, since 2018 the United States has imposed various trade and economic sanctions targeting certain persons in Russia and certain types of business with Russia, and, as a result of the February 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the United States, the European Union, and many other countries have imposed sanctions on Russia, individuals in Russia and Russian businesses, including several large banks. In 2021, our sales to Russia were $10.7 million, or 1% of our revenue. The United States has continued to expand export control restrictions applicable to certain Chinese firms and continued its assessment of new controls for \u201cemerging foundational technologies,\u201d escalating U.S.-China tension over technology competition. In response, Russia and China have begun considering and, in some cases, implementing trade sanctions that could affect U.S.-owned businesses. The imposition of trade sanctions may, and with respect to the Ukraine-related sanctions are expected to, make it generally more difficult to do business in Russia and China and cause delays or prevent shipment of products or services performed by our personnel, or to receive payment for products or services. Such restrictions could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results going forward.\nWe are required to comply with a wide variety of laws and regulations, and are subject to regulation by various federal, state and foreign agencies.\nWe are subject to various local, state, federal, foreign and transnational laws and regulations, particularly those relating to environmental protection, the importation and exportation of products, tariffs and trade barriers, taxation, exchange controls,\nKadant Inc.\ncurrent good manufacturing practices, data protection, health and safety and our business practices in the U.S. and abroad, such as anti-corruption and anti-competition laws, and, in the future, any changes to such laws and regulations could adversely affect us. Any noncompliance by us with applicable laws and regulations or the failure to maintain, renew or obtain necessary permits and licenses could result in criminal, civil and administrative penalties and could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe are subject to risks and costs associated with environmental laws and regulations.\nThe manufacturing of our products requires the use of hazardous materials that are subject to a broad array of environmental, health and safety laws and regulations. Our failure to manage the use, transportation, emissions, discharge, storage, recycling, or disposal of hazardous materials could lead to increased costs or regulatory penalties, fines and legal liability. Our ability to expand, modify or operate our manufacturing facilities in the future may be impeded by environmental regulations, such as air quality, wastewater requirements, and energy supply and use restrictions. The Chinese government has pledged to tackle the country's hazardous smog and improve air quality conditions, which has prompted authorities to impose strict pollution control measures when certain pollution levels are detected and ahead of high-profile events. Regulators have in the past and may in the future temporarily restrict the operations of our manufacturing facilities in a particular geographic location as a result of attempts to control pollution levels, or energy supply or use restrictions in China. Environmental laws and regulations could also require us to acquire pollution abatement or remediation equipment, modify product designs, or incur other expenses. New regulations promulgated in reaction to climate change could result in increased manufacturing costs associated with air pollution control or energy requirements, and increased or new monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions. We also see the potential for higher energy costs driven by climate change regulations. Implementation of such new regulations could increase our costs or require us to modify our operations and negatively impact our business and results of operations.\nEnvironmental, health and mine safety laws and regulations impacting the mining industry may adversely affect demand for products manufactured by our Material Handling segment.\nSMH, which is in our Material Handling segment, supplies equipment to mining companies operating in major mining regions throughout the world. SMH\u2019s customers\u2019 operations are subject to or affected by a wide array of regulations in the jurisdictions where they operate, including those directly impacting mining activities and those indirectly affecting their businesses, such as applicable environmental and mine safety laws. New environmental and health legislation or administrative regulations relating to mining or affecting demand for mined materials or more stringent interpretations of existing laws and regulations, may require SMH\u2019s customers to significantly change or curtail their operations. The mining industry has also encountered increased scrutiny as it relates to safety regulations. New legislation or regulations and the high cost of compliance with such regulations relating to mine safety standards may induce customers to discontinue or limit their mining operations and may discourage companies from developing new mines or maintaining existing mines, which in turn could diminish demand for our products and services. As a result of these factors, demand for SMH\u2019s mining equipment could be adversely affected by environmental and health regulations directly or indirectly impacting the mining industry. Any reduction in demand for SMH\u2019s products as a result of environmental, health or mine safety regulations could have an adverse effect on SMH\u2019s and our overall business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Related to Indebtedness and our Credit Agreement\nOur debt may adversely affect our cash flow and may restrict our investment opportunities.\nWe have borrowed amounts under our five-year, unsecured multi-currency revolving credit facility (Credit Agreement) and under other agreements to fund our operations and our acquisition strategy. Our borrowing capacity under the Credit Agreement may decrease as a result of the impact that foreign exchange rate fluctuations could have on our foreign-denominated borrowings.\nPursuant to the Credit Agreement, we have a borrowing capacity of $400.0 million with an uncommitted, unsecured incremental borrowing facility of $150.0 million with a maturity date of December 14, 2023. In 2018, we also issued $10.0 million in senior notes under our Multi-Currency Note Purchase and Private Shelf Agreement with PGIM, Inc., an affiliate of Prudential (Note Purchase Agreement). We may also in the future obtain additional long-term debt and working capital lines of credit to meet future financing needs, which would have the effect of increasing our total leverage. Our indebtedness could have negative consequences, including:\n-\nincreasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions;\n-\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing;\n-\nlimiting our ability to pay dividends on or to repurchase our capital stock;\nKadant Inc.\n-\nlimiting our ability to complete a merger or an acquisition or acquire new products and technologies through acquisitions or licensing agreements; and\n-\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we compete.\nOur existing indebtedness bears interest at fixed and floating rates, and as a result, our interest payment obligations on our indebtedness will fluctuate if interest rates increase or decrease. From time to time, we hedge a portion of our variable rate interest payment obligations through interest rate swap agreements. The counterparty to the swap agreements could demand an early termination of the swap agreements if we were to be in default under the Credit Agreement, or any agreement that amends or replaces the Credit Agreement in which the counterparty is a member, and we were unable to cure the default. If our swap agreements were to be terminated prior to the applicable scheduled maturity date and if we were required to pay cash for the value of the swap, we could incur a loss, which could adversely affect our financial results.\nIn addition, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (2017 Tax Act) places certain limitations on the deductibility of interest expense as a percentage of adjusted taxable income. If interest rates or the level of our debt increase, to the extent that the associated interest expense exceeds the limitation established by the 2017 Tax Act, the amount of interest expense that we would not be able to deduct for income tax purposes, if significant, could adversely affect our financial results and cash flows.\nOur ability to satisfy our obligations and to reduce our total debt depends on our future operating performance and on economic, financial, competitive, and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flows to meet these obligations or to successfully execute our business strategy. If we were unable to service our debt and fund our business, we could be forced to reduce or delay capital expenditures or research and development expenditures, seek additional financing or equity capital, restructure or refinance our debt, curtail or eliminate our cash dividend to stockholders, or sell assets.\nRestrictions in our Credit Agreement and Note Purchase Agreement may limit our activities.\nOur Credit Agreement and the Note Purchase Agreement contain, and future debt instruments to which we may become subject may contain, restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit us, including restrictions on our ability (including the ability of our subsidiaries) to: incur additional indebtedness; pay dividends on, redeem, or repurchase our capital stock; make investments; create liens; sell assets; enter into transactions with affiliates; and consolidate, merge, or transfer all or substantially all of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries.\nWe are also required to meet specified financial covenants under the terms of our Credit Agreement and the Note Purchase Agreement. Our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance, which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors, including factors that are beyond our control. Our failure to comply with any of these restrictions or covenants may result in an event of default under our Credit Agreement, the Note Purchase Agreement, our swap agreement and other loan and note obligations, which could permit acceleration of the debt under those instruments and require us to repay the debt before its scheduled due date. If an event of default were to occur, we might not have sufficient funds available to make the payments required under our indebtedness. In addition, our inability to borrow funds under our Credit Agreement would have significant consequences for our business, including reducing funds available for acquisitions and other investments in our business; and impacting our ability to pay dividends and meet other financial obligations.\nFurthermore, our Credit Agreement requires that any amounts borrowed under the facility be repaid by the maturity date in 2023. If we are unable to roll over the amounts borrowed into a new credit facility and we do not have sufficient cash to repay our borrowings, we may default under the Credit Agreement. We may need to repatriate cash from our overseas operations, which may not be possible, to fund the repayment and we may be required to pay taxes on the repatriated amounts. Such repatriation would have an adverse effect on our effective tax rate and cash flows.\nOur Credit Agreement has variable interest tied to the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and we could become subject to higher interest rates if the replacement rate we agree on with our banks is higher.\nBorrowings under our Credit Agreement use LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate for our LIBOR Loans, as defined in the Credit Agreement. LIBOR has been the subject of national, international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. These reforms and other pressures will cause LIBOR to disappear entirely or to perform differently than in the past. In 2021, we amended the Credit Agreement to include customary provisions to provide for the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative benchmark rate when any applicable tenor of LIBOR ceases to be available. In addition, we may need to amend other financial or contractual obligations that use LIBOR, and we cannot predict what alternative benchmark would be negotiated with our counterparties. We may incur additional expenses to amend such agreements to reference the alternative benchmark, which may differ significantly from LIBOR. Accordingly, the use of an alternative benchmark could result in increased costs, including increased interest expense on our Credit Agreement borrowings and increased borrowing\nKadant Inc.\ncosts in the future, and could adversely affect our available cash flow for general corporate requirements. At this time, we are unable to predict the effect of any such alternatives to LIBOR on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nAdverse changes to the soundness of financial institutions could affect us.\nWe have relationships with many financial institutions, including lenders under our credit facilities and insurance underwriters, and from time to time we execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry, such as our interest rate swap agreements and other hedging transactions. In addition, our subsidiaries in China often hold banker's acceptance drafts that are received from customers in the normal course of business. These drafts may be discounted or used to pay vendors prior to the scheduled maturity date or submitted to an acceptance bank for payment at the scheduled maturity date. These financial institutions or counterparties could be adversely affected by volatile conditions in the financial markets, economic downturns, and difficult economic conditions. These conditions could result in financial instability, bankruptcy, or other adverse effects at these financial institutions or counterparties. We may not be able to access credit facilities in the future, complete transactions as intended, or otherwise obtain the benefit of the arrangements we have entered into with such financial parties, which could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Capital Stock\nOur share price fluctuates and experiences price and volume volatility.\nStock markets in general and our common stock in particular experience significant price and volume volatility from time to time. The market price and trading volume of our common stock may continue to be subject to significant fluctuations due not only to general stock market conditions but also to a change in sentiment in the market regarding our operations, business prospects, or future funding. Given the nature of the markets in which we participate and the volatility of orders, we may not be able to reliably predict future revenues and profitability, and unexpected changes may cause us to adjust our operations. A large proportion of our costs are fixed, due in part to our significant selling, research and development, and manufacturing costs. Thus, small declines in revenues could disproportionately affect our operating results. Other factors that could affect our share price and quarterly operating results include:\n-\nchanges in the assumptions used for revenue recognized over time;\n-\nfluctuations in revenues due to customer-initiated delays in product shipments;\n-\nfailure of a customer to comply with an order's contractual obligations or inability of a customer to provide financial assurances of performance;\n-\nadverse changes in demand for and market acceptance of our products;\n-\nfailure of our products to pass contractually agreed upon acceptance tests, which could delay or prohibit recognition of revenues under applicable accounting guidelines;\n-\ncompetitive pressures resulting in lower sales prices for our products;\n-\nadverse changes in the process industries we serve;\n-\ndelays or problems in our introduction of new products or in the manufacture of our products;\n-\nour competitors' announcements of new products, services, or technological innovations;\n-\ncontractual liabilities incurred by us related to guarantees of our product performance;\n-\nincreased costs of raw materials or supplies, including the cost of energy;\n-\nchanges in the timing of product orders;\n-\nchanges in the estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, or expenses;\n-\nthe impact of acquisition accounting and the treatment of acquisition and restructuring costs as period costs;\n-\nfluctuations in our outstanding indebtedness and associated interest expense;\n-\nfluctuations in our effective tax rate;\n-\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;\n-\nthe operating and share price performance of companies that investors consider to be comparable to us; and\n-\nchanges in global financial markets and global economies and general market conditions.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could prevent or delay transactions that our shareholders may favor.\nProvisions of our charter and bylaws may discourage, delay, or prevent a merger or acquisition that our shareholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which shareholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares.\nKadant Inc.\nFor example, these provisions:\n-\nauthorize the issuance of \"blank check\" preferred stock without any need for action by shareholders;\n-\nprovide for a classified board of directors with staggered three-year terms;\n-\nrequire supermajority shareholder voting to effect various amendments to our charter and bylaws;\n-\neliminate the ability of our shareholders to call special meetings of shareholders;\n-\nprohibit shareholder action by written consent; and\n-\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by shareholders at shareholder meetings.\nOur board of directors could adopt a shareholder rights plan in the future that could have anti-takeover effects and might discourage, delay, or prevent a merger or acquisition that our board of directors does not believe is in our best interest and those of our shareholders, including transactions in which shareholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares.", "PERMNO": 78077, "SIC": 3550, "TIC": "KAI"}
