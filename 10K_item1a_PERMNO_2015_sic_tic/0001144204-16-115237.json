Risk Factors\nThe following is a description of those factors that we consider our key challenges and risks:\nFinancing future acquisitions may be difficult.\nOur principal challenge is the necessity to obtain financing in order to expand gaming operations. There can be no assurance that such financing will be obtained.\nIf our key personnel leave us, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur success is largely dependent upon the efforts and skills of our key executive officers. The loss of the services of any key executive officer could have a material adverse effect on us. There can be no assurance that we would be able to attract and hire suitable replacements in the event of any such loss of services. We currently have employment agreements with our President/Chief Executive Officer, our Vice President/Chief Financial Officer, our Vice President/Chief Compliance Officer and our Vice President/Washington Operations.\nIndebtedness could adversely affect our financial health.\nOn December 1, 2015, the Company and certain of its subsidiaries entered into a new $23,000,000 Reducing Revolving Credit Agreement with Mutual of Omaha Bank (the \u201cCredit Facility\u201d). The maturity date of the Credit Facility is November 30, 2020, and is secured by liens on substantially all of the real and personal property of the Company and its subsidiaries. At April 30, 2016, outstanding indebtedness was $17,172,777.\nAs of April 30, 2016, scheduled principal payments on the Credit Facility are as follows:\nThe Credit Facility contains customary covenants for a facility of this nature, including, but not limited to, covenants requiring the preservation and maintenance of the Company\u2019s assets and covenants restricting our ability to merge, transfer ownership, incur additional indebtedness, encumber assets and make certain investments. The Credit Facility also contains covenants requiring the Company to maintain certain financial ratios including a maximum total leverage ratio ranging from 3.00 to 1.00 through January 31, 2017, 2.75 to 1.00 from February 1, 2017 through January 31, 2018, and 2.50 to 1.00 from February 1, 2018 until maturity; and lease adjusted fixed charge coverage ratio of no less than 1.15 to 1.00. We are in compliance with the covenant requirements of the Credit Facility as of April 30, 2016.\nAs we increase our debt, our indebtedness could have important consequences and significant effects on our business and future operations. For example, it could:\n\u00b7 increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions or a downturn in our business;\n\u00b7 limit our ability to fund future working capital, capital expenditures and other general operating requirements;\n\u00b7 place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or greater resources; and\n\u00b7 limit our ability to borrow additional funds.\nThe occurrence of any one of these events or conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, prospects, ability to service or otherwise satisfy our obligations.\nWe will require cash to service our indebtedness and fund our gaming operations. Our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control.\nOur success in funding our gaming operations will depend on our ability to generate cash flow from our gaming operations. Our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations will depend on our future operating performance that is subject to many economic, competitive, regulatory and business factors that are beyond our control. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations, we will need to refinance or restructure our debt, sell assets, reduce or delay capital investments or seek to raise additional capital. These measures may not be available to us or, if available, they may not be sufficient to enable us to satisfy our obligations and may restrict our ability to pay operating expenses. If our cash flow is insufficient and we are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives, we may not be able to service our debt obligations or fund our gaming operations.\nWe face significant competition from other gaming operations that could have a material adverse effect on our future operations.\nThere is intense competition among companies in the gaming industry, many of which have significantly greater resources than we do. We compete with numerous casinos of varying quality and size in market areas where our properties are located. The gaming business is characterized by competitors that vary considerably by their size, quality of facilities, number of operations, brand identities, marketing and growth strategies, financial strength and capabilities, level of amenities, management talent and geographic diversity. In most markets, we compete directly with other casino facilities in the immediate and surrounding market areas. If our competitors operate more successfully, if competitors\u2019 properties are enhanced or expanded, or if additional casinos are established in and around locations in which we conduct business, we may lose market share. The expansion of casino gaming in or near any geographic area from which we attract or expect to attract a significant number of our customers could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to extensive governmental gaming regulation that could adversely affect us. We could be prevented from pursuing future development projects caused by changes in the laws, regulations and ordinances (including tribal or local laws) that apply to gaming facilities or the inability of us or our key personnel, significant shareholders or joint venture partners to obtain or retain gaming regulatory licenses.\nThe gaming industry is highly regulated and we must maintain our licenses in order to continue our operations. Each of our gaming operations is subject to extensive regulation under the laws, rules and regulations of the jurisdiction where located. These laws, rules and regulations generally concern the responsibility, financial stability and character of the owners, managers, and persons with financial interests in the gaming operations. Certain jurisdictions empower their regulators to investigate participation by licensees in gaming outside their jurisdiction and require access to and periodic reports concerning the gaming activities. Violations of laws in one jurisdiction could result in disciplinary action in other jurisdictions. Regulatory authorities have broad powers with respect to the licensing of casino operations and may revoke, suspend, condition or limit our gaming or other licenses, impose substantial fines and take other actions, any one of which could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe rapidly changing political and regulatory environment governing the gaming industry (including gaming operations which are conducted on Indian land) makes it impossible for us to accurately predict the effects that an adoption of or changes in the gaming laws, regulations and ordinances will have on us. However, the failure of us, or any of our key personnel, significant shareholders or joint venture partners, to obtain or retain required gaming regulatory licenses could prevent us from expanding into new markets, prohibit us from generating revenues in certain jurisdictions, and subject us to sanctions and fines.\nOur business is subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations in addition to gaming regulations. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages, environmental matters, employees, currency transactions, taxation, zoning and building codes, and marketing and advertising. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. Material changes, new laws or regulations, or material differences in interpretations by courts or governmental authorities could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Legislative changes beyond our control such as minimum wage and tax rates, among others, may impact our profitability. We cannot ensure that we will be able to comply with or conduct business in accordance with applicable regulations.\nWe could fail to monetize recorded assets.\nWe have receivables that are expected to be collected. If we are not able to collect or monetize these assets timely, the lack of such collection may have a negative impact on our projected cash flow. Failure to monetize our recorded assets could have adverse effects on our business, financial condition, results of operations, prospects, ability to service or otherwise satisfy our obligations.\nOur information technology and other systems are subject to cyber security risk including misappropriation of customer information or other breaches of information security.\nWe rely on information technology and other systems to maintain and transmit customers' personal and financial information, credit card settlements, credit card funds transmissions, and mailing lists. We have taken steps designed to safeguard our customers' confidential personal information. However, our information and processes are subject to the ever-changing threat of compromised security, in the form of a risk of potential breach, system failure, computer virus, or unauthorized or fraudulent use by customers, company employees, or employees of third party vendors. The steps we take to deter and mitigate these risks may not be successful, and any resulting compromise or loss of data or systems could adversely impact operations or regulatory compliance and could result in remedial expenses, fines, litigation, disclosures, and loss of reputation, potentially impacting our financial results. Further, as cyber-attacks continue to evolve, we may incur significant costs in our attempts to modify or enhance our protective measures or investigate or remediate any vulnerability.\nThere are significant risks in the development and management of casinos that could adversely affect our financial results.\nThe development and management of casinos require the satisfaction of various conditions, many of which are beyond our control. The failure to satisfy any of such conditions may significantly delay the completion of a project or prevent a project's completion altogether.\nThe opening of any facility will be contingent upon, among other things, the receipt of all regulatory licenses, permits, approvals and authorizations, the completion of construction and the hiring and training of sufficient personnel. The scope of the approvals to construct and open a casino is extensive, and the failure to obtain such approvals could prevent or delay the completion of construction or opening of all or part of such casino. No assurance can be given that development activities will begin or will be completed, or that the budget for such a project will not be exceeded, or that we will have the continuing support of the community.\nIn addition, the regulatory approvals necessary for the construction and operation of casinos are often challenged in litigation brought by government entities, citizens groups and other organizations and individuals. Such litigation can significantly delay the construction and opening of casinos.\nMajor construction projects entail significant risks, including shortages of materials or skilled labor, unforeseen engineering, environmental and/or geological problems, work stoppages, weather interference, and unanticipated cost increases. Delays or difficulties in obtaining any of the requisite licenses, permits, allocations and authorizations from regulatory authorities could increase the total cost, delay or prevent the construction or opening of any casino development. In addition, once developed, no assurances can be given that we will be able to manage the casino on a profitable basis or to attract a sufficient number of guests, gaming customers and other visitors to make the operation profitable.\nWith each project, we are subject to the risk that our investment may be lost if the project cannot obtain adequate financing to complete development and open the casino successfully. In some cases, we may be forced to provide more financing than originally planned in order to complete development, thereby increasing our risk.", "PERMNO": 60709, "SIC": 7990, "TIC": "UWN"}
