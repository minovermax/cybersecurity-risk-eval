RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider each of the following risks, which we believe are the principal risks that we face and of which we are currently aware, and all of the other information in this report. Some of the risks described below relate to our business, while others relate to the Spin-off. Other risks relate principally to the securities markets and ownership of our common stock.\nShould any of the following risks and uncertainties develop into actual events, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nWe face the following risks in connection with the general conditions and trends of the industry in which we operate:\nWe are dependent on the U.S. government\u2019s presence and operations in Afghanistan for a material portion of our revenue and operating income, and the announced withdrawal of military personnel and suspension or removal of funding for security and training activities in the region by the U.S. government may have an adverse effect on our revenue and operating income prospects.\nWe derived approximately $270.1 million, $513.1 million and $624.9 million of our revenue and $24.3 million, $91.4 million and $75.2 million of our operating income for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, from services ultimately sold to the U.S. government for contracts based in Afghanistan. This reflected a decrease of 47% in revenue and decrease of 73% in operating income for the 2014 period as compared to 2013, and a decrease of 18% in revenue and an increase of 21% in operating income for the 2013 period as compared to 2012. These amounts represented 22%, 34% and 34% of our overall revenue, respectively, for these periods. Our company has four large contracts with operations in Afghanistan, with work in each of our major capability areas; infrastructure asset management, logistics and supply chain management, and information technology and network communication services. Afghanistan contracts have experienced lower program activity in 2014 due to reduced service level requirements. U.S. funding for programs in Afghanistan has decreased in recent periods, and is expected to continue to decrease as the U.S. government plans to reduce the U.S. presence in Afghanistan. In May 2014, the Obama Administration announced its plan to steadily withdraw U.S. forces in Afghanistan by 2016. It is expected that the U.S. military will maintain a presence after the subsequent transition to the Afghan government. This withdrawal of military personnel and suspension or removal of funding for security and training activities in Afghanistan by the U.S. government will have an adverse effect on our revenue and operating income prospects.\nWe are dependent on the U.S. government and if our reputation or relationship with the U.S. government was harmed, our revenue and growth prospects could be adversely affected.\nAll of our 2014 revenue and 2013 revenue was derived from services ultimately sold to the U.S. government, primarily the DoD, either as a prime contractor or as a subcontractor to other contractors engaged in work for the U.S. government. For the year ended December 31, 2014, we generated approximately 88% of our total revenue from the U.S. Army. We expect to continue to derive all or most of our revenue from work performed under U.S. government contracts. Our reputation and relationship with the U.S. government, and in particular with the branches and agencies of the DoD, are key factors in maintaining and growing this revenue. Negative press reports or publicity, which could pertain to employee or subcontractor misconduct, conflicts of interest, termination of a contract or task order, poor contract performance, deficiencies in services, reports or other deliverables, information security breaches or other aspects of our business, regardless of accuracy, could harm our reputation, particularly with these branches and agencies. If our reputation is negatively affected, or if we lose our ability to conduct business in a foreign country (i.e., business license), or if we lose a required security clearance, or if we are suspended or debarred from contracting with government agencies or any branch of the DoD for any reason, the amount of our business with the U.S. government and other customers would decrease and our future revenue and growth prospects would be adversely affected.\nA significant portion of our revenue is derived from a few large contracts, and the loss or material reduction of any of these contracts could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nAggregate revenue from our four largest contracts amounted to approximately $822.0 million, or 68%, of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014. These four contracts: the Kuwait Base Operations and Security Support Services (K-BOSSS) contract for Camp Arifjan, Kuwait; the Operations, Maintenance and Defense of Army Communications in Southwest Asia and Central Asia (OMDAC-SWACA) contract; the Logistics Civilian Augmentation\nProgram (LOGCAP) contract and the Kuwait based Army Prepositioned Stocks-5 (APS-5 Kuwait) contract each accounted for more than 10% of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014. Accordingly, our results of operations and cash flows are highly dependent on these contracts. The loss or material reduction of any of these contracts would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nA decline in the U.S. government defense budget, changes in spending or budgetary priorities or delays in contract awards may significantly and adversely affect our future revenue and limit our growth prospects. Further, because we depend on U.S. government contracts, a delay in the completion of the U.S. government\u2019s budget process could delay procurement of the services and solutions we provide and have an adverse effect on our future revenue.\nOur contracts and revenue are correlated primarily with and dependent upon the U.S. defense budget which is subject to the congressional budget authorization and appropriations process. Congress usually appropriates funds for a given program on a September 30 fiscal year basis, even though contract periods of performance may extend over many years. Consequently, at the beginning of a major program, the contract is usually partially funded, and additional monies are normally committed to the contract by the procuring agency only as appropriations are made by Congress in future fiscal years. DoD budgets are a function of several factors beyond our control, including, but not limited to, changes in U.S. procurement policies, budget considerations, current and future economic conditions, presidential administration priorities, changing national security and defense requirements, geo-political developments and actual fiscal year congressional appropriations for defense budgets. Any of these factors could result in a significant redirection of current and future DoD budgets and impact our future operations and cash flows. Such factors may have direct bearing on new business opportunities as well as on whether the U.S. government will exercise its options for services under existing contracts, thus affecting the timing and volume of our business.\nFor example, the Budget Control Act of 2011 (Budget Control Act) established limits on discretionary government spending, which included an approximate $487 billion reduction in defense spending over a ten-year period, governmental fiscal year 2012 through 2021. If discretionary spending limits are surpassed then additional cuts of up to $500 billion, through a process known as \"sequestration,\" are possible over the same time period.\nThe sequestration went into effect in government fiscal year 2013 and required national defense spending reductions of approximately $43 billion for 2013. However, in December 2013, the U.S. Government enacted the Bipartisan Budget Act, which reduced the overall impact of sequestration cuts in government fiscal year 2014 and 2015. Unless another agreement is reached, further cuts to defense spending from sequestration remain possible through government fiscal year 2021.\nThe President's fiscal year 2016 total budget request for DoD O&M increased $3.7 billion to $250.0 billion versus the 2015 enacted amount of $246.3 billion. However, this amount is above the limit of the Budget Control Act.\nThe U.S. government also conducts periodic reviews of U.S. defense strategies and priorities, which may shift DoD budgetary priorities, reduce overall U.S. government spending or delay contract or task order awards for defense related programs, potentially affecting future Vectrus revenue and earnings. In addition, changes to the DoD acquisition system and contracting models could affect whether and how we pursue certain opportunities and the terms under which we are able to do so. Overall, we expect that top-line defense spending will decline over the next several years. Such funding cuts will likely have an impact across the DoD budget. Such reductions in U.S. government spending and policy could have a material impact on our business.\nThe funding of U.S. government programs is subject to an annual congressional budget authorization and appropriation process. In years when the U.S. government does not complete its budget process before the end of its fiscal year on September 30, government operations are typically funded pursuant to a \u201ccontinuing resolution,\u201d which allows Federal government agencies to operate at spending levels approved in the previous budget cycle, but does not authorize new spending initiatives. When the U.S. government operates under a continuing resolution, delays can occur in the procurement of the services and solutions that we provide and may result in new initiatives being cancelled. In addition, when supplemental appropriations are required to operate the U.S. government or fund specific programs and the passage of legislation needed to approve any supplemental appropriation bill is delayed, the overall funding environment for our business could be adversely affected.\nCompetition within our markets and an increase in bid protests may reduce our revenue and market share.\nOur business is highly competitive and we compete with larger companies that have greater name recognition, greater financial resources and larger technical staffs. We also compete with smaller, more specialized\ncompanies that are able to concentrate their resources on particular areas. Additionally, we compete with the U.S. government\u2019s own capabilities.\nThe markets in which we operate are characterized by the changing needs of our customers. Accordingly, our success depends on our ability to provide services that address these changing needs. To remain competitive, we must consistently provide superior service and performance on a cost-effective basis to our customers. Our competitors may be able to provide our customers with different or greater capabilities or better contract terms than we can provide, including past contract experience, geographic presence, price and the availability of qualified professional personnel. Moreover, even if we are qualified to work on a government contract, we may not be awarded the contract because of existing government policies designed to protect small businesses and under-represented minority contractors. In addition, our competitors may consolidate or establish teaming or other relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase their ability to address customers\u2019 needs. Accordingly, we anticipate that larger or new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge which may adversely affect our ability to compete.\nIf we are unable to continue to compete successfully against our current or future competitors, we may experience declines in revenue and market share which could negatively impact our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nThe competitive environment is also affected by bid protests from unsuccessful bidders. Bid protests could result in the award decision being overturned, requiring a renewed competition of the contract. Even where a bid protest does not result in a renewed competition, the resolution typically extends the time until the contract activity can begin, which may reduce our earnings in the period in which the contract would otherwise have commenced.\nWe may not be successful in winning new contracts, which will have an adverse impact on our business and prospects.\nOur contracts and task orders with the federal government are typically awarded through a competitive bidding process. This competitive bidding process presents a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nwe may bid on programs for which the work activities, deliverables, and timelines are vague or incompletely describe the actual work, which may result in pricing assumptions that are too high or too low; and\n\u2022\nwe may encounter expense and delay if our competitors protest or challenge awards of contracts to us in competitive bidding, and any such protest or challenge could result in the resubmission of bids on modified specifications, or in the termination, reduction or modification of the awarded contract.\nBecause our contracts are typically for a fixed duration, if we are unable to win a particular new contract, we may be prevented from providing the client the services that are purchased under that contract for a number of years. If we are unable to consistently win new contract awards over any extended period, or to the degree expected, our business and prospects will be adversely affected and our actual results may differ materially and adversely from those anticipated.\nThe non-renewal or termination of our existing U.S. government contracts may adversely affect our business.\nThe U.S. government services marketplace is characterized by contracts of shorter duration as compared to large production and systems integration programs. Services contracts generally are of a finite duration of five years and may range between three and ten years. Upon expiration of a contract, if the customer requires further services of the type provided by the contract, there is frequently a competitive rebidding process. There can be no assurance that we will be able to renew or replace our current contracts upon expiration or completion. In addition, the U.S. government may terminate any of our government contracts, in whole or in part, at any time at its convenience with little or no notice. Additionally, the U.S. government may terminate our contract for default if we fail to meet our obligations under a contract. If any of our contracts were to be terminated for convenience, we generally would be entitled to receive payment for work completed and allowable termination or cancellation costs. If any of our government contracts were to be terminated for default, generally the customer would pay only for the work that has been accepted; moreover, the customer can require us to pay the difference between the original contract price and the cost to re-procure the contract items, net of the work accepted from the original contract. In addition, the U.S. government can also hold us liable for damages resulting from the default.\nThe expiration, non-renewal or termination of any of our government contracts, whether for convenience or default, would adversely affect our current programs and reduce our revenue, earnings or cash flows. A termination for default may also negatively affect our reputation, performance ratings and our ability to win new contracts, particularly for contracts covering the same or similar types of services.\nAs a U.S. government contractor, we are subject to a number of procurement regulations and could be adversely affected by changes in regulations or any failure to comply with these regulations.\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and must comply with many significant procurement regulations and other requirements. These regulations and requirements, although customary in government contracts, increase our performance and compliance costs. If any such regulations or procurement requirements change, our costs of complying with them could increase and therefore reduce our margins. Some significant statutes and regulations that affect us include:\n\u2022\nthe FAR and department or agency-specific regulations that implement or supplement FAR, such as the DoD\u2019s Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement, which regulate the formation, administration and performance of U.S. government contracts;\n\u2022\nthe Truth in Negotiations Act, which requires certification and disclosure of cost and pricing data in connection with certain contract negotiations;\n\u2022\nthe Procurement Integrity Act, which regulates access to competitor bid and proposal information and government source selection information, and our ability to provide compensation to certain former government officials;\n\u2022\nthe Civil False Claims Act, which provides for substantial civil penalties for violations, including for submission of a false or fraudulent claim to the U.S. government for payment or approval; and\n\u2022\nthe U.S. government Cost Accounting Standards, which impose accounting requirements that govern our right to reimbursement under certain cost-based U.S. government contracts.\nIf we are convicted or otherwise found to have violated these or other laws or regulations, or are found not to have acted responsibly as defined by them, we may be subject to reductions of the value of contracts, contract modifications or termination and the assessment of penalties and fines, compensatory damages or treble damages, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Such findings or convictions could also result in suspension or debarment from government contracting. Given our dependence on government contracting, suspension or debarment would have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOur business is subject to reviews, investigations, audits and cost adjustments by the U.S. government, which, if resolved unfavorably to us, could adversely affect our profitability, cash position or growth prospects.\nU.S. government agencies, including the DCAA, the DCMA and others, routinely audit and review a contractor\u2019s performance on government contracts, indirect rates and pricing practices, and compliance with applicable contracting and procurement laws, regulations and standards. They also review the adequacy of the contractor\u2019s compliance with government standards for its business systems, including its accounting system, earned value management system, estimating system, materials management system, purchasing system and property management system.\nBoth contractors and the U.S. government agencies conducting these audits and reviews have come under increased scrutiny. As a result, audits and reviews have become more rigorous and the standards to which we are held are being more strictly interpreted and applied, increasing the likelihood of an audit or review resulting in an adverse outcome.\nA finding of significant control deficiencies in our system audits or other reviews can result in decremented billing rates to our U.S. government customers until the control deficiencies are corrected and our corrections are accepted by DCMA. Government audits and reviews may conclude that our practices are not consistent with applicable laws and regulations and result in adjustments to contract costs and mandatory customer refunds. Such adjustments can be applied retroactively, which could result in significant customer refunds. Our receipt of adverse audit findings or the failure to obtain an \u201capproved\u201d determination of our various accounting and management internal\ncontrol systems from the responsible U.S. government agency could significantly and adversely affect our business, including our ability to bid on new contracts and our competitive position in the bidding process. A determination of non-compliance with applicable contracting and procurement laws, regulations and standards could also result in the U.S. government imposing penalties and sanctions against us, including withholding of payments, suspension of payments and increased government scrutiny that could delay or adversely affect our ability to invoice and receive timely payment on contracts, perform contracts or compete for contracts with the U.S. government. In addition, the U.S. government, from time to time, may require its contractors to reduce certain contract prices, or may disallow costs allocated to certain contracts. These adjustments can involve substantial amounts. In the past, as a result of such audits and other investigations and inquiries, we have on occasion made adjustments to our contract prices and the costs allocated to our government contracts.\nWe are routinely subject to governmental investigations relating to our contracts and operations. If a review or investigation identifies improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties or administrative sanctions, including the termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, the triggering of price reduction clauses, suspension of payments, fines and suspension or debarment from doing business with governmental agencies. We may suffer harm to our reputation if allegations of impropriety are made against us, which would impair our ability to win new contract awards or receive contract renewals. Civil penalties and sanctions are not uncommon in our industry. If we incur a material penalty or administrative sanction or otherwise suffer harm to our reputation, our profitability, cash position and future prospects could be adversely affected.\nThe DoD continues to evolve its business practices, which could have a material effect on its overall procurement processes and adversely impact our current programs and potential new awards.\nThe DoD continues to pursue various initiatives designed to gain efficiencies and to focus and enhance business practices. These initiatives and resulting changes, such as increased usage of fixed price contracts, multiple award contracts and small business set-aside contracts, are having an impact on the contracting environment in which we do business. Any of these changes could impact our ability to obtain new contracts or renew our existing contracts when those contracts are re-competed. These initiatives are evolving, and the full impact to our business remains uncertain and subject to the manner in which the DoD implements them. Any new contracting requirements or procurement methods could be costly or administratively difficult for us to implement and could adversely affect our future revenue, profitability and prospects.\nWe incurred new indebtedness prior to consummation of the Spin-off, and the degree to which we are leveraged as an independent, publicly traded company may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nPrior to the Spin-off we relied upon Exelis for working capital requirements on a short-term basis and for other financial support functions. As an independent, publicly traded company, we cannot rely on the earnings, assets or cash flow of Exelis, and we are responsible for servicing our own debt, and obtaining and maintaining sufficient working capital. In connection with the Spin-off, we incurred borrowings of $140.0 million under a senior secured term facility and entered into a senior secured revolving facility permitting borrowings of up to $75.0 million. (See Note 6 \"Debt\" in the Notes to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements.) The proceeds from the senior secured term facility were used to fund a cash distribution to Exelis of approximately $136.3 million. We expect to incur higher debt servicing costs on the new indebtedness than we would have incurred otherwise as a subsidiary of Exelis and/or not have access to other less expensive sources of capital from short-term debt markets.\nOur ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness, including the debt incurred pursuant to the Spin-off, as well as any future debt that we may incur, will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future from operations, financings or asset sales. Our ability to generate cash is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. If we are not able to repay or refinance our debt as it becomes due, we may be forced to sell assets or take other disadvantageous actions, including (i) reducing financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes or (ii) dedicating an unsustainable level of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness. In addition, our ability to withstand competitive pressures and to react to changes in our industry could be impaired. The lenders who hold such debt could also accelerate amounts due, which could potentially trigger a default or acceleration of any of the Company's future debt.\nIn addition, we may increase our debt or raise additional capital, subject to restrictions in our credit agreement. If our cash flow from operations is less than we anticipate, or if our cash requirements are more than we expect, we may require more financing. However, debt or equity financing may not be available to us on terms\nacceptable to us, if at all. If we incur additional debt or raise equity through the issuance of preferred stock, the terms of the debt or preferred stock issued may give the holders rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock, particularly in the event of liquidation. The terms of the debt may also impose additional and more stringent restrictions on our operations than we currently have. If we raise funds through the issuance of additional equity, your percentage ownership in us would decline. If we are unable to raise additional capital when needed, it could affect our financial health, which could negatively affect your investment in us. Also, regardless of the terms of our debt or equity financing, the amount of our stock that we can issue may be limited because the issuance of our stock may cause the distribution to be a taxable event for Exelis under Section 355(e) of the Code, and under the Tax Matters Agreement we entered into with Exelis in connection with the Spin-off (the Tax Matters Agreement), we could be required to indemnify Exelis for that tax.\nOur level of indebtedness could limit our ability to finance our future operations and limit cash flow available for our operations.\nOur credit agreement contains a number of significant covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to:\n\u2022\ncreate liens and encumbrances;\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\nmerge, dissolve, liquidate or consolidate;\n\u2022\nmake acquisitions, investments, advances or loans;\n\u2022\ndispose of or transfer assets;\n\u2022\npay dividends or make other payments in respect of our capital stock;\n\u2022\namend certain material governance or debt documents;\n\u2022\nredeem or repurchase capital stock or prepay, redeem or repurchase certain debt;\n\u2022\nengage in certain transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nenter into speculative hedging arrangements; and\n\u2022\nenter into certain restrictive agreements.\nThese restrictions could impair our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or engage in other business activities that may be in our interests. In addition, the credit agreement also requires us to maintain compliance with certain financial ratios, including those relating to earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and consolidated indebtedness. Our ability to comply with these ratios and covenants may be affected by events beyond our control. A breach of the credit agreement or our inability to comply with the required financial ratios or covenants included therein could result in a default under the credit agreement. In the event of any such default, the lenders under the credit agreement could elect to:\n\u2022\ndeclare all outstanding debt, accrued interest and fees to be due and immediately payable;\n\u2022\ntake enforcement actions with respect to the collateral securing our debt; and\n\u2022\nrequire us to apply all of our available cash to repay our outstanding senior debt.\nOur variable rate indebtedness may expose us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt costs to increase significantly.\nOur term loan and revolving facility borrowings have variable rates of interest, which expose us to interest rate risks and to the risk of rising interest rates. As of December 31, 2014, we have approximately $137.4 million of aggregate debt outstanding, which consists of a floating-rate term loan (See Note 6 \"Debt\" in the Notes to the Consolidated and Combined Financial Statements). We also have the ability to incur up to $75.0 million of additional floating-rate debt under our revolving facility. If the LIBOR or other applicable base rates under our senior secured credit facilities increase in the future, then the interest expense on the floating-rate debt could increase materially.\nWe are subject to risks associated with operating internationally.\nOur U.S. government contracts operating internationally represented approximately 83% of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014. We are subject to a variety of U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including, without limitation foreign labor laws, business compliance, tax and anti-corruption laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Failure by us or our subcontractors or vendors to comply with these laws and regulations could result in administrative, civil, or criminal liabilities and could, in the extreme case, result in suspension or debarment from government contracts, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur business operations are also subject to a variety of risks associated with conducting business internationally, including, without limitation:\n\u2022\nChanges in or interpretations of foreign laws or policies that may adversely affect the performance of our services;\n\u2022\nPolitical instability in foreign countries;\n\u2022\nTerrorist activity by various groups in the areas in which we operate;\n\u2022\nImposition of inconsistent laws or regulations;\n\u2022\nConducting business in places where laws, business practices and customs are unfamiliar or unknown; and\n\u2022\nImposition of limitations on or increase in withholding and other taxes on payments by foreign operations.\nThe services we provide internationally, including through the use of subcontractors, are sometimes in countries with unstable governments, in areas of military conflict or at military installations. This increases the risk of an incident resulting in damage or destruction to our work or living sites or resulting in injury or loss of life to our employees, subcontractors or other third parties. We maintain insurance to mitigate risk and potential liabilities related to our international operations, but our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover these claims and liabilities and we may be forced to bear substantial costs arising from those claims. In addition, any accidents or incidents that occur in connection with our international operations could result in negative publicity for our company, which may adversely affect our reputation and make it more difficult for us to compete for future contracts or result in the loss of existing and future contracts. The impact of these factors is difficult to predict, but any one or more of them could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nWe may not be successful in expanding our geographic footprint or broadening our customer base, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business strategy is based, in part, on aligning our business development resources on opportunities in international regions, leveraging our leadership position in the Middle East with the U.S. Army and providing our full range of offerings to other U.S. government military and civil agencies. This business strategy involves a number of risks, including the risk that the expected results will not be achieved or that we will be unable to effectively execute this business strategy resulting in harm to our existing reputation or relationship with the U.S. government. These activities may also impose additional compliance burdens on us and could also subject us to enhanced regulatory scrutiny and greater risks associated with operating internationally. We may also incur additional expenditures in connection with our investments in new business opportunities and these investments may also result in losses and costs.\nThe success of our business strategy will depend on, among other things:\n\u2022\nthe availability of suitable opportunities;\n\u2022\nthe level of competition from other companies that may have greater financial resources;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain requisite approvals and licenses from the relevant governmental authorities and to comply with applicable laws and regulations without incurring undue costs and delays; and\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully negotiate and enter into beneficial arrangements with our customers.\nOur contract sites are inherently dangerous workplaces. Failure to maintain safe work sites and equipment could result in environmental disasters, employee deaths or injuries, reduced profitability, the loss of projects or customers and possible exposure to litigation.\nOur project sites often put our employees and others in close proximity with mechanized equipment, moving vehicles, and highly regulated materials. In addition, some of our project sites are in hostile and unstable environments, including war zones. If we fail to implement safety procedures or if the procedures we implement are ineffective, we may suffer the loss of or injury to our employees, as well as expose ourselves to possible litigation. As a result, our failure to maintain adequate safety standards and equipment, as well as the nature of the environment in which we conduct business, could result in reduced profitability or the loss of projects or customers, and could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nMisconduct of our employees, subcontractors, agents or business partners could cause us to lose customers and could have a significant adverse impact on our business and reputation, adversely affecting our ability to obtain new contracts.\nMisconduct, fraud or other improper activities by our employees, subcontractors, agents or business partners could have a significant adverse impact on our business and reputation. Such misconduct could include the failure to comply with Federal, state, local or foreign government procurement regulations, regulations regarding the protection of classified information, legislation regarding the pricing of labor and other costs in government contracts, laws and regulations relating to environmental matters, bribery of foreign government officials, lobbying or similar activities, boycotts, antitrust and any other applicable laws or regulations. Misconduct involving data security lapses resulting in the compromise of personal information or the improper use of our customer\u2019s sensitive or classified information could result in remediation costs, regulatory sanctions against us and serious harm to our reputation. Other examples of potential misconduct include falsifying time or other records and violations of the Anti-Kickback Act. Although we have implemented policies, procedures and controls to prevent and detect these activities, these precautions may not prevent all misconduct and as a result, we could face unknown risks or losses. Our failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations or misconduct by any of our employees, subcontractors, agents or business partners could subject us to fines and penalties, loss of security clearance, loss of current and future customer contracts and suspension or debarment from contracting with Federal, state or local government agencies, any of which would adversely affect our business, our reputation and our future financial results.\nWe use estimates in accounting for many of our programs and changes in our estimates could adversely affect our future financial results.\nRevenue from our contracts is recognized primarily using the percentage-of-completion method or on the basis of partial performance towards completion. These methodologies require estimates of total costs at completion, fees earned on the contract, or both. This estimation process, particularly due to the nature of the services being performed and the long-term nature of certain contracts, is complex and involves significant judgment. Adjustments to original estimates are often required as work progresses, experience is gained and additional information becomes known, even though the scope of the work required under the contract may not change. Any adjustment as a result of a change in estimates is recognized as events become known. Changes in the underlying assumptions, circumstances or estimates could result in adjustments that may adversely affect our future financial results.\nWe may not realize as revenue the full amounts reflected in our backlog, which could adversely affect our expected future revenue and growth prospects.\nAs of December 31, 2014, our total backlog was $2.9 billion, which included $814.0 million in funded backlog. Due to the U.S. government\u2019s ability to not exercise or award contract options or to terminate, modify or curtail our programs or contracts, we may realize less than expected or in some cases never realize revenue from some of the contracts that are included in our backlog. Our unfunded backlog, in particular, contains management\u2019s estimate of amounts expected to be realized on unfunded contract work that may never be realized as revenue. If we fail to realize as revenue amounts included in our backlog, our expected future revenue, growth prospects and profitability could be adversely affected.\nOur earnings and margins may vary based on the mix of our contracts, our performance, and our ability to control costs.\nWe generate revenue under various types of contracts, which include cost plus, cost reimbursement (including non-fee-bearing costs), time and materials (T&M), firm fixed price level of effort (FFP-LOE) and firm fixed\nprice (FFP). Our earnings and profitability may vary materially depending on changes in the proportionate amount of revenue derived from each type of contract, the nature of services provided, as well as the achievement of performance objectives and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees, particularly under incentive and award fee contracts, is finally determined. Cost reimbursement and T&M contracts generally have lower profitability than FFP contracts.\nOur profitability is adversely affected when we incur contract costs that we cannot bill to our customers. To varying degrees, each of our contract types involves some risk that we could underestimate the costs and resources necessary to fulfill the contract. While FFP contracts allow us to benefit from cost savings, these contracts also increase our exposure to the risk of cost overruns. Revenue derived from FFP contracts represented approximately 24% of our total revenue for fiscal 2014. When making proposals on FFP contracts, we rely heavily on our estimates of costs and timing for completing the associated projects, as well as assumptions regarding technical issues. In each case, our failure to accurately estimate costs or the resources needed to perform our contracts or to effectively manage and control our costs during the performance of our work could result in reduced profits or in losses. More generally, any increased or unexpected costs or unanticipated delays in connection with the performance of our contracts, including costs and delays caused by contractual disputes or other factors outside of our control, such as performance failures of our subcontractors, natural disasters or other force majeure events, could make our contracts less profitable than expected or unprofitable.\nThe failure to perform to customer expectations or contract requirements may result in reduced fees or claims made against us by our customers and may affect our financial performance in that period. Under each type of contract, if we are unable to control costs, our operating results could be adversely affected, particularly if we are unable to justify an increase in contract value to our customers. Cost overruns or the failure to perform on existing programs also may adversely affect our ability to retain existing programs and win future contract awards.\nOur earnings and margins depend, in part, on our ability to perform under contracts.\nWhen agreeing to contractual terms, our management makes assumptions and projections about future conditions and events, many of which extend over long periods. These projections assess the productivity and availability of labor, the complexity of the work to be performed, the cost and availability of materials and the impact of delayed performance. If we incur costs in excess of initial estimates or funding on a contract, we generally seek reimbursement for those costs but we may not be able to negotiate full recovery for these costs. We cannot predict the extent to which funding for any contract will be increased in the event actual costs significantly exceed our estimates, if at all. If there is a significant change in one or more of these circumstances or estimates, or if we face unanticipated contract costs that we are not able to recover, the profitability of one or more of these contracts may be adversely affected.\nOur earnings and margins depend, in part, on subcontractor performance.\nWe rely on other companies to perform some of the services that we provide to our customers. Disruptions or performance problems caused by our subcontractors could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers. Our ability to perform our obligations as a prime contractor could be adversely affected if one or more of the subcontractors is unable to provide the agreed-upon services in a timely and cost-effective manner.\nGoodwill represents a significant portion of our assets and any impairment of these assets could negatively impact our results of operations.\nAt December 31, 2014, our goodwill was approximately $216.9 million, which represented approximately 43% of our total assets. Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. We estimate the fair value of the reporting unit used in the goodwill impairment test using an income approach and market approach, and as a result the fair value measurements depend on revenue growth rates, future operating margin assumptions, risk-adjusted discount rates, future economic and market conditions, and identification of appropriate market comparable data. Because of the significance of our goodwill, any future impairment of this asset could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe depend on the recruitment and retention of qualified personnel, and our failure to attract and retain such personnel could seriously harm our business.\nDue to the specialized nature of our business, our future performance is highly dependent upon the continued\nservices of our personnel and executive officers, the development of additional management personnel and the hiring of new qualified technical, marketing, sales and management personnel for our operations. Competition for qualified personnel is intense, and we may not be successful in attracting or retaining qualified personnel. In addition, certain personnel may be required to receive security clearance and substantial training in order to work on certain contracts or perform certain tasks. We also employ international personnel and engage with foreign subcontractors and labor brokers, which requires compliance with numerous foreign laws and regulations related to labor, benefits, taxes, insurance and reporting requirements, among others. The loss of key employees, our inability to attract new qualified employees, adequately train employees or the delay in hiring key personnel could have an adverse effect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business depends upon obtaining and maintaining required facility security clearance and individual security clearances.\nMany of our federal government contracts require our employees to maintain various levels of security clearances and we are required to maintain certain facility security clearances complying with U.S. government requirements. Obtaining and maintaining security clearances for employees involves a lengthy process and it can be difficult to identify, recruit and retain employees who already hold security clearances. If our employees are unable to obtain or retain security clearances or if our employees who hold security clearances terminate employment with us, our ability to perform the work under the contract may be negatively affected, and the customer whose work requires cleared employees could terminate the contract or decide not to renew it upon its expiration. In addition, many of the contracts on which we bid require us to maintain a facility security clearance. To the extent we are not able to maintain a facility security clearance, we may not be able to bid on or win new contracts, or effectively re-bid on expiring contracts.\nSome of our workforce is represented by labor unions so our business could be harmed in the event of a prolonged work stoppage.\nApproximately 930 of our employees are unionized, which represents approximately 19% of our employee-base at December 31, 2014. As a result, we may experience work stoppages, which could adversely affect our business. We cannot predict how stable our union relationships will be or whether we will be able to successfully negotiate successor agreements without impacting our financial condition. In addition, the presence of unions may limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce. Work stoppages could negatively impact our ability to provide services to our customers on a timely basis, which could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur profitability could suffer if we are not able to maintain adequate staffing for our contracts.\nThe cost of providing our services, including the extent to which we utilize our workforce, affects our profitability. The rate at which we utilize our workforce is affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nour ability to transition employees from completed contracts to new assignments and to hire and assimilate new employees;\n\u2022\nour ability to hire personnel in foreign countries;\n\u2022\nour ability to manage attrition;\n\u2022\nour need to devote time and resources to training, business development, professional development and other non-chargeable activities; and\n\u2022\nour ability to manage a subcontractor workforce.\nWe rely on our information systems in our operations. Security breaches and other disruptions could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nAs a U.S. defense contractor, we face certain security threats, including cyber-security threats to our information technology infrastructure, attempts to gain access to proprietary or classified information, and threats to physical security. Cyber-security threats are evolving and include, among others, malicious software, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in mission critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. The unavailability of our information systems, the failure of these systems to perform as anticipated for any reason or any significant breach of security could disrupt our operations, lead to financial losses from remedial actions, require\nsignificant management attention and resources, and negatively impact our reputation among our customers and the public, which could have a negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nOur systems are decentralized, which presents various risks, including the risk that we may be slower or less able to identify or react to problems affecting a business function than we would be in a more centralized environment. In addition, \u201ccompany-wide\u201d business initiatives, such as the integration of information technology systems, separation and migration of business systems and data from Exelis, or the formation of a technology system impacting different parts of our business, are often more challenging and costly to implement, and their risk of failure higher, than they would be in a more centralized environment. Depending on the nature of the initiative in question, such failure could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nLegal disputes could require us to pay potentially large damage awards and could be costly to defend, which would adversely affect our cash balances and profitability, and could damage our reputation.\nWe are subject to a number of lawsuits and claims as described under \u201cPart I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings\u201d. We are also subject to, and may become a party to, a variety of other litigation or claims and suits that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Adverse judgments or settlements in some or all of these legal disputes may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief against us. Any claims or litigation could be costly to defend, and even if we are successful or if fully indemnified or insured, could damage our reputation and make it more difficult to compete effectively or obtain adequate insurance in the future. Litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and management\u2019s view of these matters may change in the future.\nUnanticipated changes in our tax provisions or exposure to additional U.S. and foreign income tax liabilities could affect our profitability.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Furthermore, changes in domestic or foreign income tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and enforcement, could result in higher or lower income tax rates assessed or changes in the taxability of certain sales or the deductibility of certain expenses, thereby affecting our income tax expense and profitability. In addition, we regularly are under audit by tax authorities. The final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Additionally, changes in the geographic mix of our sales could also impact our tax liabilities and affect our income tax expense and profitability.\nOur insurance may be insufficient to protect us from claims or losses.\nWe maintain insurance coverage with third-party insurers as part of our overall risk management strategy and because some of our contracts require us to maintain specific insurance coverage limits. However, not every risk or liability is or can be protected by insurance, and, for those risks we insure, the limits of coverage we purchase or that are reasonably obtainable in the market may not be sufficient to cover all actual losses or liabilities incurred. If any of our third-party insurers fail, cancel our coverage or otherwise are unable to provide us with adequate insurance coverage, then our overall risk exposure and our operational expenses would increase and the management of our business operations would be disrupted. Our insurance may be insufficient to protect us from significant warranty and other liability claims or losses. Moreover, there is a risk that commercially available liability insurance will not continue to be available to us at a reasonable cost, if at all. If liability claims or losses exceed our current or available insurance coverage, our business and prospects may be harmed. We are also subject to the requirements of the Defense Base Act (DBA), which generally requires insurance coverage to be provided to persons employed at U.S. military bases outside of the United States. Failure to obtain DBA insurance may result in fines or other sanctions, including the loss of a particular contract. Regardless of the adequacy of our liability insurance coverage, any significant claim may have an adverse effect on our industry and market reputation, leading to a substantial decrease in demand for our services and reduced revenue.\nBusiness disruptions caused by natural disasters and other crises could adversely affect our profitability and our overall financial position.\nWe have significant operations located in regions of the United States and internationally that may be exposed to natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, blizzards, flooding, wildfires or earthquakes. Our business could also be disrupted by pandemics and other national or international crises. Although preventative measures may help mitigate the damage from such occurrences, the damage and disruption to our business resulting\nfrom any of these events may be significant. If our insurance and other risk mitigation mechanisms are not sufficient to recover all costs, including loss of revenue from sales to customers, we could experience a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nWe depend on our teaming arrangements and relationships with other contractors and subcontractors. If we are not able to maintain these relationships, or if these parties fail to satisfy their obligations to us or the customer, our revenue, profitability and growth prospects could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on our teaming relationships with other prime contractors and subcontractors in order to submit bids for large procurements or other opportunities where we believe the combination of services provided by us and the other companies will help us to win and perform the contract. Our future revenue and growth prospects could be adversely affected if other contractors eliminate or reduce their contract relationships with us, or if the U.S. government terminates or reduces these other contractors' programs, does not award them new contracts or refuses to pay under a contract. Companies that do not already have access to U.S. government contracts may perform services as our subcontractor and that exposure could enhance such companies\u2019 prospect of securing a future position as a prime U.S. government contractor which could increase competition for future contracts and impair our ability to perform on contracts.\nWe may have disputes with our subcontractors arising from, among other things, the quality and timeliness of work performed by the subcontractor, customer concerns about the subcontractor, our failure to extend existing task orders or issue new task orders under a subcontract, proper invoicing, cost reasonableness, allocability, allowability, the hiring of each other\u2019s personnel, adjustments to the scope of the subcontractor\u2019s work, or the subcontractor\u2019s failure to comply with applicable law. Current uncertain economic conditions heighten the risk of financial stress of our subcontractors, which could adversely impact their ability to meet their contractual requirements to us. If any of our subcontractors fail to timely meet their contractual obligations or have regulatory compliance or other problems, our ability to fulfill our obligations as a prime contractor or higher tier subcontractor may be jeopardized. Significant losses could arise in future periods and subcontractor performance deficiencies could result in our termination for default. A termination for default could eliminate a revenue source, expose us to liability and have an adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and task orders.\nGovernment withholding regulations could adversely affect our operating performance.\nIn February 2012, the DoD issued the final Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS) rule which allows withholding of a percentage of payments when a contractor\u2019s business system has one or more significant deficiencies. The DFARS rule applies to Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) covered contracts that have the DFARS clause in the contract terms and conditions. The final rule represents a significant change in the contracting environment for companies performing work for the DoD. Contracting officers may withhold 5% of contract payments for one or more significant deficiencies in any single contractor business system or up to 10% of contract payments for significant deficiencies in multiple contractor business systems. A significant deficiency as defined by the DoD is a \u201cshortcoming in the system that materially affects the ability of officials of the DoD to rely upon information produced by the system that is needed for management purposes.\u201d The final rule is applicable to new DoD contracts awarded after February 2012.\nInternal system or service failures could disrupt our business and impair our ability to effectively provide our services to our customers, which could damage our reputation and adversely affect our revenue and profitability.\nAny system or service disruptions, including those caused by ongoing projects to improve our information technology systems and the delivery of services, whether through our shared services organization or outsourced services, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated, could have a material adverse effect on our business including, among other things, an adverse effect on our ability to bill our customers for work performed on our contracts, collect the amounts that have been billed and produce accurate financial statements in a timely manner. We are also subject to systems failures, including network, software or hardware failures, whether caused by us, third-party service providers, cybersecurity threats, natural disasters, power shortages, terrorist attacks or other events, which could cause loss of data and interruptions or delays in our business, cause us to incur remediation costs, subject us to claims and damage our reputation. In addition, the failure or disruption of our communications or utilities could cause us to interrupt or suspend our operations or otherwise adversely affect our business. Our property and business interruption insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur as a result of any system or operational failure or disruption and, as a result, our future results could be adversely affected.\nThe effects of changes in worldwide economic and capital markets conditions may significantly affect our ability to maintain liquidity or procure capital.\nOur business may be adversely affected by factors in the United States and other countries that are beyond our control, such as disruptions in financial markets or downturns in economic activity in specific countries or regions, or in the various industries in which our company operates; social, political or labor conditions in specific countries or regions; or adverse changes in the availability and cost of capital, interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, tax rates, or regulations in the jurisdictions in which our company operates. If, for any reason, we lose access to our currently available lines of credit, or if we are required to raise additional capital, we may be unable to do so in the current credit and stock market environment, or we may be able to do so only on unfavorable terms.\nAdverse changes to financial conditions could jeopardize certain counterparty obligations, including those of our insurers and financial institutions and other third parties.\nWe may make or enter into acquisitions, investments, joint ventures and divestitures that involve numerous risks and uncertainties.\nWe may selectively pursue strategic acquisitions, investments and joint ventures. These transactions require significant investment of time and resources and may disrupt our business and distract our management from other responsibilities. Even if successful, these transactions could reduce earnings for a number of reasons, including the amortization of intangible assets, impairment charges, acquired operations that are not yet profitable or the payment of additional consideration under earn-out arrangements if an acquisition performs better than expected. Acquisitions, investments and joint ventures pose many other risks that could adversely affect our reputation, operations or financial results, including:\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to identify, compete effectively for or complete suitable acquisitions and investments at prices we consider attractive;\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to accurately estimate the financial effect of acquisitions and investments on our business and we may not realize anticipated synergies or acquisitions may not result in improved operating performance;\n\u2022\nwe may encounter performance problems with acquired technologies, capabilities and products, particularly with respect to those that are still in development when acquired;\n\u2022\nwe may have trouble retaining key employees and customers of an acquired business or otherwise integrating such businesses, such as incompatible accounting, information management, or other control systems, which could result in unforeseen difficulties;\n\u2022\nwe may assume material liabilities that were not identified as part of our due diligence or for which we are unable to receive a purchase price adjustment or reimbursement through indemnification;\n\u2022\nwe may assume legal or regulatory risks, particularly with respect to smaller businesses that have immature business processes and compliance programs;\n\u2022\nacquired entities or joint ventures may not operate profitably, which could adversely affect our operating income or operating margins and we may be unable to recover investments in any such acquisitions;\n\u2022\nacquisitions, investments and joint ventures may require us to spend a significant amount of cash or to issue capital stock, resulting in dilution of ownership; and\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to effectively influence the operations of our joint ventures or we may be exposed to certain liabilities if our joint venture partners do not fulfill their obligations.\nIf our acquisitions, investments or joint ventures fail, perform poorly or their value is otherwise impaired for any reason, including contractions in credit markets and global economic conditions, our business and financial results could be adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to Our Recent Separation from Exelis\nWe face the following risks in connection with our recent separation from Exelis:\nWe may be responsible for U.S. Federal income tax liabilities that relate to the distribution.\nIn connection with the Spin-off, our former parent, Exelis, received an opinion of tax counsel to the effect that the Spin-off would qualify as a tax-free distribution under Section 355 of the Code. An opinion of tax counsel is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service (the \u201cIRS\u201d). Accordingly, the IRS may reach conclusions with respect to the Spin-off that are different from the conclusions reached in the opinion. The opinion was based on certain factual statements and representations, which, if incomplete or untrue in any material respect, could alter tax counsel\u2019s conclusions.\nWe are not aware of any facts or circumstances that would cause any such factual statements or representations in the opinion of tax counsel to be incomplete or untrue or cause the facts on which the opinion is based to be materially different from the facts at the time of the Spin-off. If, notwithstanding the receipt of the opinion of tax counsel, the IRS were to determine the Spin-off to be taxable, Exelis would recognize a substantial tax liability.\nEven if the Spin-off otherwise qualifies as a tax-free transaction for U.S. Federal income tax purposes, the distribution will be taxable to Exelis (but not to Exelis shareholders) pursuant to Section 355(e) of the Code if there are one or more acquisitions (including issuances) of the stock of either us or Exelis, representing 50% or more, measured by vote or value, of the then-outstanding stock of either corporation and the acquisition or acquisitions are deemed to be part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the distribution. Any acquisition of our common stock within two years before or after the distribution (with exceptions, including public trading by less-than-5% shareholders and certain compensatory stock issuances) generally will be presumed to be part of such a plan unless that presumption is rebutted. The resulting tax liability may have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows of us or Exelis.\nWe have agreed not to enter into any transaction that could cause any portion of the Spin-off to be taxable to Exelis, including under Section 355(e). Pursuant to the Tax Matters Agreement, we and Exelis have also agreed to indemnify each other for any tax liabilities resulting from such transactions to the extent a party\u2019s actions caused such tax liability, whether or not the indemnified party consented to such transaction or the indemnifying party was otherwise permitted to enter into such transaction under the Tax Matters Agreement. In addition, under U.S. Treasury regulations, each member of the Exelis consolidated group at the time of the Spin-off (including us and our subsidiaries) would be severally liable for the resulting U.S. Federal income tax liability if all or a portion of the Spin-off does not qualify as a tax-free transaction, and we will make certain payments to Exelis in respect of certain tax benefits that would be realized by us in connection with the Spin-off under the Tax Matters Agreement if the Spin-off were to be taxable. These obligations may discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company.\nIn connection with the Spin-off, we and Exelis have each agreed to a broad release of claims and indemnification of the other party; we may be required to expend cash and resources to satisfy our indemnification obligations to Exelis and there is no assurance that Exelis\u2019 indemnities to us will be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that Exelis will have the ability to satisfy its indemnification obligations to us in the future.\nIn the Distribution Agreement that we and Exelis entered into in connection with the Spin-off, Exelis agreed to indemnify us from certain claims and liabilities, and we agreed to indemnify Exelis for certain claims and liabilities as discussed further in Note 15, \u201cRelated Party Transactions and Parent Company Equity,\u201d and Note 16, \u201cCommitments and Contingencies\u201d. Indemnities that we are required to provide Exelis may be significant and could negatively impact our business, particularly those indemnities relating to our actions that could impact the tax-free nature of the Spin-off. Third-parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that Exelis has agreed to retain. Further, there can be no assurance that the indemnity from Exelis will be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, or that Exelis will be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. Moreover, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from Exelis any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves. Each of these risks could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur accounting and other management systems and resources may not be adequately prepared to meet the financial reporting and other requirements to which we are subject as a new independent, publicly traded company.\nPrior to Spin-off, our financial results were included within the consolidated results of Exelis. While we believe that our financial reporting and internal controls were appropriate for a subsidiary of a public company, prior to the Spin-off, we were not directly subject to the reporting and other requirements of the Exchange Act. As an independent, publicly traded company, we are directly subject to reporting and other obligations under the Exchange Act. Beginning with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending December 31, 2015, we will be required to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d) which will require annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and a report by our independent registered public accounting firm as to whether we maintained, in all material respects, effective internal controls over financial reporting as of the last day of the year. These reporting and other obligations may place significant demands on our management, administrative and operational resources, including accounting systems and resources.\nThe Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition. Under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we are required to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting. To comply with these requirements, we may need to further upgrade our systems; implement additional financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures; and hire additional accounting and finance staff. We expect to incur additional annual expenses as we continue to address these requirements, and those expenses may be significant. If we are unable to upgrade our financial and management controls, reporting systems, information technology systems and procedures in a timely and effective fashion, our ability to comply with our financial reporting requirements and other rules that apply to reporting companies under the Exchange Act could be impaired. Any failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe do not have a recent operating history as an independent company and our historical financial information may not be a reliable indicator of our future results.\nThe historical financial information we have included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for periods prior to the Spin-off has been derived in part from the consolidated financial statements of Exelis and does not necessarily reflect what our financial position, results of operations and cash flows would have been as a separate, stand-alone entity during the periods presented. Exelis did not account for us, and we were not operated, as a single stand-alone entity for certain of the periods presented even if we represented an important business in the historical consolidated financial statements of Exelis. In addition, the historical information is not necessarily indicative of what our results of operations, financial position and cash flows will be in the future. For example, following the Spin-off, changes have occurred and will occur in our cost structure, funding and operations, including changes in our tax structure, increased costs associated with reduced economies of scale and increased costs associated with becoming a public, stand-alone company. While we were profitable as part of Exelis, we cannot assure you that as a stand-alone company our profits will continue at a similar level.\nWe may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve as an independent, publicly traded company.\nAs an independent, publicly traded company, we believe that our business will benefit from, among other items; (i) greater strategic focus of management\u2019s efforts and resources, (ii) enhanced focus on customers, (iii) direct and differentiated access to capital resources, (iv) improved management incentive tools, and (v) ability to utilize stock as an acquisition currency. However, now that we are separate from Exelis, we may be more susceptible to market fluctuations and other adverse events than we would have been were we still a part of Exelis.\nOur customers, prospective customers and suppliers will need assurances that our financial stability on a stand-alone basis is sufficient to satisfy their requirements for doing or continuing to do business with them.\nSome of our customers, prospective customers and suppliers will need assurances that our financial stability on a stand-alone basis is sufficient to satisfy their requirements for doing or continuing to do business with them. If our customers, prospective customers or suppliers are not satisfied with our financial stability, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to bid for and obtain or retain projects, as well as on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Spin-off may expose us to potential liabilities arising out of state and Federal fraudulent conveyance laws and legal distribution requirements.\nThe Spin-off could be challenged under various state and Federal fraudulent conveyance laws. An unpaid creditor or an entity vested with the power of such creditor (such as a trustee or debtor-in-possession in a bankruptcy) could claim that Exelis did not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value in the Spin-off, and that the Spin-off left Exelis insolvent or with unreasonably small capital or that Exelis intended or believed it would incur debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they mature. If a court were to agree with such a plaintiff, then such court could void the Spin-off as a fraudulent transfer and could impose a number of different remedies, including without limitation, returning our assets or your shares in our company to Exelis or providing Exelis with a claim for money damages against us in an amount equal to the difference between the consideration received by Exelis and the fair market value of our company at the time of the Spin-off.\nThe measure of insolvency for purposes of the fraudulent conveyance laws may vary depending on which jurisdiction\u2019s law is applied. Generally, however, an entity would be considered insolvent if the fair saleable value of its assets is less than the amount of its liabilities (including the probable amount of contingent liabilities), and such entity would be considered to have unreasonably small capital if it lacked adequate capital to conduct its business in the ordinary course and pay its liabilities as they become due. No assurance can be given as to what standard a court would apply to determine insolvency or that a court would determine that Exelis was solvent at the time of or after giving effect to the Spin-off, including the distribution of our common stock.\nThe distribution by Exelis of the Vectrus common stock in the Spin-off could also be challenged under state corporate distribution statutes. Under the Indiana Business Corporation Law, a corporation may not make distributions to its shareholders if, after giving effect to the distribution, (i) the corporation would not be able to pay its debts as they become due in the usual course of business; or (ii) the corporation\u2019s total assets would be less than the sum of its total liabilities. No assurance can be given that a court will not later determine that the distribution by Exelis of Vectrus common stock in the Spin-off was unlawful.\nUnder the Distribution Agreement, we are responsible for the debts, liabilities and other obligations related to the business or businesses which we own and operate following the consummation of the Spin-off. Although we do not expect to be liable for any obligations not expressly assumed by us pursuant to the Distribution Agreement, it is possible that we could be required to assume responsibility for certain obligations retained by Exelis should Exelis fail to pay or perform its retained obligations.\nWe may have been able to receive better terms from unaffiliated third parties than the terms we receive in our agreements related to the Spin-off.\nThe agreements related to the Spin-off, including the Distribution Agreement, Employee Matters Agreement, Tax Matters Agreement, Transition Services Agreements and any other agreements, were negotiated in the context of our separation from Exelis while we were still part of Exelis. Accordingly, these agreements may not reflect terms that would have resulted from arm\u2019s-length negotiations among unaffiliated third parties. The terms of the agreements negotiated in the context of our separation are related to, among other things, allocations of assets and liabilities, rights and indemnification and other obligations between Exelis and us. To the extent that certain terms of those agreements provide for rights and obligations that could have been procured from third parties, we may have received better terms from third parties because third parties may have competed with each other to win our business.\nWe may incur greater costs as an independent company than we did when we were part of Exelis.\nAs part of Exelis, we took advantage of its size and purchasing power in procuring certain goods and services such as insurance and health care benefits, and technology such as computer software licenses. We also relied on Exelis to provide various corporate functions. After the Spin-off, as a separate, independent entity, we may be unable to obtain these goods, services and technologies at prices or on terms as favorable to us as those we obtained prior\nto the distribution. We may also incur costs for functions previously performed by Exelis that are higher than the amounts reflected in our historical financial statements, which could cause our profitability to decrease.\nFollowing the Spin-off, we are dependent on Exelis to provide certain services pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement.\nCurrently, we rely on Exelis to provide certain corporate and administrative services such as certain information technology, financial and human resource services. We expect to develop the capability to provide all such services internally at Vectrus. However, to the extent that we are unable to develop such capabilities after the separation, we will rely on Exelis to continue to provide certain services for a period of time pursuant to a Transition Services Agreement that we entered into in connection with the Spin-off. If Exelis is unable or unwilling to provide such services pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement, or if the agreement is terminated prior to the end of its term, we may be unable to provide such services ourselves or we may have to incur additional expenditures to obtain such services from another provider.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nYou face the following risks in connection with ownership of our common stock:\nThere is not a long market history for our common stock and the market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly.\nWe cannot predict the prices at which our common stock may trade. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate widely, depending on many factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nour dependence on the defense industry and the business risks peculiar to that industry, including changing priorities or reductions in the U.S. government or international defense budgets;\n\u2022\ngovernment regulations and compliance therewith, including changes to the DoD procurement process;\n\u2022\nthe availability of government funding and changes in customer requirements for our services;\n\u2022\ncompetition and industry capacity;\n\u2022\nmisconduct of our employees, subcontractors, agents and business partners;\n\u2022\nthe mix of our contracts and programs, our performance, and our ability to control costs;\n\u2022\ngovernmental investigations;\n\u2022\nchanges in interest rates and other factors that affect earnings and cash flows;\n\u2022\nour level of indebtedness and our ability to make payments on or service our indebtedness;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain financing as needed;\n\u2022\nsubcontractor performance;\n\u2022\nour ability to retain and recruit qualified personnel;\n\u2022\nsecurity breaches and other disruptions to our information technology and operations;\n\u2022\nunanticipated changes in our tax provisions or exposure to additional income tax liabilities;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results due to factors related to our business;\n\u2022\nwins and losses on contract re-competitions and new business pursuits;\n\u2022\nsuccess or failure of our business strategy;\n\u2022\nour quarterly or annual earnings, or those of other companies in our industry;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant acquisitions or dispositions;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u2022\nthe failure of securities analysts to cover our common stock;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates by securities analysts or our ability to meet those estimates;\n\u2022\nthe operating and stock price performance of other comparable companies;\n\u2022\ninvestor perception of our company and the defense industry, including changing priorities or reductions in the U.S. government defense budget;\n\u2022\nnatural or environmental disasters that investors believe may affect us;\n\u2022\noverall market fluctuations;\n\u2022\nresults from any material litigation or government investigation;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws and regulations affecting our business; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions and other external factors.\nStock markets in general have experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company. These broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nWe do not currently plan to pay a regular dividend on our common stock, and our indebtedness could limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock in the future.\nWe do not currently plan to pay a regular dividend on our common stock. The declaration of any future cash dividends and, if declared, the amount of any such dividends, will be subject to our financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, financial covenants and other contractual restrictions and to the discretion of our Board of Directors. Our Board of Directors may take into account such matters as general business conditions, industry practice, our financial condition and performance, our future prospects, our cash needs and capital investment plans, income tax consequences, applicable law and such other factors as our Board of Directors may deem relevant.\nAdditionally, indebtedness that we incurred in connection with the Spin-off could have important consequences for holders of our common stock. If we cannot generate sufficient cash flow from operations to meet our debt-payment obligations, then our ability to pay dividends, if so determined by the Board of Directors, will be impaired and we may be required to attempt to restructure or refinance our debt, raise additional capital or take other actions such as selling assets, reducing or delaying capital expenditures or reducing our dividend. There can be no assurance, however, that any such actions could be effected on satisfactory terms, if at all, or would be permitted by the terms of our debt or our other credit and contractual arrangements. In addition, the terms of the agreements governing our current debt or debt that we may incur in the future may limit the payment of dividends.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Indiana law could delay or prevent a change in control.\nCertain provisions of our amended and restated articles of incorporation and our amended and restated by-laws may delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a shareholder may consider favorable. For example, the amended and restated articles of incorporation and the amended and restated by-laws, among other things, provide for a classified board and do not permit shareholders to convene special meetings or to remove our directors other than for cause. In addition, the amended and restated articles of incorporation authorize our Board of Directors to issue one or more series of preferred stock. These provisions may also discourage acquisition proposals or delay or prevent a change in control, which could harm our stock price. Indiana law also imposes some restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between any holder of 10% or more of our outstanding common stock and us as well as certain restrictions on the voting rights of \u201ccontrol shares\u201d of an \u201cissuing public corporation.\u201d\nUnder the Tax Matters Agreement, we have agreed not to enter into any transaction involving an acquisition (including issuance) of Vectrus common stock or any other transaction that could cause the distribution to be taxable to Exelis. Exelis and we have also agreed to indemnify each other for any tax liabilities resulting from such transactions to the extent a party\u2019s actions caused such tax liability, whether or not the indemnified party consented to such transaction or the indemnifying party was otherwise permitted to enter into such transaction under the Tax Matters Agreement. Generally, Exelis will recognize taxable gain on the distribution if there are one or more acquisitions (including issuances) of our capital stock, directly or indirectly, representing 50% or more, measured by\nvote or value, of our then-outstanding capital stock, and the acquisitions or issuances are deemed to be part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the distribution. Any such shares of our common stock acquired, directly or indirectly, within two years before or after the distribution (with exceptions, including public trading by less-than-5% shareholders and certain compensatory stock issuances) will generally be presumed to be part of such a plan unless that presumption is rebutted. As a result, our obligations may discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company.", "PERMNO": 14884, "SIC": 8744, "TIC": "VEC"}
