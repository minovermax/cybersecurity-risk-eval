{"cik": "6284", "company": "ANALOGIC CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-09-25", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K contains statements, which, to the extent that they are not a recitation of historical facts, constitute \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In some cases these forward-looking statements can be identified by the use of words such as \u201cmay,\u201d \u201ccould,\u201d \u201cshould,\u201d \u201cwould,\u201d \u201cexpect,\u201d \u201cproject,\u201d \u201cpredict,\u201d \u201cpotential\u201d or the negative of these words or comparable words. Investors are cautioned that all forward-looking statements, including without limitation, statements about product development, market and industry trends, strategic initiatives, regulatory approvals, sales, profits, expenses, price trends, R&D expenses and trends, and capital expenditures, involve risk and uncertainties, and actual events and results may differ materially from those indicated in any forward-looking statement as a result of a number of important factors, including those discussed below and elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision with respect to our common stock. Additional risks not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, may also impair our business. Any of these could have a material and negative effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nBecause a significant portion of our revenue currently comes from a small number of customers, any decrease in revenue from these customers could harm our operating results.\nWe depend on a small number of customers for a large portion of our business, and changes in our customers\u2019 orders could have a significant impact on our operating results. If a major customer significantly reduces the amount of business it does with us, there would be an adverse impact on our operating results.\nWe had four customers during fiscal year 2015 and 2014 and three customers during fiscal year 2013, who accounted for 10% or more of our net revenue.\nOur ten largest customers as a group accounted for 64%, 66%, and 68% of our net product and engineering revenue for fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.\nAlthough we seek to broaden our customer base, we will continue to depend on sales to a relatively small number of major customers. Because it often takes significant time to replace lost business, it is likely that our operating results would be adversely affected if one or more of our major customers were to cancel, delay, or reduce significant orders in the future. Our customer agreements typically permit the customer to discontinue future purchases after timely notice.\nIn addition, we generate significant accounts receivable in connection with the products we sell and the services we provide to our major customers. Although our major customers are large corporations, if one or more of our customers were to become insolvent or otherwise be unable to pay for our products and services, our operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nCompetition from existing or new companies in the Medical Imaging and Security and Detection industries could cause us to experience downward pressure on prices, fewer customer orders, reduced margins, loss of new business opportunities, and the loss of market share.\nWe operate in highly competitive industries. We are subject to competition based on product design, performance, pricing, quality, and service offerings, and we believe our innovative engineering and product reliability have been important factors in our historical growth. While we try to maintain competitive pricing on those products which are comparable to products manufactured by others, in many instances our products conform to more precise specifications and may carry a higher price than analogous products manufactured by others.\nOur competitors include divisions of larger, more diversified organizations as well as specialized companies. Some of them have greater resources and larger staffs than we have. A number of our existing and potential OEM customers have the ability to design and manufacture internally the products that we manufacture for them. We face competition from the R&D groups and manufacturing operations of our existing and potential customers, who continually compare the benefits of internal research, product development, and manufacturing with the costs and benefits of outsourcing.\nWe depend on our suppliers, some of which are the sole-source for certain components, and our production could be substantially curtailed if these suppliers were not able to meet our demands and alternative sources were not available.\nWe order raw materials and components to complete our customers\u2019 orders, and some of these raw materials and components are ordered from sole-source suppliers. Although we work with our customers and suppliers to minimize the impact of shortages in raw materials and components, we sometimes experience short-term adverse effects due to price fluctuations and delayed shipments. In the past, there have been industry-wide shortages of electronics components. If a significant shortage of raw materials or components were to occur, we might have to delay shipments or pay premium pricing, which could adversely affect our operating results. In some cases, supply shortages of particular components could substantially curtail our production of products using these components. We are not always able to pass on price increases to our customers. Accordingly, some raw material and component price increases could adversely affect our operating results. We also depend on a small number of\nsuppliers to provide many of the other raw materials and components that we use in our business. Some of these suppliers are affiliated with customers or competitors, and others are small companies. If we were unable to continue to purchase these raw materials and components from our suppliers, our operating results could be adversely affected. Because many of our costs are fixed, our margins depend on the volume of output at our facilities, and a reduction in volume could adversely affect our margins.\nWe rely on successful performance by and relationships with suppliers. This reliance could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have formed arrangements with suppliers for various services and components. We have formed these arrangements because it is commercially more efficient to outsource these services and purchase these components than it would be for us to perform these services or manufacture these components, which in some cases require, among other things, a high degree of technical skill and advanced equipment that is not practical or cost-effective for us to develop or acquire. As a result, if one of our suppliers were to experience quality problems, capacity constraints, decreased yields, or delivery delays, or were to raise prices significantly, we could face product liability claims, product shortages, decreased revenues or lost customers, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nIf we were to be left with excess inventory, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nBecause of long lead times and specialized product designs, in certain cases we purchase components and manufacture products in anticipation of customer orders based on customer forecasts. For a variety of reasons, such as decreased end-user demand for our products, inadequate or inaccurate forecasts, or other issues that might impact production planning, our customers might not purchase all the products that we have manufactured or for which we have purchased components. In any such event, we would attempt to recoup material and manufacturing costs by means such as returning components to our vendors, disposing of excess inventory through other channels, or requiring our OEM customers to purchase or otherwise compensate us for such excess inventory. Some of our significant customer agreements do not give us the ability to require our OEM customers to do this. To the extent that we were unsuccessful in recouping our material and manufacturing costs, our gross margin and operating results could be adversely affected. Moreover, carrying excess inventory would reduce the working capital we have available to continue to operate and grow our business.\nUncertainties and adverse trends affecting our industry or any of our major customers could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur business operates primarily within three business segments: Medical Imaging, Ultrasound, and Security and Detection. The Medical and Security and Detection equipment markets in which our segments operate are subject to changes in technology, pricing, and profit margins and have been historically subject to cyclical downturns characterized by diminished product demand, rapid declines in average selling prices, and production over-capacity. In addition, changes in government policy and regulations relating to the purchase or use of medical and security-related capital equipment could also affect our sales. Our customers\u2019 markets are also subject to economic cycles and are likely to experience periodic contractions. The economic conditions affecting our industry in general or any of our major customers in particular, might adversely affect our operating results.\nIn Security and Detection, our OEM customers\u2019 purchasing dynamics are generally affected by the level of government funding, the expansion and/or upgrade of airport terminals, the timing of government tenders and fluctuations in airline passenger volume.\nOur customers\u2019 or our delay in obtaining or inability to obtain any necessary U.S. or foreign regulatory clearances or approvals for products could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur products in the Medical Imaging and Ultrasound segments are finished medical devices or are components used by our customers in the production of finished medical devices that are subject to a high level of regulatory oversight. A delay in obtaining or inability to obtain any necessary U.S. or foreign regulatory\nclearances or approvals for products could have a material adverse effect on our business. The process of obtaining clearances and approvals can be costly and time-consuming. There is a further risk that any approvals or clearances, once obtained, might be withdrawn or modified. Medical devices cannot be marketed in the U.S. without clearance from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA. Medical devices sold in the U.S. must also be manufactured in compliance with FDA rules and regulations, which regulate the design, manufacturing, packaging, storage, and installation of medical devices. Moreover, medical devices are required to comply with FDA regulations relating to investigational research and labeling. States may also regulate the manufacturing, sale, and use of medical devices. Medical devices are also subject to approval and regulation by foreign regulatory and safety agencies. Our products must also meet the requirements of these governments and agencies for approval and distribution. As with the U.S., foreign governments or agencies can withdraw or modify their approvals.\nOur business strategy includes the pursuit of acquisitions or business combinations, which, if consummated, could be difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value, or divert management attention.\nAs part of our business strategy, we may seek attractive acquisitions and other business combinations. Acquisitions are typically accompanied by a number of risks, including the difficulty of integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired companies, the potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management, expenses related to the acquisition, and potential unknown or underestimated liabilities associated with acquired businesses. If we do not successfully complete acquisitions, we could incur substantial expenses and devote significant management time and resources without generating any benefit to us. In addition, substantial portions of our available cash might be utilized as consideration for these acquisitions.\nOur annual and quarterly operating results are subject to fluctuations, which could affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur annual and quarterly results could vary significantly depending on various factors, many of which are beyond our control, and may not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors. If this occurs, the price of our common stock could decline. These factors include:\n\u2022\nvariations in the timing and volume of customer orders;\n\u2022\nintroduction and market acceptance of our customers\u2019 or our own new products;\n\u2022\nchanges in demand for our customers\u2019 or our own existing products;\n\u2022\nthe timing of our expenditures in anticipation of future orders;\n\u2022\neffectiveness in managing our manufacturing processes;\n\u2022\nchanges in competitive and economic conditions generally in our or our customers\u2019 markets;\n\u2022\nchanges in the cost or availability of components or skilled labor;\n\u2022\nchanges in our effective tax rate;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in manufacturing yields;\n\u2022\nforeign currency and commodity price exposures;\n\u2022\ninvestor and analyst perceptions of events affecting us, our competitors, and/or our industry; and\n\u2022\nchanges in laws or regulatory requirements affecting the health care or aviation security industries or our products.\nA delay in anticipated sales beyond the end of a particular quarter could have a significant effect on our operating results for that quarter. In addition, most of our operating expenses do not vary directly with net revenue and are difficult to adjust in the short term. As a result, if revenue for a particular quarter was below our expectations, we could not proportionately reduce operating expenses for that quarter. Hence, the revenue shortfall could have a disproportionate adverse effect on our operating results for that quarter.\nLoss of any of our key personnel could hurt our business because of their industry experience and their technological expertise.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry and depend on the services of our key senior executives and our technological experts. The loss of the services of one or several of our key employees or an inability to attract, train, and retain qualified and skilled employees, specifically engineering and operations personnel, could result in the loss of customers or otherwise inhibit our ability to operate and grow our business successfully.\nIf we fail to effectively manage our growth or, alternatively, our spending during economic downturns, our business could be disrupted, which could harm our operating results.\nOur ability to offer our products and implement our business plan in evolving markets successfully requires an effective planning and management process. We must effectively manage our spending and operations to ensure our competitive position during economic downturns, and must preserve our future opportunities when the economy improves. A failure to manage our spending and operations effectively could disrupt our business and harm our operating results. A growth in sales, combined with the challenges of managing geographically dispersed operations, can place a significant strain on our management systems and resources, and growth in future operations could continue to place such a strain. The failure to manage our growth effectively could disrupt our business and harm our operating results.\nIf we are unable to maintain our expertise in research and product development, manufacturing processes, and marketing new products, we might not be able to compete successfully.\nWe believe that our future success depends upon our ability to provide research and product development, provide manufacturing services that meet the changing needs of our customers, and market new products. Technological changes may adversely impact orders and sales of our existing products, or make them less desirable or even obsolete. This requires that we successfully anticipate and respond to technological changes in design and manufacturing processes in a cost-effective and timely manner. As a result, we continually evaluate the advantages and feasibility of new product designs and manufacturing processes. We may not be able to develop and introduce new and improved products in a timely or efficient manner. New and improved products, if developed, may not achieve price and profitability targets or market acceptance. Commercialization of new products may prove challenging, and we may be required to invest more time and money than expected to introduce these products into the market successfully.\nMajor terrorist attacks and threats have increased financial expectations that may not materialize.\nMajor terrorist attacks and threats have created increased interest in our security and inspection systems. However, the level of demand for our products is not predictable and may vary over time. We do not know what solutions will continue to be adopted by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security as a result of terrorism and whether our products will continue to be a part of the solutions. Additionally, should our products be considered as a part of future security solutions, it is unclear what the level of purchases may be and how quickly funding to purchase our products may be made available. These factors could adversely impact us and create unpredictability in our revenues and operating results.\nWe are exposed to risks associated with international operations and markets.\nWe source and manufacture certain components and systems outside the U.S., we market and sell products in international markets, and we have established offices and subsidiaries in Europe, Canada, and Asia. Our foreign revenue accounted for 60%, 64%, and 62% of our total net revenue for fiscal years 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. There are inherent risks in transacting business internationally, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in applicable laws and regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nexport and import restrictions;\n\u2022\nexport controls relating to technology;\n\u2022\ntariffs and other trade barriers;\n\u2022\nintellectual property laws that offer less protection for our proprietary rights;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022\nproblems in collecting accounts receivable and longer payment cycles;\n\u2022\npolitical instability;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in managing employee relations;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies across our global operations, including inventory management and financial consolidation;\n\u2022\nexpatriation controls; and\n\u2022\npotential adverse tax consequences.\nThere is significant uncertainty about the stability of global currency, credit and financial markets. These economic uncertainties affect businesses such as ours in a number of ways, making it difficult to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities. Various macroeconomic factors such as sudden adverse changes to foreign exchange rates, unemployment rates, availability of credit, strength or weakness of real estate markets and other such factors may cause our customers to cancel, decrease or delay their existing or future orders for our products. We are unable to predict the impact of this instability and if economic conditions worsen, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe must comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and antitrust, competition and similar laws in other jurisdictions and our failure to do so could lead to substantial liability. We could also face investigations by one or more government agencies that could be costly to respond to and divert the attention of key personnel from our business operations. An adverse outcome from any such investigation could subject us to fines or other penalties, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny one or more of these factors may have a material adverse effect on our future international activities and, consequently, on our business and results of operations.\nThere are risks associated with our operations in China.\nWe conduct certain manufacturing operations at, and are transitioning additional manufacturing operations to, our facility in Shanghai, China in order to reduce costs and streamline our manufacturing operations. There are administrative, legal, and governmental risks to operating in China that could result in increased operating expenses or could hamper us in the development of our operations in China. The risks from operating in China that could increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and ability to deliver our products and grow our business include, without limitation:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, particularly in attracting and retaining personnel qualified to design, sell, test and support our products;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in managing employee relations;\n\u2022\nincreases in the value of the Chinese Yuan, or CNY;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in coordinating our operations in China with those in the U.S., Canada, and Europe;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in enforcing contracts in China;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in protecting intellectual property;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management attention;\n\u2022\nimposition of burdensome governmental regulations;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies across our global operations, including inventory management and financial consolidation;\n\u2022\nregional political and economic instability, which could have an adverse impact on foreign exchange rates in Asia and impair our ability to conduct our business in China; and\n\u2022\ninadequacy of the local infrastructure to support our operations.\nOur operations are vulnerable to interruption or loss due to natural disasters, epidemics, terrorist acts and other events beyond our control, which would adversely affect our business.\nAlthough we perform manufacturing in multiple locations, we generally do not have redundant manufacturing capabilities in place for any particular product or component. As a result, we depend on our current facilities for the continued operation of our business. A natural disaster, pandemic, terrorist act, act of war, or other natural or manmade disaster affecting any of our facilities could significantly disrupt our operations, or delay or prevent product manufacturing and shipment for the time required to repair, rebuild, or replace our manufacturing facilities. This delay could be lengthy and we could incur significant expenses to repair or replace the facilities. Any similar natural or manmade disaster that affects a key supplier or customer could lead to a similar disruption in our business.\nOur business could be harmed if we are unable to protect our intellectual property or if we become subject to intellectual property infringement claims.\nWe rely on a combination of trade secrets, patents, trademarks, copyrights and confidentiality procedures to protect our technology. Despite our efforts, the steps we have taken to protect our technology may be inadequate. Existing trade secret, patent, trademark and copyright laws offer only limited protection. Our patents could be invalidated or circumvented. In addition, others may develop substantially equivalent or superseding proprietary technology, or competitors may offer similar competing products, thereby substantially reducing the value of our proprietary rights. The laws of some foreign countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold may not protect our products or intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the U.S. The steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology. Our inability to protect our intellectual property could have a negative impact on our operations and financial results.\nWe may also become subject to claims that we infringe the intellectual property rights of others in the future. We cannot ensure that, if made, these claims will not be successful. Any claim of infringement could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim even if the claim is invalid, and could distract management from other business. Any judgment against us could require substantial payment in damages and could also include an injunction or other court order that could prevent us from offering certain products.\nWe rely significantly on information technology and any failure, inadequacy, interruption or security lapse of that technology could harm our ability to operate our business effectively.\nWe rely extensively on information technology systems to interact with our employees and our customers and to run our business effectively. These interactions include ordering and managing materials from suppliers, converting materials to finished products, shipping product to customers, processing transactions, summarizing and reporting results of operations, complying with regulatory, legal and tax requirements, and other processes necessary to manage our business. Our systems could become damaged or cease to function properly due to any\nnumber of causes, including issues caused by ongoing projects to improve our information technology systems and the delivery of services, failures of third-party service providers, catastrophic events, power outages, and security breaches. Any failure or malfunctioning of our information technology systems, errors or misuse by system users, or inadequacy of the systems in addressing the needs of our operations, could disrupt our ability to timely and accurately manufacture and ship products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any such failure, errors, misuse or inadequacy could also disrupt our ability to timely and accurately process, report and evaluate key operations metrics and key components of our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. Any such disruptions would likely divert our management and key employees\u2019 attention away from other business matters. Any disruptions or difficulties that may occur in connection with our information technology systems could also adversely affect our ability to complete important business processes such as the evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting and attestation activities.\nWe face attempts by others to gain unauthorized access to our information technology systems and have been subject to information security breaches caused by illegal hacking, none of which, in the aggregate, have materially impacted our operations and financial condition to date. We may be subject to additional information security breaches caused by illegal hacking, computer viruses, or acts of vandalism or terrorism. We have implemented procedures to mitigate these risks. We monitor our data, information technology and personnel usage of our systems to reduce these risks and continue to do so on an ongoing basis for any current or potential threats; however, our security measures or those of our third-party service providers may not detect or prevent such breaches and, in some instances we, our customers, and the users of our products might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effect. These threats are constantly evolving, thereby increasing the difficulty of successfully defending against them or implementing adequate preventative measures. Any such compromise to our information security could result in an interruption in our operations, the unauthorized publication of our confidential business or proprietary information, the unauthorized release of customer, vendor, or employee data, the violation of privacy or other laws, and the exposure to litigation, any of which could harm our business and operating results.\nIf our security and inspection systems fail to detect weapons, explosives or other devices that are used to commit a terrorist act, we could be exposed to product liability and related claims for which we may not have adequate insurance coverage.\nOur business exposes us to potential product liability risks that are inherent in the development, manufacturing, sale and service of security inspection systems. Our customers use our security and inspection systems to help them detect items that could be used in performing terrorist acts or other crimes. The training, reliability and competence of the customers\u2019 operators are crucial to the detection of suspicious items. In addition, our security and inspection systems are not designed to work under all circumstances or may otherwise fail to detect a threat. We test the reliability of our security and inspection systems during both their development and manufacturing phases. We also perform such tests if we are requested to perform installation, warranty or post-warranty servicing. However, our security inspection systems are advanced mechanical and electronic devices and therefore can malfunction.\nAs a result of the September 11, 2001, and 1993 World Trade Center terrorist attacks, and the potential for future attacks, product liability insurance coverage for such threats is extremely difficult and costly to obtain. It is possible, subject to the applicability of the Support Anti-terrorism by Fostering Effective Technologies Act of 2002, or SAFETY Act, that if we were found liable following a major act of terrorism, our insurance might not fully cover the claims for damages.\nThe SAFETY Act is a Federal law in the U.S. enacted to provide certain legal liability protections for providers of certain anti-terrorism technologies. If applicable to claims against Analogic, the SAFETY Act could mitigate some of this risk.\nOur Security and Detection segment depends in part on purchases of products and services by the U.S. Federal Government and its agencies, which purchases may be only partially funded, and are subject to potential termination and reductions and delays in government spending.\nAs an indirect subcontractor or team member with prime contractors and in other cases directly to the U.S. Federal Government and its agencies, our security and inspection systems are included in many different domestic programs. Over the lifetime of a program, the award of many different individual contracts and subcontracts could impact our products\u2019 requirements. The funding of U.S. Federal Government programs are subject to Congressional appropriations. Although multiple-year contracts may be planned in connection with major procurements, Congress generally appropriates funds only on a single fiscal year basis. Consequently, programs are often only partially funded initially, and additional funds are committed only as Congress makes further appropriations and prime contracts receive such funding. The reduction or delay in funding or termination of a government program in which we are involved could result in a loss of or delay in receiving anticipated future revenues attributable to that program and contracts or orders received. The U.S. Federal Government could reduce or terminate a prime contract under which we are a subcontractor or team member irrespective of the quality of our products or services. The termination of a program or reduction in, or failure to commit additional funds to, a program in which we are involved could negatively impact our revenue and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in laws affecting the health care industry could adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition.\nIn recent years, the healthcare industry has undergone significant changes driven by various efforts to reduce costs, including increased levels of managed care, cuts in Medicare, consolidation of healthcare distribution companies and collective purchasing arrangements by office-based healthcare practitioners. In addition, numerous governments have undertaken efforts to control healthcare costs through legislation and regulation. In the U.S. in March 2010, President Obama signed into law health care reform legislation in the form of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or PPACA. The PPACA could meaningfully change the way healthcare is developed, marketed and delivered, and may materially impact numerous aspects of our business, results of operations, and financial conditions. The implementation of health care reform and medical cost containment measures in the U.S. and in foreign countries in which we operate could:\n\u2022\nlimit the use of our products and adversely affect the use of new therapies for which our products may be targeted;\n\u2022\nreduce reimbursement available to our customers for using our products; and\n\u2022\ndecrease the price we might establish for our products and products that we may develop, which would result in lower product revenues to us.\nIn addition, because we operate in a highly regulated industry, other governmental actions may adversely affect our business, operations and financial condition, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in FDA and foreign regulations that may require additional safety monitoring, labeling changes, restrictions on product distribution or use, or other measures after the introduction of our products to market, which could increase our costs of doing business, or otherwise adversely affect the market for our products;\n\u2022\nnew laws, regulations and judicial decisions affecting pricing or marketing practices; and\n\u2022\nchanges in the tax laws relating to our operations.\nWe have identified transactions involving our Danish subsidiary BK Medical ApS (\u201cBK Medical\u201d) and certain of its distributors with respect to which we have raised questions as to compliance with law, and we may incur ongoing inquiry-related costs and/or governmental sanctions in connection with the matter.\nAs initially disclosed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July 31, 2011, we identified certain transactions involving our Danish subsidiary BK Medical ApS, or BK Medical, and certain of its foreign distributors, with respect to which we have raised questions concerning compliance with law, including Danish law and the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and our business policies. These have included transactions in which the distributors paid BK Medical amounts in excess of amounts owed and BK Medical transferred the excess amounts, at the direction of the distributors, to third parties identified by the distributors. We have terminated the employment of certain BK Medical employees and also terminated our relationships with the BK Medical distributors that were involved in the transactions. We have concluded that the transactions identified to date have been properly accounted for in our reported financial statements in all material respects. However, we have been unable to ascertain with certainty the ultimate beneficiaries or the purpose of these transfers. We have voluntarily disclosed this matter to the Danish Government, the U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ, and the SEC, and are cooperating with inquiries by the Danish Government, the DOJ and the SEC. We believe that the SEC and DOJ have substantially completed their investigation into the transactions at issue. We have commenced discussions with the SEC concerning the resolution of the SEC inquiry and have proposed a payment of $1.6 million in settlement of such inquiry. During the three months ended July 31, 2015, we accrued a $1.6 million charge in connection with our settlement proposal. We are uncertain whether the DOJ or the Danish Government will seek to impose any sanctions or penalties against us and have not engaged in settlement discussions with either of these entities. There can be no assurance that we will enter into any settlement with the SEC, the DOJ or the Danish Government, and the cost of any settlements or other resolutions of these matters could materially exceed our accruals. We incurred inquiry-related costs of approximately $1.4 million in in each of our fiscal years ended July 31, 2014 and July 31, 2015 in connection with this matter.\nCompliance or the failure to comply with current and future environmental regulations could cause us significant expense.\nWe are subject to various environmental regulations. From time to time new regulations are enacted, and it is difficult to anticipate how such regulations will be implemented and enforced. We continue to evaluate the necessary steps for compliance with environmental regulations as they are enacted. These regulations include, for example, the Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemical substances, or REACH, the Restriction on the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive, or RoHS and the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive, or WEEE enacted in the European Union which regulate the use of certain hazardous substances in, and require the collection, reuse and recycling of waste from, certain products we manufacture. This and similar legislation that has been or is in the process of being enacted in Japan, China, Korea and various states of the U.S. may require us to redesign our products to ensure compliance with the applicable standards, for example by requiring the use of different types of materials. These redesigns or alternative materials may detrimentally impact the performance of our products, add greater testing lead-times for product introductions or have other similar effects. We believe we comply with all such legislation where our products are sold and we will continue to monitor these laws and the regulations being adopted under them to determine our responsibilities. In addition, we are monitoring legislation relating to the reduction of carbon emissions from industrial operations to determine whether we may be required to incur any material, additional material costs, or expenses associated with our operations. Our failure to comply with any of the foregoing regulatory requirements could result in our being directly or indirectly liable for costs, fines or penalties and third-party claims, and could jeopardize our ability to conduct business in the U.S. and foreign countries.", "PERMNO": 14198, "SIC": 3845, "TIC": "ALOG"}
