{"cik": "90168", "company": "SIFCO INDUSTRIES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-01-29", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThis Form 10-K, including Item 1A (\"Risk Factors\"), may contain various forward-looking statements and includes assumptions concerning the Company\u2019s operations, future results and prospects. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations and are subject to risk and uncertainties. In connection with the \u201csafe harbor\u201d provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, the Company provides this cautionary statement identifying important economic, political and technological factors, among others, the absence or effect of which could cause the actual results or events to differ materially from those set forth in or implied by the forward-looking statements and related assumptions. Such factors include the following: (1) the impact on business conditions in general, and on the demand for product in the A&E industries in particular, of the global economic outlook, including the continuation of military spending at or near current levels and the availability of capital and liquidity from banks and other providers of credit; (2) the future business environment, including capital and consumer spending;\n(3) competitive factors, including the ability to replace business that may be lost at comparable margins; (4) metals and commodities price increases and the Company\u2019s ability to recover such price increases; (5) successful development and market introduction of new products and services; (6) continued reliance on consumer acceptance of regional and business aircraft powered by more fuel efficient turboprop engines; (7) continued reliance on military spending, in general, and/or several major customers, in particular, for revenues; (8) the impact on future contributions to the Company\u2019s defined benefit pension plans due to changes in actuarial assumptions, government regulations and the market value of plan assets; (9) stable governments, business conditions, laws, regulations and taxes in economies where business is conducted; and (10) the ability to successfully integrate businesses that may be acquired into the Company\u2019s operations.\nIn addition to the other information in this Form 10-K and our other filings with the SEC, the following risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating us and our business before investing in our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us and are not listed in any order of magnitude or likelihood of occurrence. Additional risks and uncertainties, not presently known to us or otherwise, may also impair our business. If any of the risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and investors may lose all or part of their investment. All written and verbal descriptions of our business, operations and assets and all forward-looking statements attributable to the Company or any person acting on the Company\u2019s behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by the risks, uncertainties, and cautionary statements contained herein.\nGlobal economic conditions may adversely impact our business, operating results or financial condition.\nDisruption and volatility in global financial markets may lead to increased rates of default and bankruptcy and may negatively impact consumer and business spending levels. These macroeconomic developments could adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition. Current or potential customers may delay or decrease spending on our products and services as their business and/or budgets are impacted by economic conditions. The inability of current and potential customers to pay SIFCO for its products and services may adversely affect its earnings and cash flows.\nGovernment spending priorities and terms may change in a manner adverse to our business.\nAt times, our military business has been adversely affected by significant changes in U.S. defense and national security budgets. Budget changes that result in a decline in overall spending, program delays, program cancellations or a slowing of new program starts on programs in which we participate could materially adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations. Future levels of expenditures and authorizations for defense-related programs by the U.S. government may decrease, remain constant or shift to programs in areas where we do not currently provide products, thereby reducing the chances that we will be awarded new contracts.\nSIFCO has contracts for programs where the period of performance may exceed one year. Congress and certain foreign governments must usually approve funds for a given program each fiscal year and may significantly reduce funding of a program in a particular year. Significant reductions in these appropriations or the amount of new defense contracts awarded may affect our ability to complete contracts, obtain new work and grow our business. Congress does not always enact spending bills by the beginning of the new fiscal year. Such delays leave the affected agencies under-funded, which delay their ability to contract. Future delays and uncertainties in funding could impose additional business risks on us.\nA deadlock in the U.S. Congress over budgets and spending could cause another partial shutdown of the U.S. government, which could result in a termination or suspension of some or all of our contracts with suppliers to the U.S. government.\nCongress may fail to pass a budget or continuing resolution, which could result in a partial shutdown of the U.S. government and cause the termination or suspension of our contracts with suppliers to the U.S. government. SIFCO could be required to furlough affected employees for an indefinite time. It is uncertain in such a circumstance if we would be compensated or reimbursed for any loss of revenue during such a shutdown. If we were not compensated or reimbursed, it could result in significant adverse effects on our revenues, operating costs and cash flows.\nFurther consolidation in the aerospace industry could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nThe aerospace and defense industry is experiencing significant consolidation among its customers, competitors and suppliers. Consolidation among our customers in the industry may result in pricing pressures, delays in the award of new contracts, and losses of existing business for SIFCO. Consolidation among our competitors may result in larger competitors with greater resources and market share, which could adversely affect our ability to compete successfully. Consolidation among our suppliers may result in fewer sources of supply and increased cost and lower gross margin to SIFCO.\nChanges in future business or other market conditions could cause business investments and/or recorded goodwill or other long- term assets to become impaired, resulting in substantial losses and write-downs that would reduce our results of operations.\nAs part of our strategy, we will, from time to time, acquire a business. These investments are made upon careful analysis and due diligence procedures designed to achieve a desired return or strategic objective. These procedures often involve certain assumptions and judgment in determining acquisition price. After acquisition, unforeseen issues could arise that adversely affect the anticipated returns, or which are otherwise not recoverable as an adjustment to the purchase price. Even after diligent integration efforts, actual operating results may vary significantly from initial estimates. We evaluate the recorded goodwill balances for potential impairment annually as of July 31, or when circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. The goodwill impairment test is performed by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying value, including recorded goodwill. Any future impairment could result in substantial losses and write-downs that would reduce our results of operations.\nWe are subject to the cyclical nature of the aerospace and energy industries and any future downturn in these industries could adversely impact the demand for our products.\nThe commercial aerospace industry is historically driven by the demand from commercial airlines for new aircraft. The U.S. and international commercial aviation industries continue to face challenges arising from competitive pressures. Demand for commercial aircraft is influenced by airline industry profitability, trends in airline passenger traffic, the state of U.S. and world economies, the ability of aircraft purchasers to obtain required financing and numerous other factors including the effects of terrorism, health and safety concerns and environmental constraints imposed upon aircraft operators. The military aerospace cycle is highly dependent on U.S. and foreign government funding; as well as the effects of terrorism, a changing global political environment, U.S. foreign policy, the retirement of older aircraft and technological improvements to new engines. Accordingly, the timing, duration and severity of cyclical upturns and downturns cannot be forecast with certainty. Downturns or reductions in demand could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe power generation market is also cyclical in nature. Global demand for power generation products is affected by the state of the world economies, the availability of financing to power generation project sponsors, the political environments of numerous countries and environmental constraints imposed upon power project operators. The availability of fuels and related prices also have a large impact on demand. Reductions in demand for our power generation products could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nCyclical declines or sustained weakness in either of these markets could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFailure to retain existing contracts or win new contracts under competitive bidding processes may adversely affect our sales.\nSIFCO obtains most of its contracts through a competitive bidding process, and substantially all of the business that we expect to seek in the foreseeable future likely will be subject to a competitive bidding process. Competitive bidding presents a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\nthe need to compete against companies or teams of companies with more financial and marketing resources and more experience in bidding on and performing major contracts than we have;\n\u2022\nthe need to compete against companies or teams of companies that may be long-term, entrenched incumbents for a particular contract for which we are competing and that have, as a result, greater domain expertise and better customer relations;\n\u2022\nthe need to compete to retain existing contracts that have in the past been awarded to us on a sole-source basis or that have been incumbent for a long time;\n\u2022\nthe award of contracts to providers offering solutions at the \u201clowest price technically acceptable,\u201d which may lower the profit we may generate under a contract awarded using this pricing method or prevent us from submitting a bid for such work due to us deeming such work to be unprofitable;\n\u2022\nthe reduction of margins achievable under any contracts awarded to us;\n\u2022\nthe need to bid on some programs in advance of the completion of their specifications, which may result in unforeseen technological difficulties or increased costs that lower our profitability;\n\u2022\nthe substantial cost and managerial time and effort, including design, development and marketing activities, necessary to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that may not be awarded to us;\n\u2022\nthe need to develop, introduce and implement new and enhanced solutions to our customers\u2019 needs;\n\u2022\nthe need to locate and contract with teaming partners and subcontractors;\n\u2022\nthe need to accurately estimate the resources and cost structure that will be required to perform any contract that we are awarded; and\n\u2022\nlong term agreements - cost profile can change over the life of contract.\nIf SIFCO wins a contract, and upon expiration, the customer requires further services of the type provided by the contract, there is frequently a competitive rebidding process. There can be no assurance that we will win any particular bid, that we will win the contract at the same profit margin, or that we will be able to replace business lost upon expiration or completion of a contract.\nIf SIFCO is unable to consistently retain existing contracts or win new contract awards, our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nThe Company may not receive the full amounts estimated under the contracts in our total backlog, which could reduce our sales in future periods below the levels anticipated, and which makes backlog an uncertain indicator of future operating results.\nAs of September 30, 2015, the total backlog was $94.8 million. Orders may be canceled and scope adjustments may occur, and we may not realize the full amounts of sales that we anticipate in our backlog numbers. Additionally, the timing of receipt of orders, if any, on contracts included in our backlog could change. The failure to realize amounts reflected in our backlog could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations in future periods.\nSIFCO business is dependent on a small number of direct and indirect customers.\nA substantial portion of SIFCO's business is conducted with a relatively small number of large direct and indirect customers, including United Technologies Corporation and the Boeing Company. These two customers accounted for approximately 38% percent of our total net sales for fiscal 2015. In fiscal 2015, a key customer closed its facility, resulting in a significant loss of revenue to the Company.\nNo other customer directly accounted for more than 10 percent of total sales; however, General Electric, Rolls Royce, Spirit AeroSystems, and Textron Inc. are also considered key customers. A financial hardship experienced by any one of these key customers, the loss of any of them or a reduction in or substantial delay of orders from any of them could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe Company's failure to identify, attract and retain qualified personnel could adversely affect our existing business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSIFCO may not be able to identify, attract or retain qualified technical personnel, sales and customer service personnel, employees with expertise in forging, or management personnel to supervise such activities. We may also not attract and retain employees who share the Company's core values, who can maintain and grow our existing business, and who are suited to work in a public company environment, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company's business could be negatively affected by cyber or other security threats or other disruptions.\nSIFCO faces cyber threats, threats to the physical security of our facilities and employees, including senior executives, and terrorist acts, as well as the potential for business disruptions associated with information technology failures, damaging weather or other acts of nature, and pandemics or other public health crises, which may adversely affect our business.\nSIFCO has experienced and expects to continue to experience, cybersecurity threats, including threats to our information technology infrastructure and attempts to gain access to the Company\u2019s sensitive information, as do our customers, suppliers and subcontractors. Although we maintain information security policies and procedures to prevent, detect, and mitigate these threats, cybersecurity incidents, depending on their nature and scope, could potentially result in misappropriations, destruction, corruption or unavailability of critical data and confidential or proprietary information (our own or that of third parties) and disrupt the business operations.\nAlthough SIFCO works cooperatively with its customers, suppliers and and subcontractors to seek to minimize the impacts of cyber threats, other security threats or business disruptions, in addition to our internal processes, procedures and systems, it must also rely on the safeguards put in place by those entities.\nThe costs related to cyber or other security threats or disruptions may not be fully mitigated by insurance or other means. The occurrence of any of these events could adversely affect our internal operations, the services we provide to customers, our competitive advantages, our future financial results, our reputation, our stock price, and lead to early obsolescence of our products and services. The occurrence of any of these events could also result in civil and/or criminal liabilities.\nSIFCO relies on our suppliers to meet the quality or delivery expectations of our customers.\nThe ability to deliver SIFCO's products and services on schedule is dependent upon a variety of factors, including execution of internal performance plans, availability of raw materials, internal and supplier produced parts and structures, conversion of raw materials into parts and assemblies, and performance of suppliers and others. We rely on numerous third-party suppliers for raw materials and a large proportion of the components used in our production process. Certain of these raw materials and components are available only from single sources or a limited number of suppliers, or similarly, customers\u2019 specifications may require SIFCO to obtain raw materials and/or components from a single source or certain suppliers. Many of our suppliers are small companies with limited financial resources and manufacturing capabilities. We do not currently have the ability to manufacture these components ourselves. Consequently, we risk disruptions in our supply of key products and components if our suppliers fail or are unable to perform because of shortages in raw materials, operational problems, strikes, natural disasters, financial condition or other factors. We may have disputes with our vendors arising from, among other things, the quality of products and services or customer concerns about the vendor. If any of our vendors fail to timely meet their contractual obligations or have regulatory compliance or other problems, our ability to fulfill our obligations may be jeopardized. Economic downturns can adversely affect a vendor\u2019s ability to manufacture or deliver products. Further, vendors may also be enjoined from manufacturing and distributing products to us as a result of litigation filed by third parties, including intellectual property litigation. If SIFCO were to experience difficulty in obtaining certain products, there could be an adverse effect on its results of operations and on its customer relationships and our reputation. Additionally, our key vendors could also increase pricing of their products, which could negatively affect our ability to win contracts by offering competitive prices.\nAny material supply disruptions could adversely affect our ability to perform our obligations under our contracts and could result in cancellation of contracts or purchase orders, penalties, delays in realizing revenues, and payment delays, as well as adversely affect our ongoing product cost structure.\nFailure to perform by our subcontractors could materially and adversely affect our contract performance and its ability to obtain future business.\nThe performance of contracts often involves subcontractors, upon which we rely to complete delivery of products to our customers. SIFCO may have disputes with subcontractors. A failure by a subcontractor to satisfactorily deliver products can adversely affect our ability to perform our obligations as a prime contractor. Any subcontractor performance deficiencies could result in the customer terminating our contract for default, which could expose us to liability for excess costs of re-procurement by the customer and have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for other contracts.\nThe Company's future success depends on the ability to meet the needs of its customer requirements in a timely manner.\nThe Company believes that the commercial A&E markets in which we operate are changing toward more sophisticated manufacturing and system-integration techniques and capabilities using composite and metallic materials. The future success depends to a significant extent on our ability to acquire and/or develop and execute such sophisticated techniques and capabilities to meet the needs of our customers and to bring those products to market quickly and at cost-effective prices. Accordingly, our performance depends on a number of factors, including our ability to:\n\u2022\nidentify emerging trends in our current and target markets;\n\u2022\ndevelop and maintain competitive products and capabilities that meet our customers' requirements; and\n\u2022\ndevelop, manufacture and bring to market cost-effective offerings in the most efficient manner.\nIf its unable to acquire and/or develop and execute such techniques and capabilities, we may experience an adverse effect to our business, financial condition or results of operation.\nThe terms of our financing arrangements may restrict our financial and operational flexibility, including our ability to invest in new business opportunities.\nThe Company entered into a new credit facility which is comprised of (i) a five year revolving credit facility with a maximum borrowing amount of up to $25.0 million, which reduces to $20.0 million on January 1, 2016 and (ii) a five year term loan of $20.0 million, secured by substantially all the assets of the Company and its U.S. subsidiaries and a pledge of 65% of the stock of its non-U.S. subsidiaries. The new term loan is repayable in quarterly installments of $0.7 million starting September 30, 2015. As of September 30, 2015, the term loan balance was $19.3 million.\nThe loans are subject to certain customary financial covenants, including, without limitation, covenants that require the Company to not exceed a maximum debt to EBITDA ratio and to maintain a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. In the event of a default,\nwe would not be able to access our revolver, which could impact the ability to fund working capital needs, capital expenditures and invest in new business opportunities.\nThe Company faces certain significant risk exposures and potential liabilities that may not be covered adequately by insurance or indemnity.\nWe are exposed to liabilities that are unique to the products we provide. While we maintain insurance for certain risks, the amount of insurance or indemnity may not be adequate to cover all claims or liabilities, and we may be forced to bear substantial costs from an accident or incident. It also is not possible for SIFCO to obtain insurance to protect against all operational risks and liabilities. Substantial claims resulting from an incident in excess of the indemnification we receive and our insurance coverage would harm our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Moreover, any accident or incident for which we are liable, even if fully insured, could negatively affect our standing with our customers and the public, thereby making it more difficult for us to compete effectively, and could significantly impact the cost and availability of adequate insurance in the future.\nSIFCO may acquire other companies, which could increase the levels of debt, increase costs or liabilities, require alternative forms of capital, increase competition, or be disruptive to the business.\nPart of our strategy involves the acquisition of other companies. SIFCO cannot ensure that we will be able to integrate acquired companies successfully without substantial expense, delay or operational or financial problems. Such expenses, delays or operational or financial problems may include the following:\n\u2022\nwe may need to divert management resources to integration, which may adversely affect our ability to pursue other more profitable activities;\n\u2022\nintegration may be difficult as a result of the necessity of coordinating geographically separated organizations, integrating personnel with disparate business backgrounds and combining different corporate cultures;\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to eliminate redundant costs anticipated at the time we select acquisition candidates; and\n\u2022\none or more of our acquisition candidates may have unexpected liabilities, fraud risk, or adverse operating issues that we fail to discover through our due diligence procedures prior to the acquisition.\nAs a result, the integration of acquired businesses may be costly and may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company's business is subject to risks associated with international operations.\nOn July 1, 2015, SIFCO acquired C*Blade, located in Maniago, Italy. C*Blade is a manufacturer of metal forgings for the energy market. A number of risks inherent in international operations could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, including:\n\u2022\nfluctuations in U.S. dollar value arising from transactions denominated in foreign currencies and the translation of certain foreign currency subsidiary balances;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing multi-national operations;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and political uncertainties and potential for social unrest in countries in which we or our customers operate;\n\u2022\nlimitations on our ability to enforce legal rights and remedies;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on the repatriation of funds;\n\u2022\nchanges in trade policies;\n\u2022\ntariff regulations;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in obtaining export and import licenses\n\u2022\nthe risk of government financed competition; and\n\u2022\ncompliance with a variety of international laws as well as U.S. regulations, rules and practices affecting the activities of companies abroad.\nThe funding and costs associated with our pension plans and significant changes in key estimates and assumptions, such as discount rates and assumed long-term returns on assets, actual investment returns on our pension plan assets, and legislative and regulatory actions could affect our earnings, equity and contributions to our pension plans in future periods.\nCertain of the Company's employees are covered by its noncontributory defined benefit pension plans (\"Plans\"). The impact of these Plans on our earnings may be volatile in that the amount of expense we record for our pension plans may materially change from year to year because those calculations are sensitive to changes in several key economic assumptions, including discount\nrates, inflation, salary growth, expected return on plan assets, retirement rates and mortality rates. These pension costs are dependent on significant judgment in the use of various estimates and assumptions, particularly with respect to the discount rate and expected long-term rates of return on plan assets. Changes to these estimates and assumptions could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Differences between actual investment returns and our assumed long-term returns on assets will result in changes in future pension expense and the funded status of our Plans, and could increase future funding of the Plans. Changes in these factors affect our plan funding, cash flows, earnings, and shareholders\u2019 equity.\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly.\nAn active, liquid and orderly market for our common stock may not be sustained, which could depress the trading price of our common stock.\nVolatility in the market price of our common stock may prevent you from being able to sell your shares at or above the price you paid for your shares or at all. The market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly for various reasons, which include:\n\u2022\nour quarterly or annual earnings or those of our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe public\u2019s reaction to our press releases, our other public announcements and our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates or recommendations by research analysts who track the stocks of our competitors;\n\u2022\nnew laws or regulations or new interpretations of laws or regulations applicable to our business;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u2022\nchanges in general conditions in the domestic and global economies or financial markets, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism or responses to such events;\n\u2022\nlitigation involving our company or investigations or audits by regulators into the operations of our company or our competitors;\n\u2022\nstrategic action by our competitors;\n\u2022\nsales of common stock by our directors, executive officers and significant shareholders; and\n\u2022\nour stock being closely held by insider holdings is thinly traded which impacts price volatility.\nIn addition, the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. Broad market and industry factors may seriously affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of actual operating performance. In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. If litigation is instituted against us, it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources.\nAdverse global economic conditions may have significant effects on our customers that would result in our inability to borrow or to meet our debt service coverage ratio in our revolving credit facility.\nThe Company received a waiver from its Lender related to certain non-financial covenants for fiscal 2015. With the waiver, the Company was in compliance with all covenants contained in its revolving credit facility and term loan as of September 30, 2015. Although the Company expects to remain in compliance throughout fiscal 2016, declines in demand in the aerospace and energy industries and in sales volumes could adversely impact our ability to remain in compliance with certain of these financial covenants. Additionally, to the extent our customers are adversely affected by a decline in the economy in general, they may not be able to pay their accounts payable to us on a timely basis or at all.\nIf SIFCO is unable to pay annual dividends at the targeted level, SIFCO's reputation and stock price may be harmed.\nThe dividend program requires the use of a portion of our cash flows. The ability to pay annual dividends will depend in large part on our ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future. This ability may be subject to certain economic, financial, competitive and other factors that are beyond our control. The board of directors, at its discretion, suspended the annual dividend this fiscal year and may at its discretion decrease the targeted annual dividend amount or entirely discontinue the payment of dividends at any time in the future. Any failure to pay dividends after we have announced the intention to do so may adversely affect our reputation and investor confidence in SIFCO and negatively impact our stock price.\nIf the Company fails to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, it may not be able to accurately or timely report its financial results. As a result, current and potential shareholders could lose confidence in the Company's financial reporting, which would harm the business and the trading price of its common stock.\nIn connection with SIFCO's assessment of its effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of September 30, 2015, the Company concluded that its internal controls over financial reporting were not effective and as a result, contributed to a delay in the filing of its annual report on Form 10-K beyond the extended filing date.\nThe Company installed a new, complex ERP system at the corporate office and two operating locations. The complexity of the system and lack of adequate training contributed to material weaknesses described in Item 9A. The Company also experienced significant accounting personnel turnover throughout the year which contributed to material weaknesses on account reconciliation preparation and reviews and application of cash receipts to outstanding receivable balances. There were material weaknesses related to revenue recognition and monitoring controls as well. Under standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, a material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected or corrected on a timely basis.\nThe Company received a letter of notification from the NYSE MKT LLC (\"NYSE\") indicating that the Company is below certain of the continued listing standards of the NYSE as set forth in Sections 134 and 1101 of the NYSE MKT Company Guide, due to the delay in filing its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended September 30, 2015 beyond the extended filing date. The Company is developing a plan of compliance for the NYSE which addresses its efforts to regain compliance with applicable listing standards. The plan of compliance must be accepted by the NYSE.\nManagement and the Company's Board of Directors are committed to improving the Company's overall system of internal control over financial reporting. The Company is in the process of designing and implementing additional controls and improving existing controls to remediate the material weaknesses that exist as of September 30, 2015. These actions are subject to ongoing senior management review as well as audit committee oversight.\nAlthough we plan to complete this remediation as quickly as possible, we cannot at this time estimate how long it will take, and our initiatives may not prove to be successful. As with any internal control deficiency, our remedial measures may be insufficient to address the material weaknesses, or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting are discovered or occur in the future, our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to restate our financial results.\nIncreased competition from low-cost providers and customer pricing pressures could reduce the demand and/or price for our products and services.\nThe end-user markets SIFCO serves are highly competitive and price sensitive. We compete globally with a number of domestic and international companies that have substantially greater manufacturing, purchasing, marketing and financial resources than we do. Many of SIFCO's customers have the in-house capability to fulfill their manufacturing requirements. SIFCO's larger competitors may be able to vie more effectively for very large-scale contracts than we can by providing different or greater capabilities or benefits such as technical qualifications, past performance on large-scale contracts, geographic presence, price and availability of key professional personnel. If SIFCO is unable to successfully compete for new business, our net sales growth and operating margins may decline. Several of SIFCO's major customers have completed extensive cost containment efforts and SIFCO expects continued pricing pressures in 2016 and beyond. Competitive pricing pressures may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. Further, there can be no assurance that competition from existing or potential competitors will not have a material adverse effect on our financial results. If SIFCO does not continue to compete effectively and win contracts, our future business, financial condition, results of operations and our ability to meet its financial obligations may be materially compromised.\nThe occurrence of litigation where we could be named as a defendant is unpredictable.\nFrom time to time, we are involved in various legal and other proceedings that are incidental to the conduct of our business. While we believe no current proceedings, if adversely determined, could have a material adverse effect on our financial results, no assurances can be given. Any such claims may divert financial and management resources that would otherwise be used to benefit our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nDamage or destruction of our facilities caused by storms, earthquakes or other causes could adversely affect our financial results and financial condition.\nWe have operations located in regions of the world that may be exposed to damaging storms, earthquakes and other natural disasters. Although we maintain standard property casualty insurance covering our properties and may be able to recover costs associated with certain natural disasters through insurance. Two of our properties are located in Southern California, an area subject to earthquake activity, but we do not carry any earthquake insurance based on our assessment of the potential risk to our equipment and facilities. Even if covered by insurance, any significant damage or destruction of our facilities due to storms, earthquakes or other natural disasters could result in its inability to meet customer delivery schedules and may result in the loss of customers and significant additional costs to SIFCO. Thus, any significant damage or destruction of our properties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nLabor disruptions by our employees could adversely affect our business.\nAs of September 30, 2015, we employed approximately 593 people. Two of our domestic operating locations are parties to collective bargaining agreements, covering 107 full time hourly employees and 30 full time hourly employees, respectively, and will expire May 2020 and July 2017, respectively. The Italian operating location is a party to the National Collective Agreement in Metalworking, which covers all 157 employees, and expired in December 2015 (currently undergoing renewal negotiations). Although we have not experienced any material labor-related work stoppage and consider our relations with our employees to be good, labor stoppages may occur in the future. If the unionized workers were to engage in a strike or other work stoppage, if SIFCO is unable to negotiate acceptable collective bargaining agreements with the unions or if other employees were to become unionized, we could experience a significant disruption of our operations, higher ongoing labor costs and possible loss of customer contracts, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nMarket volatility and adverse capital or credit market conditions may affect our ability to access cost-effective sources of funding and may expose SIFCO to risks associated with the financial viability of suppliers.\nThe financial markets can experience high levels of volatility and disruption, reducing the availability of credit for certain issuers. We sometimes access these markets to support certain business activities, including acquisitions and capital expansion projects, obtaining credit support for our workers' compensation self-insurance program and refinancing existing indebtedness. Depending on the condition of the capital or credit markets existing at the time, we may be unable in the future to obtain capital market financing or bank financing on favorable terms, or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nTightening credit markets could also adversely affect our suppliers' ability to obtain financing. Delays in suppliers' ability to obtain financing, or the unavailability of financing, could negatively affect their ability to perform their contracts with SIFCO and cause our inability to meet our contract obligations. The inability of our suppliers to obtain financing could also result in the need for us to transition to alternate suppliers, which could result in significant incremental costs and delays.\nUnanticipated changes in our tax provisions or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability and cash flow.\nSIFCO is subject to income taxes in the United States and various jurisdictions in Europe. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes. In the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Changes in applicable income tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation, could result in higher or lower income tax rates or changes in the taxability of certain sales or the deductibility of certain expenses, thereby affecting our income tax expense and profitability. In addition, the final results of any tax audits or related litigation could be materially different from our related historical income tax provisions and accruals. Additionally, changes in our tax rate as a result of changes in our overall profitability, changes in tax legislation, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in differences between financial reporting income and taxable income, the examination of previously filed tax returns by taxing authorities and continuing assessments of our tax exposures can also impact our tax liabilities and affect our income tax expense, profitability and cash flow.\nThe Company uses estimates when pricing contracts and any changes in such estimates could have an adverse effect on our profitability and our overall financial performance.\nWhen agreeing to contractual terms, some of which extend for multiple years, SIFCO makes assumptions and projections about future conditions and events. These projections assess the productivity and availability of labor, complexity of the work to be performed, cost and availability of materials, impact of delayed performance and timing of product deliveries. Contract pricing\nrequires judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating contract revenues and costs, and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Due to the size and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total revenues and costs at completion is complicated and subject to many variables. For example, assumptions are made regarding the length of time to complete a contract since costs also include expected increases in wages, prices for materials and allocated fixed costs. Similarly, assumptions are made regarding the future impact of our efficiency initiatives and cost reduction efforts. Incentives, awards or penalties related to performance on contracts are considered in estimating revenue and profit rates and are recorded when there is sufficient information to assess anticipated performance. Suppliers' assertions are also assessed and considered in estimating costs and profit rates.\nBecause of the significance of the judgment and estimation processes described above, it is possible that materially different amounts could be obtained if different assumptions were used or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances or estimates may have a material adverse effect upon the profitability of one or more of the affected contracts, future period financial reporting and performance.\nOur technologies could become obsolete, reducing our revenues and profitability.\nThe future of our business will depend in large part upon the continuing relevance of our forging capabilities. SIFCO could encounter competition from new or revised technologies that render its technologies and equipment less profitable or obsolete in our chosen markets and our operating results may suffer.", "PERMNO": 49138, "SIC": 3724, "TIC": "SIF"}
