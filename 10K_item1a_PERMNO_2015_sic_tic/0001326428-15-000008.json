Factors that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results or liquidity and the trading price of our units are described below. This information should be considered carefully, together with other information in this report and other reports and materials we file with the SEC.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors - Continued\nWe may not have sufficient net cash provided by operating activities to pay our distribution at the current distribution level, or at all, and as a result, future distributions to our unitholders may be reduced, suspended or eliminated.\nWhile our Board of Directors makes discretionary adjustments to net cash provided by operating activities when declaring a distribution for the current period, if we generate insufficient net cash provided by operating activities for a sustained period of time and/or forecasts demonstrate expectations of continued future insufficiencies, our Board of Directors may determine to reduce, suspend or eliminate our distribution to unitholders. Any such reduction, suspension or elimination in distributions may cause the trading price of our units to decline. Factors that may cause us to generate net cash provided by operating activities that is insufficient to pay our current distribution to unitholders include, among other things, the following:\n\u2022\nUnhedged oil production: Our expected oil production for 2015 is approximately 70% hedged at approximately $94 per Bbl and 2016 is approximately 65% hedged at approximately $90 per Bbl. As a result, a meaningful portion of our expected oil production for 2015 and 2016 remains unhedged and subject to fluctuating market prices. If we are ultimately unable to hedge additional expected oil production volumes for 2015 and beyond, we will be subject to further potential commodity price volatility, which may result in lower than expected net cash provided by operating activities. Consequently, our Board of Directors may determine to reduce, suspend or eliminate future distributions to our unitholders.\n\u2022\nReduced capital expenditures: As previously announced, we have approved a 2015 budget which includes a 61% reduction in capital expenditures to approximately $600 million, from approximately $1.6 billion spent in 2014. If our capital program continues to be limited or is further reduced in the future, our production volumes and revenues may be lower than expected, net cash provided by operating activities could be insufficient to pay our current distribution to unitholders, and our Board of Directors may determine to reduce, suspend or eliminate future distributions to our unitholders.\n\u2022\nLiquidity position: Our liquidity is dependent on many factors, including availability under our Credit Facilities, as defined in Note 6, and cost and access to capital and credit markets, which are affected by the price and performance of our equity and debt securities. If the borrowing bases under our Credit Facilities are reduced and we are otherwise unable to maintain our current liquidity position, we may no longer have the financial flexibility to manage our business, including funding our planned capital expenditures, and our Board of Directors may determine to reduce, suspend or eliminate future distributions to our unitholders.\n\u2022\nAbility to consummate accretive acquisitions: Accretive acquisitions are an integral component of our business strategy. When cash flows are expected to be lower as a result of weak commodity prices on unhedged volumes, under-performance of assets, or declining contract prices on hedged volumes, we seek to make accretive acquisitions of oil and natural gas properties to cover potential shortfalls in net cash provided by operating activities in order to maintain our distribution level. As a result of the effect of weakened commodity prices on the price of our equity and debt securities, we may be limited in our ability to access the capital markets at an acceptable cost or at all; thus, our ability to make accretive acquisitions may be limited, in which case our Board of Directors may determine to reduce, suspend or eliminate future distributions to our unitholders.\nAs a result of these and other factors, the amount of cash we distribute to our unitholders in the future may be significantly less than the current distribution level, and future distributions to our unitholders may be reduced, suspended or eliminated.\nThe borrowing bases under our Credit Facilities are subject to redetermination and any reduction in either borrowing base may result in our having to repay indebtedness under our Credit Facilities earlier than anticipated, potentially causing future distributions to our unitholders to be reduced, suspended or eliminated.\nEach of our Credit Facilities is subject to scheduled redeterminations of its borrowing base, based primarily on reserve reports using lender commodity price expectations at such time, semi-annually in April and October. Additionally the lenders under the LINN Credit Facility have the ability to request an interim redetermination of the borrowing base once per calendar year and the lenders under the Berry Credit Facility have the ability to request an interim redetermination of the borrowing base once between scheduled redeterminations. If current low commodity prices continue through such redetermination events, the borrowing base under either Credit Facility may be reduced. Upon any such potential reduction, any outstanding\nItem 1A. Risk Factors - Continued\nindebtedness in excess of the new borrowing base may become due within a short time span or we must pledge other properties as additional collateral. We currently have limited unpledged properties.\nIn particular, because the Berry Credit Facility is effectively fully drawn, any such reduction in the Berry Credit Facility\u2019s borrowing base may require Berry and us to make mandatory prepayments under the Berry Credit Facility to the extent existing indebtedness under the Berry Credit Facility exceeds the new borrowing base, or we may choose to post restricted cash on Berry\u2019s behalf, reducing our liquidity position. If we are required to repay indebtedness under either of our Credit Facilities earlier than anticipated due to a borrowing base redetermination, it may be necessary to use cash that would otherwise be available for capital expenditures or distributions to our unitholders to repay such indebtedness. As a result of this, future distributions to our unitholders may be reduced, suspended or eliminated. In addition, any failure to repay indebtedness in excess of our borrowing bases would constitute an event of default under the Credit Facilities, and could cause a cross-default under our other outstanding indebtedness.\nCommodity prices are volatile, and a significant decline in commodity prices for a prolonged period would reduce our revenues, net cash provided by operating activities and profitability and we may have to lower our distribution or may not be able to pay distributions at all.\nOur revenues, profitability and cash flow depend on the prices of and demand for oil, natural gas and NGL. The oil, natural gas and NGL market is very volatile and a drop in prices can significantly affect our financial results and impede our growth. Changes in oil, natural gas and NGL prices have a significant impact on the value of our reserves and on our net cash provided by operating activities. Prices for these commodities may fluctuate widely in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for them, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control, such as:\n\u2022\nthe domestic and foreign supply of and demand for oil, natural gas and NGL;\n\u2022\nthe price and level of foreign imports;\n\u2022\nthe level of consumer product demand;\n\u2022\nweather conditions;\n\u2022\noverall domestic and global economic conditions;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic conditions in oil and natural gas producing countries;\n\u2022\nthe ability of members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to agree to and maintain price and production controls;\n\u2022\nthe impact of the U.S. dollar exchange rates on oil, natural gas and NGL prices;\n\u2022\ntechnological advances affecting energy consumption;\n\u2022\ndomestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxation;\n\u2022\nthe impact of energy conservation efforts;\n\u2022\nthe proximity and capacity of pipelines and other transportation facilities; and\n\u2022\nthe price and availability of alternative fuels.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2014 and subsequent to December 31, 2014, the prices of oil, natural gas and NGLs have been extremely volatile and declined significantly. Downward pressure on commodity prices has continued in 2015 and may continue for the foreseeable future. If commodity prices continue at current levels for a prolonged period or further decline, our net cash provided by operating activities will decline, and we may have to reduce our distribution, which we did at the beginning of 2015, or future distributions to our unitholders may be suspended or eliminated.\nWe may not have sufficient net cash provided by operating activities to pay our distribution at the current distribution level, or at all, and future distributions to our unitholders may fluctuate from quarter to quarter.\nWe may not have sufficient net cash provided by operating activities each quarter to pay our distribution at the current distribution level or at all. Under the terms of our limited liability company agreement, the amount of cash otherwise available for distribution will be reduced by our operating expenses and any cash reserve amounts that our Board of Directors establishes to provide for future operations, future capital expenditures, future debt service requirements and future cash\nItem 1A. Risk Factors - Continued\ndistributions to our unitholders. The amount of cash we can distribute on our units principally depends upon the amount of cash we generate from our operations, which will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on, among other things:\n\u2022\nproduced volumes of oil, natural gas and NGL;\n\u2022\nprices at which oil, natural gas and NGL production is sold;\n\u2022\nlevel of our operating costs;\n\u2022\npayment of interest, which depends on the amount of our indebtedness and the interest payable thereon; and\n\u2022\nlevel of our capital expenditures.\nFor example, in response to significantly lower oil prices beginning in the fourth quarter of 2014, and in order to solidify our financial position and regain a useful cost of capital, we reduced our oil and natural gas capital budget and distribution to unitholders. In addition, the actual amount of cash we will have available for distribution will depend on other factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\navailability of borrowings on acceptable terms under the LINN Credit Facility, as defined in Note 6, to pay distributions;\n\u2022\nthe costs of acquisitions, if any;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in our working capital needs;\n\u2022\ntiming and collectability of receivables;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on distributions contained in our Credit Facilities and the indentures governing our May 2019 Senior Notes, November 2019 Senior Notes, 2010 Issued Senior Notes, Berry November 2020 Senior Notes and Berry September 2022 Senior Notes, as defined in Note 6;\n\u2022\nprevailing economic conditions;\n\u2022\naccess to credit or capital markets; and\n\u2022\nthe amount of cash reserves established by our Board of Directors for the proper conduct of our business.\nAs a result of these and other factors, the amount of cash we distribute to our unitholders may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and may be significantly less than the current distribution level, or the distribution may be reduced, suspended or eliminated.\nWe actively seek to acquire oil and natural gas properties. Acquisitions involve potential risks that could adversely impact our future growth and our ability to increase or pay distributions at the current level, or at all.\nAny acquisition involves potential risks, including, among other things:\n\u2022\nthe risk that reserves expected to support the acquired assets may not be of the anticipated magnitude or may not be developed as anticipated;\n\u2022\nthe risk of title defects discovered after closing;\n\u2022\ninaccurate assumptions about revenues and costs, including synergies;\n\u2022\nsignificant increases in our indebtedness and working capital requirements;\n\u2022\nan inability to transition and integrate successfully or timely the businesses we acquire;\n\u2022\nthe cost of transition and integration of data systems and processes;\n\u2022\nthe potential environmental problems and costs;\n\u2022\nthe assumption of unknown liabilities;\n\u2022\nlimitations on rights to indemnity from the seller;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u2022\nincreased demands on existing personnel and on our corporate structure;\n\u2022\ndisputes arising out of acquisitions;\n\u2022\ncustomer or key employee losses of the acquired businesses; and\n\u2022\nthe failure to realize expected growth or profitability.\nThe scope and cost of these risks may ultimately be materially greater than estimated at the time of the acquisition. Further, our future acquisition costs may be higher than those we have achieved historically. Any of these factors could adversely impact our future growth and our ability to increase or pay distributions.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors - Continued\nIf we do not make future acquisitions on economically acceptable terms, then our growth and ability to pay or increase distributions will be limited.\nOur ability to grow and to pay or increase distributions to our unitholders is partially dependent on our ability to make acquisitions that result in an increase in net cash provided by operating activities. We may be unable to make such acquisitions because we are:\n\u2022\nunable to identify attractive acquisition candidates or negotiate acceptable purchase agreements with them;\n\u2022\nunable to obtain financing for these acquisitions on economically acceptable terms; or\n\u2022\noutbid by competitors.\nIn any such case, our future growth and ability to pay or increase distributions will be limited. Furthermore, even if we do make acquisitions that we believe will increase net cash provided by operating activities, these acquisitions may nevertheless result in a decrease in available cash flow per unit and future distributions to our unitholders may be reduced, suspended or eliminated.\nIf we are unable to replace declines in production, proved developed producing reserves and cash flow from discretionary reductions for a portion of our oil and natural gas development costs, our net cash provided by operating activities could be reduced, which could adversely affect our ability to pay a distribution at the current level or at all.\nIn determining the amount of cash that we distribute to unitholders, our Board of Directors establishes at the end of each year an amount of capital expenditures for the next year (which we refer to as discretionary reductions for a portion of oil and natural gas development costs) with the objective of replacing proved developed producing reserves, current production and cash flow, taking into consideration our overall commodity mix. Management evaluates all of these objectives as part of the decision-making process to determine the discretionary reductions for a portion of oil and natural gas development costs for the year, although every objective may not be met in each year. Furthermore, there may be certain years in which commodity prices and other economic conditions do not merit capital spending at a level sufficient to accomplish any of these objectives.\nIn determining this portion of oil and natural gas development costs (which may include estimated drilling and development costs associated with projects to convert a portion of non-producing reserves to producing status but does not include the historical cost of acquired properties as those amounts have already been spent in prior periods and were financed primarily with external sources of funding), management evaluates historical results of our drilling and development activities based on periodically revised and updated information from past years to assess the costs, adequacy and effectiveness of such activities and future assumptions regarding cost trends, production and decline rates and reserve recoveries. However, our management does not conduct an analysis to evaluate historical amounts of capital actually spent on such drilling and development activities. Our ability to pursue projects with the intent to replace proved developed producing reserves, current production and cash flow through drilling and development activities is limited to our inventory of development opportunities on our existing acreage position. Management\u2019s estimate of this discretionary portion of our oil and natural gas development costs does not include the historical acquisition cost of projects pursued during the year or the acquisition of new oil and natural gas reserves. Moreover, our assumptions regarding costs, production and decline rates and reserve recoveries may prove incorrect. After establishing the amount of discretionary reductions for a portion of oil and natural gas development costs, if we do not fully replace proved developed producing reserves, current production and cash flow, our net cash provided by operating activities could be reduced, which could adversely affect our ability to pay a distribution at the current level or at all. Furthermore, our existing reserves, inventory of drilling locations and production levels will decline over time as a result of development and production activities. Consequently, if we were to limit our total capital expenditures to this discretionary portion of our oil and natural gas development costs and not complete acquisitions of new reserves, total reserves would decrease over time, resulting in an inability to sustain production at current levels, which could adversely affect our ability to pay a distribution at the current level or at all.\nWe have significant indebtedness under our May 2019 Senior Notes, November 2019 Senior Notes, 2010 Issued Senior Notes, Berry November 2020 Senior Notes and Berry September 2022 Senior Notes (collectively, \u201cSenior Notes\u201d) and, from time to time, our Credit Facilities. For a discussion of our debt, see Note 6. Our Credit Facilities and the indentures governing our Senior Notes have substantial restrictions and financial covenants and we may have difficulty obtaining additional credit, which could adversely affect our operations, our ability to make acquisitions and our ability to pay distributions to our unitholders.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors - Continued\nAs of January 31, 2015, we had an aggregate of approximately $10.3 billion outstanding under Senior Notes and our Credit Facilities (with additional borrowing capacity of approximately $2.2 billion under the LINN Credit Facility). As a result of our indebtedness, we will use a portion of our cash flow to pay interest and principal when due, which will reduce the cash available to finance our operations and other business activities and could limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate.\nThe Credit Facilities restrict our ability to obtain additional financing, make investments, lease equipment, sell assets, enter into commodity and interest rate derivative contracts and engage in business combinations. We are also required to comply with certain financial covenants and ratios under our Credit Facilities and the indentures governing our Senior Notes. Our ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants in the future is uncertain and will be affected by the levels of cash flow from our operations and events or circumstances beyond our control. Our failure to comply with any of the restrictions and covenants could result in an event of default, which, if it continues beyond any applicable cure periods, could cause all of our existing indebtedness to be immediately due and payable.\nWe depend, in part, on our Credit Facilities for future capital needs; however, at December 31, 2014, there was no remaining borrowing capacity available under the Berry Credit Facility. We have drawn on the LINN Credit Facility to fund or partially fund cash distribution payments. Absent such borrowing, we would have at times experienced a shortfall in cash available to pay our declared cash distribution amount. If there is a default by us under our Credit Facilities that continues beyond any applicable cure period, we would be unable to make borrowings to fund distributions. In addition, we may finance acquisitions through borrowings under our Credit Facilities or the incurrence of additional debt. To the extent that we are unable to incur additional debt under our Credit Facilities or otherwise because we are not in compliance with the financial covenants in the Credit Facilities, we may not be able to complete acquisitions, which could adversely affect our ability to pay or increase distributions to our unitholders. Furthermore, to the extent we are unable to refinance our Credit Facilities on terms that are as favorable as those in our existing Credit Facilities, or at all, our ability to fund our operations and our ability to pay distributions could be affected.\nThe borrowing bases under our Credit Facilities are determined semi-annually at the discretion of the lenders and are based in part on oil, natural gas and NGL prices. Significant declines in oil, natural gas or NGL prices may result in a decrease in our borrowing base. The lenders can unilaterally adjust the borrowing base and therefore the borrowings permitted to be outstanding under the Credit Facilities. Any increase in the borrowing base requires the consent of all the lenders. Outstanding borrowings in excess of the borrowing base must be repaid immediately, or we must pledge other properties as additional collateral. We currently have limited unpledged properties, and we may not have the financial resources in the future to make any mandatory principal prepayments if required under the Credit Facilities. Significant declines in our production or significant declines in realized oil, natural gas or NGL prices for prolonged periods and resulting decreases in our borrowing base may force us to reduce, suspend or eliminate future distributions to our unitholders.\nOur ability to access the capital and credit markets to raise capital and borrow on favorable terms will be affected by disruptions in the capital and credit markets, which could adversely affect our operations, our ability to make acquisitions and our ability to pay distributions to our unitholders.\nDisruptions in the capital and credit markets, in particular with respect to companies in the energy sector, could limit our ability to access these markets or may significantly increase our cost to borrow. Recent decreases in commodity prices, among other things, may cause some lenders to increase interest rates, enact tighter lending standards, refuse to refinance existing debt at maturity on favorable terms or at all and may reduce or cease to provide funding to borrowers. If we are unable to access the capital and credit markets on favorable terms, our ability to make acquisitions and pay distributions could be affected and future distributions to our unitholders may be reduced, suspended or eliminated.\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nBorrowings under our Credit Facilities bear interest at variable rates and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase and we are unable to effectively hedge our interest rate risk, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash available for servicing our indebtedness would decrease.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors - Continued\nIncreases in interest rates could adversely affect the demand for our units.\nAn increase in interest rates may cause a corresponding decline in demand for equity investments, in particular for yield-based equity investments such as our units. Any such reduction in demand for our units resulting from other more attractive investment opportunities may cause the trading price of our units to decline.\nThe terms of Berry\u2019s senior notes restrict Berry\u2019s ability to make distributions to us, which may limit the cash available to pay distributions to our unitholders.\nThe indentures governing Berry\u2019s senior notes contain, and any future indebtedness may also contain, a number of restrictive covenants that impose financial restrictions on Berry, including restrictions on Berry\u2019s ability to make cash distributions to us. These restrictions on Berry\u2019s ability to make cash distributions to us may adversely affect our ability to pay distributions to our unitholders at the current level or at all.\nOur commodity derivative activities could result in financial losses or could reduce our income, which may adversely affect our ability to pay distributions to our unitholders.\nTo achieve more predictable net cash provided by operating activities and to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in the prices of oil and natural gas, we enter into commodity derivative contracts for a significant portion of our production. Commodity derivative arrangements expose us to the risk of financial loss in some circumstances, including situations when production is less than expected. If we experience a sustained material interruption in our production or if we are unable to perform our drilling activity as planned, we might be forced to satisfy all or a portion of our derivative obligations without the benefit of the cash flow from our sale of the underlying physical commodity, resulting in a substantial reduction of our liquidity, which may adversely affect our ability to pay distributions to our unitholders and future distributions to our unitholders may be reduced, suspended or eliminated.\nOur limited ability to hedge our NGL production and commodity basis differentials could adversely impact our net cash provided by operating activities and results of operations.\nA liquid, readily available and commercially viable market for hedging NGL and commodity basis differentials has not developed in the same way that exists for crude oil and natural gas priced at WTI and Henry Hub, respectively. The current direct NGL and commodity basis differential hedging market is constrained in terms of price, volume, duration and number of counterparties. This limits both our ability to hedge our NGL production and price difference based on point of sale effectively or at all. As a result, currently, we directly hedge only our oil and natural gas production priced at WTI and Henry Hub, respectively. If the current price levels for NGL continue or decrease in the future or the commodity basis differentials versus WTI or Henry Hub negatively increase, our revenues and results of operations would be affected, net cash provided by operating activities could be insufficient to pay our current distribution to unitholders and future distributions to our unitholders may be reduced, suspended or eliminated.\nCounterparty failure may adversely affect our derivative positions.\nWe cannot be assured that our counterparties will be able to perform under our derivative contracts. If a counterparty fails to perform and the derivative arrangement is terminated, our net cash provided by operating activities could be insufficient to pay our current distribution to unitholders and future distributions to our unitholders may be reduced, suspended or eliminated.\nThe swaps regulatory provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act and the rules adopted thereunder could have an adverse impact on our ability to hedge risks associated with our business and on our results of operations and cash flows.\nTitle VII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d) establishes federal oversight and regulation of the over-the-counter (\u201cOTC\u201d) derivatives market and entities, such as us, that participate in that market. The provisions of that title of the Dodd-Frank Act and the rules of the Commodity Future Trading Commission (\u201cCFTC\u201d) and the SEC adopted and proposed to be adopted thereunder, regulate certain swaps entities, require clearing of certain swaps by clearing organizations and execution of certain swaps on contract markets or swap execution facilities, and require certain reporting and recordkeeping of swaps. They also give the CFTC the authority to establish limits on the positions in certain core futures and equivalent swaps contracts for or linked to certain physical commodities held by market\nItem 1A. Risk Factors - Continued\nparticipants, with exceptions for certain bona fide hedging transactions. The CFTC\u2019s rules establishing position limits were vacated by a federal district court in September 2012. However, on November 5, 2013, the CFTC proposed new position limits rules that would modify and expand the applicability of position limits on certain core futures and equivalent swaps contracts for or linked to certain physical commodities that market participants could hold with exceptions for certain bona fide hedging transactions.\nThe CFTC has designated certain interest rate swaps and certain credit default swaps for mandatory clearing and set compliance dates for three different categories of market participants who are parties to such swaps, the earliest of which was March 11, 2013, and the latest of which was September 9, 2013. The CFTC has not yet proposed rules designating any other classes of swaps, including physical commodity swaps, for mandatory clearing. Although we expect to qualify for the end-user exception from the mandatory clearing and trade execution requirements for our swaps entered to hedge our commercial risks, the application of the mandatory clearing and trade execution requirements to other market participants, such as swap dealers, may change the cost and availability of the swaps that we use for hedging. In addition, for uncleared swaps, the CFTC or federal banking regulators may require our counterparties to require that we enter into credit support documentation and/or post initial and variation margin; however, the proposed margin rules are not yet final, and therefore the application of those provisions to us is uncertain at this time. Provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act may also cause our derivatives counterparties to spin off some or all of their derivatives activities to a separate entity, which could be our counterparty in future swaps and which entity may not be as creditworthy as the current counterparty.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act\u2019s swaps regulatory provisions and the related rules could significantly increase the cost of derivatives contracts (including through requirements to post collateral which could adversely affect our available liquidity), materially alter the terms of derivatives contracts, reduce the availability of derivatives to protect against risks that we encounter, reduce our ability to monetize or restructure our existing derivatives contracts, and increase our exposure to less creditworthy counterparties. If, as a result of the swaps regulatory regime discussed above, we were to reduce our use of swaps to hedge our risks, such as commodity price risks that we encounter in our operations, our results of operations and cash flows may become more volatile and could be otherwise adversely affected.\nIn addition to the Dodd-Frank Act, in 2012, the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (\u201cEMIR\u201d) became effective. EMIR includes regulations related to the trading, reporting and clearing of derivatives and the regulations thereunder may impact our ability to maintain or enter into derivatives with certain of our European counterparties.\nUnless we replace our reserves, our reserves and production will decline, which would adversely affect our revenues, net cash provided by operating activities from operations and our ability to make distributions to our unitholders.\nProducing oil, natural gas and NGL reservoirs are characterized by declining production rates that vary depending on reservoir characteristics and other factors. The overall rate of decline for our production will change if production from our existing wells declines in a different manner than we have estimated and can change when we drill additional wells, make acquisitions and under other circumstances. Thus, our future oil, natural gas and NGL reserves and production and, therefore, our cash flow and income, are highly dependent on our success in efficiently developing our current reserves and economically finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves. We may not be able to develop, find or acquire additional reserves to replace our current and future production at acceptable costs, which would adversely affect our revenues, net cash provided by operating activities and our ability to make distributions to our unitholders.\nFuture price declines or downward reserve revisions may result in a write-down of our asset carrying values, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nDeclines in oil, natural gas and NGL prices may result in our having to make substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves. If this occurs, or if our estimates of development costs increase, production data factors change or drilling results deteriorate, accounting rules may require us to write-down, as a noncash charge to earnings, the carrying value of our properties for impairments. We capitalize costs to acquire, find and develop our oil and natural gas properties under the successful efforts accounting method. We are required to perform impairment tests on our assets periodically and whenever events or changes in circumstances warrant a review of our assets. To the extent such tests indicate a reduction of the estimated useful life or estimated future cash flows of our assets, the carrying value may not be recoverable and therefore would require a write-down. We have incurred impairment charges in the past and may do so in the future. Any impairment could be substantial and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period incurred.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors - Continued\nOur estimated reserves are based on many assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves.\nNo one can measure underground accumulations of oil, natural gas and NGL in an exact manner. Reserve engineering requires subjective estimates of underground accumulations of oil, natural gas and NGL and assumptions concerning future oil, natural gas and NGL prices, production levels and operating and development costs. As a result, estimated quantities of proved reserves and projections of future production rates and the timing of development expenditures may prove to be inaccurate. Independent petroleum engineering firms prepare estimates of our proved reserves. Some of our reserve estimates are made without the benefit of a lengthy production history, which are less reliable than estimates based on a lengthy production history. Also, we make certain assumptions regarding future oil, natural gas and NGL prices, production levels and operating and development costs that may prove incorrect. Any significant variance from these assumptions by actual amounts could greatly affect our estimates of reserves, the economically recoverable quantities of oil, natural gas and NGL attributable to any particular group of properties, the classifications of reserves based on risk of recovery and estimates of the future net cash flows. Decreases in commodity prices can result in a reduction of our estimated reserves if development of those reserves would not be economic at those lower prices. Numerous changes over time to the assumptions on which our reserve estimates are based, as described above, often result in the actual quantities of oil, natural gas and NGL we ultimately recover being different from our reserve estimates.\nThe present value of future net cash flows from our proved reserves is not necessarily the same as the current market value of our estimated oil, natural gas and NGL reserves. We base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on an unweighted average of the first-day-of-the month price for each month during the 12-month calendar year and year-end costs. However, actual future net cash flows from our oil and natural gas properties also will be affected by factors such as:\n\u2022\nactual prices we receive for oil, natural gas and NGL;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of actual production;\n\u2022\ncapital and operating expenditures;\n\u2022\nthe timing and success of development activities;\n\u2022\nsupply of and demand for oil, natural gas and NGL; and\n\u2022\nchanges in governmental regulations or taxation.\nAlthough proved reserves were estimated in accordance with SEC regulations, using the average price during the 12-month period, determined as an unweighted average of the first-day-of-the-month price for each month, there was a steep decline in commodity prices during the fourth quarter of 2014. From September 30, 2014 to December 31, 2014, NYMEX oil and natural gas prices decreased approximately 42% and 30%, respectively, to $53.27 per Bbl for oil and $2.89 per MMBtu for natural gas at December 31, 2014.\nIn addition, the 10% discount factor required to be used under the provisions of applicable accounting standards when calculating discounted future net cash flows, may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and natural gas industry in general.\nOur development operations require substantial capital expenditures, which will reduce our cash available for distribution. We may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms, which could lead to a decline in our reserves.\nThe oil and natural gas industry is capital intensive. We make and expect to continue to make substantial capital expenditures in our business for the development and production of oil, natural gas and NGL reserves. These expenditures will reduce our cash available for distribution. We intend to finance our future capital expenditures with net cash provided by operating activities and to the extent necessary, with equity and debt offerings or bank borrowings. Our net cash provided by operating activities and access to capital are subject to a number of variables, including:\n\u2022\nour proved reserves;\n\u2022\nthe level of oil, natural gas and NGL we are able to produce from existing wells;\n\u2022\nthe prices at which we are able to sell our oil, natural gas and NGL;\n\u2022\nthe level of operating expenses; and\n\u2022\nour ability to acquire, locate and produce new reserves.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors - Continued\nIf our revenues or the borrowing bases under our Credit Facilities decrease as a result of lower oil, natural gas and NGL prices, operating difficulties, declines in reserves or for any other reason, we may have limited ability to obtain the capital necessary to sustain our operations at current levels. Our Credit Facilities restrict our ability to obtain new financing. If additional capital is needed, we may not be able to obtain debt or equity financing on terms favorable to us, or at all. If net cash provided by operating activities or cash available under our Credit Facilities is not sufficient to meet our capital requirements, the failure to obtain additional financing could result in a curtailment of our development operations, which in turn could lead to a possible decline in our reserves.\nWe may decide not to drill some of the prospects we have identified, and locations that we decide to drill may not yield oil, natural gas and NGL in commercially viable quantities.\nOur prospective drilling locations are in various stages of evaluation, ranging from a prospect that is ready to drill to a prospect that will require additional geological and engineering analysis. Based on a variety of factors, including future oil, natural gas and NGL prices, the generation of additional seismic or geological information, the current and future availability of drilling rigs and other factors, we may decide not to drill one or more of these prospects. As a result, we may not be able to increase or sustain our reserves or production, which in turn could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and our ability to pay distributions. In addition, the SEC\u2019s reserve reporting rules include a general requirement that, subject to limited exceptions, proved undeveloped reserves may only be booked if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years of the date of booking. At December 31, 2014, we had 2,778 proved undeveloped drilling locations. To the extent that we do not drill these locations within five years of initial booking, they may not continue to qualify for classification as proved reserves, and we may be required to reclassify such reserves as unproved reserves. The reclassification of such reserves could also have a negative effect on the borrowing bases under our Credit Facilities.\nThe cost of drilling, completing and operating a well is often uncertain, and cost factors can adversely affect the economics of a well. Our efforts will be uneconomic if we drill dry holes or wells that are productive but do not produce enough oil, natural gas and NGL to be commercially viable after drilling, operating and other costs. In the future, if we drill wells that we identify as dry holes, our drilling success rate would decline, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business depends on gathering and transportation facilities. Any limitation in the availability of those facilities would interfere with our ability to market the oil, natural gas and NGL we produce, and could reduce our cash available for distribution and adversely impact expected increases in oil, natural gas and NGL production from our drilling program.\nThe marketability of our oil, natural gas and NGL production depends in part on the availability, proximity and capacity of gathering and pipeline systems. The amount of oil, natural gas and NGL that can be produced and sold is subject to limitation in certain circumstances, such as pipeline interruptions due to scheduled and unscheduled maintenance, excessive pressure, physical damage to the gathering or transportation system, or lack of contracted capacity on such systems. The curtailments arising from these and similar circumstances may last from a few days to several months. In many cases, we are provided only with limited, if any, notice as to when these circumstances will arise and their duration. In addition, some of our wells are drilled in locations that are not serviced by gathering and transportation pipelines, or the gathering and transportation pipelines in the area may not have sufficient capacity to transport additional production. As a result, we may not be able to sell the oil, natural gas and NGL production from these wells until the necessary gathering and transportation systems are constructed. Any significant curtailment in gathering system or pipeline capacity, or significant delay in the construction of necessary gathering and transportation facilities, would interfere with our ability to market the oil, natural gas and NGL we produce, and could reduce or eliminate our cash available for distribution and adversely impact expected increases in oil, natural gas and NGL production from our drilling program.\nWe depend on certain key customers for sales of our oil, natural gas and NGL. To the extent these and other customers reduce the volumes they purchase from us or delay payment, our revenues and cash available for distribution could decline. Further, a general increase in nonpayment could have an adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, sales of oil, natural gas and NGL to Enbridge Energy Partners, L.P. accounted for approximately 13% of our total production volumes. For the year ended December 31, 2013, sales of oil, natural gas and\nItem 1A. Risk Factors - Continued\nNGL to Enbridge Energy Partners, L.P. accounted for approximately 20% of our total production volumes. To the extent this and other customers reduce the volumes of oil, natural gas or NGL that they purchase from us, our revenues and cash available for distribution could decline.\nWe may experience difficulties in integrating assets we acquire from third parties, which could cause us to fail to realize many of the anticipated potential benefits of those acquisitions.\nAs part of our previously announced plan to divest certain of our higher decline, capital intensive properties for more mature, long-life oil and natural gas properties with lower decline rates, we acquired oil and natural gas properties throughout our various operating regions. Achieving the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions will depend in part on whether we are able to integrate these assets in an efficient and effective manner. We may not be able to accomplish this integration process smoothly or successfully. The difficulties of integrating these assets with our business potentially will include, among other things, the necessity of coordinating geographically separated assets and addressing possible differences incorporating cultures and management philosophies of employees associated with these assets, and the integration of certain operations, data systems and processes, which may require the dedication of significant management resources and which may temporarily distract management\u2019s attention from our day-to-day business.\nAn inability to realize the full extent of the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions, as well as any delays encountered in the transition process, could have an adverse effect on our revenues, level of expenses and operating results, which may affect our cash available for distribution.\nWe may be unable to retain key employees.\nOur future success will depend in part on our ability to retain key employees. During 2014, we acquired several new properties and hired employees associated with those properties. Additionally, in the fourth quarter of 2014, commodity prices decreased significantly. Key employees may depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or during times of commodity price volatility. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that we will be able to retain key employees to the same extent as in the past.\nMany of our leases are in areas that have been partially depleted or drained by offset wells.\nOur key project areas are located in some of the most active drilling areas of the producing basins in the U.S. As a result, many of our leases are in areas that have already been partially depleted or drained by earlier offset drilling. This may inhibit our ability to find economically recoverable quantities of reserves in these areas.\nOur identified drilling location inventories are scheduled out over several years, making them susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling, resulting in temporarily lower net cash provided by operating activities, which may impact our ability to pay distributions.\nOur management has specifically identified and scheduled drilling locations as an estimation of our future multi-year drilling activities on our existing acreage. As of December 31, 2014, we had identified 10,885 drilling locations, of which 2,778 were proved undeveloped locations and 8,107 were other locations. These identified drilling locations represent a significant part of our growth strategy. Our ability to drill and develop these locations depends on a number of factors, including the availability of capital, seasonal conditions, regulatory approvals, oil, natural gas and NGL prices, costs and drilling results. In addition, DeGolyer and MacNaughton has not estimated proved reserves for the 8,107 other drilling locations we have identified and scheduled for drilling, and therefore there may be greater uncertainty with respect to the success of drilling wells at these drilling locations. Our final determination on whether to drill any of these drilling locations will be dependent upon the factors described above as well as, to some degree, the results of our drilling activities with respect to our proved drilling locations. Because of these uncertainties, we do not know if the numerous drilling locations we have identified will be drilled within our expected timeframe or will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce oil, natural gas and NGL from these or any other potential drilling locations. As such, our actual drilling activities may materially differ from those presently identified, which could adversely affect our business.\nDrilling for and producing oil, natural gas and NGL are high risk activities with many uncertainties that could adversely affect our financial position or results of operations and, as a result, our ability to pay distributions to our unitholders.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors - Continued\nOur drilling activities are subject to many risks, including the risk that we will not discover commercially productive reservoirs. Drilling for oil, natural gas and NGL can be uneconomic, not only from dry holes, but also from productive wells that do not produce sufficient revenues to be commercially viable. In addition, our drilling and producing operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of other factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe high cost, shortages or delivery delays of equipment and services;\n\u2022\nunexpected operational events;\n\u2022\nadverse weather conditions;\n\u2022\nfacility or equipment malfunctions;\n\u2022\ntitle problems;\n\u2022\npipeline ruptures or spills;\n\u2022\ncompliance with environmental and other governmental requirements;\n\u2022\nunusual or unexpected geological formations;\n\u2022\nloss of drilling fluid circulation;\n\u2022\nformations with abnormal pressures;\n\u2022\nfires;\n\u2022\nblowouts, craterings and explosions; and\n\u2022\nuncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas and NGL or well fluids.\nAny of these events can cause increased costs or restrict our ability to drill the wells and conduct the operations which we currently have planned. Any delay in the drilling program or significant increase in costs could impact our ability to generate sufficient net cash provided by operating activities to pay distributions to our unitholders at the current distribution level or at all. Increased costs could include losses from personal injury or loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment, pollution, environmental contamination, loss of wells and regulatory penalties. We ordinarily maintain insurance against certain losses and liabilities arising from our operations. However, it is impossible to insure against all operational risks in the course of our business. Additionally, we may elect not to obtain insurance if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the perceived risks presented. Losses could therefore occur for uninsurable or uninsured risks or in amounts in excess of existing insurance coverage. The occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business activities, financial position and results of operations.\nWe have limited control over the activities on properties we do not operate.\nOther companies operate some of the properties in which we have an interest. As of December 31, 2014, nonoperated wells represented approximately 29% of our owned gross wells, or approximately 10% of our owned net wells. We have limited ability to influence or control the operation or future development of these nonoperated properties, including timing of drilling and other scheduled operations activities, compliance with environmental, safety and other regulations, or the amount of capital expenditures that we are required to fund with respect to them. The failure of an operator of our wells to adequately perform operations, an operator\u2019s breach of the applicable agreements or an operator\u2019s failure to act in ways that are in our best interest could reduce our production and revenues. Our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects and our limited ability to influence or control the operation and future development of these properties could materially adversely affect the realization of our targeted returns on capital in drilling or acquisition activities and lead to unexpected future costs.\nBecause we handle oil, natural gas and NGL and other hydrocarbons, we may incur significant costs and liabilities in the future resulting from a failure to comply with new or existing environmental regulations or an accidental release of hazardous substances into the environment.\nThe operations of our wells, gathering systems, turbines, pipelines and other facilities are subject to stringent and complex federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including the assessment of monetary penalties, the imposition of remedial requirements, and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations. There is an inherent risk that we may incur environmental costs and liabilities due to the nature of our business and the substances we handle. Certain environmental statutes, including the RCRA, CERCLA and analogous state laws and regulations, impose strict, joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore sites where hazardous substances have been disposed of or\nItem 1A. Risk Factors - Continued\notherwise released. In addition, an accidental release from one of our wells or gathering pipelines could subject us to substantial liabilities arising from environmental cleanup and restoration costs, claims made by neighboring landowners and other third parties for personal injury and property damage and fines or penalties for related violations of environmental laws or regulations.\nMoreover, the possibility exists that stricter laws, regulations or enforcement policies could significantly increase our compliance costs and the cost of any remediation that may become necessary, and these costs may not be recoverable from insurance. For a more detailed discussion of environmental and regulatory matters impacting our business, see Item 1. \u201cBusiness - Environmental Matters and Regulation.\u201d\nWe are subject to complex federal, state, local and other laws and regulations that could adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of doing business.\nOur operations are regulated extensively at the federal, state and local levels. Environmental and other governmental laws and regulations have resulted in delays and increased the costs to plan, design, drill, install, operate and abandon oil and natural gas wells. Under these laws and regulations, we could also be liable for personal injuries, property damage and other damages. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative, civil and criminal penalties. Moreover, public interest in environmental protection has increased in recent years, and environmental organizations have opposed, with some success, certain drilling projects.\nPart of the regulatory environment in which we operate includes, in some cases, legal requirements for obtaining environmental assessments, environmental impact studies and/or plans of development before commencing drilling and production activities. In addition, our activities are subject to the regulations regarding conservation practices and protection of correlative rights. These regulations affect our operations and limit the quantity of oil, natural gas and NGL we may produce and sell. A major risk inherent in our drilling plans is the need to obtain drilling permits from state and local authorities. Delays in obtaining regulatory approvals or drilling permits, the failure to obtain a drilling permit for a well or the receipt of a permit with unreasonable conditions or costs could have a material adverse effect on our ability to develop our properties. Additionally, the regulatory environment could change in ways that might substantially increase the financial and managerial costs of compliance with these laws and regulations and, consequently, adversely affect our ability to pay distributions to our unitholders. For a description of the laws and regulations that affect us, see Item 1. \u201cBusiness - Environmental Matters and Regulation.\u201d\nFederal and state legislation and regulatory initiatives related to hydraulic fracturing could result in increased costs and operating restrictions or delays.\nHydraulic fracturing is an important and common practice that is used to stimulate production of hydrocarbons from tight formations. The process involves the injection of water, sand and chemicals under pressure into formations to fracture the surrounding rock and stimulate production. Hydraulic fracturing operations have historically been overseen by state regulators as part of their oil and natural gas regulatory programs. However, on May 9, 2014, the Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) announced an advance notice of proposed rulemaking under the Toxic Substances Control Act, relating to chemical substances and mixtures used in oil and natural gas exploration or production. Further, on May 16, 2013, the Department of the Interior\u2019s Bureau of Land Management (\u201cBLM\u201d) issued a proposed rule that, if adopted, would require public disclosure to the BLM of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing operations after fracturing operations have been completed and would strengthen standards for well-bore integrity and management of fluids that return to the surface during and after fracturing operations on federal and Indian lands. In addition, legislation has been introduced before Congress that would provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing and would require disclosure of the chemicals used in the fracturing process. If adopted, these bills could result in additional permitting requirements for hydraulic fracturing operations as well as various restrictions on those operations. These permitting requirements and restrictions could result in delays in operations at well sites and also increased costs to make wells productive.\nThere may be other attempts to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act and/or other regulatory mechanisms. President Obama created the Interagency Working Group on Unconventional Natural Gas and Oil by Executive Order on April 13, 2012, which is charged with coordinating and aligning federal agency research and scientific studies on unconventional natural gas and oil resources. Moreover, some states and local governments have adopted, and other states and local governments are considering adopting, regulations that could\nItem 1A. Risk Factors - Continued\nrestrict hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances. For example, both Texas and Louisiana have adopted disclosure regulations requiring varying degrees of disclosure of the constituents in hydraulic fracturing fluids. In addition, the entire state of New York and certain communities in Colorado and Texas have enacted bans or moratoria on hydraulic fracturing, to which legal challenges are pending. If new laws or regulations that significantly restrict hydraulic fracturing are adopted, such laws could make it more difficult or costly for us to perform fracturing to stimulate production from tight formations. In addition, any such added regulation could lead to operational delays, increased operating costs and additional regulatory burdens, and reduced production of oil and natural gas, which could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.\nWe use a significant amount of water in our hydraulic fracturing operations. Our inability to locate sufficient amounts of water, or dispose of or recycle water used in our drilling and production operations, could adversely impact our operations. Moreover, new environmental initiatives and regulations could include restrictions on our ability to conduct certain operations such as hydraulic fracturing or disposal of waste, including, but not limited to, produced water, drilling fluids and other wastes associated with the development or production of natural gas.\nFinally, in some instances, the operation of underground injection wells has been alleged to cause earthquakes as a result of flawed well design or operation. This has resulted in stricter regulatory requirements in some jurisdictions relating to the location and operation of underground injection wells.\nLegislation and regulation of greenhouse gases could adversely affect our business.\nIn December 2009, the EPA determined that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other \u201cgreenhouse gases\u201d (\u201cGHG\u201d) present an endangerment to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to warming of the earth\u2019s atmosphere and other climatic changes. Based on these findings, the EPA has begun adopting and implementing regulations to restrict emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the Clean Air Act (\u201cCAA\u201d). The EPA has adopted two sets of rules regulating GHG emissions under the CAA, one that requires a reduction in emissions of GHGs from motor vehicles and the other that regulates emissions of GHGs from certain large stationary sources under the CAA\u2019s Prevention of Significant Deterioration and Title V permitting programs. The EPA has also adopted rules requiring the monitoring and reporting of GHG emissions from specified sources in the U.S., including, among other things, certain onshore oil and natural gas production facilities, on an annual basis. Legislation has from time to time been introduced in Congress that would establish measures restricting GHG emissions in the U.S. At the state level, almost one half of the states, including California, have begun taking actions to control and/or reduce emissions of GHGs.\nIn October 2006, California adopted the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006 (\u201cAssembly Bill 32\u201d), which established a statewide \u201ccap and trade\u201d program with an enforceable compliance obligation beginning with 2013 GHG emissions. The program is designed to reduce the state's GHG emissions to 1990 levels by 2020. Assembly Bill 32 sets maximum limits or caps on total emissions of GHGs from industrial sectors of which we are a part, as our California operations emit GHGs. The cap will decline annually thereafter through 2020. We are required to remit compliance instruments for each metric ton of GHG that we emit, in the form of allowances (each the equivalent of one ton of carbon dioxide) or qualifying offset credits. The availability of allowances will decline over time in accordance with the declining cap, and the cost to acquire such allowances may increase over time. Under Assembly Bill 32, we will be granted a certain number of California Carbon Allowances (\u201cCCAs\u201d) and we will need to purchase CCAs and/or offset credits to cover the remaining amount of our emissions. Compliance with Assembly Bill 32 could significantly increase our capital, compliance and operating costs and could also reduce demand for the oil and natural gas we produce. We continue to assess the impact of these regulations on our operations, including the cost to acquire allowances and to reduce emissions. Our cost of acquiring compliance instruments in 2014 was in the range of $1.50 to $2.50 per barrel of California production. In the future, the cost to acquire compliance instruments will depend on the market price for such instruments at the time they are purchased, the distribution of cost-free allowances among various industry sectors by the California Air Resources Board and our ability to limit our GHG emissions and implement cost-containment measures. The cap and trade program is currently scheduled to be in effect through 2020, although it may be continued thereafter.\nRecent regulatory changes in California have and may continue to materially and adversely impact our production and operating costs related to our Diatomite assets acquired in the Berry acquisition.\nRecent regulatory changes in California have impacted production from our Diatomite assets acquired in the Berry acquisition. In 2010, Diatomite production decreased significantly due to the inability to drill new wells pending the receipt\nItem 1A. Risk Factors - Continued\nof permits from the California Division of Oil, Gas and Geothermal Resources (\u201cDOGGR\u201d). Berry received a new full-field development approval in late July 2011 from DOGGR, which contained stringent operating requirements. Revisions to the July 2011 project approval letter were received in February 2012. Implementation of these new operating requirements negatively impacted the pace of drilling and steam injection and increased Berry\u2019s operating costs for its Diatomite assets. The requirements continued to affect Berry\u2019s operations through 2014, and we may not be successful in streamlining the review process with DOGGR or in taking additional steps to more efficiently manage our operations to avoid additional delays. In addition, DOGGR may impose additional operational restrictions or requirements. In such case, we may experience additional delays in production and increased operating costs related to our Diatomite assets, which could affect our business, financial position, results of operations and net cash provided by operating activities.\nWe may issue additional units without unitholder approval, which would dilute existing ownership interests.\nWe may issue an unlimited number of limited liability company interests of any type, including units, without the approval of our unitholders.\nThe issuance of additional units or other equity securities may have the following effects:\n\u2022\nan individual unitholder\u2019s proportionate ownership interest in us may decrease;\n\u2022\nthe relative voting strength of each previously outstanding unit may be reduced;\n\u2022\nthe amount of cash available for distribution per unit may decrease; and\n\u2022\nthe market price of the units may decline.\nOur management may have conflicts of interest with the unitholders. Our limited liability company agreement limits the remedies available to our unitholders in the event unitholders have a claim relating to conflicts of interest.\nConflicts of interest may arise between our management on one hand, and the Company and our unitholders on the other hand, related to the divergent interests of our management. Situations in which the interests of our management may differ from interests of our nonaffiliated unitholders include, among others, the following situations:\n\u2022\nour limited liability company agreement gives our Board of Directors broad discretion in establishing cash reserves for the proper conduct of our business, which will affect the amount of cash available for distribution. For example, our management will use its reasonable discretion to establish and maintain cash reserves sufficient to fund our drilling program;\n\u2022\nour management team, subject to oversight from our Board of Directors, determines the timing and extent of our drilling program and related capital expenditures, asset purchases and sales, borrowings, issuances of additional units and reserve adjustments, all of which will affect the amount of cash that we distribute to our unitholders; and\n\u2022\naffiliates of our directors are not prohibited from investing or engaging in other businesses or activities that compete with the Company.\nWe do not have the same flexibility as other types of organizations to accumulate cash and equity to protect against illiquidity in the future.\nUnlike a corporation, our limited liability company agreement requires us to make distributions to our unitholders of all available cash reduced by any amounts of reserves for commitments and contingencies, including capital and operating costs and debt service requirements. The value of our units may decrease in direct correlation with decreases in the amount we distribute per unit. Accordingly, if we experience a liquidity problem in the future, we may have difficulty issuing more equity to recapitalize.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors - Continued\nOur tax treatment depends on our status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, as well as our not being subject to a material amount of entity level taxation by individual states. If the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) were to treat us as a corporation for federal income tax purposes or we were to become subject to entity level taxation for state tax purposes, taxes paid, if any, would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution.\nThe anticipated after-tax economic benefit of an investment in our units depends largely on our being treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. We have not requested, and do not plan to request, a ruling from the IRS on this or any other tax matter that affects us.\nIf we were treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, we would pay federal income tax on our taxable income at the corporate tax rates, currently at a maximum rate of 35%. Distributions would generally be taxed again as corporate distributions, and no income, gain, loss, deduction or credit would flow through to unitholders. Because a tax may be imposed on us as a corporation, our cash available for distribution to our unitholders could be reduced. Therefore, treatment of us as a corporation would result in a material reduction in the anticipated cash flow and after-tax return to our unitholders, likely causing a substantial reduction in the value of our units.\nCurrent law or our business may change so as to cause us to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes or otherwise subject us to entity level taxation. Any modification to current law or interpretations thereof may or may not be applied retroactively and could make it more difficult or impossible to meet the requirements for partnership status, affect or cause us to change our business activities, affect the tax considerations of an investment in us, change the character or treatment of portions of our income and adversely affect an investment in our units.\nIn addition, because of widespread state budget deficits and other reasons, several states are evaluating ways to subject partnerships and limited liability companies to entity level taxation through the imposition of state income, franchise or other forms of taxation. For example, we may be required to pay Texas franchise tax on our total revenue apportioned to Texas at a maximum effective rate of 0.7%. Imposition of a tax on us by any other state would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our unitholders.\nA successful IRS contest of the federal income tax positions we take may adversely affect the market for our units, and the cost of an IRS contest will reduce our cash available for distribution to our unitholders.\nThe IRS may adopt tax positions that differ from the positions we take. It may be necessary to resort to administrative or court proceedings to sustain some or all of the positions we take. A court may not agree with some or all of the positions we take. Any contest with the IRS may materially and adversely impact the market for our units and the price at which they trade.\nUnitholders are required to pay taxes on their share of our taxable income, including their share of ordinary income and capital gain upon dispositions of properties by us, even if they do not receive any cash distributions from us. A unitholder\u2019s share of our taxable income, gain, loss and deduction, or specific items thereof, may be substantially different than the unitholder\u2019s interest in our economic profits.\nOur unitholders are required to pay federal income taxes and, in some cases, state and local income taxes on their share of our taxable income, whether or not they receive any cash distributions from us. Our unitholders may not receive cash distributions from us equal to their share of our taxable income or even equal to the actual tax liability that results from their share of our taxable income.\nFor example, we may sell a portion of our properties and use the proceeds to pay down debt or acquire other properties rather than distributing the proceeds to our unitholders, and some or all of our unitholders may be allocated substantial taxable income with respect to that sale. A unitholder\u2019s share of our taxable income upon a disposition of property by us may be ordinary income or capital gain or some combination thereof. Even where we dispose of properties that are capital assets, what otherwise would be capital gains may be recharacterized as ordinary income in order to \u201crecapture\u201d ordinary deductions that were previously allocated to that unitholder related to the same property.\nA unitholder\u2019s share of our taxable income and gain (or specific items thereof) may be substantially greater than, or our tax losses and deductions (or specific items thereof) may be substantially less than, the unitholder\u2019s interest in our economic\nItem 1A. Risk Factors - Continued\nprofits. This may occur, for example, in the case of a unitholder who purchases units at a time when the value of our units or of one or more of our properties is relatively low or a unitholder who acquires units directly from us in exchange for property whose fair market value exceeds its tax basis at the time of the exchange. Cash distributions from us decrease a unitholder\u2019s tax basis in their units, and the amount, if any, of excess distributions over a unitholder\u2019s tax basis in their units will, in effect, become taxable income to the unitholder, above and beyond the unitholder\u2019s share of our taxable income and gain (or specific items thereof).\nA unitholder\u2019s taxable gain or loss on the disposition of our units could be more or less than expected.\nIf unitholders sell their units, they will recognize a gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized and their tax basis in those units. Prior distributions to our unitholders in excess of the total net taxable income they were allocated for a unit, which decreases their tax basis, will become taxable income to our unitholders if the unit is sold at a price greater than their tax basis in that unit, even if the price received is less than their original cost.\nA substantial portion of the amount realized, whether or not representing gain, may be ordinary income. In addition, if unitholders sell their units, they may incur a tax liability in excess of the amount of cash they receive from the sale. If the IRS successfully contests some positions we take, unitholders could recognize more gain on the sale of units than would be the case under those positions, without the benefit of decreased income in prior years.\nTax-exempt entities and non-U.S. persons face unique tax issues from owning our units that may result in adverse tax consequences to them.\nInvestment in units by tax-exempt entities, such as individual retirement accounts (known as IRAs) and other retirement plans, and non-U.S. persons raises issues unique to them. For example, virtually all of our income allocated to organizations that are exempt from federal income tax, including IRAs and other retirement plans, will be unrelated business taxable income and will be taxable to them. Distributions to non-U.S. persons will be reduced by withholding taxes at the highest applicable effective tax rate, and non-U.S. persons will be required to file U.S. federal tax returns and pay tax on their share of our taxable income.\nWe treat each purchaser of units as having the same economic and tax characteristics without regard to the units purchased. The IRS may challenge this treatment, which could adversely affect the value of the units.\nBecause we cannot match transferors and transferees of units, we must maintain uniformity of the economic and tax characteristics of our units to a purchaser of units. We take depletion, depreciation and amortization and other positions that are intended to maintain such uniformity. These positions may not conform with all aspects of existing Treasury regulations and may affect the amount or timing of income, gain, loss or deduction allocable to a unitholder or the amount of gain from a unitholder\u2019s sale of units. A successful IRS challenge to those positions could also adversely affect the amount or timing of income, gain, loss or deduction allocable to a unitholder, or the amount of gain from a unitholder\u2019s sale of units and could have a negative impact on the value of our units or result in audit adjustments to unitholder tax returns.\nWe prorate our items of income, gain, loss and deduction between transferors and transferees of our units each month (or in some cases for periods shorter than a month) based upon the ownership of our units on the first day of each month (or shorter period), instead of on the basis of the date a particular unit is transferred. The IRS may challenge this treatment, which could change the allocation of items of income, gain, loss and deduction among our unitholders.\nWe prorate our items of income, gain, loss and deduction between transferors and transferees of our units each month (or in some cases for periods shorter than a month) based upon the ownership of our units on the first day of each month (or shorter period), instead of on the basis of the date a particular unit is transferred. The use of this proration method may not be permitted under existing Treasury regulations. If the IRS were to challenge this method or new Treasury regulations were issued, we may be required to change the allocation of items of income, gain, loss and deduction among our unitholders.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors - Continued\nThe sale or exchange of 50% or more of our capital and profits interests within a 12-month period will result in the deemed termination of our tax partnership for federal income tax purposes.\nWe will be considered to have terminated for federal income tax purposes if there is a sale or exchange of 50% or more of the total interests in our capital and profits within a 12-month period. Our termination would, among other things, result in the closing of our taxable year for all unitholders and could result in a deferral of depreciation deductions allowable in computing our taxable income. If this occurs, our unitholders will be allocated an increased amount of federal taxable income for the year in which we are considered to be terminated as a percentage of the cash distributed to the unitholders with respect to that period.\nA unitholder whose units are loaned to a \u201cshort seller\u201d to cover a short sale of units may be considered as having disposed of those units. If so, the unitholder would no longer be treated for tax purposes as a partner with respect to those units during the period of the loan and may recognize gain or loss from the disposition.\nBecause a unitholder whose units are loaned to a \u201cshort seller\u201d to cover a short sale of units may be considered as having disposed of the loaned units, the unitholder may no longer be treated for tax purposes as a partner with respect to those units during the period of the loan to the short seller and the unitholder may recognize gain or loss from such disposition. Moreover, during the period of the loan to the short seller, any of our income, gain, loss, or deduction with respect to those units may not be reportable by the unitholder and any cash distributions received by the unitholder as to those units could be fully taxable as ordinary income. Unitholders desiring to assure their status as partners and avoid the risk of gain recognition from a loan to a short seller are urged to modify any applicable brokerage account agreements to prohibit their brokers from borrowing their units.\nUnitholders may be subject to state and local taxes and return filing requirements in states and jurisdictions where they do not live as a result of investing in our units.\nIn addition to federal income taxes, our unitholders will likely be subject to other taxes, including state and local taxes, unincorporated business taxes and estate, inheritance or intangible taxes that are imposed by the various jurisdictions in which we do business or own property now or in the future, even if they do not reside in any of those jurisdictions. Our unitholders will likely be required to file foreign, state and local income tax returns and pay state and local income taxes in some or all of these jurisdictions. Further, our unitholders may be subject to penalties for failure to comply with those requirements. In 2014, we have been registered to do business or have owned assets in Arkansas, California, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Texas, Utah and Wyoming. As we make acquisitions or expand our business, we may do business or own assets in other states in the future. It is the responsibility of each unitholder to file all U.S. federal, state and local tax returns that may be required of such unitholder.\nChanges to current federal tax laws may affect unitholders\u2019 ability to take certain tax deductions.\nSubstantive changes to the existing federal income tax laws have been proposed that, if adopted, would affect, among other things, the ability to take certain operations-related deductions, including deductions for intangible drilling and deductions for U.S. production activities. Other proposed changes may affect our ability to remain taxable as a partnership for federal income tax purposes or tax publicly traded partnerships with qualifying income from fossil fuels activities as a corporation. We are unable to predict whether any changes, or other proposals to such laws, ultimately will be enacted. Any such changes could negatively impact the value of an investment in our units.\nYour units are subject to limited call rights that could result in your having to involuntarily sell your units at a time or price that may be undesirable. Unitholders who are not \u201cEligible Holders\u201d will be subject to redemption of their units.\nIf at any time a person owns more than 90% of our outstanding units, such person may elect to purchase all, but not less than all, of our remaining outstanding units at a price equal to the higher of the current market price (as defined in our limited liability company agreement) and the highest price paid by such person or any of its affiliates for any of our units purchased during the 90-day period preceding the date notice was mailed to the our unitholders informing them of such election. In this case, you will be required to tender all of your outstanding units and you may receive a payment that is effectively less than the price at which you would prefer to sell your units.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors - Continued\nIn order to comply with U.S. laws with respect to the ownership of interests in oil and natural gas leases on federal lands, we have adopted certain requirements regarding those investors who may own our units. As used herein, an Eligible Holder means a person or entity qualified to hold an interest in oil and natural gas leases on federal lands. As of the date hereof, Eligible Holder means: (1) a citizen of the U.S.; (2) a corporation organized under the laws of the U.S. or of any state thereof; or (3) an association of U.S. citizens, such as a partnership or limited liability company, organized under the laws of the U.S. or of any state thereof, but only if such association does not have any direct or indirect foreign ownership, other than foreign ownership of stock in a parent corporation organized under the laws of the U.S. or of any state thereof. For the avoidance of doubt, onshore mineral leases or any direct or indirect interest therein may be acquired and held by aliens only through stock ownership, holding or control in a corporation organized under the laws of the U.S. or of any state thereof and only for so long as the alien is not from a country that the U.S. federal government regards as denying similar privileges to citizens or corporations of the U.S. Unitholders who are not persons or entities who meet the requirements to be an Eligible Holder will not be entitled to receive distributions in kind on their units in a liquidation and they run the risk of having their units redeemed by us at the then-current market price.", "PERMNO": 18246, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "ROAN"}
