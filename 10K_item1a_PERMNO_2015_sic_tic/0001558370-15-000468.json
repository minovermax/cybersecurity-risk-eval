RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the following risk factors and all other information contained in this annual report in evaluating our business and prospects. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties, other than those we describe below, that are not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks occur, our business and financial results could be harmed. You should also refer to the other information contained in this annual report, including the Forward-Looking Statements section in Item 1, our consolidated financial statements and the related notes, and Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a further discussion of the risks, uncertainties and assumptions relating to our business. Except where the context otherwise indicates, references in this section to \u201cwe,\u201d \u201cour,\u201d \u201cours,\u201d and \u201cus\u201d includes our subsidiaries and our interest in Caliber.\nThe risks described below relating to oil and natural gas exploration, exploitation and development activities affect TUSA directly but also affect RockPile and Caliber because the materialization of those risks, whether experienced by TUSA or other customers or potential customers of RockPile or Caliber, may adversely affect demand for the products and services provided by RockPile and Caliber.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nOil and natural gas prices are volatile and change for reasons that are beyond our control. Decreases in the price we receive for our production adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nDeclines in the prices we receive for our production adversely affect many aspects of our business, including our financial condition, revenues, results of operations, liquidity, rate of growth, and the carrying value of our properties, all of which depend primarily or in part upon those prices. Declines in the prices we receive for our production also adversely affect our ability to finance capital expenditures, make acquisitions, raise capital, and satisfy our financial obligations. In addition, declines in prices reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically and the expected cash flows from that production and, as a result, adversely affect the quantity and present value of proved reserves. Among other things, a reduction in our reserves can limit the capital available to us, as the maximum amount of available borrowing under TUSA\u2019s credit facility is, and the availability of other sources of capital likely will be, based to a significant degree on the estimated quantity and present value of those reserves. Declines in prices may also reduce the demand for services provided by RockPile and Caliber. The price of oil fell dramatically in the second half of fiscal year 2015, from a high of $107.26 per barrel in June 2014 to a low of $44.45 per barrel in January 2015, in each case based on WTI prices. This decline adversely affected TUSA\u2019s revenue and profitability, and also led to a significant reduction in drilling activity in North Dakota, which adversely affected the revenue and profitability of both RockPile and Caliber. Lower commodity prices have persisted in calendar year 2015.\nOil and natural gas are commodities and their prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand. Prices have historically been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile in the future. The prices of oil and natural gas are affected by a variety of factors that are beyond our control, including changes in the global supply and demand for oil and natural gas, domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxes, the level of global oil and natural gas exploration activity and inventories, the price, availability and consumer acceptance of alternative fuel sources, the availability of refining capacity, technological advances affecting energy consumption, weather conditions, speculative activity, civil or political unrest in oil and natural gas producing regions, financial and commercial market uncertainty, and worldwide economic conditions. The significant decline in the price of oil that occurred in calendar year 2014 was due to a number of causes outside of our control, including increased overall U.S. production, concerns regarding worldwide economic conditions and a decision by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries not to curtail supply in order to rebalance global crude oil fundamentals.\nIn addition to factors affecting the price of oil and natural gas generally, the prices we receive for our production are affected by factors specific to us and to the local markets where the production occurs. Pricing can be influenced by, among other things, local or regional supply and demand factors (such as refinery or pipeline capacity issues, trade restrictions and governmental regulations) and the terms of our sales contracts. The prices we receive for our production are often at a discount to the relevant benchmark prices on NYMEX. A negative difference between the benchmark price and the price received is called a differential. The differential may vary significantly due to market conditions, the quality and location of production, and other factors. Due to increasing production from the Williston Basin in recent years and\nlimits to the available takeaway capacity and related infrastructure, the differential applicable to oil produced there has been significant. We cannot accurately predict future differentials, and increases in differentials could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In addition, the difficulty involved in predicting the differential also makes it more difficult for us to effectively hedge our production.\nOur planned operations will require additional capital that may not be available.\nOur business is capital intensive and requires substantial expenditures to maintain currently producing wells, to make the acquisitions and conduct the exploration, exploitation and development activities necessary to replace our reserves, and to pay expenses and to satisfy our other obligations. In recent years, we have chosen to pursue projects that required capital expenditures substantially in excess of cash flows from operations. That fact has made us dependent on external financing. In addition, our existing asset base is small compared to many of our public company competitors, which may make financing more difficult. We anticipate that we will continue to make substantial capital expenditures for the acquisition, exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas reserves in the future and for future drilling programs. We cannot assure you that our cash flows from operations and other available sources of financing will be adequate for us to implement our capital plans and to satisfy our debt-related and other obligations. Debt or equity financing may not be available in a timely manner, on terms acceptable to us or at all. Moreover, future activities may require us to alter our capitalization significantly. Recent declines in commodity prices will likely make it more difficult for us to raise capital on acceptable terms. Our inability to access sufficient capital for our operations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nTUSA\u2019s lenders can limit its borrowing capabilities under its credit facility, which may materially impact our operations.\nAt January 31, 2015, TUSA had $119.3 million outstanding under its credit facility, with a borrowing base of $435.0 million. The borrowing base under TUSA\u2019s credit facility is redetermined semi-annually based upon a number of factors, including proved reserves growth. In addition, each of TUSA and the lenders may request an unscheduled borrowing base redetermination twice during each calendar year. Upon a redetermination, TUSA\u2019s borrowing base could be substantially reduced, and if the new borrowing base is less than the amount of outstanding indebtedness under the credit facility, TUSA will be required to (i) pledge additional collateral, (ii) prepay the principal amount of the loans in an amount sufficient to eliminate the excess, (iii) prepay the excess in five equal monthly installments, or (iv) any combination of options (i) through (iii). TUSA uses cash flows from operations and bank borrowings to fund its exploration, development and acquisition activities. Recent declines in commodity prices significantly increase the risk of adverse changes in the borrowing base. A reduction in TUSA\u2019s borrowing base could materially limit those activities and adversely affect our operations and financial results.\nOur substantial level of indebtedness and debt service costs could limit our financial and operating activities, and adversely affect our ability to incur additional debt to fund future needs.\nWe have outstanding indebtedness under TUSA\u2019s 6.75% Senior Notes, TUSA\u2019s and RockPile\u2019s credit facilities, and our Convertible Note. A significant portion of our cash flows will be required to pay interest and principal on our indebtedness, and we may not generate sufficient cash flows from operations, or have future borrowing capacity available, to enable us to repay our indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs. Our ability to pay interest and principal on our indebtedness and to satisfy our other obligations will depend upon our future operating performance and financial condition and the availability of refinancing indebtedness, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations, or that future borrowings will be available to us under our credit facilities or otherwise, in an amount sufficient to fund our liquidity needs.\nA substantial decrease in our operating cash flows or an increase in our expenses could make it difficult for us to meet our debt service requirements and could require us to modify our operations, including by curtailing our exploration and drilling programs, selling assets, refinancing all or a portion of our existing debt, or obtaining additional financing. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. In the absence of adequate cash from operations and other available capital resources, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be\nrequired to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. We may not be able to consummate these dispositions for fair market value, in a timely manner or at all. Furthermore, any proceeds that we could realize from any dispositions may not be adequate to meet our debt service or other obligations then due.\nThe terms of certain of our debt agreements require us to comply with specified financial covenants and ratios. Our ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants in the future is uncertain and will be affected by the levels of cash flows from operations and events or circumstances beyond our control. Our failure to comply with any of the restrictions and covenants under the agreements could result in a default under those agreements, which could cause all of our existing indebtedness to be immediately due and payable.\nIn addition to making it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt service obligations, our substantial indebtedness could limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness if needed for other purposes, including working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and general corporate or other purposes, on satisfactory terms or at all. As a result, our indebtedness, and the terms of agreements governing that indebtedness, could increase our vulnerability to economic downturns and impair our ability to withstand sustained declines in commodity prices and limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate.\nOur estimated reserves are based on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or the relevant underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantity and present value of our reserves.\nThe reserve data included in this report represent estimates only. Estimating quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves is a complex process that requires interpretations of available technical data and various estimates, including estimates based upon assumptions relating to economic factors, such as future commodity prices, production costs, severance and excise taxes, availability of capital, estimates of required capital expenditures, workover and remedial costs, and the assumed effect of governmental regulation. The assumptions underlying our estimates of our proved reserves could prove to be inaccurate, and any significant inaccuracy could materially affect, among other things, future estimates of our reserves, the economically recoverable quantities of oil and natural gas attributable to our properties, the classifications of reserves based on risk of recovery, and estimates of our future net cash flows.\nAt January 31, 2015, approximately 39% of our estimated net remaining proved reserves (Mboe) were proved undeveloped, or PUDs. Estimation of PUD reserves is almost always based on analogy to existing wells as contrasted with the performance data used to estimate producing reserves. Recovery of PUD reserves requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations.\nAdditionally, SEC rules require that, subject to limited exceptions, PUD reserves may be recorded only if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years after the date of booking. This rule has limited and may continue to limit our potential to record additional PUD reserves as we pursue our drilling program. Moreover, we may be required to write-down our PUDs if we do not drill those wells within the required five-year time frame. Our PUD reserve estimates as of January 31, 2015 reflected our plans to make significant capital expenditures to convert our PUDs into proved developed reserves, including currently estimated expenditures of approximately $439.7 million during the five years ending on January 31, 2020. You should be aware that this estimate of our development costs may not be accurate, development may not occur as scheduled, and results may not be as estimated. If we choose not to develop PUDs, or if we are not otherwise able to successfully develop them, we will be required to remove the associated volumes from our reported proved reserves.\nYou should not assume that the present values referred to in this report represent the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves. The timing and success of development activities and related expenses, each of which is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, will affect the timing and amount of actual future net cash flows from our proved reserves and their present value. In addition, our PV-10 and Standardized Measure estimates are based on assumed future prices and costs. Actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the assumed prices and costs. Further, the effect of derivative instruments is not reflected in these assumed prices. Also, the use of a 10% discount factor to calculate PV-10 and Standardized Measure may not necessarily represent the most appropriate discount factor given actual interest rates and risks to which our business, and the oil and natural gas industry in general, are subject.\nOur investments in oil and natural gas properties may result in impairments.\nWe follow the full cost method of accounting for oil and natural gas properties. Accordingly, all costs associated with the acquisition, exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties, including costs of undeveloped leasehold, geological and geophysical expenses, dry holes, leasehold equipment and other costs directly related to acquisition, exploration and development activities, are capitalized. Capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties also include estimated asset retirement costs recorded based on the fair value of the asset retirement obligation when incurred. The capitalized costs plus future development and dismantlement costs are depleted and charged to operations using the equivalent unit-of-production method based on proved oil and natural gas reserves as determined annually by an experienced petroleum engineer on our staff and audited by an independent petroleum engineering firm, and determined in interim quarterly periods by an experienced petroleum engineer on our staff. To the extent that such capitalized costs, net of their accumulated depreciation and amortization, exceed the sum of (i) the present value (discounting at 10% per annum) of estimated future net revenues from proved oil and natural gas reserves and (ii) the capitalized costs of unevaluated properties (both adjusted for income tax effects), such excess costs are charged to operations, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We recognized such impairment expense in fiscal year 2012. Once incurred, such a write-down of oil and natural gas properties is not reversible at a later date, even if oil or natural gas prices substantially increase or if estimated proved reserves substantially increase. Although we had no impairments in fiscal years 2013, 2014 or 2015, there can be no assurance that that we will not recognize impairment expense in future periods.\nMuch of our net leasehold acreage is undeveloped, and that acreage may not ultimately be developed or become commercially productive, which could have a material adverse effect on our future oil and natural gas reserves and production and, therefore, our future cash flows and income.\nMuch of our net leasehold acreage is undeveloped acreage on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of oil and natural gas. In addition, many of our oil and natural gas leases require us to drill wells that are commercially productive within specified periods of time, and if we are unsuccessful in drilling such wells, we could lose our rights under such leases. We intend to develop our leasehold acreage by implementing our exploration and development plan, but the funds needed to do so may not be available and our exploration and development activities may be unsuccessful. Our future oil and natural gas reserves and production, and therefore our future cash flows and income, are highly dependent on our success in developing our undeveloped leasehold acreage.\nOil and natural gas exploration, exploitation and development activities may not be successful and could result in a complete loss of a significant investment.\nExploration, exploitation and development activities are subject to many risks. For example, new wells we drill may not be productive and we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in such wells. The seismic data and other technologies we use do not allow us to know conclusively prior to drilling a well that oil or natural gas is present or that it can be produced economically. In addition, a productive well may become commercially unproductive in the event that water or other deleterious substances are encountered which impair or prevent the commercial production of oil and natural gas from the well. Similarly, decline rates from a productive well may exceed our estimates and may cause the well to become uneconomic. We engage in exploratory drilling, which increases these risks. Drilling for oil and natural gas often involves unprofitable efforts as a result of dry holes or wells that are productive but do not produce sufficient oil or natural gas to return a profit at then-realized prices after deducting drilling, operating and other costs. Moreover, even profitable development activity may be less successful than we, investors or analysts expect, potentially resulting in a decline in the market value of our securities. Cost-related risks are exacerbated in the Williston Basin because the drilling and completion of a well there generally costs significantly more than a typical onshore conventional well. The currently prevailing lower commodity price environment may reduce certain of these costs. However, TUSA may not be able to achieve the cost savings it anticipates. Moreover, RockPile, as a provider of completion services, will have its revenue and profitability reduced by cost reductions demanded by its customers. In addition, our exploration, exploitation and development activities may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of numerous factors, including:\n\u00b7\ntitle problems;\n\u00b7\nproblems in delivery of our oil and natural gas to market;\n\u00b7\npressure or irregularities in geological formations;\n\u00b7\nequipment failures or accidents;\n\u00b7\nadverse weather conditions;\n\u00b7\nreductions in oil and natural gas prices;\n\u00b7\ncompliance with environmental and other governmental requirements, including with respect to permitting issues; and\n\u00b7\ncosts of, or shortages or delays in the availability of, drilling rigs, equipment, qualified personnel and services.\nWe expect that nearly all of the wells we drill in fiscal year 2016 will be drilled horizontally and will be hydraulically fractured. When drilling horizontal wells, the risks we face include, but are not limited to, failing to place our wellbore in the desired target producing zone, not staying in the desired drilling zone while drilling horizontally through the formation, failing to run casing the entire length of the wellbore and not being able to run tools and other equipment consistently through the horizontal wellbore. Risks we face while completing such wells include, but are not limited to, not being able to fracture stimulate the planned number of stages, failing to run tools the entire length of the wellbore during completion operations, and not successfully cleaning out the wellbore after completion of the final fracture stimulation stage. Because of the cost typically associated with this type of well, unsuccessful exploration or development activity affecting even a small number of these wells could have a significant impact on our results of operations.\nWe may not realize the benefits of integrating acquired properties.\nThe integration into our operations of previously acquired oil and natural gas properties, as well as any future acquired properties, is a significant undertaking and requires significant resources, as well as attention from our management team. We could encounter difficulties in the integration process, such as the need to revisit assumptions about reserves, future production, revenues, capital expenditures and operating costs, including synergies, the loss of commercial relationships or the need to address unanticipated liabilities. If we cannot successfully integrate acquired properties into our business, we may fail to realize the expected benefits of those acquisitions.\nAcquisitions may prove to be unprofitable because of uncertainties in evaluating recoverable reserves and potential liabilities.\nOur recent growth is due in large part to acquisitions of undeveloped leasehold interests and the drilling and completion of productive wells. We expect acquisitions will also contribute to our future growth. Successful acquisitions require an assessment of a number of factors, including estimates of recoverable reserves, exploration potential, future oil and natural gas prices, operating costs, title issues and potential environmental and other liabilities. Such assessments are inexact and their accuracy is inherently uncertain. In addition, many of these factors are subject to change and are beyond our control. In particular, the prices of and markets for oil and natural gas products may change from those anticipated at the time such assessments are made. In connection with our assessment of a potential acquisition, we perform a review of the acquired properties that we believe is generally consistent with industry practices. However, such a review will not reveal all existing or potential problems, and generally will not involve a review of seismic data or independent environmental testing. In addition, our review may not permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their capabilities and deficiencies, including any structural, subsurface and environmental problems that may exist or arise. As a result, we may assume unknown liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to successfully acquire additional leasehold interests or other oil and natural gas properties, which may inhibit our ability to grow our production.\nAcquisitions of leasehold interests or other oil and natural gas properties have been an important element of our business, and we will continue to pursue acquisitions in the future. In recent years, we have pursued and consummated leasehold or other property acquisitions that have provided us opportunities to expand our acreage position and grow our production. Although we regularly engage in discussions and submit proposals regarding leasehold interests or other oil and natural gas properties, suitable acquisitions may not be available in the future on reasonable terms, or we may not possess sufficient capital to consummate attractive acquisitions.\nUnless reserves are replaced as they are produced, our reserves and production will decline, which would adversely affect our future business, financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able to develop our identified drilling locations as planned.\nProducing crude oil and natural gas reservoirs are generally characterized by declining production rates that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors. The rate of decline may change over time and may exceed our estimates. Our future reserves and production and, therefore, our cash flows and income, are highly dependent on our ability to efficiently develop and exploit our current reserves and to economically find or acquire additional recoverable reserves. We may not be able to develop, discover or acquire additional reserves to replace our current and future production at acceptable costs. Our failure to do so would adversely affect our future operations, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have identified a number of well locations as an estimation of our future multi-year drilling activities on our existing acreage. These well locations represent a significant part of our growth strategy. Our ability to drill and develop these locations depends on a number of uncertainties, including crude oil prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, drilling results, lease expirations, midstream constraints, access to and availability of water sourcing and distribution systems, regulatory approvals, and other factors. Because of these factors, we do not know if the numerous potential well locations we have identified will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce crude oil or natural gas from these or any other potential well locations. In addition, the number of drilling locations available to us will depend in part on the spacing of wells in our operating areas. An increase in well density in an area could result in additional locations in that area, but a reduced production performance from the area on a per-well basis. Further, certain of the horizontal wells we intend to drill in the future may require pooling of our lease interests with the interests of third parties. If these third parties are unwilling to pool their interests with ours, and we are unable to require such pooling on a timely basis or at all, this may limit the total locations we can drill. As such, our actual drilling activities may materially differ from those presently identified. Further, our inventory of drilling projects includes locations in addition to those that we currently classify as proved. The development of and results from these additional projects are more uncertain than those relating to proved locations.\nNo assurance can be given that defects in our title to oil and natural gas interests do not exist.\nIt is often not possible to determine title to an oil and natural gas interest without incurring substantial expense. The title review processes we have conducted with respect to certain interests we have acquired may not have been sufficient to detect all potential defects, and we have not conducted such a process with respect to all our properties. If a title defect does exist, it is possible that we may lose all or a portion of our interest in the properties to which the title defect relates. Our actual interest in certain properties may therefore vary from our records.\nThe results of our planned drilling in the Bakken Shale and Three Forks formations are subject to more uncertainties than drilling programs in more established formations and may not meet our expectations for production.\nPart of our drilling strategy to maximize recoveries from the Bakken Shale and Three Forks formations involves the drilling of horizontal wells using completion techniques that have proven to be successful for other companies in these and other shale formations. Our experience with horizontal drilling in the Bakken Shale and Three Forks formations, like that of the industry in general, is limited. The ultimate success of these drilling and completion strategies and techniques in these formations will be better evaluated over time as more wells are drilled and longer-term production profiles are established. In addition, the decline rates in these formations may be higher than in other areas and in other shale formations, making overall production difficult to estimate until our experience in these formations increases. Accordingly, the results of our future drilling in the Bakken Shale and Three Forks formations are more uncertain than drilling results in some other formations with more established reserves and longer production histories. Further, access to adequate gathering systems or pipeline takeaway capacity and the availability of drilling rigs and other services may be more challenging in resource constrained plays such as the Williston Basin.\nIf our drilling results are less favorable than anticipated or we are unable to execute our drilling program because of capital constraints, lease expirations, lack of access to gathering systems and takeaway capacity or otherwise, or oil and natural gas prices decline further, the return on our investment in these areas may not be as attractive as we anticipate, and we could incur material write-downs of properties and the value of our undeveloped acreage could decline.\nWe rely on independent experts and technical or operational service providers over whom we may have limited control.\nWe use independent contractors to provide us with technical assistance and services. We rely upon the owners and operators of rigs and drilling equipment, and upon providers of oilfield services, to drill and develop certain of our prospects to production. In addition, we rely upon the services of other third parties to explore or analyze our prospects to determine a method in which the prospects may be developed in a cost-effective manner. Our limited control over the activities and business practices of these operators and service providers, any inability on our part to maintain satisfactory commercial relationships with them, or their failure to provide quality services could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur agreements with operators and other joint venture partners, as well as other operational agreements that we may enter into, present a number of challenges that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur agreements with well operators and other joint venture partners, as well as other operational agreements (including agreements with mineral rights owners and suppliers of services, equipment and product transportation), represent a significant portion of our business. In addition, as part of our business strategy, we plan to enter into other similar transactions, some of which may be material. These transactions typically involve a number of risks and present financial, managerial and operational challenges, including the existence of unknown potential disputes, liabilities or contingencies that arise after entering into these arrangements related to the counterparties to such arrangements. We could experience financial or other setbacks if we encounter unanticipated problems in connection with such transactions, including problems related to execution or integration. Any of these risks could reduce our revenues or increase our expenses, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may experience an increase in non-consenting working interest owners in our operated wells.\nOur exploration and development agreements contain customary industry non-consent provisions. Pursuant to these provisions, if we, as operator, propose a well to be drilled and completed and a working interest owner elects not to participate, we assume the non-participating working interest owners\u2019 share of the costs of such well. As a penalty for not participating, the portion of the well\u2019s revenues that would otherwise would go to the non-participant flow to us until we receive from 150% to 300% of the capital that we provided to cover the non-participant's share. We have historically viewed non-consents by other working interest owners in our operated wells favorably as it has the effect of increasing our interest in our operated wells, despite the additional capital outlay. However, in the current depressed commodity pricing environment, we could experience a significant increase in the number of non-consenting working interest owners that either do not have the capital to participate or choose not to participate at current commodity prices. In either case, we would be required to assume their portion of the well\u2019s expenses. The potential for such an increase makes it difficult to accurately predict our fiscal year 2016 capital expenditures and could require us to redirect capital budgeted for other expenditures. Further, redirecting capital to fund the expenses of non-participating working interest owners in our operated wells could cause us to non-consent in wells that we do not operate, and such wells may prove more successful than our operated wells.\nWe cannot control the activities on the properties we do not operate and are unable to ensure their proper operation and profitability.\nOther companies\u2019 operated properties represent a portion of our production. We have limited ability to exercise influence over, or control the risks associated with, operations of our non-operated properties. The failure of an operator of our non-operated wells to adequately perform operations, an operator\u2019s breach of the applicable agreements, or an operator\u2019s failure to act in our best interests could reduce our production and revenues. The success and timing of drilling and development activities on properties operated by others depends upon a number of factors outside of our control, including the operator\u2019s expertise and financial resources, inclusion of other participants in drilling wells, and use of technology. In addition, we could be adversely affected by our lack of control over the timing and amount of capital expenditures related to non-operated properties.\nWe are subject to complex laws and regulations, including environmental laws and regulations that can adversely affect the cost, manner and feasibility of doing business and limit our growth.\nOur operations and facilities are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to exploration for, and the exploitation, development, production and transportation of, oil and natural gas, as well as environmental, safety and other matters. Existing laws or regulations, as currently interpreted or reinterpreted in the future, or future laws or regulations, may harm our business, results of operations and financial condition. Laws and regulations applicable to us include those relating to:\n\u00b7\nland use restrictions;\n\u00b7\ndrilling bonds and other financial responsibility requirements;\n\u00b7\nspacing of wells;\n\u00b7\nemissions into the air;\n\u00b7\nunitization and pooling of properties;\n\u00b7\nhabitat and endangered species protection;\n\u00b7\nenvironmental, reclamation, and remediation obligations;\n\u00b7\nthe management and disposal of hazardous substances, oil field waste and other waste materials;\n\u00b7\nthe use of underground and above-ground storage tanks;\n\u00b7\ntransportation and drilling permits;\n\u00b7\nthe use of underground injection wells;\n\u00b7\nsafety precautions;\n\u00b7\nhydraulic fracturing (including limitations on the use of this technology);\n\u00b7\nthe prevention of oil spills;\n\u00b7\nthe closure of production facilities;\n\u00b7\noperational reporting; and\n\u00b7\ntaxation and royalties.\nUnder these laws and regulations, we could be liable for:\n\u00b7\npersonal injuries;\n\u00b7\nproperty and natural resource damages;\n\u00b7\nreleases or discharges of hazardous materials;\n\u00b7\nwell reclamation costs;\n\u00b7\noil spill clean-up costs;\n\u00b7\nother remediation and clean-up costs;\n\u00b7\nplugging and abandonment costs;\n\u00b7\ngovernmental sanctions, such as fines and penalties; and\n\u00b7\nother environmental damages.\nThese regulations have been changed frequently in the past and, in general, these changes have imposed more stringent requirements that have increased operating costs and required capital expenditures to remain in compliance. For example, in 2013, North Dakota, the primary state in which we conduct operations, amended its regulations to impose more stringent regulation of hydraulic fracturing, the disclosure of chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing and more rigorous regulation of pits. Any noncompliance with these laws and regulations could subject us to material administrative, civil, or criminal penalties or other liabilities, including suspension or termination of operations. Some environmental laws and regulations impose strict liability, under which we could be exposed to liability for clean-up costs and other damages for conduct that was not negligent and was lawful at the time it occurred, or for the conduct of prior owners or operators of properties we have acquired or other third parties, including, in some circumstances, operators of properties in which we have an interest and parties that provide transportation services for us. Similarly, some environmental laws and regulations impose joint and several liability, under which we could be held responsible for more than our proportionate share of liability for site remediation or other obligations, and potentially the entire obligation, even where other parties also have liability. In addition, we may be required to make large and unanticipated capital expenditures to comply with applicable laws and regulations, for example by installing and maintaining pollution control devices. Further, our plugging and abandonment obligations will be substantial and may exceed our estimates. Our operations could also be adversely affected by environmental and other laws and regulations that require us to obtain permits before\ncommencing drilling or other activities. Even when permits are granted in a timely manner, they may be subject to conditions that impose delays on a project, increase its costs or reduce its benefits to us.\nIn addition, any changes in applicable laws, regulations and/or administrative policies or practices may have a negative impact on our ability to operate and on our profitability. The laws, regulations, policies or current administrative practices of any government body, organization or regulatory agency in the United States or any other jurisdiction in which we operate may be changed, applied or interpreted in a manner that could fundamentally alter our ability to carry on our business or otherwise adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nCaliber\u2019s operations may be subject to additional regulatory risks. For example, in the future its pipelines may be subject to siting, public necessity, rate and service regulations by FERC or various state regulatory bodies, depending upon jurisdiction. FERC generally regulates the transportation of natural gas, NGLs and crude oil in interstate commerce. FERC\u2019s actions in any of these areas or modifications of its current regulations could adversely impact Caliber\u2019s ability to compete for business, the costs it incurs in its operations, the construction of new facilities or its ability to recover the full cost of operating its pipelines. Other laws and actions by federal and state regulatory authorities could have similar effects on Caliber\u2019s operations. For example, North Dakota adopted new regulations in December 2013 requiring operators to submit data to the state to track construction and reclamation of pipelines, and to track pipeline locations for surface owners.\nClimate change laws and regulations restricting emissions of greenhouse gases could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the oil and natural gas we produce, while the physical effects of climate change could disrupt our production and cause us to incur significant costs in preparing for, or responding to, those effects.\nClimate change has emerged as an important topic in public policy debate. It is a complex issue, with some scientific research suggesting that rising global temperatures are the result of an increase in GHGs. Products produced by the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry are a source of certain GHGs, namely carbon dioxide and methane, and future restrictions on the combustion of fossil fuels or the venting and release of fugitive emissions of natural gas could have a significant impact on our future operations. The EPA has issued a notice of finding and determination that emissions of carbon dioxide, methane and other GHGs present an endangerment to human health and the environment, which allows the EPA to regulate GHG emissions under existing provisions of the federal Clean Air Act. The EPA has begun to implement GHG-related reporting and permitting rules. Similarly, the U.S. Congress has considered and may in the future consider \u201ccap and trade\u201d legislation that would establish an economy-wide cap on GHG emissions in the United States and would require most sources of GHG emissions to obtain GHG emission \u201callowances\u201d corresponding to their annual emissions of GHGs. Any laws or regulations that may be adopted to restrict or reduce GHG emissions would likely require us to incur increased operating costs and could have an adverse effect on demand for our production. These or future federal, state, regional or international monitoring or regulatory requirements relating to climate change could require us to obtain permits or allowances for our GHG emissions, install new pollution controls, increase our operational costs, limit our operations or adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas we produce. See Item 1. Business - Governmental Regulation - Air Emissions and Climate Change for further discussion.\nMany scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the earth\u2019s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, floods, and other climatic events. If any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our exploration and production operations. Significant physical effects of climate change could also have an indirect effect on our financing and operations by disrupting services or infrastructure provided to us by other parties. We may not be able to recover through insurance some or any of the damages, losses or costs that may result from potential physical effects of climate change and, as a result, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nHydraulic fracturing has recently come under increased scrutiny and could be the subject of further regulation, which could impact the timing and cost of development, as well as our investment in RockPile.\nAs discussed above in Item 1. Business - Governmental Regulation - Regulation of Hydraulic Fracturing, the regulatory landscape regarding hydraulic fracturing remains in flux. Depending on the legislation or regulations that ultimately may be adopted, exploration and production activities that employ hydraulic fracturing could be restricted or subject to additional regulation and permitting requirements. Individually or collectively, such new legislation or regulation could lead to operational delays or increased operating costs for TUSA and RockPile, and could result in additional burdens that could increase the costs and delay or curtail the development of unconventional oil and natural gas\nresources from shale formations that are not commercially viable without hydraulic fracturing. Further, commercially prohibitive costs or a prohibition or moratorium on hydraulic fracturing in the areas in which RockPile operates could result in a complete loss of our investment in RockPile. As a result, such legislation or regulation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe sale of our oil and natural gas production depends in part on gathering, transportation and processing facilities and services. Any limitation in the availability of, or our access to, those facilities or services would interfere with our ability to market the oil and natural gas that we produce and could adversely impact our drilling program, cash flows and results of operations.\nWe deliver oil and natural gas that may ultimately flow through gathering, processing and pipeline systems that Caliber does not own. The amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce and sell is subject to the accessibility, availability, proximity and capacity of these gathering, processing and pipeline systems. In particular, natural gas produced from the Bakken Shale has a high Btu content that requires natural gas processing to remove the natural gas liquids before it can be redelivered into transmission pipelines. Industry-wide in the Williston Basin, there is currently a shortage of natural gas gathering and processing capacity. Such shortage has limited our ability to sell our natural gas production. In addition, the use of alternative forms of transportation for oil production, such as trucks or rail, involve risks as well. For example, recent and well-publicized accidents involving trains delivering crude oil could result in increased levels of regulation and transportation costs.\nThe lack of available capacity in any of the gathering, processing and pipeline systems we use could result in our inability to realize the full economic potential of our production or in a reduction of the price offered for our production and could force us to reduce production in some circumstances. Any significant change in market factors or other conditions affecting these infrastructure systems and facilities, as well as any delays in constructing new infrastructure systems and facilities or any changes in regulatory requirements, could harm our business and, in turn, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFurthermore, weather conditions or natural disasters, actions by companies doing business in the areas in which we operate, or labor disputes may impair the distribution of oil and/or natural gas and in turn diminish our financial condition or ability to conduct our operations.\nThe lack of availability or high cost of drilling rigs, fracture stimulation crews, equipment, supplies, insurance, personnel and oilfield services could adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans on a timely basis and within our budget.\nOur industry is cyclical and, from time to time, there is a shortage of drilling rigs, fracture stimulation crews, equipment, supplies, key infrastructure, insurance or qualified personnel. During these periods, the costs and delivery times of rigs, equipment and supplies are substantially greater. In addition, the demand for, and wage rates of, qualified crews rise as the number of active rigs and completion fleets in service increases. If increasing levels of exploration and production result from strong commodity prices in the future, the demand for oilfield services will likely rise, and the costs of these services will likely increase, while the quality of these services may suffer. Costs associated with hydraulic fracturing, such as costs relating to water and proppants, may be subject to similar pressures in areas such as the Williston Basin where hydraulic fracturing activities are widespread. Moreover, costs in the Williston Basin generally are high relative to many areas of the United States due to its rapid growth in recent years and its distance from major metropolitan areas. Conversely, while certain costs could potentially decrease when commodity prices fall, we may be unable to realize such potential reductions or they may be less significant than we project.\nOur operations substantially depend on the availability of water. Restrictions on our ability to obtain, dispose of or recycle water may impact our ability to execute our drilling and development plans in a timely and cost-effective manner.\nWater is an essential component of our drilling and hydraulic fracturing processes. If we are unable to obtain water to use in our operations from local sources, we may be unable to economically produce oil, NGLs and gas, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMoreover, new environmental initiatives and regulations could include restrictions on disposal of waste, including, but not limited to, produced water, drilling fluids and other wastes associated with the exploration, development or\nproduction of oil and natural gas. Compliance with environmental regulations and permit requirements for the withdrawal, storage and use of surface water or ground water necessary for hydraulic fracturing of our wells may increase our operating costs and cause delays, interruptions or cessation of our operations, the extent of which cannot be predicted, and all of which would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nConstraints in the supply of, prices for, and availability of transportation of raw materials can have a material adverse effect on RockPile\u2019s business.\nHigh levels of demand for, or a shortage of, raw materials used in hydraulic fracturing operations, such as proppants, can trigger constraints in RockPile\u2019s supply chain of those raw materials. Many of the raw materials essential to its business require the use of rail, storage, and trucking services to transport the materials to its jobsites. These services, particularly during times of high demand, may cause delays in the arrival of, or otherwise constrain its supply of, raw materials. These constraints could have a material adverse effect on RockPile\u2019s business. In addition, price increases imposed by its vendors for such raw materials and the inability to pass these increases through to its customers could have a material adverse effect on RockPile\u2019s business. Our other operations may be similarly adversely affected by shortages of these raw materials.\nGrowing Caliber\u2019s business by constructing new pipelines and other infrastructure subjects it to construction risks and will require it to obtain rights of way at a reasonable cost. Such projects may not be profitable if costs are higher, or demand is less, than expected.\nWe intend to grow Caliber\u2019s business through the construction of pipelines, treatment/processing facilities and other midstream infrastructure. The construction of this infrastructure requires significant amounts of capital, which may exceed our expectations, and will involve numerous regulatory, environmental, political and legal uncertainties and stringent, lengthy and occasionally unreasonable or impractical federal, state and local permitting, consent, or authorization requirements. As a result, new infrastructure may not be constructed as scheduled or as originally designed, which may require redesign and additional equipment, relocations of facilities or rerouting of pipelines, which in turn could subject Caliber to additional capital costs, additional expenses or penalties and may adversely affect Caliber\u2019s operations. In addition, the coordination and monitoring of these projects requires skilled and experienced labor. Agreements with Caliber\u2019s producer customers may contain substantial financial penalties and give the producers the right to terminate their contracts if construction deadlines are not achieved. Moreover, Caliber\u2019s revenues may not increase immediately upon the expenditure of funds on a particular project. For instance, if Caliber builds a new pipeline, the construction may occur over an extended period of time, and Caliber may not receive any material increases in revenues until after completion of the project, if at all.\nIn addition, the construction of pipelines and other infrastructure may require Caliber to obtain rights-of-way or other property rights prior to construction. Caliber may be unable to obtain such rights-of-way or other property rights at a reasonable cost. If the cost of obtaining new or renewing rights-of-way or other property rights increases, it would adversely affect Caliber\u2019s operations.\nFurthermore, Caliber may have limited or no commitments from customers relating to infrastructure projects prior to their construction. If Caliber constructs facilities to capture anticipated future growth in production or satisfy anticipated market demand that does not materialize, the facilities may not operate as planned or may not be used at all. Caliber may rely on estimates of proved reserves in deciding to construct new pipelines and facilities, and those estimates may prove to be inaccurate because of the numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves. As a result, new infrastructure projects may be unprofitable.\nWe do not insure against all potential operating risk. We might incur substantial losses from, and be subject to substantial liability claims for, uninsured or underinsured risks related to our operations.\nOur operations are subject to the risks normally incident to the operation and development of oil and natural gas properties, the drilling of oil and natural gas wells, hydraulic fracturing and the provision of related services including:\n\uf0b7environmental hazards, such as uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas, brine, well fluids, toxic gas or other substances into the environment, including groundwater;\n\uf0b7abnormally pressured formations;\n\uf0b7fires and explosions;\n\uf0b7personal injuries and death;\n\uf0b7regulatory investigations and penalties;\n\uf0b7well blowouts;\n\uf0b7pipeline failures and ruptures;\n\uf0b7casing collapse;\n\uf0b7mechanical and operational problems that affect production; and\n\uf0b7natural disasters.\nWe do not maintain insurance against all such risks. We generally elect not to obtain insurance if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. Also, certain risk events may not be detected or detectable within the period during which notice must be provided under the applicable insurance policy. Losses and liabilities arising from uninsured and underinsured events or in amounts in excess of existing insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may have difficulty managing growth in our business, which could adversely affect our business plan, financial condition and results of operations.\nGrowth in accordance with our long-term business plan, if achieved, will place a significant strain on our financial, accounting, technical, operational and management resources. As we expand our activities and increase the number of projects we are evaluating or in which we participate, there will be additional demands on these resources. Our vertical integration strategy effectively increases the variety of these projects, which adds complexity and may require additional resources. The failure to continue to upgrade our technical, administrative, operating and financial control systems or the occurrence of unexpected expansion difficulties, including the failure to recruit and retain experienced managers, geologists, engineers and other professionals in the oil and natural gas industry, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to timely execute our business plan.\nOur lack of geographic diversification may increase the risk of an investment in us.\nOur current business focus is on the oil and natural gas industry in a limited number of properties in North Dakota and Montana. RockPile and Caliber also focus on the Williston Basin areas of those states. Larger companies have the ability to manage their risk by diversification. However, we currently lack diversification in terms of the geographic scope of our business. As a result, we will likely be impacted more acutely by factors affecting our industry or the regions in which we operate than we would if our business were more diversified, and this may increase our risk profile.\nWe face strong competition from other companies.\nWe encounter competition from other companies involved in the oil and natural gas industry in all areas of our operations, including the acquisition of exploratory prospects and proven properties. Our competitors include major integrated oil and natural gas companies and numerous independent oil and natural gas companies. Many of our competitors have been engaged in the oil and natural gas business much longer than we have and possess substantially larger operating staffs and greater capital resources than we do. These companies may be able to pay more for exploratory projects and productive oil and natural gas properties and may be able to define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit. In addition, these companies may be able to expend greater resources on the existing and changing technologies that we believe are and will be increasingly important to attaining success in the industry, particularly in the Bakken Shale and Three Forks formations on which we focus. Such competitors may also be in a better position to secure oilfield services and equipment on a timelier basis or on more favorable terms. We may not be able to conduct our operations, evaluate and select suitable properties, and consummate transactions successfully in this highly competitive environment, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects. Similarly, the market for RockPile\u2019s services and products is characterized by continual technological developments to provide better and more reliable performance and services. If RockPile is not able to design, develop, and produce commercially competitive products, and to implement commercially competitive services in a timely manner in response to changes in technology, its business could be materially and adversely affected.\nSeasonal weather conditions and other factors could adversely affect our ability to conduct drilling and completion activities.\nOur operations could be adversely affected by weather conditions. In the Williston Basin, drilling and other oil and natural gas activities cannot be conducted as effectively during the winter months. Severe weather conditions limit and may temporarily halt operations during such conditions. Wet weather and spring thaw may make the ground unstable. Consequently, municipalities and state transportation departments enforce road bans that restrict the movement of rigs and other heavy equipment during certain periods, thereby reducing activity levels. Similarly, any drought or other condition resulting in a shortage or the unavailability of adequate supplies of water would impair our ability to conduct hydraulic fracturing operations. These constraints, and resulting shortages or cost increases, could delay or temporarily halt our oil and natural gas operations and materially increase our operating and capital costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to retain or recruit qualified managerial, operations and field personnel, we may not be able to continue our operations.\nOur success depends to a significant extent upon the continued services of our directors and officers and that of key managerial, operational, land, finance, legal and accounting staff. In order to successfully implement and manage our business plan, we will be dependent upon, among other things, successfully recruiting qualified managerial and field personnel having experience in required aspects of our business. Competition for qualified individuals is intense. We cannot assure you that we will be able to retain existing employees or that we will be able to find, attract and retain qualified personnel on acceptable terms.\nWe have restated our financial statements in the past and may be required to do so in the future.\nWe restated certain financial information in fiscal years 2013 and 2014 as a result of identifying distinct material weakness in our internal controls. In fiscal year 2014, we identified a material weakness in our controls over the accounting for equity investment derivatives. Our control for the accounting for equity investment derivatives was not designed to consider all of the relevant accounting literature applicable to our Caliber trigger units and warrants. This material weakness resulted in a material error in our accounting for equity investment derivatives, and we restated our previously issued quarterly financial statements for the three months ended October 31, 2013. We have implemented system and procedural changes to prevent previously identified material weaknesses from recurring. However, our vertical integration strategy and midstream joint venture investment create certain accounting issues relating to the relationship of our various businesses that are complex, increasing the risk that we may have to restate or correct financial disclosures in the future. If other deficiencies in our internal controls arise in the future, we may be unable to provide holders of our securities with required financial information in a timely and reliable manner.\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP involves making estimates, judgments, interpretations and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and income. These estimates, judgments, interpretations and assumptions are often inherently imprecise or uncertain, and any necessary revisions to prior estimates, judgments, interpretations or assumptions could lead to further restatements. Any such restatement or correction may be highly time consuming, may require substantial attention from management and significant accounting costs, may result in adverse regulatory actions by the SEC or NYSE MKT, may result in stockholder litigation, may cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, and may cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, leading to a decline in our stock price.\nCertain U.S. federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development may be eliminated as a result of future legislation.\nPresident Obama has proposed changes to U.S. tax laws that would eliminate certain key U.S. federal income tax incentives currently available to oil and natural gas exploration and production companies, including by (i) repealing the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas wells, (ii) eliminating current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs, (iii) eliminating the deduction for certain domestic production activities, and (iv) extending the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. It is unclear whether these or similar changes will be enacted and, if enacted, how soon any such changes could become effective. The passage of this legislation or any similar changes in U.S. federal income tax laws could increase the cost of exploration and development of natural gas\nand oil resources. Any such changes could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business could be negatively impacted by cybersecurity risks and other disruptions.\nAs an oil and natural gas producer, we face various security threats, including possible attempts by third parties to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information, or to render data or systems unusable, through unauthorized computer access, threats to the safety of our employees, and threats to the security of our infrastructure or third-party facilities and infrastructure, such as processing plants and pipelines. Our business partners, including vendors, service providers, operating partners, purchasers of our production, and financial institutions, face similar threats, including with respect to sensitive information of ours. There can be no assurance that the procedures and controls we or our business partners use to monitor these threats and mitigate exposure to them will be sufficient in preventing them from materializing. If any of these events were to materialize, they could lead to losses of sensitive information, critical infrastructure, personnel or capabilities essential to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nAboriginal claims could have an adverse effect on us and our operations.\nAboriginal peoples have claimed aboriginal title and rights to portions of Montana where we operate. We are not aware that any claims have been made in respect to our property or assets in Montana or North Dakota. However, if a claim arose and was successful, it could have an adverse effect on us and our business operations, financial conditions or prospects.\nCertain stockholders have significant influence on our major corporate decisions, including control over some matters that require stockholder approval, and could take actions that could be adverse to stockholders.\nIn connection with the issuance and sale to NGP Triangle Holdings, LLC (\u201cNGP\u201d) in July 2012 of our 5% convertible note with an initial principal amount of $120.0 million (the \u201cConvertible Note\u201d), we entered into an Investment Agreement with NGP and its parent company. Pursuant to the Investment Agreement, NGP is entitled to designate one director to our board of directors until the occurrence of a \u201cTermination Event\u201d (as defined in the Investment Agreement). The Investment Agreement further provides that, for so long as at least 50% of the original principal amount is outstanding and held by NGP, we will not take certain actions without the prior written consent of NGP. In addition, pursuant to the Convertible Note, for so long as at least 50% of the original principal amount is outstanding and held by NGP, we have agreed to (i) obtain the prior written consent of NGP before submitting certain resolutions or matters to a vote of the stockholders, or (ii) require the approval of stockholders as would be required to approve such resolution or matter if the then-outstanding Convertible Note held by NGP had been converted into shares of common stock immediately prior to the record date for such meeting of stockholders and NGP had voted all of such shares of common stock against such resolution or matter. The Convertible Note is convertible into shares of common stock at an initial conversion price of $8.00 per share, which, based on the initial principal amount, would allow the Convertible Note to be converted into 15,000,000 shares of common stock plus any shares issuable upon the conversion of accrued interest, which is paid-in-kind by adding to the principal balance on a quarterly basis.\nIn March 2013, we sold to two affiliates of NGP an aggregate of 9,300,000 shares of our common stock in a private placement (the \u201cNGP Private Placement\u201d). In connection with the NGP Private Placement, we entered into an amendment to the Investment Agreement to modify the definition of \u201cTermination Event,\u201d thereby strengthening NGP\u2019s board seat designation right. As of April 1, 2015, NGP\u2019s affiliates collectively held (i) 9,300,000 shares of our outstanding common stock and (ii) the Convertible Note with an outstanding principal balance of approximately $135.9 million. If NGP had fully converted the Convertible Note on April 1, 2015, NGP and its affiliates would have collectively held approximately 29% of our outstanding shares of common stock on that date. As a result of the Investment Agreement, as amended, and NGP\u2019s current and potential holdings of our common stock, NGP has significant influence over us, our management, our policies, and certain matters requiring stockholder approval.\nFurther, in August 2013, we sold to ActOil Bakken, LLC (\u201cActOil\u201d) 11,350,000 shares of our common stock in a private placement. As of April 1, 2015, ActOil held approximately 15% of our outstanding shares of common stock.\nThe interests of NGP and its affiliates, including in NGP\u2019s capacity as a creditor, and ActOil may differ from the interests of our other stockholders, and the ability of NGP and ActOil to influence certain of our major corporate decisions\nmay harm the market price of our common stock by delaying, deferring or preventing transactions that are in the best interest of all stockholders or discouraging third-party investors.\nOur limited partner interest in Caliber may be diluted.\nIn October 2012, a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours participated in the formation of Caliber, a joint venture with FREIF to provide crude oil, natural gas, and water transportation and related services to us and third-parties primarily in the Williston Basin. In connection with its investment in Caliber, our subsidiary received an initial 30% percent limited partner interest, as well as warrants to purchase additional limited partner interests at specified prices, trigger units, and trigger warrants. Based on initial anticipated funding commitments by the joint venture partners, full exercise and vesting of our warrants, trigger units, and trigger warrants would cause our ownership to increase to a 50% limited partner interest.\nIn September 2014, FREIF committed to providing an anticipated additional $80.0 million to Caliber in return for 8,000,000 limited partner units. The associated amendment to the joint venture agreement resulted in our 4,000,000 trigger units vesting and converting to limited partner units. FREIF and our subsidiary received the 8,000,000 and 4,000,000 limited partner units, respectively, on June 30, 2014. Following the conversion of our 4,000,000 trigger units and the issuance of 8,000,000 limited partner units to our joint venture partner, our limited partner interest in Caliber increased to 32%.\nIn February 2015, FREIF contributed an additional $34.0 million to Caliber in exchange for 2,720,000 limited partner units, which diluted our limited partner interest to 28.3%. In conjunction with the contribution, we received warrants to purchase an additional 3,626,667 limited partner units, and FREIF received warrants to purchase an additional 906,667 limited partner units. On a fully-diluted basis, assuming the exercise of all outstanding warrants and no further capital contributions, we and FREIF would each hold a 50% percent limited partner interest in Caliber.\nWe will be unable to increase our limited partner interest above 28.3% absent a cashless exercise of our warrants or a direct capital outlay to exercise our warrants or commit additional partnership approved capital. Further, if FREIF makes a partnership approved capital contribution and we choose not to invest additional capital in the joint venture, or if FREIF exercises its warrants and we do not exercise our warrants, we would be diluted below our 28.3% limited partner interest.\nWe do not control Caliber.\nCaliber is managed and governed by its general partner, Caliber Midstream GP, LLC, of which FREIF and Triangle each own a 50% non-economic interest and share governance equally. Because we do not hold a controlling interest in Caliber, we do not have the ability to direct the activities of Caliber that most significantly impact Caliber\u2019s growth and economic performance. If we and the other general partner disagree on significant matters relating to Caliber, such an impasse could adversely affects Caliber\u2019s prospects and our investment therein.\nOur derivative activities could result in financial losses or reduced income, or could limit our potential gains from increases in prices.\nWe use derivatives for a portion of our crude oil production to reduce exposure to adverse fluctuations in prices of crude oil and to achieve more predictable cash flows. These arrangements expose us to the risk of financial loss in some circumstances, including when sales are different than expected, when there is a change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the derivative agreement and actual prices that we receive, or if the counterparty to the derivative contract were to default on its contractual obligations.\nIn addition, derivative arrangements may limit the benefit from increases in the price for crude oil, and they may also require the use of our resources to meet cash margin requirements. Since we do not designate our derivatives as hedges, we do not currently qualify for use of hedge accounting; therefore, changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded in our statements of operations, and our net income is subject to greater volatility than it would be if our derivative instruments qualified for hedge accounting. For instance, if the price of crude oil rises significantly, it could result in significant non-cash charges each quarter, which could have a material negative effect on our net income.\nAdditionally, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, or the Dodd-Frank Act, among other things, imposes restrictions on the use and trading of certain derivatives, including energy derivatives. The nature\nand scope of those restrictions is in the process of being determined in significant part through implementing regulations adopted by the SEC, the Commodities Futures Trading Commission and other regulators. If, as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act or its implementing regulations, capital or margin requirements or other limitations relating to our commodity derivative activities are imposed, this could have an adverse effect on our ability to implement our hedging strategy. In particular, a requirement to post cash collateral in connection with our derivative positions would likely make it impracticable to implement our current hedging strategy. In addition, requirements and limitations imposed on our derivative counterparties could increase the costs of pursuing our hedging strategy.\nUnrelated to our hedging activities with respect to crude oil prices, we hold warrants in Caliber that are classified as derivatives. For so long as such warrants remain outstanding, we will be required to estimate their fair market value on a quarterly basis. We currently use a modified market approach and Black-Scholes option pricing model to value the warrants. The associated model is based on several assumptions about future events. While we believe that our model and underlying assumptions are reasonable, there can be no assurance that the assumptions will ultimately prove to be accurate or that our model is the best model for valuing the warrants. If the model and underlying assumptions are flawed, then our accounting for the warrants may not reflect their true value.\nMost of our commodity derivatives expire by December 31, 2015.\nAs of January 31, 2015, we had costless collar commodity derivative contracts for 4,356 Bbl/d with a weighted average put strike price of $86.85 and a weighted average call strike price of $98.63 (NYMEX). These contracts expire by December 31, 2015. Subsequent to January 31, 2015, the Company entered into crude oil swaps at a weighted average price of $60.07 for 1,500 Bbl/d (NYMEX), effective for the period from October 1, 2015 through December 31, 2016, and crude oil swaps at a weighted average price of $60.30 for 500 Bbl/d (NYMEX), effective for the period from January 1, 2016 through December 31, 2016. Once our costless collar contracts expire, our commodity derivatives may be limited to those contracts that we have entered into in a depressed pricing environment. As such, our crude oil production and sales for fiscal year 2017 and beyond may be largely unhedged, or hedged at depressed prices, which will expose us to continued volatility in crude oil market prices, whether favorable or unfavorable.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nThe market price for our common stock may be highly volatile.\nThe market price for our common stock may be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations. Some of the factors that could negatively affect such share price include:\n\uf0b7changes in oil and natural gas prices;\n\uf0b7actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations;\n\uf0b7liquidity;\n\uf0b7sales of common stock by our stockholders, directors, and officers;\n\uf0b7changes in our cash flows from operations or earnings estimates;\n\uf0b7publication of research reports about us or the oil and natural gas exploration and production industry generally;\n\uf0b7increases in market interest rates which may increase our cost of capital;\n\uf0b7changes in applicable laws or regulations, court rulings, and enforcement and legal actions;\n\uf0b7changes in market valuations of similar companies;\n\uf0b7adverse market reaction to any indebtedness we incur in the future;\n\uf0b7additions or departures of key management personnel;\n\uf0b7actions by our stockholders;\n\uf0b7commencement of or involvement in litigation;\n\uf0b7news reports relating to trends, concerns, technological or competitive developments, regulatory changes and other related issues in our industry, including adverse public sentiment regarding hydraulic fracturing;\n\uf0b7speculation in the press or investment community regarding our business;\n\uf0b7general market and economic conditions; and\n\uf0b7domestic and international economic, legal and regulatory factors unrelated to our performance.\nFinancial markets have recently experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices of securities that have, in many cases, been unrelated to the operating performance, underlying asset values or\nprospects of the companies issuing those securities. Accordingly, the market price of our common stock may decline even if our results of operations, underlying asset values or prospects improve or remain consistent.\nFuture sales or other issuances of our common stock could depress the market for our common stock.\nWe may seek to raise additional funds through one or more public or private offerings of our common stock, in amounts and at prices and terms to be determined at the time of the offering. We may also use our common stock as consideration to make acquisitions, including acquisitions of additional leasehold interests. Any issuances of large quantities of our common stock could reduce the price of our common stock. In addition, to the extent that we issue equity securities to fund our business plan, our existing stockholders\u2019 ownership will be diluted.\nIssuances, or the availability for sale, of substantial amounts of our common stock could adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nNo prediction can be made as to the effect, if any, that future issuances of our common stock, or the availability of common stock for future sales, will have on the market price of our common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market and the availability of shares for future sale, including by one or more of our significant stockholders or shares of our common stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding options to acquire shares of our common stock, could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock. This in turn would adversely affect the fair value of our common stock and could impair our future ability to raise capital through an offering of our equity securities.\nThe potential future issuance of preferred stock may not enhance stockholder value.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval. Shares of preferred stock could be issued in a financing in which investors purchase preferred stock with rights, preferences and privileges that may be superior to those of our common stock. We could also use the preferred stock for potential strategic transactions, including, among other things, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, restructurings, business combinations and investments. We cannot provide assurances that any such transactions will be consummated on favorable terms or at all, that they will enhance stockholder value, or that they will not adversely affect our business or the trading price of the common stock. Further, the existence of outstanding preferred stock may make us a less attractive candidate for third party acquirers.\nIn the past, we have not paid dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.\nIn the past, we have not paid dividends on our common stock and do not expect to declare or pay any cash or other dividends in the foreseeable future on our common stock, as we intend to use cash flows generated by operations to develop our business. Any future determination to pay cash dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will be dependent upon our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements, limits imposed by our debt agreements, and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant.\nAnti-takeover provisions could make a third-party acquisition of us difficult.\nWe are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits certain business combination transactions between a corporation and an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d within three years of the time such stockholder became an interested stockholder, absent, in most cases, board or stockholder approval. An \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d is any person who, together with affiliates and associates, is the owner of 15% or more of the outstanding voting stock of the corporation, and the term \u201cbusiness combination\u201d encompasses a wide variety of transactions with or caused by an interested stockholder, including mergers, asset sales and other transactions in which the interested stockholder receives a benefit on other than a pro rata basis with other stockholders. Although a corporation can opt out of Section 203 in its certificate of incorporation, we have not done so. Section 203 may have an anti-takeover effect with respect to transactions not approved in advance by our board of directors, including by discouraging takeover attempts that might result in a premium being paid over the then-current market price of our common stock and that might be supported by a majority of our stockholders.", "PERMNO": 12389, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "TPLMQ"}
