{"cik": "1411579", "company": "AMC ENTERTAINMENT HOLDINGS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-10", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisk Factors Associated with AMC\u2019s Business\nWe depend on motion picture production and performance.\nOur ability to operate successfully depends upon the availability, diversity and appeal of motion pictures, our ability to license motion pictures and the performance of such motion pictures in our markets. The most attended films are usually released during the summer and the calendar year-end holidays, making our business highly seasonal. We license first-run motion pictures, the success of which has increasingly depended on the marketing efforts of the major motion picture studios. Poor performance of, or any disruption in the production of these motion pictures (including by reason of a strike or lack of adequate financing), or a reduction in the marketing efforts of the major motion picture studios, could hurt our business and results of operations. Conversely, the successful performance of these motion pictures, particularly the sustained success of any one motion picture, or an increase in effective marketing efforts of the major motion picture studios, may generate positive results for our business and operations in a specific fiscal quarter or year that may not necessarily be indicative of, or comparable to, future results of operations. For example, our fourth quarter 2016 results (as well as those of Odeon and Carmike) were negatively impacted, when compared to the same quarter in 2015, by the opening during the fourth quarter of 2015 of the largest grossing film of all time, Star Wars: The Force Awakens. As movie studios rely on a smaller number of higher grossing \u201ctent pole\u201d films there may be increased pressure for higher film licensing fees. In addition, a change in the type and breadth of movies offered by motion picture studios may adversely affect the demographic base of movie-goers.\nWe have no control over distributors of the films and our business may be adversely affected if our access to motion pictures is limited or delayed.\nWe rely on distributors of motion pictures, over whom we have no control, for the films that we exhibit. Major motion picture distributors are required by law to offer and license film to exhibitors, including us, on a film-by-film and theatre-by-theatre basis. Consequently, we cannot assure ourselves of a supply of motion pictures by entering into long-term arrangements with major distributors, but must compete for our licenses on a film-by-film and theatre-by-theatre basis. Our business depends on maintaining good relations with these distributors, as this affects our ability to negotiate commercially favorable licensing terms for first-run films or to obtain licenses at all. With only seven distributors representing approximately 90% of the U.S. box office in 2016, there is a high level of concentration in the industry. Our business may be adversely affected if our access to motion pictures is limited or delayed because of deterioration in our relationships with one or more distributors or for some other reason. To the extent that we are unable to license a popular film for exhibition in our theatres, our operating results may be adversely affected.\nOur substantial debt could adversely affect our operations and prevent us from satisfying those debt obligations.\nWe have a significant amount of debt. As of December 31, 2016, we had outstanding approximately $3,761.0 million of indebtedness ($3,834.4 million face amount), which consisted of $1,691.3 million under our Senior Secured Credit Facility ($1,721.8 million face amount), $1,823.5 million of our existing subordinated notes ($1,878.4 million face amount), $246.2 million of the Carmike Notes ($230.0 million face amount), a $4.2 million promissory note, $675.4 million of existing capital and financing lease obligations, and $137.4 million available for borrowing under our Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2016, we also had approximately $6.2 billion of undiscounted rental payments under operating leases (with initial base terms generally between 15 to 20 years). We will also increase our debt substantially in connection with the Nordic Acquisition, if completed. The amount of our indebtedness and lease and other financial obligations could have important consequences to our stockholders. For example, it could:\n\u00b7\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u00b7\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, dividend payments, acquisitions, general corporate purposes or other purposes;\n\u00b7\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of lease rentals and principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the funds available to us for operations, dividends and any future business opportunities;\n\u00b7\nlimit our planning flexibility for, or ability to react to, changes in our business and the industry; and\n\u00b7\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage with competitors who may have less indebtedness and other obligations or greater access to financing.\nIf we fail to make any required payment under our Senior Secured Credit Facility or the indentures governing our notes or to comply with any of the financial and operating covenants contained therein, we would be in default. Lenders under our Senior Secured Credit Facility or holders of our notes, as applicable, could then decide to accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness under the Senior Secured Credit Facility or the indentures and in the case of the Senior Credit Facility, foreclose upon the stock and personal property of our subsidiaries that is pledged to secure the Senior Secured Credit Facility. Other creditors might then accelerate other indebtedness. If the lenders under the Senior Secured Credit Facility or holders of our notes accelerate the maturity of the indebtedness thereunder, we might not have sufficient assets to satisfy our obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facility, the indentures, or our other indebtedness. Our indebtedness under our Senior Secured Credit Facility bears interest at rates that fluctuate with changes in certain prevailing interest rates (although, subject to certain conditions, such rates may be fixed for certain periods). If interest rates increase, we may be unable to meet our debt service obligations under our Senior Secured Credit Facility and other indebtedness.\nThe agreements governing our indebtedness contain covenants that may limit our ability to take advantage of certain business opportunities advantageous to us.\nThe agreements governing our indebtedness contain various covenants that limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u00b7\nincur or guarantee additional indebtedness;\n\u00b7\npay dividends or make other distributions to our stockholders;\n\u00b7\nmake restricted payments;\n\u00b7\nincur liens;\n\u00b7\nengage in transactions with affiliates; and\n\u00b7\nenter into business combinations.\nThese restrictions could limit our ability to obtain future financing, make acquisitions, fund needed capital expenditures, withstand economic downturns in our business or the economy in general, conduct operations or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities that may arise.\nAt the same time, the covenants in the instruments governing our indebtedness may not provide investors with protections against transactions they may deem undesirable. Although the indentures governing our notes contain a fixed charge coverage test that limits our ability to incur indebtedness, this limitation is subject to a number of significant exceptions and qualifications. Moreover, the indentures do not impose any limitation on our incurrence of lease obligations or liabilities that are not considered \u201cIndebtedness\u201d under the indentures (such as operating leases), nor do they impose any limitation on the amount of liabilities incurred by subsidiaries, if any, that might be designated as \u201cunrestricted subsidiaries,\u201d which are subsidiaries that we designate, that are not subject to the restrictive covenants contained in the indentures governing our notes.\nFurthermore, there are no restrictions in the indentures on our ability to invest in other entities (including unaffiliated entities) and no restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to enter into agreements restricting their ability to pay dividends or otherwise transfer funds to us. Also, although the indentures limit our ability to make dividends and other restricted payments, these restrictions are subject to significant exceptions and qualifications.\nIf our cash flows prove inadequate to service our debt and provide for our other obligations, we may be required to refinance all or a portion of our existing debt or future debt at terms unfavorable to us.\nOur ability to make payments on and refinance our debt and other financial obligations and to fund our capital expenditures and acquisitions will depend on our ability to generate substantial operating cash flow. This will depend on our future performance, which will be subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors beyond our control.\nIn addition, our debt obligations require us to repay or refinance our obligations when they come due. If our cash flows were to prove inadequate to meet our debt service, rental and other obligations in the future, we may be required to refinance all or a portion of our existing or future debt, on or before maturity, to sell assets or to obtain additional financing. We cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance any of our indebtedness, including our Senior Secured Credit Facility and our notes, sell any such assets, or obtain additional financing on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nThe terms of the agreements governing our indebtedness restrict, but do not prohibit us from incurring additional indebtedness. If we are in compliance with the financial covenants set forth in the Senior Secured Credit Facility and our other outstanding debt instruments, we may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness. If we incur additional indebtedness, the related risks that we face may intensify.\nLimitations on the availability of capital may prevent deployment of strategic initiatives.\nOur key strategic initiatives, including recliner seating, enhanced food and beverage and premium sight and sound, require significant capital expenditures to implement. Our gross capital expenditures aggregated approximately $421.7 million, $333.4 million and $270.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, December 31, 2015 and, December 31, 2014, respectively. We estimate that our gross cash outflows for capital expenditures will be approximately $700.0 million to $750.0 million, before giving effect to expected landlord contributions of approximately $150.0 million to $170.0 million for the year ending December 31, 2017. The lack of available capital resources due to business performance or other financial commitments could prevent or delay the deployment of innovations in our theatres. We may have to seek additional financing or issue additional securities to fully implement our growth strategy. We cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain new financing on favorable terms, or at all. In addition, covenants under our existing indebtedness limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness, and the performance of any additional or improved theatres may not be sufficient to service the related indebtedness that we are permitted to incur.\nWe are subject, at times, to intense competition.\nOur theatres are subject to varying degrees of competition in the geographic areas in which we operate. Competitors may be multi-national circuits, national circuits, regional circuits or smaller independent exhibitors. Competition among theatre exhibition companies is often intense with respect to the following factors:\n\u00b7\nAttracting patrons. The competition for patrons is dependent upon factors such as the availability of popular motion pictures, the location and number of theatres and screens in a market, the comfort and quality of the theatres and pricing. Many of our competitors have sought to increase the number of screens that they operate. Competitors have built or may be planning to build theatres in certain areas where we operate, which could result in excess capacity and increased competition for patrons.\n\u00b7\nLicensing motion pictures. We believe that the principle competitive factors with respect to film licensing include licensing terms, number of seats and screens available for a particular picture, revenue potential and the location and condition of an exhibitor\u2019s theatres.\n\u00b7\nTheatre Locations. We must compete with exhibitors and others in our efforts to locate and acquire attractive new and existing sites for our theatres and when renewing leases on our existing theatres. There can be no assurance that we will be able to acquire such new sites or existing theatres at reasonable prices or on favorable terms. Moreover, some of these competitors may be stronger financially than we are. As a result of the foregoing, we may not succeed in acquiring theatres or may have to pay more than we would prefer to make an acquisition.\nThe theatrical exhibition industry also faces competition from other forms of out-of-home entertainment, such as concerts, amusement parks and sporting events and from other distribution channels for filmed entertainment, such as cable television, pay-per-view and home video systems and from other forms of in-home entertainment.\nAn increase in the use of alternative film delivery methods or other forms of entertainment may drive down our attendance and limit our ticket prices.\nWe compete with other film delivery methods, including network, syndicated cable and satellite television and DVDs, as well as video-on-demand, pay-per-view services, video streaming and downloads via the Internet. We also compete for the public\u2019s leisure time and disposable income with other forms of entertainment, including sporting events, amusement parks, live music concerts, live theatre and restaurants. An increase in the popularity of these alternative film delivery methods and other forms of entertainment could reduce attendance at our theatres, limit the prices we can charge for admission and materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur results of operations may be impacted by shrinking theatrical exclusive release windows.\nOver the last decade, the average theatrical exclusive release window, which represents the time that elapses from the date of a film\u2019s theatrical release to the date a film is available to consumers in-home, has decreased from approximately six months to approximately three to four months. If patrons choose to wait for in-home viewing options rather than attend a theatre for viewing the film, it may adversely impact our business and results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. In 2011, several major film studios tested premium video-on-demand products released in homes approximately 60 days after a movie\u2019s theatrical debut, which threatened the length of the release window. In January 2015, Amazon Studios announced its intention to produce and acquire original movies for theatrical release with video streaming available just 4 to 8 weeks after their theatrical debut. We cannot assure you that this release window, which is determined by the film studios, will not shrink further or be eliminated altogether, which could have an adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nOur business is subject to international economic, political and other risks that could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAs a result of the Odeon Acquisition, 23% of our revenues on a pro forma basis after giving effect to the Completed Acquisitions are derived from countries outside the United States for the year ended December 31, 2016. The success of our acquisition of Odeon is dependent upon our ability to operate a business in markets where we have limited experience and is subject to risks that are beyond our control. The portion of our revenues derived from international operations will grow further if the Nordic Acquisition is completed. Accordingly, our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally, including:\n\u00b7\ndifficulties and costs of staffing and managing international operations among diverse geographies, languages and cultures;\n\u00b7\nthe impact of regional or country-specific business cycles and economic instability;\n\u00b7\nthe impact of the United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the European Union and the potential that other countries could also exit;\n\u00b7\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates which could lead to fluctuations in our reported results of operations or result in significant decreases in the value of our international investments as denominated in U.S. Dollars;\n\u00b7\nincreased foreign interest rates, foreign exchange fees and other bank charges as a result of financing our foreign operations;\n\u00b7\nexposure to anti-corruption laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d) and the U.K. Bribery Act (the \u201cBribery Act\u201d), and export-control regulations and economic sanctions regulations, including those promulgated by the Office of Foreign Assets Control, United States Department of Treasury (\u201cOFAC\u201d);\n\u00b7\nexposure to local economic conditions and local laws and regulations;\n\u00b7\nexposure to local labor and employment laws;\n\u00b7\nrelationships with local labor unions and works councils;\n\u00b7\nlimited borrowing capabilities relating to activities in non-U.S. countries;\n\u00b7\neconomic and/or credit conditions abroad;\n\u00b7\npotential adverse changes in the political and/or economic stability of foreign countries or in their diplomatic relations with the United States;\n\u00b7\nrestrictions on the withdrawal of foreign investment and earnings;\n\u00b7\ngovernment policies against businesses owned by foreigners;\n\u00b7\ninvestment restrictions or requirements;\n\u00b7\ndiminished ability to legally enforce our contractual rights in foreign countries;\n\u00b7\ndifficulty in protecting our brand, reputation and intellectual property;\n\u00b7\nrestrictions on the ability to obtain or retain licenses required for operation;\n\u00b7\nforeign exchange restrictions;\n\u00b7\nadverse changes in regulatory or tax requirements;\n\u00b7\nrestrictions on foreign ownership of subsidiaries;\n\u00b7\nmultijurisdictional data protection and privacy laws, including restrictions on transferring personally identifiable information outside of a jurisdiction; and\n\u00b7\ntariffs and other trade barriers.\nIf we are unable to manage the complexity of our global operations successfully, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not achieve the expected benefits and performance from our recent acquisitions.\nAs a result of our recent acquisitions of Carmike and Odeon, we expect to achieve certain synergies and cost savings through, for example, reducing general and administrative expenses by combining operating functions such as accounting, finance and technology, achieving purchasing efficiencies and achieving revenue enhancements resulting from the acquisitions. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow from these acquisitions to service the indebtedness incurred to finance such acquisitions or realize any other anticipated benefits. Nor can there be any assurance that our profitability will be improved by these or any future acquisitions. Although we have a long history of successfully integrating acquisitions, any acquisition may involve operating risks, such as:\n\u00b7\nthe difficulty of assimilating and integrating the acquired operations and personnel into our current business;\n\u00b7\nthe potential disruption of our ongoing business;\n\u00b7\nthe diversion of management\u2019s attention and other resources;\n\u00b7\nthe possible inability of management to maintain uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies;\n\u00b7\nthe risks of entering markets in which we have little or no experience;\n\u00b7\nthe potential impairment of relationships with employees;\n\u00b7\nunexpected costs, charges or expenses;\n\u00b7\nour effective implementation and customer acceptance of our marketing strategy;\n\u00b7\nthe possibility that any liabilities we may incur or assume may prove to be more burdensome than anticipated; and\n\u00b7\nthe possibility that the acquired theatres do not perform as expected.\nOptimizing our theatre circuit through new construction and the transformation of our existing theatres may be subject to delay and unanticipated costs.\n\u00b7\nThe availability of attractive site locations for new construction is subject to various factors that are beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u00b7\nlocal conditions, such as scarcity of space or increase in demand for real estate, demographic changes and changes in zoning and tax laws; and\n\u00b7\ncompetition for site locations from both theatre companies and other businesses.\nWe typically require 18 to 24 months in the United States from the time we reach an agreement with a landlord to when a theatre opens.\nIn addition, the improvement of our existing theatres through our enhanced food and beverage and recliner seating initiatives is subject to substantial risks, such as difficulty in obtaining permits, landlord approvals and new types of operating licenses (e.g. liquor licenses). We may also experience cost overruns from delays or other unanticipated costs in both new construction and facility improvements. Furthermore, our new sites and transformed locations may not perform to our expectations.\nWe rely on our information systems to conduct our business, and any failure to protect these systems against security breaches or failure of these systems themselves could adversely affect our business, results of operations and liquidity and could result in litigation and penalties. Additionally, if these systems fail or become unavailable for any significant period of time, our business could be harmed.\nThe efficient operation of our business is dependent on computer hardware and software systems. Among other things, these systems collect and store certain personal information from customers, vendors and employees and process customer payment information. Additionally, open source internet ticketing allows tickets for all of our theatres to be sold by various third party vendors on websites using information systems we do not control. Our information systems and those maintained by our third party vendors and the sensitive data they are designed to protect are vulnerable to security breaches by computer hackers, cyber terrorists and other cyber attackers. We rely on industry accepted security measures and technology to securely maintain confidential and proprietary information maintained on our information systems, and we rely on our third party vendors to take appropriate measures to protect the confidentiality of the information on those information systems. However, these measures and technology may not adequately prevent security breaches. Our information systems may become unavailable or fail to perform as anticipated for any reason, including viruses, loss of power or human error. Any significant interruption or failure of our information systems or those maintained by our third party vendors or any significant breach of security could adversely affect our reputation with our customers, vendors and employees and could adversely affect our business, results of operations and liquidity and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties. A significant interruption, failure or breach of the security of our information systems or those of our third party vendors could also require us to expend significant\nresources to upgrade the security measures and technology that guard sensitive data against computer hackers, cyber terrorists and other cyber attackers. We maintain cyber risk insurance coverage to protect against such risks, however, there can be no assurance that such coverage will be adequate.\nWe may suffer future impairment losses and theatre and other closure charges.\nThe opening of new theatres by us and certain of our competitors has drawn audiences away from some of our older theatres. In addition, demographic changes and competitive pressures have caused some of our theatres to become unprofitable. Since not all theatres are appropriate for our new initiatives, we may have to close certain theatres or recognize impairment losses related to the decrease in value of particular theatres. We review long-lived assets, including intangibles, marketable securities and non-consolidated entities for impairment as part of our annual budgeting process and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable. During the years ended December 31, 2016, December 31, 2015, and December 31, 2014, we recorded impairment charges of $5.5 million, $1.7 million, and $3.1 million, respectively. Deterioration in the performance of our theatres could require us to recognize additional impairment losses and close additional theatres, which could have an adverse effect on the results of our operations. We continually monitor the performance of our theatres, and factors such as changing consumer preferences and our inability to sublease vacant retail space could negatively impact operating results and result in future closures, sales, dispositions and significant theatre and other closure charges prior to expiration of underlying lease agreements.\nWe may be limited in our ability to utilize, or may not be able to utilize, net operating loss carryforwards to reduce our future tax liability.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had an estimated federal income tax loss carryforward of $562.3 million and estimated state income tax loss carryforward of $257.6 million which will be limited annually due to certain change in ownership provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended (\u201cIRC\u201d), Section 382. Our federal tax loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2018 and will completely expire in 2035. Our state tax loss carryforwards may be used over various periods ranging from 1 to 20 years. As of December 31, 2016, we had estimated foreign income tax loss carryforwards of $459.8 million. Our foreign tax loss carryforwards are available to be used indefinitely, except for approximately $13.8 million which will expire in varying amounts between 2017 and 2028. The tax loss carryforward is reflected on our balance sheet as an asset valued at our current effective tax rate. A reduction in corporate tax rates will cause us to revalue the asset at the lower rates.\nWe have experienced numerous \u201cownership changes\u201d within the meaning of Section 382(g) of the IRC, including our merger with Wanda. These ownership changes have and will continue to subject our tax loss carryforwards to annual limitations which will restrict our ability to use them to offset our taxable income in periods following the ownership changes. In general, the annual use limitation equals the aggregate value of our equity at the time of the ownership change multiplied by a specified tax-exempt interest rate. On December 21, 2016 we acquired Carmike Cinemas, Inc. Carmike has experienced numerous \u201cownership changes\u201d within the meaning of Section 382(g). These ownership changes have and will continue to subject losses acquired with the transaction to annual limitations which will restrict our ability to use them to offset our taxable income in periods following the ownership changes.\nWe are subject to complex taxation, changes in tax rates, adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation and disagreements with tax authorities that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are subject to many different forms of taxation in both the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions where we operate. Current economic and political conditions, including the recent United Kingdom (U.K.) referendum in which voters approved an exit from the E.U., make tax rates and policy in any jurisdiction, including the U.S., U.K. and E.U., subject to significant change. Recent examples include the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development\u2019s (\u201cOECD\u201d) recommendations on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (\u201cBEPS\u201d), the European Commission\u2019s Anti-Tax Avoidance Package, and the U.S. Treasury issuance of proposed SS 385 regulation (debt characterization as equity). The costs of compliance with these laws and regulations are high and are likely to increase in the future. Any failure on our part to comply with these laws and regulations can result in negative publicity and diversion of management time and effort and may subject us to significant liabilities and other penalties.\nWe may be reviewed by antitrust authorities in connection with acquisition opportunities that would increase our number of theatres in markets where we have a leading market share.\nGiven our size and market share, pursuit of acquisition opportunities that would increase the number of our theatres in markets where we have a leading market share would likely result in significant review by antitrust regulators in the applicable jurisdictions, and we may be required to dispose of theatres in order to complete such acquisition opportunities. For example, in connection with the acquisition of Carmike, we are required, among other things, to dispose of 17 theatres located in various markets across the United States to obtain approval of the transaction. As a result, we may not be able to succeed in acquiring other exhibition companies or we may have to dispose of a significant number of theatres in key markets in order to complete such acquisitions.\nWe are subject to substantial government regulation, which could entail significant cost.\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local laws, regulations and administrative practices affecting our business, and we must comply with provisions regulating antitrust, health and sanitation standards, equal employment, environmental, and licensing for the sale of food and, in some theatres, alcoholic beverages. Our new theatre openings could be delayed or prevented or our existing theatres could be impacted by difficulties or failures in our ability to obtain or maintain required approvals or licenses. Changes in existing laws or implementation of new laws, regulations and practices could have a significant impact on our business. A significant portion of our theatre level employees are part time workers who are paid at or near the applicable minimum wage in the theatre\u2019s jurisdiction. Increases in the minimum wage and implementation of reforms requiring the provision of additional benefits will increase our labor costs.\nWe own and operate facilities throughout the United States and are subject to the environmental laws and regulations of those jurisdictions, particularly laws governing the cleanup of hazardous materials and the management of properties. We might in the future be required to participate in the cleanup of a property that we own or lease, or at which we have been alleged to have disposed of hazardous materials from one of our facilities. In certain circumstances, we might be solely responsible for any such liability under environmental laws, and such claims could be material.\nWe are presently cooperating with the relevant governmental authorities in connection with certain Civil Investigative Demands (\u201cCIDs\u201d) received from the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice and from the Attorneys General for the States of Ohio, Texas, Washington, Florida, New York, Kansas and from the District of Columbia concerning potentially anticompetitive conduct, including film clearances and partnering in certain joint ventures. We may receive additional CIDs from antitrust authorities in other jurisdictions in which we operate. If we were found to have violated antitrust laws, it could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.\nOur theatres must comply with Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (\u201cADA\u201d). Compliance with the ADA requires that public accommodations \u201creasonably accommodate\u201d individuals with disabilities and that new construction or alterations made to \u201ccommercial facilities\u201d conform to accessibility guidelines unless \u201cstructurally impracticable\u201d for new construction or technically infeasible for alterations. Non-compliance with the ADA could result in the imposition of injunctive relief, fines, and an award of damages to private litigants or additional capital expenditures to remedy such noncompliance, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to replace our earnings from NCM, or our investment in NCM may otherwise be negatively impacted, as a result of the competitive environment in which NCM operates or our obligation to divest most of our equity interest in NCM.\nWe have maintained an investment in NCM. NCM\u2019s in-theatre advertising operations compete with other cinema advertising companies and other advertising mediums including, most notably, television, newspaper, radio and the Internet. There can be no guarantee that in-theatre advertising will continue to attract major advertisers or that NCM\u2019s in-theatre advertising format will be favorably received by the theatre-going public. If NCM is unable to generate expected sales of advertising, it may not maintain the level of profitability it hopes to achieve, its results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected and our investment in and revenues and dividends from NCM may be adversely impacted.\nOn December 20, 2016, in resolution of a complaint filed by the United States Department of Justice, Antitrust Division, the United States District Court for the District of Columbia issued a Hold Separate Stipulation and Order (the \u201cOrder\u201d) requiring us to divest sufficient interests in NCM to reduce our beneficial ownership to 4.99% on a fully converted basis. Pursuant to the Order, we must decrease our ownership levels on the following schedule:\nIn addition, we agreed to transfer 24 theatres with a total of 384 screens to the Screenvision network, the cinema screen advertising business in which Carmike participates. This includes five Carmike theatres that implemented the Screenvision network prior to completion of the Carmike acquisition, an AMC theatre required to extended its existing term with the Screenvision network, and an AMC theatre that was also included in the divestitures.\nPursuant to the Order, we are enjoined from making any additional acquisitions, directly or indirectly, of ownership interests in NCM except in situations involving an adjustment resulting from annual audience attendance or an acquisition of a movie theatre or movie theatre chain. If our ownership of NCM exceeds the applicable threshold as a result of the situations described above, we will have 90 days to sell down our interests so that their ownership complies with the applicable threshold. As a result of these requirements, we may have to sell portions of our investment in NCM below current market value, we will cease receiving distributions as to the interests we sell, and we may incur significant tax liability. The reinvestment or other uses we make of any proceeds we receive as a result of the sales of our interest in NCM may not generate the same earnings we currently receive from our investment.\nAs a result of our initial public offering, we and certain of our domestic affiliates may not be able to file a consolidated tax return which could result in increased tax liability.\nPrior to our initial public offering, we and certain of our domestic affiliates (the \u201cAMC affiliated tax group\u201d) were members of a consolidated group for federal income tax purposes, of which a Wanda domestic subsidiary is the common parent. As a result of our initial public offering, the AMC affiliated tax group ceased to be members of the Wanda federal consolidated group. The AMC affiliated tax group will not be permitted to file a consolidated return for federal income tax purposes for five years, unless we obtain a waiver from the Internal Revenue Service. It is uncertain whether we will obtain a waiver if we seek one. If we do not obtain a waiver, each member of the AMC affiliated tax group will be required to file a separate federal income tax return, and, as a result, the income (and tax liability) of a member will only be offset by its own tax loss carryforwards (and other tax attributes) and not by tax loss carryforwards, current year losses or other tax attributes of other members of the group. We believe that we should not incur substantial additional federal tax liability if we are not permitted to file a federal consolidated return, because (i) most of our revenues are generated by a single member of the AMC affiliated tax group and most of our tax loss carryforwards are attributable to such member and (ii) there are certain other beneficial aspects of the structure of the AMC affiliated tax group. We cannot assure you, however, that we will not incur substantial additional tax liability if the AMC affiliated tax group is not permitted to file a federal consolidated return for five years.\nWe have had significant financial losses in previous years.\nPrior to fiscal 2007, we had reported net losses in each of the prior nine fiscal years totaling approximately $551.1 million. For fiscal 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, the period March 30, 2012 through August 30, 2012, the period August 31, 2012 through December 31, 2012, the year ended 2013, the year ended 2014, the year ended 2015, and the year ended 2016, we reported net earnings (losses) of $116.9 million, $(6.2) million, $(149.0) million, $79.9 million, $(174.3) million, $(94.1) million, $90.2 million, $(42.7) million, $364.4 million, $64.1 million, $103.9 million and 111.7 million, respectively. If we experience poor financial results in the future, we may be unable to meet our payment obligations while attempting to expand our theatre circuit and withstand competitive pressures or adverse economic conditions.\nGeneral political, social and economic conditions can reduce our attendance.\nOur success depends on general political, social and economic conditions and the willingness of consumers to spend money at movie theatres. If going to motion pictures becomes less popular or consumers spend less on food and\nbeverage, which accounted for 31.5% of our revenues in calendar 2016, our operations could be adversely affected. In addition, our operations could be adversely affected if consumers\u2019 discretionary income falls as a result of an economic downturn. Geopolitical events, including the threat of terrorism or cyber-attacks, could cause people to avoid our theatres or other public places where large crowds are in attendance. In addition, due to our concentration in certain markets, natural disasters such as hurricanes or earthquakes in those markets could adversely affect our overall results of operations.\nWe depend on key personnel for our current and future performance.\nOur current and future performance depends to a significant degree upon the retention of our senior management team and other key personnel. The loss or unavailability to us of any member of our senior management team or a key employee could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot assure you that we would be able to locate or employ qualified replacements for senior management or key employees on acceptable terms.\nOur controlling shareholder owns more than 86% of the combined voting power of our common stock and has significant influence over our corporate management and affairs.\nOur Class B common stock has three votes per share, and our Class A common stock, which is the publicly traded stock, has one vote per share. As of December 31, 2016, Wanda owns 75,826,927 shares of Class B common stock, or 68.83% of our outstanding common stock, representing approximately 86.88% of the voting power of our outstanding common stock. After giving effect to our additional equity offering during February 2017, Wanda owns 57.95% of our outstanding common stock, representing approximately 80.52% of the voting power of our common stock. As such, Wanda has significant influence over our reporting and corporate management and affairs, and, because of the three-to-one voting ratio between our Class B and Class A common stock, Wanda will continue to control a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock and therefore be able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval (including election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, such as mergers) so long as the shares of Class B common stock owned by Wanda and its permitted transferees represent at least 30% of all outstanding shares of our Class A and Class B common stock. The shares of our Class B common stock automatically convert to shares of Class A common stock upon Wanda and its permitted transferees holding less than 30% of all outstanding shares of our Class A and Class B common stock.\nWe may not generate sufficient cash flows or have sufficient restricted payment capacity under our Senior Secured Credit Facility or the indentures governing our debt securities to pay our intended dividends on our Class A common stock.\nSubject to legally available funds, we intend to pay quarterly cash dividends. We will only be able to pay dividends from our available cash on hand and funds received from our subsidiaries. Our subsidiaries' ability to make distributions to us will depend on their ability to generate substantial operating cash flow. Our ability to pay dividends to our stockholders is subject to the terms of our Senior Secured Credit Facility and the indentures governing our outstanding notes. Our operating cash flow and ability to comply with restricted payment covenants in our debt instruments will depend on our future performance, which will be subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business and other factors beyond our control. In addition, dividend payments are not mandatory or guaranteed, and our board of directors may decrease the level of dividends or entirely discontinue the payment of dividends. We may not pay dividends as a result of the following additional factors, among others:\n\u00b7\nwe are not legally or contractually required to pay dividends;\n\u00b7\nwhile we currently intend to pay a regular quarterly dividend, this policy could be modified or revoked at any time;\n\u00b7\neven if we do not modify or revoke our dividend policy, the actual amount of dividends distributed and the decision to make any distribution is entirely at the discretion of our board of directors and future dividends, if any, will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, cash requirements, financial condition, business opportunities, provisions of applicable law and other factors that our board of directors may deem relevant;\n\u00b7\nthe amount of dividends distributed is and will be subject to contractual restrictions under the restrictive payment covenants contained in:\n\u00b7\nthe indentures governing our debt securities,\n\u00b7\nthe terms of our Senior Secured Credit Facility, and\n\u00b7\nthe terms of any other outstanding or future indebtedness incurred by us or any of our subsidiaries;\n\u00b7\nthe amount of dividends distributed is subject to state law restrictions; and\n\u00b7\nour stockholders have no contractual or other legal right to dividends.\nThe maximum amount we would be permitted to distribute in accordance with our Senior Secured Credit Facility and the indentures governing our debt securities was approximately $3.3 billion as of December 31, 2016. As a result of the foregoing limitations on our ability to make distributions, we cannot assure you that we will be able to make all of our intended quarterly dividend payments.\nThere may be future dilution of our Class A common stock, which could adversely affect the market price of shares of our Class A common stock.\nIn the future, we may issue additional shares of Class A common stock to raise cash to refinance indebtedness, for working capital, to finance strategic initiatives and future acquisitions or for other purposes. We may also acquire interests in other companies by using a combination of cash and shares of Class A common stock or just shares of Class A common stock. We may also issue securities convertible into, or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, shares of Class A common stock. Any of these events may dilute the ownership interests of current stockholders, reduce our earnings per share or have an adverse effect on the price of our shares of Class A common stock.\nFuture sales of our Class A common stock in the public market could adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock.\nWe cannot predict the effect, if any, that market sales of shares of our Class A common stock or the availability of shares of our Class A common stock for sale will have on the prevailing market price of our Class A common stock. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our Class A common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales may occur, could reduce the market price of our shares of Class A common stock. As part of the Odeon transaction, we issued to the seller of Odeon 4,536,466 shares of Class A common stock, which may be sold under our existing shelf registration statement. While the Odeon seller has agreed to certain six-month and one-year lockup periods commencing on November 30, 2016, the Odeon seller could sell its shares of our Class A common stock promptly upon the expiration of such lock-up periods, and earlier in certain circumstances. Such sales could reduce the market price of shares of our Class A common stock.\nWanda holds shares of our Class B common stock, all of which constitute \"restricted securities\" under the Securities Act. The shares of our Class B common stock automatically convert to Class A common stock (1) if transferred to a person other than certain permitted transferees or (2) upon Wanda and its permitted transferees holding less than 30% of all outstanding shares of our Class A and Class B common stock. Provided the holders comply with the applicable volume limits and other conditions prescribed in Rule 144 under the Securities Act, all of these restricted securities are currently freely tradeable. Pursuant to a registration rights agreement dated December 23, 2013, we have agreed to use our best efforts to effect registered offerings upon request from Wanda and to grant incidental or \"piggyback\" registration rights with respect to any registrable securities held by Wanda. The obligation to effect any demand for registration by Wanda will be subject to certain conditions, including limitations on the number of demand registrations and limitations on the minimum value of securities to be registered. We have also agreed to use our best efforts to grant certain incidental or \"piggyback\" registration rights with respect to securities issued to the seller of Odeon and securities issued to certain current and former officers. The exercise of such registration rights by Wanda, the seller of Odeon and/or the current and former officers may substantially increase the number of shares of Class A common stock in the public market and could reduce the market price of shares of our Class A common stock.\nWe have elected to take advantage of the \"controlled company\" exemption to the corporate governance rules for publicly-listed companies, which could make our Class A common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price.\nBecause we qualify as a \"controlled company\" under the corporate governance rules for publicly-listed companies, we are not required to have a majority of our board of directors be independent, nor are we required to have a compensation committee or an independent nominating function. In light of our status as a controlled company, our board of directors has determined not to have a majority of our board of directors be independent, have a compensation committee composed solely of independent directors or have an independent nominating function and has chosen to have the full board of directors be directly responsible for nominating members of our board. Accordingly, should the interests of Wanda, as our controlling stockholder, differ from those of other stockholders, the other stockholders may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance rules for publicly-listed companies. Our status as a controlled company could make our Class A common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price.\nOur controlling shareholder owns more than 86% of the combined voting power of our common stock and has significant influence over our corporate management and affairs.\nOur Class B common stock has three votes per share, and our Class A common stock, which is the publicly traded stock, has one vote per share. As of December 31, 2016, Wanda owns 75,826,927 shares of Class B common stock, or 68.83% of our outstanding common stock, representing approximately 86.88% of the voting power of our outstanding common stock. As such, Wanda has significant influence over our reporting and corporate management and affairs, and, because of the three-to-one voting ratio between our Class B and Class A common stock, Wanda will continue to control a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock and therefore be able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval (including election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, such as mergers) so long as the shares of Class B common stock owned by Wanda and its permitted transferees represent at least 30% of all outstanding shares of our Class A and Class B common stock. The shares of our Class B common stock automatically convert to shares of Class A common stock upon Wanda and its permitted transferees holding less than 30% of all outstanding shares of our Class A and Class B common stock.\nThe super voting rights of our Class B common stock and other anti-takeover protections in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws may discourage or prevent a takeover of our Company, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders.\nProvisions contained in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, as amended, as well as provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law and the supermajority rights of our Class B common stockholder, could delay or make it more difficult to remove incumbent directors or for a third party to acquire us, even if a takeover would benefit our stockholders. These provisions include:\n\u00b7\na dual class common stock structure, which provides Wanda with the ability to control the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval, even if they own significantly less than a majority of the shares of our outstanding Class A and Class B common stock;\n\u00b7\na classified board of directors;\n\u00b7\nthe sole power of a majority of the board of directors to fix the number of directors;\n\u00b7\nlimitations on the removal of directors;\n\u00b7\nthe sole power of the board of directors to fill any vacancy on the board of directors, whether such vacancy occurs as a result of an increase in the number of directors or otherwise;\n\u00b7\nthe ability of our board of directors to designate one or more series of preferred stock and issue shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval; and\n\u00b7\nthe inability of stockholders to call special meetings.\nOur issuance of shares of preferred stock could delay or prevent a change of control of our company. Our board of directors has the authority to cause us to issue, without any further vote or action by the stockholders, up to 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01 per share, in one or more series, to designate the number of shares constituting any series, and to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions thereof, including dividend rights, voting rights, rights and terms of redemption, redemption price or prices and liquidation preferences of such series. The issuance of shares of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of our company without further action by the stockholders, even where stockholders are offered a premium for their shares.\nOur incorporation under Delaware law, the ability of our board of directors to create and issue a new series of preferred stock or a stockholder rights plan and certain other provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, as amended, could impede a merger, takeover or other business combination involving our company or the replacement of our management or discourage a potential investor from making a tender offer for our Class A common stock, which, under certain circumstances, could reduce the market value of our Class A common stock.\nOur issuance of preferred stock could dilute the voting power of the common stockholders and adversely affect the market value of our Class A common stock.\nThe issuance of shares of preferred stock with voting rights may adversely affect the voting power of the holders of our other classes of voting stock either by diluting the voting power of our other classes of voting stock if they vote together as a single class, or by giving the holders of any such preferred stock the right to block an action on which they have a separate class vote even if the action were approved by the holders of our other classes of voting stock.\nIn addition, the issuance of shares of preferred stock with dividend or conversion rights, liquidation preferences or other economic terms favorable to the holders of preferred stock could adversely affect the market price for our Class A common stock by making an investment in the common stock less attractive. For example, investors may not wish to purchase Class A common stock at a price above the conversion price of a series of convertible preferred stock because the holders of the preferred stock would effectively be entitled to purchase Class A common stock at the lower conversion price causing economic dilution to the holders of Class A common stock.", "PERMNO": 14328, "SIC": 7830, "TIC": "AMC"}
