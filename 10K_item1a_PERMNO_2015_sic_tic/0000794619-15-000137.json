RISK FACTORS\nThere are a number of business risks and uncertainties that may affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. These risks and uncertainties could cause future results to differ from past performance or expected results, including results described in statements elsewhere in this report that constitute \"forward-looking statements\" under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to the Company or currently believed to be immaterial also may adversely impact the Company\u2019s business. Should any risks or uncertainties develop into actual events, these developments could have material adverse effects on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations. These risks and uncertainties, which the Company considers to be most relevant to specific business activities, include, but are not limited to, the following, as well as additional risk factors included in Item 7A, \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.\" Additional risks and uncertainties that may affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition are discussed elsewhere in this report, including in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d under the headings \u201cForward-Looking Statements,\u201d \u201cSeasonality,\u201d and \u201cOutlook for Fiscal 2016.\u201d\nThe Company\u2019s business is dependent upon remodeling activity and residential construction. The Company\u2019s results of operations are affected by levels of home improvement and residential construction activity, including repair and remodeling and new construction. Job creation levels, interest rates, availability of credit, energy costs, consumer confidence, national and regional economic conditions, and weather conditions and natural disasters can significantly impact levels of home improvement and residential construction activity.\nProlonged economic downturns may adversely impact the Company\u2019s sales, earnings and liquidity. The Company\u2019s industry historically has been cyclical in nature and has fluctuated with economic cycles. During economic downturns, the Company\u2019s industry could experience longer periods of recession and greater declines than the general economy. The Company believes that its industry is significantly influenced by economic conditions generally and particularly by housing activity, consumer confidence, the level of personal discretionary spending, demographics and credit availability. These factors not only may affect the ultimate consumer of the Company\u2019s products, but also may impact home centers, builders and the Company\u2019s other primary customers. As a result, a worsening of economic conditions could adversely affect the Company\u2019s sales and earnings as well as its cash flow and liquidity.\nThe Company\u2019s future financial performance depends in part on the success of its new product development and other growth strategies. The Company has increased its emphasis on new product development in recent years and continues to focus solely on organic growth. Consequently, the Company\u2019s financial performance will, in part, reflect its success in implementing its growth strategies in its existing markets and in introducing new products.\nThe loss of, or a reduction in business from, either of the Company\u2019s key customers would have a material adverse effect upon its business. The size and importance to the Company of its two largest customers are significant. These customers could make significant changes in their volume of purchases and could otherwise significantly affect the terms and conditions on which the Company does business. Sales to The Home Depot and Lowe\u2019s Companies, Inc. were approximately 45% of total company sales for fiscal 2015. Although builders, dealers, and other retailers represent other channels of distribution for the Company's products, an unplanned loss of a substantial portion of sales to The Home Depot or Lowe\u2019s Companies, Inc. would have a material adverse impact on the Company.\nManufacturing expansion to add capacity could result in a decrease in the Company\u2019s near-term earnings. The Company continually reviews its manufacturing operations. These reviews could result in the expansion of capacity, functions, systems, or procedures, which in turn could result in inefficiencies for a period that would decrease near-term earnings until the additional capacity is in place and fully operating. In addition, downturns in the economy could potentially have a larger impact on the Company as a result of this added capacity.\nImpairment charges could reduce the Company\u2019s profitability. The Company has significant long-lived assets, including deferred tax assets, recorded on its balance sheets. If operating results decline or if the Company decides to restructure its operations as it did with the 2012 Restructuring Plan, the Company could incur impairment charges, which could have a material impact on its financial results. The Company evaluates the recoverability of the carrying amount of its long-lived assets on an ongoing basis. The outcome of future reviews could result in substantial impairment charges. Impairment assessments inherently involve judgments as to assumptions about market conditions and the Company\u2019s ability to generate future cash flows and profitability, given those assumptions. Future events and changing market conditions may impact the Company\u2019s assumptions as to prices, costs or other factors that may result in changes in the Company\u2019s estimates.\nThe Company\u2019s operating results are affected by the cost and availability of raw materials. Because the Company is dependent on outside suppliers for raw material needs, it must obtain sufficient quantities of quality raw materials from its suppliers at acceptable prices and in a timely manner. The Company has no long-term supply contracts with its key suppliers. A substantial decrease in the availability of products from the Company\u2019s suppliers, the loss of key supplier arrangements, or a substantial increase in the cost of its raw materials could adversely impact the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe Company may not be able to maintain or raise the prices of its products in response to inflation and increasing costs. Short-term market and competitive pressures may prohibit the Company from raising prices to offset inflationary raw material and freight costs, which would adversely impact profit margins.\nThe Company's operations may be adversely affected by information systems interruptions or intrusions. The Company relies on a number of information technology systems to process, transmit, store and manage information to support its business activities. Increased global cybersecurity vulnerabilities, threats and more sophisticated and targeted attacks pose a risk to its information technology systems. The Company has established security policies, processes and layers of defense designed to help identify and protect against intentional and unintentional misappropriation or corruption of its systems and information and disruption of its operations. Despite these efforts, systems may be damaged, disrupted, or shut down due to attacks by unauthorized access, malicious software, undetected intrusion, hardware failures, or other events, and in these circumstances the Company's disaster recovery planning may be ineffective or inadequate. These breaches or intrusions could lead to business interruption, exposure of proprietary or confidential information, data corruption, damage to the Company's reputation, exposure to litigation, and increased operational costs. Such events could have a material adverse impact on the Company's business, financial condition and results of operation. In addition, the Company could be adversely affected if any of its significant customers or suppliers experience any similar events that disrupt their business operations or damage their reputation.", "PERMNO": 10501, "SIC": 2430, "TIC": "AMWD"}
