RISK FACTORS\nOperational Risks\nThe economic impact of the COVID-19 outbreak could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 coronavirus pandemic has caused economic and social disruption on an unprecedented scale. While some industries have been impacted more severely than others, all businesses have been impacted to some degree. Industries that have been particularly hard-hit include the travel and hospitality industry, the restaurant industry and the retail industry. This disruption has resulted in the shuttering of businesses and schools across the country, significant job loss, restrictions on travel and social distancing protocols, highly volatile financial markets and aggressive measures by the federal government. The spread of the coronavirus has also caused us to modify our business practices, including employee travel, employee work locations, and cancellation of physical participation in meetings, events and conferences. While almost all our employees are currently working onsite, we have many employees prepared to work remotely if required as per action by government authorities or if we determine that it is in the best interests of our employees, customers and business partners. Significant progress has been made to combat the outbreak of COVID-19; however, the global pandemic has adversely impacted a broad range of industries in which the Company\u2019s customers operate and could still impair their ability to fulfill their financial obligations to the Company.\nGiven the ongoing and dynamic nature of the circumstances, it is difficult to predict the full impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on our business. The extent of such impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain, including when the coronavirus can be controlled and abated and when and how the economy may be reopened. As the result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the related adverse local and national economic consequences, we could be subject to any of the following risks, any of which could have a material, adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations:\n\u2022\ndemand for our products and services may decline, making it difficult to grow assets and income;\n\u2022\nif the economy is unable to substantially reopen, and high levels of unemployment continue for an extended period of time, loan delinquencies, problem assets, and foreclosures may increase, resulting in increased charges and reduced income;\n\u2022\ncollateral for loans, especially real estate, may decline in value, which could cause loan losses to increase;\n\u2022\nlimitations may be placed on our ability to foreclose on properties during the pandemic;\n\u2022\nour allowance for loan losses may have to be increased if borrowers experience financial difficulties beyond forbearance periods, which will adversely affect our net income;\n\u2022\nthe net worth and liquidity of loan guarantors may decline, impairing their ability to honor commitments to us;\n\u2022\nas the result of the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s target federal funds rate of 1.50% to 1.75% at June 30, 2022, the yield on our assets may decline to a greater extent than the decline in our cost of interest-bearing liabilities, reducing our net interest margin and spread and reducing net income;\n\u2022\nour cyber security risks are increased as the result of an increase in the number of employees working remotely;\n\u2022\na worsening of business and economic conditions or in the financial markets could result in an impairment of certain intangible assets, such as goodwill;\n\u2022\nlitigation, regulatory enforcement risk and reputation risk regarding our participation in the PPP and the risk that the SBA may not fund some or all PPP loan guaranties;\n\u2022\nthe unanticipated loss or unavailability of key employees due to the outbreak, which could harm our ability to operate our business or execute our business strategy, especially as we may not be successful in finding and integrating suitable successors;\n\u2022\nwe rely on third party vendors for certain services and the unavailability of a critical service due to the COVID-19 outbreak could have an adverse effect on us; and\n\u2022\nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation premiums may increase if the agency experience additional resolution costs;\nMoreover, our future success and profitability substantially depends on the management skills of our executive officers and directors, many of whom have held officer and director positions with us for many years. The unanticipated loss or unavailability of key employees due to the outbreak could harm our ability to operate our business or execute our business strategy. We may not be successful in finding and integrating suitable successors in the event of key employee loss or unavailability.\nAny one or a combination of the factors identified above could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations and prospects.\nWe intend to continue to grow our commercial real estate, multi-family and commercial business loans and increase these loans as a percentage of our total loan portfolio. As a result, our credit risk will continue to increase, and downturns in the local real estate market or economy could have a more severe adverse effect on our earnings.\nWe intend to continue growing our portfolio of commercial real estate, multi-family and commercial business loans. Since our mutual-to-stock conversion in 2011 we have emphasized the origination of our commercial loans. At June 30, 2022, $167.4 million, or 31.8%, of our total loan portfolio consisted of commercial real estate loans, $88.2 million, or 16.8%, of our total loan portfolio consisted of multi-family loans, and $80.4 million, or 15.3%, of our total loan portfolio consisted of commercial business loans. We expect each of these loan categories to continue to increase as a percentage of our total loan portfolio. Commercial real estate, multi-family and commercial business loans generally have more risk than the one- to four-family residential real estate loans that we originate. Because the repayment of commercial real estate, multi-family and commercial business loans depends on the successful management and operation of the borrower\u2019s properties or businesses, repayment of such loans can be affected by adverse conditions in the local real estate market or economy. Commercial real estate, multi-family and commercial business loans may also involve relatively large loan balances to individual borrowers or groups of related borrowers. In addition, a downturn in the real estate market or the local economy could adversely affect the value of properties securing the loan or the revenues from the borrower\u2019s business, thereby increasing the risk of nonperforming loans. As our commercial real estate, multi-family and commercial business loan portfolios increase, the corresponding risks and potential for losses from these loans may also increase.\nOur funding sources may prove insufficient to replace deposits and support our future growth.\nWe must maintain sufficient funds to respond to the needs of depositors and borrowers. As a part of our liquidity management, we use a number of funding sources in addition to core deposit growth and repayments and maturities of loans and investments. These additional sources consist primarily of FHLB advances, certificates of deposit and brokered certificates of deposit and, to a lesser extent, repurchase agreements. As we continue to grow, we are likely to become more dependent on these sources. Adverse operating results or changes in industry conditions could lead to difficulty or an inability to access these additional funding sources. Our financial flexibility will be severely constrained if we are unable to maintain our access to funding or if adequate financing is not available to accommodate future growth at acceptable interest rates. If we are required to rely more heavily on more expensive funding sources to support future growth, our revenues may not increase proportionately to cover our costs. In this case, our operating margins and profitability would be adversely affected.\nA portion of our loan portfolio consists of loan participations secured by properties outside of our primary market area. Loan participations may have a higher risk of loss than loans we originate because we are not the lead lender and we have limited control over credit monitoring.\nWe occasionally purchase loan participations secured by properties outside of our primary market area in which we are not the lead lender. Although we underwrite these loan participations consistent with our general underwriting criteria, loan participations may have a higher risk of loss than loans we originate because we rely on the lead lender to monitor the performance of the loan. Moreover, our decision regarding the classification of a loan participation and loan loss provisions associated with a loan participation is made in part based upon information provided by the lead lender. A lead lender also may not monitor a participation loan in the same manner as we would for loans that we originate. At June 30, 2022, our loan participations totaled $30.0 million, or 5.7% of our gross loans, most of which are within 100 miles of our primary lending market and consist primarily of multi-family, commercial real estate and commercial loans.\nAdditionally, we expect to continue to use loan participations as a way to effectively deploy our capital. If our underwriting of these participation loans is not sufficient, our non-performing loans may increase and our earnings may decrease.\nIf our non-performing loans and other non-performing assets increase, or the value of our foreclosed assets decreases our earnings will decrease.\nAt June 30, 2022, our non-performing assets (which consist of non-accrual loans, loans 90 days or more delinquent and still accruing, and real estate owned) totaled $1.3 million. Our non-performing assets adversely affect our net income in various ways. We do not record interest income on non-accrual loans, and we must establish reserves or take charge-offs for probable losses on non-performing loans. Reserves are established through a current period charge to income in the provision for loan losses. There are also legal fees associated with the resolution of problem assets.\nFurther, the resolution of non-performing assets requires the active involvement of management, which can distract us from the overall supervision of operations and other income-producing activities of Iroquois Federal. Finally, if our estimate of the allowance for loan losses is inadequate, we will have to increase the allowance accordingly by recording a provision for loan losses.\nIf our allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings will decrease.\nOur customers may not repay their loans according to the original terms, and the collateral, if any, securing the payment of these loans may be insufficient to pay any remaining loan balance. We may experience significant loan losses, which may have a material adverse effect on our operating results. We make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans. In determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses, we review our loans and our loss and delinquency experience, and we evaluate economic conditions. If our assumptions are incorrect, our allowance for loan losses may not be sufficient to cover probable losses in our loan portfolio, requiring us to make additions to our allowance for loan losses. Our allowance for loan losses was 1.34% of total loans at June 30, 2022. Additions to our allowance could materially decrease our net income.\nThe Financial Accounting Standards Board has delayed the effective date of the Current Expected Credit Loss, or CECL, standard. After transition modeling for a couple years and validating our CECL model, we adopted CECL effective July 1, 2022. CECL will require financial institutions to determine periodic estimates of lifetime expected credit losses on loans, and recognize the expected credit losses as allowances for credit losses. This will change the current method of providing allowances for loan losses that are incurred or probable, which would likely require us to increase our allowance for credit losses, and to greatly increase the types of data we would need to collect and review to determine the appropriate level of the allowance for credit losses.\nIn addition, bank regulators periodically review our allowance for loan losses and, as a result of such reviews, we may be required to increase our allowance for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs. Any increase in our allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs as required by these regulatory authorities may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to stringent capital requirements, which may adversely impact our return on equity, require us to raise additional capital, or limit our ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares.\nFederal regulations establish minimum capital requirements for insured depository institutions, including minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios, and defines \u201ccapital\u201d for calculating these ratios. The application of these capital requirements could, among other things, result in lower returns on equity, and result in regulatory actions if we are unable to comply with such requirements. In addition, our ability to pay dividends to could be limited if we do not meet a minimum capital conservation buffer required by the capital rules. See \u201cRegulation and Supervision-Federal Banking Regulation-Capital Requirements.\u201d\nChanges in accounting standards could affect reported earnings.\nThe bodies responsible for establishing accounting standards, including the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the Securities and Exchange Commission and other regulatory bodies, periodically change the financial accounting and reporting guidance that governs the preparation of our financial statements. These changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply new or revised guidance retroactively.\nWe face significant operational risks because the financial services business involves a high volume of transactions.\nWe operate in diverse markets and rely on the ability of our employees and systems to process a high number of transactions. Operational risk is the risk of loss resulting from our operations, including but not limited to, the risk of fraud by employees or persons outside our company, the execution of unauthorized transactions by employees, errors relating to transaction processing and technology, breaches of our internal control systems and compliance requirements, and business continuation and disaster recovery. Insurance coverage may not be available for such losses, or where available, such losses may exceed insurance limits. This risk of loss also includes the potential legal actions that could arise as a result of operational deficiencies or as a result of non-compliance with applicable regulatory standards or customer attrition due to potential negative publicity. In the event of a breakdown in our internal control systems, improper operation of systems or improper employee actions, we could suffer financial loss, face regulatory action, and/or suffer damage to our reputation.\nCyber-attacks or other security breaches could adversely affect our operations, net income or reputation.\nWe regularly collect, process, transmit and store significant amounts of confidential information regarding our customers, employees and others and concerning our own business, operations, plans and strategies. In some cases, this confidential or proprietary information is collected, compiled, processed, transmitted or stored by third parties on our behalf.\nInformation security risks have generally increased in recent years because of the proliferation of new technologies, the use of the Internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial and other transactions and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyber-attacks and mobile phishing. Mobile phishing, a means for identity thieves to obtain sensitive personal information through fraudulent e-mail, text or voice mail, is an emerging threat targeting the customers of popular financial entities. A failure in or breach of our operational or information security systems, or those of our third-party service providers, as a result of cyber-attacks or information security breaches or due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions could adversely affect our business, result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, damage our reputation, increase our costs and/or cause losses.\nIf this confidential or proprietary information were to be mishandled, misused or lost, we could be exposed to significant regulatory consequences, reputational damage, civil litigation and financial loss.\nAlthough we employ a variety of physical, procedural and technological safeguards to protect this confidential and proprietary information from mishandling, misuse or loss, these safeguards do not provide absolute assurance that mishandling, misuse or loss of the information will not occur, and that if mishandling, misuse or loss of information does occur, those events will be promptly detected and addressed. Similarly, when confidential or proprietary information is collected, compiled, processed, transmitted or stored by third parties on our behalf, our policies and procedures require that the third party agree to maintain the confidentiality of the information, establish and maintain policies and procedures designed to preserve the confidentiality of the information, and permit us to confirm the third party\u2019s compliance with the terms of the agreement. As information security risks and cyber threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend additional resources to continue to enhance our information security measures and/or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities.\nRisks associated with system failures, interruptions, or breaches of security could negatively affect our earnings.\nInformation technology systems are critical to our business. We use various technology systems to manage our customer relationships, general ledger, securities, deposits, and loans. We have established policies and procedures to prevent or limit the impact of system failures, interruptions, and security breaches, but such events may still occur and may not be adequately addressed if they do occur. In addition, any compromise of our systems could deter customers from using our products and services. Although we rely on security systems to provide security and authentication necessary to effect the secure transmission of data, these precautions may not protect our systems from compromises or breaches of security.\nIn addition, we outsource some of our data processing to certain third-party providers. If these third-party providers encounter difficulties, or if we have difficulty communicating with them, our ability to adequately process and account for transactions could be affected, and our business operations could be adversely affected. Threats to information security also exist in the processing of customer information through various other vendors and their personnel.\nThe occurrence of any systems failures, interruptions, or breach of security could damage our reputation and result in a loss of customers and business thereby subjecting us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or could expose us to litigation and possible financial liability. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nMarket and Industry Risks\nA continuation of the historically low interest rate environment and the possibility that we may access higher-cost funds to support our loan growth and operations may adversely affect our net interest income and profitability.\nIn recent years the Federal Reserve Board\u2019s policy has been to maintain interest rates at historically low levels through its targeted federal funds rate and the purchase of mortgage-backed securities. Our ability to reduce our interest expense may be limited at current interest rate levels while the average yield on our interest-earning assets may continue to decrease, and our interest expense may increase as we access non-core funding sources or increase deposit rates to fund our operations. A continuation of a low interest rate environment or an increase in our cost of funds may adversely affect our net interest income, which would have an adverse effect on our profitability.\nFuture changes in interest rates could reduce our profits.\nOur profitability largely depends on our net interest income, which can be negatively affected by changes in interest rates. Net interest income is the difference between:\n\u2022\nthe interest income we earn on our interest-earning assets, such as loans and securities; and\n\u2022\nthe interest expense we incur on our interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings.\nThe interest rates on our loans are generally fixed for a longer period of time than the interest rates on our deposits. Like many savings institutions, our focus on deposits as a source of funds, which either have no stated maturity or shorter contractual maturities than mortgage loans, results in our liabilities having a shorter average duration than our assets. For example, as of June 30, 2022, 9.2% of our loans had remaining maturities of, or reprice after, 5 years or longer, while 87.3% of our certificates of deposit had remaining maturities of, or reprice in, one year or less. This imbalance can create significant earnings volatility because market interest rates change over time. In a period of rising interest rates, the interest we earn on our assets, such as loans and investments, may not increase as rapidly as the interest we pay on our liabilities, such as deposits. In a period of declining market interest rates, the interest income we earn on our assets may decrease more rapidly than the interest expense we incur on our liabilities, as borrowers prepay mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities and callable investment securities are called or prepaid, thereby requiring us to reinvest these cash flows at lower interest rates. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Management of Market Risk.\u201d\nAny substantial, unexpected, prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations. Changes in the level of interest rates also may negatively affect the value of our assets and ultimately affect our earnings.\nWe evaluate interest rate sensitivity using a model that estimates the change in our net portfolio value over a range of interest rate scenarios, also known as a \u201crate shock\u201d analysis. Net portfolio value is the discounted present value of expected cash flows from assets, liabilities and off-balance sheet contracts. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Management of Market Risk.\u201d\nIncreased interest rates and changes in secondary mortgage market conditions could reduce our earnings from our mortgage banking operations.\nOur mortgage banking income varies with movements in interest rates, and increases in interest rates could negatively affect our ability to originate loans in the same volume as we have in past years. In addition to being affected by interest rates, the secondary mortgage markets are also subject to investor demand for residential mortgage loans and increased investor yield requirements for these loans. These conditions may fluctuate or worsen in the future. In light of current conditions, there is greater risk in retaining mortgage loans pending their sale to investors. As a result, a prolonged period of secondary market illiquidity may reduce our loan mortgage production volume and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe State of Illinois has significant financial difficulties, and this could adversely impact certain of our borrowers and the economic vitality of the state, which would have a negative impact on our business.\nThe State of Illinois has significant financial difficulties, including material pension funding shortfalls. Although the State of Illinois\u2019 debt rating has been recently upgraded, it remains the lowest in the country. These issues could impact the economic vitality of the state and the businesses operating there, encourage businesses to leave the State of Illinois, discourage new employers from starting or moving businesses to the state, and could result in an increase in the Illinois state income tax rate. In addition, population outflow from the State of Illinois could affect our ability to attract and retain customers.\nSome of the markets we are in include significant university and healthcare presence, which rely heavily on state funding and contracts. Payment delays by the State of Illinois to its vendors and government sponsored entities may have significant, negative effects on our markets, which could in turn adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, adverse changes in agribusiness and capital goods exports could materially adversely affect downstate Illinois markets, which are heavily reliant upon these industries. Delays in the payment of accounts receivable owed to borrowers that are employed by or who do business with these industries or the State of Illinois could impair their ability to repay their loans when due and negatively impact our business.\nA worsening of economic conditions in our market area could reduce demand for our products and services and/or result in increases in our level of non-performing loans, which could adversely affect our operations, financial condition and earnings.\nLocal economic conditions have a significant impact on the ability of our borrowers to repay loans and the value of the collateral securing loans. A deterioration in economic conditions, especially local conditions, as a result of COVID-19 or otherwise, could have the following consequences, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity and results of operations, and could more negatively affect us compare to a financial institution that operates with more geographic diversity:\n\u2022\ndemand for our products and services may decline;\n\u2022\nloan delinquencies, problem assets and foreclosures may increase;\n\u2022\ncollateral for loans, especially real estate, may decline in value, thereby reducing customers\u2019 future borrowing power, and reducing the value of assets and collateral associated with existing loans; and\n\u2022\nthe net worth and liquidity of loan guarantors may decline, impairing their ability to honor commitments to us.\nMoreover, a significant decline in general economic conditions caused by inflation, recession, acts of terrorism, an outbreak of hostilities or other international or domestic calamities, an epidemic or pandemic, unemployment or other factors beyond our control could further impact these local economic conditions and could further negatively affect the financial results of our banking operations. In addition, deflationary pressures, while possibly lowering our operating costs, could have a significant negative effect on our borrowers, especially our business borrowers, and the values of underlying collateral securing loans, which could negatively affect our financial performance.\nMonetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition to being affected by general economic conditions, our earnings and growth are affected by the policies of the Federal Reserve Board. An important function of the Federal Reserve Board is to regulate the money supply and credit conditions. Among the instruments used by the Federal Reserve Board to implement these objectives are open market purchases and sales of U.S. government securities, adjustments of the discount rate and changes in banks\u2019 reserve requirements against bank deposits. These instruments are used in varying combinations to influence overall economic growth and the distribution of credit, bank loans, investments and deposits. Their use also affects interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits.\nThe monetary policies and regulations of the Federal Reserve Board have had a significant effect on the operating results of financial institutions in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. The effects of such policies upon our business, financial condition and results of operations cannot be predicted.\nStrong traditional and non-traditional competition within our market areas may limit our growth and profitability.\nWe face intense competition in making loans and attracting deposits. Price competition from other financial institutions, credit unions, money market and mutual funds, insurance companies, and other non-traditional competitors such as financial technology companies for loans and deposits sometimes results in us charging lower interest rates on our loans and paying higher interest rates on our deposits and may reduce our net interest income. Competition also makes it more difficult and costly to attract and retain qualified employees. Many of the institutions with which we compete have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we have and may offer services that we do not provide. Our competitors also may price loan and deposit products aggressively when they enter into new lines of business or new market areas. We expect competition to increase in the future as a result of legislative, regulatory, and technological changes and the continuing trend of consolidation in the financial services industry. If we are not able to compete effectively in our market area, our profitability may be negatively affected. The greater resources and broader offering of deposit and loan products of some of our competitors may also limit our ability to increase our interest-earning assets.\nGovernment responses to economic conditions may adversely affect our operations, financial condition and earnings.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act has changed the bank regulatory framework, created an independent consumer protection bureau that has assumed the consumer protection responsibilities of the various federal banking agencies, and established more stringent capital standards for savings associations and savings and loan holding companies, subject to a transition period. Bank regulatory agencies also have been responding aggressively to concerns and adverse trends identified in examinations. Ongoing uncertainty and adverse developments in the financial services industry and the domestic and international credit markets, and the effect of the Dodd-Frank Act and regulatory actions, may adversely affect our operations by restricting our business activities, including our ability to originate or sell loans, modify loan terms, or foreclose on property securing loans. These risks could affect the performance and value of our loan and investment securities portfolios, which also would negatively affect our financial performance.\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, supervision, and examination by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Federal regulations govern the activities in which we may engage, and are primarily for the protection of depositors and the Deposit Insurance Fund. These regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on the operations of a savings association, the classification of assets by a savings association, and the adequacy of a savings association\u2019s allowance for loan losses. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations or legislation, could have a material impact on our results of operations. Because our business is highly regulated, the laws, rules and applicable regulations are subject to regular modification and change. Any legislative, regulatory or policy changes adopted in the future could make compliance more difficult or expensive or otherwise adversely affect our business, financial condition or prospects. Further, we expect any such new laws, rules or regulations will add to our compliance costs and place additional demands on our management team.\nNon-compliance with the USA PATRIOT Act, Bank Secrecy Act, or other laws and regulations could result in fines or sanctions.\nThe USA PATRIOT and Bank Secrecy Acts require financial institutions to develop programs to prevent financial institutions from being used for money laundering and terrorist activities. If such activities are suspected, financial institutions are obligated to file suspicious activity reports with the U.S. Treasury\u2019s Office of Financial Crimes Enforcement Network. These rules require financial institutions to establish procedures for identifying and verifying the identity of customers seeking to open new financial accounts. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in fines or sanctions, including restrictions on pursuing acquisitions or establishing new branches. The policies and procedures we have adopted that are designed to assist in compliance with these laws and regulations may not be effective in preventing violations of these laws and regulations. Furthermore, these rules and regulations continue to evolve and expand. We have not been subject to fines or other penalties, or have suffered business or reputational harm, as a result of money laundering activities in the past.\nLegal and regulatory proceedings and related matters could adversely affect us.\nWe have been and may in the future become involved in legal and regulatory proceedings. We consider most of the proceedings to be in the normal course of our business or typical for the industry; however, it is inherently difficult to assess the outcome of these matters, and we may not prevail in any proceedings or litigation. There could be substantial costs and management diversion in such litigation and proceedings, and any adverse determination could have a materially adverse effect on our business, brand or image, or our financial condition and results of our operations.\nSocietal responses to climate change could adversely affect our business and performance, including indirectly through impacts on our customers.\nConcerns over the long-term impacts of climate change have led and will continue to lead to governmental efforts around the world to mitigate those impacts. Consumers and businesses also may change their behavior on their own as a result of these concerns. We and our customers will need to respond to new laws and regulations as well as consumer and business preferences resulting from climate change concerns. We and our customers may face cost increases, asset value reductions, operating process changes, and the like. The impact on our customers will likely vary depending on their specific attributes, including reliance on or role in carbon intensive activities. Among the impacts to us could be a drop in demand for our products and services, particularly in certain sectors. In addition, we could face reductions in creditworthiness on the part of some customers or in the value of assets securing loans. Our efforts to take these risks into account in making lending and other decisions, including by increasing our business with climate-friendly companies, may not be effective in protecting us from the negative impact of new laws and regulations or changes in consumer or business behavior.", "PERMNO": 12920, "SIC": 6035, "TIC": "IROQ"}
