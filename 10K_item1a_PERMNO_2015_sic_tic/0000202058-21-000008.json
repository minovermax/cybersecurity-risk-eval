RISK FACTORS.\nWe have described many of the trends and other factors that we believe could impact our business and future results in \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d of this Report. In addition, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and equity are subject to, and could be materially adversely affected by, various risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation, those set forth below, any one of which could cause our actual results to vary materially from recent results or our anticipated future results.\nCOVID-Related Risks\nCOVID and ongoing attempts to contain and reduce its spread could have a material adverse effect on our business operations, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and equity.\nCOVID, which in fiscal 2020 was recognized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization and declared a national emergency by the U.S. Government, and ongoing attempts to contain and reduce its spread, such as mandatory closures, \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d orders and travel and quarantine restrictions, have caused significant volatility, uncertainty, disruption and other adverse effects on the U.S. and global economies, including impacts to supply chains, customer demand, international trade and capital markets. These effects have adversely affected certain of our business operations, may further adversely affect our business operations and may materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and equity.\nOur response to COVID and related impacts has involved increasing our focus on keeping our employees safe while striving to maintain continuity of operations, meet customer commitments and support suppliers. For example, we instituted work-from-home (for employees who are able to work remotely) and social distancing arrangements; canceled travel and external events; procured personal protective equipment for employees; implemented health screening procedures at all facilities; staggered work shifts, redesigned work stations, implemented stringent cleaning protocols and initiated more detailed safety precautions and protocols for on-site work, such as daily health assessments and mandatory face coverings, which currently remain in effect. We also have maintained an active dialog with key suppliers and developed plans to mitigate supply chain risks. We have allowed certain essential business travel to resume and continue to expect to utilize a phased approach based on local conditions for transitioning employees from work-from-home arrangements to on-site work. The U.S. Government response has included identifying the defense industrial base as a Critical Infrastructure Sector and enhancing cash flow and liquidity for the Defense Industrial Base, such as by increasing progress payments and accelerating contract awards. As a part of the Defense Industrial Base, these actions have enabled us to keep our U.S. production facilities largely operational in support of national security commitments to U.S. Government customers and to accelerate payments to small business suppliers, which we expect to continue while the U.S. Government\u2019s responsive actions remain in effect.\nAlthough we believe that the large percentage of our revenue, earnings and cash flow that is derived from sales to the U.S. Government, both directly and through prime contractors, will be relatively predictable, in part due to the responsive actions taken by the U.S. Government described above, our commercial, international and public safety businesses have experienced adverse COVID-related impacts and remain at a higher risk of further adverse COVID-related impacts. For example, the severe decline in global air traffic from travel restrictions and the resulting downturn in the commercial aviation market and its impact on customer\noperations has significantly reduced demand for flight training, flight simulators and commercial avionics products in our Aviation Systems segment\u2019s Commercial Aviation Solutions sector. As a result, we temporarily, and in some circumstances permanently, closed, or will soon close, some of our flight training facilities, initiated restructuring and other actions to align resources with the outlook for the commercial aviation market (including workforce reduction and facility consolidation) and also recognized $767 million of charges for impairment of goodwill and other assets and other COVID-related impacts in fiscal 2020.\nWe are continuing to closely monitor COVID-related impacts on all aspects of our business and geographies, including on our workforce, supply chain and customers. We may continue to or further restrict operations of our facilities if we deem it necessary or if recommended or mandated by governmental authorities, and we may experience further volatility in the overall demand environment for our products, systems and services, any of which would have a further adverse impact on us. Our management\u2019s focus on mitigating COVID-related impacts has required and will continue to require a large investment of time and resources across our enterprise, which may impact other value-added services or initiatives. Additionally, it remains uncertain when and on what scale our employees that are working remotely will return to work in person, and an extended period of remote work arrangements could strain our business continuity plans, create additional operational risk, such as cyber security risks, and impair our ability to manage our business. We may suffer damage to our reputation, which could adversely affect our business, if our responses to COVID-related impacts are unsuccessful or perceived as inadequate for the U.S. or our international markets.\nCOVID-related costs for us and our suppliers could be significant, and we are seeking reimbursement of certain COVID-related costs under our U.S. Government contracts through a combination of equitable adjustments to the contract price and reimbursement of the costs under Section 3610 of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (\u201cCARES Act\u201d), which allows federal agencies to reimburse contractors at the minimum applicable contract billing rate for certain COVID-related costs from March 27, 2020 through March 31, 2021. Reimbursement of any costs under Section 3610 of the CARES Act would increase sales, but is not expected to be at a profit or fee and, thus, would have the effect of reducing our margins in future periods. These cost increases, including costs for employees whose jobs cannot be performed remotely, may not be fully recoverable under our contracts, particularly fixed-price contracts, or adequately covered by insurance. We also have no assurance that Congress will appropriate funds to cover the reimbursement of defense contractors as authorized by the CARES Act, which could reduce funds available for other U.S. Government defense priorities.\nThe manner and extent to which COVID-related impacts further affect us, directly and indirectly by affecting our workforce, supply chain and customers, will depend on numerous evolving factors and future developments that we are not able to predict, including: the ultimate severity and duration of COVID; the extent, effectiveness and other consequences of attempts to contain and reduce its spread; governmental, business and other actions, which could include closures or other limitations on our or our supply chain\u2019s operations or mandates to provide products, systems or services; impacts on economic activity and customer demand, budgets and buying patterns; the health of and the effect on our workforce and our ability to meet staffing needs in our businesses and facilities, particularly if members of our workforce are quarantined as a result of exposure; any impairment in value of our tangible or intangible assets which could be recorded as a result of weaker economic conditions; and the potential effects on our internal controls, including those over financial reporting, as a result of changes in working environments, among others. In addition, disruptions or turmoil in the credit or financial markets or impacts on our credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to access capital on favorable terms and continue to meet our liquidity needs, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. COVID-related impacts also may exacerbate other risks discussed below, as well as affect us in a manner that we are not aware of currently, any of which could have a material effect on us.\nMacroeconomic, Industry and Governmental Risks\nWe depend on U.S. Government customers for a significant portion of our revenue, and the loss of these relationships, a reduction in U.S. Government funding or a change in U.S. Government spending priorities could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and equity.\nWe are highly dependent on sales to U.S. Government customers, primarily defense-related programs with the DoD and a broad range of programs with the U.S. Intelligence Community and other U.S. Government departments and agencies. The percentage of our revenue derived from sales to U.S. Government customers, including foreign military sales funded through the U.S. Government, both directly and through prime contractors, was 78 percent, 73 percent, 77 percent and 75 percent in fiscal 2020, the two quarters ended January 3, 2020, and fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. Therefore, any significant disruption or deterioration of our relationship with the U.S. Government (in particular, the DoD) would significantly reduce our revenue and have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and equity.\nWe operate in highly competitive markets, and the U.S. Government may choose to use contractors other than us, for example as part of competitive bidding processes (through which we expect that a majority of the business we seek will be awarded), or otherwise due to our competitors\u2019 ongoing efforts to expand their business relationships with the U.S. Government. The U.S. Government has increasingly relied on certain types of contracts that are subject to multiple competitive bidding processes, including multi-vendor IDIQ, GWAC, General Services Administration Schedule and other multi-award contracts, which has resulted in greater competition and increased pricing pressure. Some of our competitors have greater financial\nresources than we do and may have more extensive or more specialized engineering, manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we do in some areas. We may not be able to continue to win competitively awarded contracts or to obtain task orders under multi-award contracts. Further, competitive bidding processes involve significant cost and managerial time to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that may not be awarded to us or may be split with competitors and the risk that we may fail to accurately estimate the resources and costs required to fulfill any contract awarded to us. The current competitive bidding environment has resulted in an increase of bid protests from unsuccessful bidders, which typically extends the time until work on a contract can begin and may result in us experiencing significant expense or delay, contract modification or contract rescission as a result of our competitors protesting or challenging contracts awarded to us.\nOur U.S. Government programs must compete with programs managed by other government contractors and with other policy imperatives for consideration for limited resources and for uncertain levels of funding during the budget and appropriations process. Budget and appropriations decisions made by the U.S. Government are outside of our control and have long-term consequences for our business. U.S. Government spending priorities and levels remain uncertain and difficult to predict and are affected by numerous factors, including sequestration (automatic, across-the-board U.S. Government budgetary spending cuts) and potential alternative funding arrangements. A change in U.S. Government spending priorities or an increase in non-procurement spending at the expense of our programs, or a reduction in total U.S. Government spending, could have material adverse consequences on our current or future business. Any inability of the U.S. Government to complete its budget process for any government fiscal year, and consequently having to operate on funding levels equivalent to its prior fiscal year pursuant to a \u201ccontinuing resolution\u201d or shut down, also could have material adverse consequences on our current or future business. For more information regarding sequestration, see \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Business Considerations - Industry-Wide Opportunities, Challenges and Risks\u201d of this Report.\nWe depend significantly on U.S. Government contracts, which often are only partially funded, subject to immediate termination, and heavily regulated and audited. The termination or failure to fund, or negative audit findings for, one or more of these contracts could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and equity.\nA U.S. Government program may be implemented by the award of many different individual contracts and subcontracts over its lifetime, and its funding is subject to Congressional appropriations, which have been affected by larger U.S. Government budgetary issues and related legislation in recent years. Although multi-year contracts may be authorized and appropriated in connection with major procurements, Congress generally appropriates funds on a government fiscal year basis. Procurement funds are typically made available for obligation over the course of one to three years. Consequently, programs often initially receive only partial funding, and additional funds are obligated only as Congress authorizes further appropriations. We cannot predict the extent to which total funding and/or funding for individual programs will be included, increased or reduced as part of the annual appropriations process ultimately approved by Congress and the President or in separate supplemental appropriations or continuing resolutions, as applicable. The termination of funding for a U.S. Government program would result in a loss of anticipated future revenue attributable to that program, which could have an adverse impact on our operations. In addition, the termination of a program or the failure to commit additional funds to a program that already has been started could result in lost revenue and increase our overall costs of doing business.\nU.S. Government contracts also generally are subject to U.S. Government oversight audits, which could result in adjustments to our contract costs. Any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed, and such costs already reimbursed must be refunded. We have recorded contract revenue based on costs we expect to realize upon final audit. However, we do not know the outcome of any future audits and adjustments, and we may be required to materially reduce our revenue or profits upon completion and final negotiation of audits. Negative audit findings could also result in termination of a contract, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines or suspension or debarment from U.S. Government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time.\nIn addition, U.S. Government contracts generally contain provisions permitting termination, in whole or in part, without prior notice at the U.S. Government\u2019s convenience upon payment only for work done and commitments made at the time of termination. For some contracts, we are a subcontractor and not the prime contractor, and in those arrangements, the U.S. Government could terminate the prime contractor for convenience without regard for our performance as a subcontractor. We may be unable to procure new contracts to offset revenue or backlog lost as a result of any termination of our U.S. Government contracts. Because a significant portion of our revenue is dependent on our performance and payment under our U.S. Government contracts, the loss of one or more large contracts could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and equity.\nOur U.S. Government business also is subject to specific procurement regulations and a variety of socioeconomic and other requirements that, although customary in U.S. Government contracts, increase our performance and compliance costs. These costs might increase in the future, thereby reducing our margins, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and equity. In addition, the U.S. Government has and may continue to implement\ninitiatives focused on efficiencies, affordability and cost growth and other changes to its procurement practices. These initiatives and changes to procurement practices may change the way U.S. Government contracts are solicited, negotiated and managed, which may affect whether and how we pursue opportunities to provide our products and services to the U.S. Government, including the terms and conditions under which we do so, which may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and equity. For example, contracts awarded under the DoD\u2019s Other Transaction Authority for research and prototypes generally require cost-sharing and may not follow, or may follow only in part, standard U.S. Government contracting practices and terms, such as the FAR and Cost Accounting Standards.\nFailure to comply with applicable regulations and requirements could lead to fines, penalties, repayments, or compensatory or treble damages, or suspension or debarment from U.S. Government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time. Among the causes for debarment are violations of various laws and regulations, including those related to procurement integrity, export control (including International Traffic in Arms Regulations (\u201cITAR\u201d)), U.S. Government security, employment practices, protection of the environment, accuracy of records, proper recording of costs and foreign corruption. The termination of a U.S. Government contract or relationship as a result of any of these acts would have an adverse impact on our operations and could have an adverse effect on our standing and eligibility for future U.S. Government contracts.\nThe U.S. Government\u2019s budget deficit and the national debt, as well as any inability of the U.S. Government to complete its budget process for any government fiscal year and consequently having to shut down or operate on funding levels equivalent to its prior fiscal year pursuant to a \u201ccontinuing resolution,\u201d could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and equity.\nConsiderable uncertainty exists regarding how future budget and program decisions will unfold, including the defense spending priorities of the U.S. Government, what challenges budget reductions will present for the defense industry and whether annual appropriations bills for all agencies will be enacted for U.S. Government fiscal 2022 and thereafter. The U.S. Government\u2019s budget deficit and the national debt could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and equity in a number of ways, including the following:\n\u2022The U.S. Government could reduce or delay its spending on, or reprioritize its spending away from, the government programs in which we participate;\n\u2022U.S. Government spending could be impacted by alternate arrangements to sequestration, which increases the uncertainty as to, and the difficulty in predicting, U.S. Government spending priorities and levels; and\n\u2022We may experience declines in revenue, profitability and cash flows as a result of reduced or delayed orders or payments or other factors caused by economic difficulties of our customers and prospective customers, including U.S. Federal, state and local governments.\nFurthermore, we believe continued budget pressures and additional budget pressures from COVID-related impacts could have serious negative consequences for U.S. security and for companies in the defense industrial base and the customers, employees, suppliers, investors and communities that rely on them. Budget and program decisions made in this environment would have long-term implications for us and the rest of the defense industry.\nOur results of operations and cash flows are substantially affected by our mix of fixed-price, cost-plus and time-and-material type contracts. In particular, our fixed-price contracts could subject us to losses in the event of cost overruns or a significant increase in inflation.\nWe generate revenue through various fixed-price, cost-plus and time-and-material contracts. For a general description of our U.S. Government contracts and subcontracts, including a discussion of revenue generated thereunder and of cost-reimbursable versus fixed-price contracts, see \u201cItem 1. Business - Principal Customers; Government Contracts\u201d of this Report. For a description of our revenue recognition policies, see \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Revenue Recognition\u201d of this Report.\nIn fiscal 2020, 74 percent of our revenue was derived from fixed-price contracts which allow us to benefit from cost savings, but subject us to the risk of potential cost overruns, particularly for firm fixed-price contracts because we assume all of the cost burden. If our initial estimates are incorrect, we can lose money (or make more or less money than estimated) on these contracts. U.S. Government contracts can expose us to potentially large losses because the U.S. Government can hold us responsible for completing a project or, in certain circumstances, paying the entire cost of its replacement by another provider regardless of the size or foreseeability of any cost overruns that occur over the life of the contract. Because many of these contracts involve new technologies and applications and can last for years, unforeseen events, such as technological difficulties, fluctuations in the price of raw materials, a significant increase in inflation, problems with our suppliers and cost overruns, can result in the contractual price becoming less favorable or even unprofitable to us over time. Furthermore, if we do not meet contract deadlines or specifications, we may need to renegotiate contracts on less favorable terms, be forced to pay penalties or liquidated damages or suffer major losses if the customer exercises its right to terminate. In addition, some of our contracts have provisions relating to cost controls and audit rights, and if we fail to meet the terms specified in those contracts, we may not realize their full benefits. Cost overruns would adversely impact our results of operations, which are dependent on our ability to maximize our earnings from our contracts, and the potential risk would be greater if our contracts shifted toward a greater percentage of fixed-price contracts, particularly firm fixed-price contracts.\nIn fiscal 2020, 26 percent of our revenue was derived from cost-plus and time-and-material contracts, substantially all of which are with U.S. Government customers. Sales to foreign government and commercial customers are generally under fixed-price arrangements and are included in our fixed-price contract sales. For a cost-plus contract, we are paid our allowable incurred costs plus a profit, which can be fixed or variable depending on the contract\u2019s fee arrangement up to predetermined funding levels established by our customers. For a time-and-material contract, we are paid on the basis of direct labor hours expended at specified fixed-price hourly rates (which include wages, overhead, allowable general and administrative expenses and profit) and materials at cost. Therefore, on cost-plus and time-and-material type contracts, we do not bear the risks of unexpected cost overruns, provided that we do not incur costs that exceed the predetermined funded amounts.\nOur commercial aviation products, systems and services businesses are affected by global demand and economic factors that could negatively impact our financial results.\nThe operating results of our commercial aviation products, systems and services businesses may be adversely affected by downturns in the global demand for air travel which impacts new aircraft production and orders, and global flying hours, which impacts air transport, regional and business aircraft utilization rates and pilot training needs. The aviation industry is highly cyclical, and the level of demand for air travel is correlated to the strength of the U.S. and international economies and is impacted by long-term trends in airline passenger and cargo traffic. The results of our commercial aviation businesses also depend on other factors, including general economic growth, political stability in both developed and emerging markets, pricing pressures, trends in capital goods markets and changes in original equipment manufacturer production rates. As described above under \u201cCOVID-Related Risks,\u201d our commercial aviation businesses experienced adverse COVID-related impacts in fiscal 2020 and remain at a higher risk of further adverse COVID-related impacts.\nWe participate in markets that are often subject to uncertain economic conditions, which makes it difficult to estimate growth in our markets and, as a result, future income and expenditures.\nWe participate in U.S. and international markets that are subject to uncertain economic conditions. In particular, U.S. Government spending priorities and levels remain uncertain and difficult to predict and are affected by numerous factors, including sequestration and potential alternative funding arrangements and COVID-related impacts. In addition, certain of our non-U.S. customers, including in the Middle East and other oil or natural gas-producing countries, could be adversely affected by weakness or volatility in oil or natural gas prices, or negative expectations about future prices or volatility, which could adversely affect demand for tactical communications, electronic systems or other products, systems, services or technologies. As a result of that uncertainty, it is difficult to develop accurate estimates of the level of growth in the markets we serve. Because those estimates underpin all components of our budgeting and forecasting, our estimates or guidance for future revenue, income and expenditures may be inaccurate, and we may make significant investments and expenditures but never realize the anticipated benefits.\nWe cannot predict the consequences of future geo-political events, but they may adversely affect the markets in which we operate, our ability to insure against risks, our operations or our profitability.\nOngoing instability and current conflicts in global markets, including in the Middle East and Asia, and the potential for other conflicts and future terrorist activities and other recent geo-political events throughout the world, including new or increased tariffs and potential trade wars and the withdrawal of the United Kingdom (the \u201cUK\u201d) from the European Union (the \u201cEU\u201d) in January 2020 (commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d), have created and may continue to create economic and political uncertainties and impacts that could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and profitability. Since January 1, 2021, when the Brexit transition period ended, the UK and EU\u2019s trade and cooperation agreement (covering the general objectives and framework of their relationship, including as to trade, transport and certain other matters, but not providing for free movement of people between the UK and EU, free movement of UK goods or automatic access to the entire EU single market for UK service\nsuppliers) has applied provisionally, but it remains subject to EU ratification and revision before formal effectiveness. The effects of Brexit in part depend on application of the terms of the agreement, and thus remain uncertain. We generated 2 percent of our fiscal 2020 revenue in the UK, but we and our suppliers may experience supply chain disruptions, increased tariffs, currency devaluation in the UK or other adverse impacts on operations or profitability. These types of matters cause uncertainty in financial and insurance markets and may significantly increase the political, economic and social instability in the geographic areas in which we operate. If credit in financial markets outside of the U.S. tightened, it could adversely affect the ability of our international customers and suppliers to obtain financing and could result in a decrease in or cancellation of orders for our products, systems and services or impact the ability of our customers to make payments. These matters also may cause us to experience increased costs, such as for insurance coverages and performance bonds (or for them to be unavailable altogether), as well as difficulty with future borrowings under our commercial paper program or credit facilities or in the debt markets or otherwise with financing our operating, investing (including any future acquisitions) or financing activities.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenue from international operations and are subject to the risks of doing business internationally, including fluctuations in currency exchange rates.\nWe are dependent on sales to customers outside the U.S. The percentage of our total revenue represented by revenue from products, systems and services where the end consumer is located outside the U.S., including foreign military sales through the U.S. Government, was 20 percent, 21 percent, 22 percent and 23 percent in fiscal 2020, the two quarters ended January 3, 2020, and fiscal 2019 and 2018, respectively. In fiscal 2020, 32 percent of our international business was transacted in local currency. Losses resulting from currency rate fluctuations can adversely affect our results. We expect that international revenue will continue to account for a significant portion of our total revenue. Also, a significant portion of our international revenue is from, and a significant portion of our business activity is being conducted with or in, less-developed countries and sometimes countries with unstable governments, or in areas of military conflict or at military installations. Other risks of doing business internationally include:\n\u2022Currency exchange controls, fluctuations of currency and currency revaluations;\n\u2022Laws, regulations and policies of foreign governments relating to investments and operations, as well as U.S. laws affecting activities of U.S. companies abroad, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d);\n\u2022Import and export licensing requirements and regulations, including ITAR, as well as unforeseen changes in export controls and other trade regulations;\n\u2022Changes in regulatory requirements, including business or operating license requirements, imposition of tariffs or embargoes;\n\u2022Uncertainties and restrictions concerning the availability of funding, credit or guarantees;\n\u2022Risk of non-payment or delayed payment by non-U.S. customers;\n\u2022Contractual obligations to non-U.S. customers may include specific in-country purchases, investments, manufacturing agreements or financial or other support arrangements or obligations, known as offset obligations, that may extend for many years, require teaming with local companies and result in significant penalties if not satisfied;\n\u2022Complexities and necessities of using, and disruptions involving, international dealers, distributors, sales representatives and consultants;\n\u2022Difficulties of managing a geographically dispersed organization and culturally diverse workforces, including compliance with local laws and practices;\n\u2022Difficulties with repatriating cash generated or held abroad in a tax-efficient manner and changes in tax laws;\n\u2022Uncertainties as to local laws and enforcement of contract and intellectual property rights and occasional requirements for onerous contract terms;\n\u2022Rapid changes in government, economic and political policies, political or civil unrest, acts of terrorism or threats of international boycotts or U.S. anti-boycott legislation; and\n\u2022Increased risk of an incident resulting in damage or destruction to our facilities or products or resulting in injury or loss of life to our employees, subcontractors or other third parties.\nWe are subject to government investigations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and equity.\nU.S. Government contractors are subject to extensive legal and regulatory requirements, including ITAR and FCPA, and from time to time agencies of the U.S. Government investigate whether we have been and are operating in accordance with these requirements. We may cooperate with the U.S. Government in those investigations. Under U.S. Government regulations, an indictment of L3Harris by a federal grand jury, or an administrative finding against us as to our present responsibility to be a U.S. Government contractor or subcontractor, could result in us being suspended for a period of time from eligibility for awards of new government contracts or task orders or in a loss of export privileges, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and equity. A conviction, or an administrative finding against us that satisfies\nthe requisite level of seriousness, could result in debarment from contracting with the U.S. Government for a specific term, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and equity.\nBusiness and Operational Risks\nWe could be negatively impacted by a security breach, through cyber attack, cyber intrusion, insider threats or otherwise, or other significant disruption of our IT networks and related systems or of those we operate for certain of our customers.\nWe face the risk of a security breach, whether through cyber attack, cyber intrusion or insider threat via the Internet, malware, computer viruses, attachments to e-mails, persons inside our organization or with access to systems inside our organization, threats to the physical security of our facilities and employees or other significant disruption of our IT networks and related systems or those of our suppliers or subcontractors. We face an added risk of a security breach or other significant disruption of the IT networks and related systems that we develop, install, operate and maintain for certain of our customers, which may involve managing and protecting information relating to national security and other sensitive government functions or personally identifiable or protected health information. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber attack or cyber intrusion, including by computer hackers, foreign governments and cyber terrorists, is persistent and substantial as the volume, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks, intrusions and threats from around the world remain elevated and unlikely to diminish. As an advanced technology-based solutions provider, and particularly as a government contractor with access to national security or other sensitive government information, we face a heightened risk of a security breach or disruption from threats to gain unauthorized access to our and our customers\u2019 proprietary or classified information on our IT networks and related systems and to the IT networks and related systems that we operate and maintain for certain of our customers. These types of information and IT networks and related systems are critical to the operation of our business and essential to our ability to perform day-to-day operations, and, in some cases, are critical to the operations of certain of our customers. We make significant efforts to maintain the security and integrity of these types of information and IT networks and related systems and have implemented various measures to manage the risk of a security breach or disruption. Our efforts and measures have not been entirely effective in the case of every cyber security incident, but no incident has had a material negative impact on us to date. Even the most well protected information, networks, systems and facilities remain potentially vulnerable because attempted security breaches, particularly cyber attacks and cyber intrusions, or disruptions will occur in the future, and because the techniques used in such attempts are constantly evolving and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases are designed not to be detected and, in fact, may not be detected (for example, the SolarWinds cyber incident). In some cases, the resources of foreign governments may be behind such attacks due to the nature of our business and the industries in which we operate. Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures. Thus, it is impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk, and there can be no assurance that future cyber security incidents will not have a material negative impact on us. A security breach or other significant disruption involving these types of information and IT networks and related systems could:\n\u2022Disrupt proper functioning of these networks and systems and, therefore, our operations and/or those of certain of our customers;\n\u2022Result in unauthorized access to, and destruction, loss, theft, misappropriation or release of, proprietary, confidential, sensitive or otherwise valuable information of ours, our customers or our employees, including trade secrets, which could be used to compete against us or for disruptive, destructive or otherwise harmful purposes and outcomes;\n\u2022Compromise national security and other sensitive government functions;\n\u2022Require significant management attention and resources to remedy damages that result;\n\u2022Result in costs which exceed our insurance coverage and/or indemnification arrangements;\n\u2022Subject us to claims for contract breach, damages, credits, penalties or termination; and\n\u2022Damage our reputation with our customers (particularly agencies of the U.S. Government) and the general public.\nWe must also rely on the safeguards put in place by customers, suppliers, vendors, subcontractors or other third parties to minimize the impact of cyber threats, other security threats or business disruptions. These third parties may have varying levels of cybersecurity expertise and safeguards, and their relationships with government contractors, such as us, may increase their likelihood of being targeted by the same cyber threats we face. Our commercial arrangements with these third parties include processes designed to require that the third parties and their employees and agents agree to maintain certain standards for the storage, protection and transfer of confidential, personal and proprietary information. However, we remain at risk of a data breach due to the intentional or unintentional non-compliance by a third party\u2019s employee or agent, the breakdown of a third party\u2019s data protection processes, which may not be as sophisticated as ours, or a cyber-attack on a third party\u2019s information network and systems.\nAny or all of the foregoing could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and equity.\nOur future success will depend on our ability to develop new products, systems, services and technologies that achieve market acceptance in our current and future markets.\nOur businesses are characterized by rapidly changing technologies and evolving industry standards. Accordingly, our performance depends on a number of factors, including our ability to:\n\u2022Identify market needs and growth opportunities;\n\u2022Identify emerging technological trends in our current and target markets;\n\u2022Identify additional uses for our existing technology to address customer needs;\n\u2022Develop and maintain competitive products, systems, services and technologies;\n\u2022Enhance our offerings by adding innovative hardware, software or other features that differentiate our products, systems, services and technologies from those of our competitors;\n\u2022Develop, manufacture and bring to market cost-effective offerings quickly;\n\u2022Enhance product designs for export and releasability to international markets; and\n\u2022Effectively structure our businesses to reflect the competitive environment, including through the use of joint ventures, collaborative agreements and other forms of alliances.\nTo remain competitive, we need to continue to design, develop, manufacture, assemble, test, market and support new products, systems, services and technologies, which will require the investment of significant financial resources. In the past, we have allocated substantial funds for such investments through customer funded and internal research and development, acquisitions or other teaming arrangements. This practice will continue to be required, but we may not be able to successfully identify new opportunities and may not have the necessary financial resources to develop new products, systems, services and technologies in a timely or cost-effective manner. Furthermore, the need to make these expenditures could divert our attention and resources from other projects, and we cannot be sure that these expenditures ultimately will lead to the timely development of new products, systems, services or technologies. Due to the design complexity of some of our products, systems, services and technologies, we may experience delays in completing development and introducing new products, systems, services or technologies in the future. Any delays could result in increased costs of development or divert resources from other projects. In addition, the markets for our products, systems, services or technologies may not develop as we currently anticipate, we may not be as successful in newly identified markets as we currently anticipate, and acquisitions, joint ventures or other teaming arrangements we may enter into to pursue developing new products, systems, services or technologies may not be successful. Failure of our products, systems, services or technologies to gain market acceptance could significantly reduce our revenue and harm our business. Furthermore, competitors may develop competing products, systems, services or technologies that gain market acceptance in advance of our products, systems, services or technologies, or competitors may develop new products, systems, services or technologies that cause our existing products, systems, services or technologies to become non-competitive or obsolete, which could adversely affect our results of operations. The future direction of the domestic and global economies, including its impact on customer demand, also will have a significant impact on our overall performance.\nWe must attract and retain key employees, and any failure to do so could seriously harm us.\nOur future success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our management and our ability to attract and retain highly qualified management and technical personnel, including employees who have U.S. Government security clearances, particularly clearances of top-secret and above. To the extent that the demand for qualified personnel exceeds supply, as has been the case from time to time in recent years, we could experience higher labor, recruiting or training costs in order to attract and retain such employees, or could experience difficulties in performing under our contracts if our needs for such employees were unmet. Failure to attract and retain such personnel would damage our future prospects.\nSome of our workforce is represented by labor unions, so a prolonged work stoppage could harm our business.\nAt January 1, 2021, approximately 3,100 of our U.S. employees, or approximately 7 percent of our employee base, were unionized. If we encounter difficulties with renegotiation or renewals of collective bargaining arrangements or are unsuccessful in those efforts, we could incur additional costs and experience work stoppages. Union actions at suppliers can also affect us. We cannot predict how stable our union relationships will be or whether we will be able to successfully negotiate successor collective bargaining agreements without impacting our financial condition. In addition, the presence of unions may limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce. Work stoppages could negatively impact our ability to manufacture products or provide services on a timely basis, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and equity.\nDisputes with our subcontractors or key suppliers, or their inability to perform or timely deliver our components, parts or services, could cause our products, systems or services to be produced or delivered in an untimely or unsatisfactory manner.\nWe engage subcontractors on many of our contracts and from time to time may have disputes with them, including regarding the quality and timeliness of work performed by them, customer concerns about the subcontract or subcontractor, our\nfailure to extend existing task orders or issue new task orders under a subcontract, our hiring of the personnel of a subcontractor or vice versa or the subcontractor\u2019s failure to comply with applicable law. In addition, there are certain parts, components and services for many of our products, systems and services that we source from other manufacturers or vendors. Some of our suppliers, from time to time, experience financial and operational difficulties, which may impact their ability to supply the materials, components, subsystems and services that we require. Tariffs recently imposed on certain materials and other trade issues may create or exacerbate existing materials shortages and may result in further supplier business closures. Our supply chain could also be disrupted by external events, such as natural disasters or other significant disruptions (including COVID-related impacts as described above under \u201cCOVID-Related Risks,\u201d extreme weather conditions, epidemics, acts of terrorism, cyber attacks and labor disputes), governmental actions and legislative or regulatory changes, including product certification or stewardship requirements, sourcing restrictions, product authenticity and climate change or greenhouse gas emission standards, or availability constraints from increased demand from customers. These or any further political or governmental developments or health concerns in countries in which we operate could result in social, economic and labor instability. Any inability to develop alternative sources of supply on a cost-effective and timely basis could materially impair our ability to manufacture and deliver products, systems and services to our customers. We may experience disputes with our subcontractors; material supply constraints or problems; or component, subsystems or services problems in the future. Also, our subcontractors and other suppliers may not be able to acquire or maintain the quality of the materials, components, subsystems and services they supply, which might result in greater product returns, service problems and warranty claims and could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and equity. In addition, in connection with our government contracts, we are required to procure certain materials, components and parts, including certain microelectronics components, from supply sources approved by the U.S. Government and we rely on our subcontractors and suppliers to comply with applicable laws, regulations and other requirements regarding procurement of counterfeit, unauthorized or otherwise non-compliant parts or materials, including parts or materials they supply to us, and in some circumstances, we rely on their certifications as to their compliance. From time to time, there are components for which there may be only one supplier, which may be unable to meet our needs. Each of these subcontractor and supplier risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and equity.\nWe have significant operations in locations that could be materially and adversely impacted in the event of a natural disaster or other significant disruption.\nOur corporate headquarters and significant business operations are located in Florida, which is subject to the risk of major hurricanes. Our worldwide operations and operations of our suppliers and customers could be subject to natural disasters or other significant disruptions, including hurricanes, typhoons, tsunamis, floods, earthquakes, fires, water shortages, other extreme weather conditions, epidemics, pandemics, COVID-related impacts as described above under \u201cCOVID-Related Risks,\u201d acts of terrorism, power shortages and blackouts, telecommunications failures, cyber attacks and other natural and manmade disasters or disruptions. In the event of such a natural disaster or other disruption, we could experience disruptions or interruptions to our operations or the operations of our suppliers, subcontractors, distributors, resellers or customers, including inability of employees to work; destruction of facilities; and/or loss of life, all of which could materially increase our costs and expenses, delay or decrease orders and revenue from our customers and have a material adverse effect on the continuity of our business and our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and equity.\nFinancial Risks\nChanges in estimates we use in accounting for many of our programs could adversely affect our future financial results.\nAccounting for our contracts requires judgment relative to assessing risks, including risks associated with customer-directed delays and reductions in scheduled deliveries, unfavorable resolutions of claims and contractual matters, and judgment associated with estimating contract revenue and costs and assumptions for schedule and technical issues. Due to the size and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables. For example, we must make assumptions regarding: (i) the length of time to complete the contract because costs also include expected increases in wages and prices for materials; (ii) whether contracts should be accounted for as having one or more performance obligations based on the goods and services promised to the customer; (iii) incentives or penalties related to performance on contracts in estimating revenue and profit rates, and recording them when there is sufficient information for us to assess anticipated performance; and (iv) estimates of award fees in estimating revenue and profit rates based on actual and anticipated awards. Because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes involved in accounting for our contracts, materially different amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. Changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances or estimates may adversely affect our future results of operations and financial condition. For additional information regarding our critical accounting policies and estimates applicable to our accounting for our contracts, see \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d of this Report.\nOur level of indebtedness and our ability to make payments on or service our indebtedness and our unfunded defined benefit plans liability may materially adversely affect our financial and operating activities or our ability to incur additional debt.\nAt January 1, 2021, we had $6.8 billion in aggregate principal amount of outstanding debt and $1.9 billion of unfunded defined benefit plans liability. These amounts may increase; however, our ability to increase our borrowings is subject to limitations imposed on us by our debt agreements. Our ability to make payments on and to refinance our current or future indebtedness, and our ability to make contributions to our unfunded defined benefit plans liability, will depend on our ability to generate cash from operations, financings or asset sales, which may be subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. If we are not able to repay or refinance our debt as it becomes due or make contributions to our unfunded defined benefit plans liability, we may be forced to sell assets or take other disadvantageous actions, including reducing financing for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes; reducing our cash dividend rate and/or share repurchases; or dedicating an unsustainable level of our cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness. In addition, our ability to withstand competitive pressures and to react to changes in the defense technology industry could be impaired. The lenders who hold such debt could also accelerate amounts due, which could potentially trigger a default or acceleration of any of our other debt.\nAdditionally, certain of our financial obligations and instruments, including our 2019 Credit Facility (defined below) and Floating Rate Notes due March 10, 2023, as well as financial instruments that we hold or use or may hold or use, such as interest rate swaps, are or may be made at variable interest rates that use the London interbank offered rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) (or metrics derived from or related to LIBOR) as a benchmark for establishing the applicable interest rate. The potential consequences from discontinuation, modification or reform of LIBOR, implementation of alternative reference rates and any interest rate transition process cannot be fully predicted and may have an adverse impact on values of LIBOR-linked securities and other financial obligations or extensions of credit and may involve, among other things, increased volatility or illiquidity in markets for instruments that rely on LIBOR, reductions in effectiveness of related transactions such as hedges, increased borrowing costs, uncertainty under applicable documentation, or difficult and costly consent processes. This could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. See Note 13: Credit Arrangements in the Notes for additional information regarding our 2019 Credit Facility and Note 14: Debt in the Notes for additional information regarding our Floating Rate Notes due March 10, 2023.\nA downgrade in our credit ratings could materially adversely affect our business.\nThe credit ratings assigned to our debt securities could change based on, among other things, our results of operations, financial condition, mergers, acquisitions or dispositions. These ratings are subject to ongoing evaluation by credit rating agencies and may be changed or withdrawn by rating agencies in the future. Moreover, these credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold any of our debt securities. Actual or anticipated changes or downgrades in our credit ratings, including any announcement that our ratings are under review for a downgrade or have been assigned a negative outlook, would likely increase our borrowing costs and affect our ability to incur new indebtedness or refinance our existing indebtedness, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, equity and the market value of our common stock and outstanding debt securities.\nThe level of returns on defined benefit plan assets, changes in interest rates and other factors could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and equity in future periods.\nA substantial portion of our current and retired employee population is covered by defined benefit pension and other postretirement defined benefit plans (collectively, \u201cdefined benefit plans\u201d). We may experience significant fluctuations in costs related to defined benefit plans as a result of macro-economic factors, such as interest rates, that are beyond our control. The cost of our defined benefit plans is incurred over long periods of time and involves various factors and uncertainties during those periods that can be volatile and unpredictable, including the rates of return on defined benefit plan assets, discount rates used to calculate liabilities and expenses, mortality of plan participants and trends for future medical costs. We develop our assumptions using relevant plan experience and expectations in conjunction with market-related data. These assumptions and other actuarial assumptions may change significantly due to changes in economic, legislative, and/or demographic experience or circumstances. Significant changes in key economic indicators, financial market volatility, future legislation and other governmental regulatory actions could materially affect our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and equity.\nWe will make contributions to fund our defined benefit plans when considered necessary or advantageous to do so. The macro-economic factors discussed above, including the rates of return on defined benefit plan assets and the minimum funding requirements established by government funding or taxing authorities, or established by other agreement, may influence future funding requirements. A significant decline in the fair value of our plan assets, or other adverse changes to our overall defined benefit plans, could require us to make significant funding contributions and affect cash flows in future periods.\nU.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (\u201cCAS\u201d) govern the extent to which postretirement costs and plan contributions are allocable to and recoverable under contracts with the U.S. Government. We expect to continue to seek reimbursement from the U.S. Government for a portion of our postretirement costs and plan contributions; however, pension plan cost recoveries under our U.S. Government contracts may occur in different periods from when those pension costs are\nrecognized for financial statement purposes or when pension funding is made. CAS rules have been revised to partially harmonize the measurement and period of assignment of pension plan costs allocable to U.S. Government contracts and minimum required contributions under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended by the Pension Protection Act of 2006. However, there is still a lag between the time when we contribute cash to our plans under pension funding rules and when we recover pension costs under CAS rules. These timing differences could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows.\nLegal, Tax and Regulatory Risks\nChanges in our effective tax rate may have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur future effective tax rate may be adversely affected by a number of factors including:\n\u2022Changes in domestic or international tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws;\n\u2022The jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed;\n\u2022Adjustments to estimated taxes upon finalization of various tax returns;\n\u2022Increases in expenses not fully deductible for tax purposes, including write-offs of acquired in-process R&D and impairment of goodwill or other long-term assets in connection with mergers or acquisitions;\n\u2022Changes in available tax credits;\n\u2022Changes in share-based compensation expense;\n\u2022Changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities; and\n\u2022The resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities.\nFor example, provisions in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 require that, beginning in 2022, R&D expenditures be capitalized and amortized over five years, which would result in a material increase to our cash taxes in 2022 through 2026 and establishment of a material deferred tax asset, if the provisions are not modified or repealed before then.\nAny significant increase in our future effective tax rates could adversely impact our results of operations for future periods.\nWe may not be successful in obtaining the necessary export licenses to conduct certain operations abroad, and Congress may prevent proposed sales to certain foreign governments.\nWe must first obtain export and other licenses and authorizations from various U.S. Government agencies before we are permitted to sell certain products and technologies outside of the U.S. For example, the U.S. Department of State must notify Congress at least 15 to 60 days, depending on the size and location of the proposed sale, prior to authorizing certain sales of defense equipment and services to foreign governments. During that time, Congress may take action to block the proposed sale. We may be unsuccessful in obtaining necessary licenses or authorizations or Congress may prevent or delay certain sales. Our ability to obtain necessary licenses and authorizations timely or at all is subject to risks and uncertainties, including changing U.S. Government policies or laws or delays in Congressional action due to geopolitical and other factors. If we are not successful in obtaining or maintaining the necessary licenses or authorizations in a timely manner, our sales relating to those approvals may be reversed, prevented or delayed, and any significant impairment of our ability to sell products or technologies outside of the U.S. could negatively impact our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and equity.\nOur reputation and ability to do business may be impacted by the improper conduct of our employees, agents or business partners.\nWe have implemented compliance controls, training, policies and procedures designed to prevent and detect reckless or criminal acts from being committed by our employees, agents or business partners that would violate the laws of the jurisdictions in which we operate, including laws governing payments to government officials, such as the FCPA, the protection of export controlled or classified information, such as ITAR, false claims, procurement integrity, cost accounting and billing, competition, information security and data privacy and the terms of our contracts. This risk of improper conduct may increase as we continue to grow and expand our operations. We cannot ensure, however, that our controls, training, policies and procedures will prevent or detect all such reckless or criminal acts, and we have been adversely impacted by such acts in the past. If not prevented, such acts could subject us to civil or criminal investigations, monetary and non-monetary penalties and suspension and debarment by the U.S. Government and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and reputation. In addition, misconduct involving data security lapses resulting in the compromise of personal information or the improper use of our customer\u2019s sensitive or classified information could result in remediation costs, regulatory sanctions against us and serious harm to our reputation and could adversely impact our ability to continue to contract with the U.S. Government.\nThe outcome of litigation or arbitration in which we are involved from time to time is unpredictable, and an adverse decision in any such matter could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and equity.\nThe size, nature and complexity of our business make us susceptible to investigations, claims, disputes, enforcement actions, litigation and other legal proceedings, particularly those involving governments. From time to time, we are defendants in a number of litigation matters and are involved in a number of arbitration matters. These actions may divert financial and\nmanagement resources that would otherwise be used to benefit our operations. The results of these or new matters may be unfavorable to us. Although we maintain insurance policies, they may not be adequate to protect us from all material judgments and expenses related to current or future claims and may not cover the conduct that is the subject of the litigation or arbitration. Desired levels of insurance may not be available in the future at economical prices or at all. In addition, we believe that while we have valid defenses with respect to legal matters pending against us, the results of litigation or arbitration can be difficult to predict, including litigation involving jury trials. Accordingly, our current judgment as to the likelihood of our loss (or our current estimate as to the potential range of loss, if applicable) with respect to any particular litigation or arbitration matter may be wrong. A significant judgment or arbitration award against us arising out of any of our current or future litigation or arbitration matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and equity.\nThird parties have claimed in the past and may claim in the future that we are infringing directly or indirectly upon their intellectual property rights, and third parties may infringe upon our intellectual property rights.\nMany of the markets we serve are characterized by vigorous protection and pursuit of intellectual property rights, which often has resulted in protracted and expensive litigation. Our efforts to gain awards of contracts and ensure a competitive position in the market depends in part on our ability to ensure that our intellectual property is protected, that our intellectual property rights are not diluted or subject to misuse, and that we are able to license certain third party intellectual property on reasonable terms. Third parties have claimed in the past and may claim in the future that we are infringing directly or indirectly upon their intellectual property rights, and we may be found to be infringing or to have infringed directly or indirectly upon those intellectual property rights. Claims of infringement might also require us to enter into costly royalty or license agreements. Our patents and other intellectual property may be challenged, invalidated, misappropriated or circumvented by third parties. Moreover, we may not be able to obtain royalty or license agreements on terms acceptable to us, or at all. We also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development and sale of certain of our products, services and solutions. Our success depends in large part on our proprietary technology. We rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, know-how, confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our intellectual property rights. In addition, the laws concerning intellectual property vary among nations and the protection provided to our intellectual property by the laws and courts of foreign nations may differ from those of the U.S. If we fail to successfully protect and enforce these rights, our competitive position could suffer. Our pending patent and trademark registration applications may not be allowed, or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of our patents or trademark registrations. In addition, our patents may not provide us a significant competitive advantage. We may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and enforce our intellectual property rights. Litigation to determine the scope of intellectual property rights, even if ultimately successful, could be costly and could divert management\u2019s attention away from other aspects of our business. We may not be able to detect infringement, and our competitive position may be harmed before we do so. In addition, competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies.\nWe face certain significant risk exposures and potential liabilities that may not be covered adequately by insurance or indemnity.\nWe are exposed to liabilities that are unique to the products, systems and services we provide. A significant portion of our business relates to designing, developing and manufacturing advanced defense, technology and communications systems and products. New technologies associated with these systems and products may be untested or unproven. Components of certain defense systems and products we develop are inherently dangerous. Failures of satellites, missile systems, air traffic control systems, electronic warfare systems, space superiority systems, C5ISR systems, homeland security applications and aircraft have the potential to cause loss of life and extensive property damage. Other examples of unforeseen problems that could result, either directly or indirectly, in the loss of life or property or otherwise negatively affect revenue and profitability include loss on launch of spacecraft, premature failure of products that cannot be accessed for repair or replacement, problems with quality and workmanship, country of origin, delivery of subcontractor components or services and unplanned degradation of product performance. In addition, problems and delays in development or delivery as a result of issues with respect to design, technology, licensing and patent rights, labor, learning curve assumptions or materials and components could prevent us from achieving contractual requirements. In many circumstances, we may receive indemnification from the U.S. Government. We generally do not receive indemnification from foreign governments. Although we maintain insurance for certain risks, including certain cybersecurity exposures, the amount of our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all claims or liabilities, and we may be forced to bear substantial costs from an accident or incident. It also is not possible for us to obtain insurance to protect against all operational risks and liabilities. Substantial claims resulting from an incident in excess of U.S. Government indemnity and our insurance coverage would harm our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and equity. Other factors that may affect revenue and profits include loss of follow-on work, and, in the case of certain contracts, liquidated damages, penalties and repayment to the customer of contract cost and fee payments we previously received. Moreover, any accident or incident for which we are liable, even if fully insured, could negatively affect our standing with our customers and the public, thereby making it more difficult for us to compete effectively, and could significantly impact the cost and availability of adequate insurance in the future.\nUnforeseen environmental issues could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and equity.\nOur operations are subject to various U.S. Federal, state and local, as well as certain foreign, environmental laws and regulations within the countries in which we operate relating to the discharge, storage, treatment, handling, disposal and remediation of certain materials, substances and wastes used in our operations. In addition, we could be affected by future environmental laws or regulations, including, for example, new restrictions on materials used in our operations, or future regulations imposed or claims asserted in response to concerns over climate change, other aspects of the environment or natural resources. Compliance with current and future environmental laws and regulations may require significant operating and capital costs. Environmental laws and regulations may authorize substantial fines and criminal sanctions as well as facility shutdowns to address violations, and may require the installation of costly pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit emissions or discharges. We also incur, and expect to continue to incur, costs to comply with current environmental laws and regulations related to remediation of conditions in the environment. In addition, if violations of environmental laws result in us, or in one or more of our operations, being identified as an excluded party in the U.S. Government\u2019s System for Award Management, then we or one or more of our operations would become ineligible to receive certain contracts, subcontracts and other benefits from the Federal government or to perform work under a government contract or subcontract. Generally, such ineligibility would continue until the basis for the listing has been appropriately addressed. Developments such as the adoption of new environmental laws and regulations, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, violations by us of such laws and regulations, discovery of previously unknown or more extensive contamination, litigation involving environmental impacts, our inability to recover costs associated with any such developments under previously priced contracts, or financial insolvency of other responsible parties could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and equity.\nStrategic Transactions and Investments Risks\nStrategic transactions, including mergers, acquisitions and divestitures, involve significant risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and equity.\nStrategic mergers, acquisitions and divestitures we have made in the past and may make in the future present significant risks and uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and equity, which include:\n\u2022Difficulty in identifying and evaluating potential mergers and acquisitions, including the risk that our due diligence does not identify or fully assess valuation issues, potential liabilities or other merger or acquisition risks;\n\u2022Difficulty and expense in integrating newly merged or acquired businesses and operations, including combining product and service offerings, and in entering into new markets in which we are not experienced, in an efficient and cost-effective manner while maintaining adequate standards, controls and procedures, and the risk that we encounter significant unanticipated costs or other problems associated with integration;\n\u2022Difficulty and expense in consolidating and rationalizing IT infrastructure, which may include multiple legacy systems from various mergers and acquisitions and integrating software code;\n\u2022Challenges in achieving strategic objectives, cost savings and other expected benefits;\n\u2022Risk that our markets do not evolve as anticipated and that the strategic mergers, acquisitions and divestitures do not prove to be those needed to be successful in those markets;\n\u2022Risk that we assume or retain, or that companies we have merged with or acquired have assumed or retained or otherwise become subject to, significant liabilities that exceed the limitations of any applicable indemnification provisions or the financial resources of any indemnifying parties;\n\u2022Risk that indemnification related to businesses divested or spun off that we may be required to provide or otherwise bear may be significant and could negatively impact our business;\n\u2022Risk that mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, spin offs and other strategic transactions fail to qualify for the intended tax treatment for U.S. Federal income tax purposes, such as a tax-free reorganization in the case of the L3Harris Merger;\n\u2022Risk that we are not able to complete strategic divestitures on satisfactory terms and conditions, including non-competition arrangements applicable to certain of our business lines, or within expected timeframes;\n\u2022Potential loss of key employees or customers of the businesses merged with or acquired or to be divested; and\n\u2022Risk of diverting the attention of senior management from our existing operations.\nChanges in future business or other market conditions could cause business investments and/or recorded goodwill or other long-term assets to become impaired, resulting in substantial losses and write-downs that would materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nFrom time to time, we acquire a minority or majority interest in a business, following careful analysis and due diligence procedures designed to achieve a desired return or strategic objective. These procedures often involve certain assumptions and judgment in determining acquisition price. After acquisition, such assumptions and judgment may prove to have been inaccurate\nand unforeseen issues could arise, which could adversely affect the anticipated returns or which are otherwise not recoverable as an adjustment to the purchase price. Even after careful integration efforts, actual operating results may vary significantly from initial estimates. As of January 1, 2021, we had goodwill of $18.9 billion recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet, the large majority of which was recorded in connection with the L3Harris Merger. We evaluate the recoverability of recorded goodwill annually, as well as when we change reporting units and when events or circumstances indicate there may be an impairment. We test goodwill for impairment at an organizational level referred to as the reporting unit, which is our business segment level or one level below the business segment. The impairment test is based on several factors requiring judgment. Principally, a decrease in expected reporting unit cash flows or changes in market conditions may indicate potential impairment of recorded goodwill. In addition, following the L3Harris Merger, our reporting units are generally one level below the segment level and two of our segments are comprised of several reporting units. During fiscal 2020, we recorded non-cash charges for impairment of goodwill and other assets of $718 million related to our Commercial Aviation Solutions reporting unit due to COVID-related impacts on global air traffic and customer operations. Allocation of goodwill to several reporting units could make it more likely that we will have additional impairment charges in the future. Because of the significance of our goodwill and other intangible assets, any future impairment of these assets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. For additional information on our accounting policies related to impairment of goodwill, see our discussion under \u201cCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d in \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d of this Report and Note 1: Significant Accounting Policies and Note 10: Goodwill in the Notes.\nWe may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the L3Harris Merger or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected. We may also encounter significant difficulties in integrating the businesses.\nOur ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the L3Harris Merger will depend, to a large extent, on our ability to integrate the businesses. The combination of independent businesses is a complex, costly and time-consuming process. As a result, we will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integration activities. The integration process may disrupt the businesses and, if implemented ineffectively, could restrict the realization of the full benefits anticipated. The failure to meet the challenges involved in integrating the businesses and to realize the anticipated benefits of the L3Harris Merger could cause an interruption of or a loss of momentum in our activities and could adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, the overall integration may result in material unanticipated problems, expenses, liabilities, competitive responses, loss of customer relationships and diversion of management\u2019s attention. The difficulties of combining the operations of the companies include, among others:\n\u2022The diversion of management\u2019s attention to integration matters;\n\u2022Difficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings, synergies, business opportunities and growth prospects;\n\u2022Difficulties in the integration of operations and systems;\n\u2022Conforming standards, controls, procedures and accounting and other policies, business cultures and compensation structures between the companies;\n\u2022Difficulties in the assimilation of employees;\n\u2022Difficulties in managing the expanded operations of a significantly larger and more complex company;\n\u2022Difficulties in establishing effective uniform controls, systems, procedures and policies for the combined company;\n\u2022Challenges in keeping existing customers and obtaining new customers;\n\u2022Challenges in attracting and retaining key personnel; and\n\u2022Coordinating a geographically dispersed organization.\nMany of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenue and diversion of management\u2019s time and energy, which could materially impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, even if our operations are integrated successfully, the full benefits of the L3Harris Merger may not be realized, including the synergies, cost savings or sales or growth opportunities that are expected. These benefits may not be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all. Further, additional unanticipated costs may be incurred in the integration. All of these factors could cause dilution to our earnings per share, decrease or delay the expected benefits of the L3Harris Merger and negatively impact the price of our stock. As a result, we can give no assurances that the L3Harris Merger will result in the realization of the full benefits anticipated.", "PERMNO": 25582, "SIC": 3812, "TIC": "LHX"}
