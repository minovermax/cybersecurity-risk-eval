{"cik": "67215", "company": "DYCOM INDUSTRIES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-09-04", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nOur business is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, the risks and uncertainties described below. You should read the following risk factors carefully in connection with evaluating our business and the forward-looking information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If any of the risks described below, or elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K were to occur, our financial condition and results of operations could suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline. Additionally, if other risks not presently known to us, or that we do not currently believe to be significant, occur or become significant, our financial condition and results of operations could suffer and the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nDemand for our services is cyclical and vulnerable to economic downturns affecting the industries we serve. Demand for our services has been, and will likely continue to be, cyclical in nature and vulnerable to downturns in the economy and telecommunications industry. During times of uncertain or slowing economic conditions, our customers often reduce their\ncapital expenditures and defer or cancel pending projects. In addition, uncertain or adverse economic conditions that create volatility in the credit and equity markets may reduce the availability of debt or equity financing for our customers causing them to reduce capital spending. Any reduction in capital spending or deferral or cancellation of projects by our customers could reduce demand for our services, adversely affecting our operations, cash flows, and liquidity. These conditions make it difficult to estimate our customers' demand for our services and add uncertainty to the determination of our backlog.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from master service agreements and long-term contracts which may be canceled by our customers upon notice, may not guaranty a specific amount of work, or which we may be unable to renew on negotiated terms. During fiscal 2015, we derived approximately 79.9% of our revenues from master service agreements and long-term contracts. The majority of these contracts are cancellable by our customers upon notice regardless of whether or not we are in default. In addition, our customers generally have no obligation to assign a specific amount of work to us under these agreements. Consequently, projected expenditures by customers are not assured until a definitive work order is placed with us and the work completed. This makes it difficult to estimate our customers' demand for our services. Furthermore, our customers generally require competitive bidding of these contracts upon expiration of their terms. We may not be able to renew a contract if our competitors reduce their prices and underbid us in order to procure business, or we could be required to lower the price charged for work under the contract being rebid in order to retain the contract. The loss of work obtained through master service agreements and long-term contracts or the reduced profitability of such work could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity.\nThe telecommunications industry has experienced, and may continue to experience, rapid technological, structural, and competitive changes that could reduce the need for our services and adversely affect our revenues. We generate the majority of our revenues from customers in the telecommunications industry. The telecommunications industry is characterized by rapid technological change, intense competition and changing consumer demands. New technologies, or upgrades to existing technologies by customers could reduce the need for our services by enabling telecommunication companies to improve their networks without physically upgrading them. New, developing, or existing services could displace the wireline or wireless systems that we install and that our customers use to deliver services to consumers and businesses. Reduced demand for our services or a loss of a significant customer due to technological changes could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of customers, and the loss of one or more of these customers through industry consolidation or otherwise could adversely affect our revenues and profitability. Our customer base is highly concentrated, with our top five customers accounting for approximately 61.1%, 58.3% and 58.5% of our total revenues in fiscal 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. Revenues under our contracts with significant customers may vary from period to period depending on the timing or volume of work that those customers order or perform with their in-house service organizations. Our revenue could significantly decline if we were to lose one or more of our significant customers or if one or more of our customers elect to do the work we provide with their in-house service teams. Additionally, the telecommunications industry has been characterized by consolidation. In the case of a consolidation, merger or acquisition of an existing customer, the amount of work we receive could be reduced if procurement strategies employed by the surviving entity changes from that of the existing customer or the surviving entity uses a different service provider. The loss of work from a significant customer could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity.\nThe specialty contracting services industry in which we operate is highly competitive. We compete with other specialty contractors, including numerous small, privately owned companies, as well as several large corporations that may have financial, technical, and marketing resources exceeding ours. Relatively few barriers to entry exist in the markets in which we operate. Any organization may become a competitor if they have adequate financial resources, access to technical expertise, and the necessary equipment and materials. Additionally, our competitors may develop expertise, experience and resources to provide services that are equal or superior to our services in both price and quality, and we may not be able to maintain or enhance our competitive position. We also face competition from the in-house service organizations of our customers whose personnel perform some of the services that we provide. We can offer no assurance that our existing or prospective customers will continue to outsource specialty contracting services in the future. Our results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity could be materially and adversely affected if we are unsuccessful in bidding on projects, if our ability to win projects requires that we settle for lesser margins or if our customers reduce the amount of specialty contracting services that are outsourced.\nOur profitability is based on our delivering services within the estimated costs established when pricing our contracts. We recognize revenues under the percentage of completion method of accounting using the units-of-delivery or cost-to-cost measures. For the majority of our contracts, we recognize revenue as each unit is completed under the units-of-delivery percentage of completion method. Due to the fixed price nature of these contracts, our profitability could decline if our actual cost to complete each unit exceeds our original estimates. Under the cost-to-cost measure of completion, we recognize revenue based on the ratio of contract costs incurred to date to total estimated contract costs. Application of the percentage of\ncompletion method of accounting requires the use of estimates of costs to be incurred for the performance of the contract. The cost estimation process is based on the knowledge and experience of our project managers and financial professionals. Any changes in original cost estimates, or the assumptions underpinning such estimates, may result in changes to costs and income. We recognize these changes in the period in which they are determined, potentially resulting in significant changes to previously reported results.\nWe have a significant amount of accounts receivable and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings, which could become uncollectible. We extend credit to our customers as a result of performing work under contract prior to billing for that work. We periodically assess the credit risk of our customers and regularly monitor the timeliness of their payments. However, slowing conditions in the industries we serve, bankruptcies or financial difficulties within the telecommunications sector may impair the financial condition of one or more of our customers and hinder their ability to pay us on a timely basis or at all. As of July 25, 2015, we had net accounts receivable of $315.1 million and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings of $274.7 million. The failure or delay in payment by our customers could reduce our expected cash flows and adversely affect our liquidity and profitability.\nWe retain the risk of loss for certain insurance related liabilities. Within our insurance program, we retain the risk of loss, up to certain limits, for matters related to automobile liability, general liability, workers' compensation, employee group health, and damages associated with underground facility locating services. We are self-insured for the majority of all claims because most claims against us do not exceed the deductibles under our insurance policies. We estimate and develop our accrual for these claims, including losses incurred but not reported, based on facts, circumstances and historical evidence. However, the estimate for accrued insurance claims remains subject to uncertainty as it depends in part on factors not known with precision. These factors include the estimated development of claims, the payment pattern of claims incurred, changes in the medical condition of claimants, and other factors such as inflation, tort reform or other legislative changes, unfavorable jury decisions and court interpretations. Should the cost of actual claims exceed what we have anticipated, our recorded reserves may not be sufficient, and we could incur substantial additional unanticipated charges. See Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies - Accrued Insurance Claims, and Note 8, Accrued Insurance Claims, of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur backlog is subject to reduction or cancellation. Our backlog consists of the estimated uncompleted portion of services to be performed under contractual obligations with our customers. Our backlog estimates represent amounts under master service agreements and other contractual agreements for services projected to be performed over the terms of the contracts and are based on contract terms, our historical experience with customers and, more generally, our experience in similar procurements. The significant majority of our backlog estimates comprise services under master service agreements and long-term contracts. Revenue estimates included in our backlog can be subject to change because of project accelerations, cancellations, or delays due to various factors, including but not limited to commercial issues and adverse weather. These factors can also cause revenue to be realized in different periods or in different amounts from those originally reflected in backlog. In many instances, our customers are not contractually committed to procure specific volumes of services under a contract and may cancel a contract for convenience. Our estimates of a customer's requirements during a particular future period may prove to be inaccurate. As a result, our backlog as of any particular date is an uncertain indicator of future revenues and earnings.\nWe may incur impairment charges on goodwill or other intangible assets. We account for goodwill and other intangibles in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") Accounting Standard Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 350, Intangibles-Goodwill and Other (\"ASC Topic 350\"). Our goodwill resides in multiple reporting units. We assess goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually, as of the first day of the fourth fiscal quarter of each year in order to determine whether their carrying value exceeds their fair value. In addition, reporting units are tested on an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change between annual tests that would more likely than not reduce their fair value below carrying value. If we determine the fair value of the goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets is less than their carrying value as a result of the tests, an impairment loss is recognized. Any such write-down would adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe profitability of individual reporting units may suffer periodically due to downturns in customer demand and the level of overall economic activity, including in particular construction and housing activity. Our customers may reduce capital expenditures and defer or cancel pending projects during times of slowing economic conditions. Additionally, adverse conditions in the economy and future volatility in the equity and credit markets could impact the valuation of our reporting units. The cyclical nature of our business, the high level of competition existing within our industry, and the concentration of our revenues from a limited number of customers may also cause results to vary. These factors may affect individual reporting units disproportionately, relative to the Company as a whole. As a result, the performance of one or more of the reporting units\ncould decline, resulting in an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets. In addition, adverse changes to the key valuation assumptions contributing to the fair value of our reporting units could result in an impairment of goodwill or intangible assets.\nWe may be subject to periodic litigation and regulatory proceedings, including Fair Labor Standards Act and state wage and hour class action lawsuits, which may adversely affect our business and financial performance. From time to time, we may be involved in lawsuits and regulatory actions brought or threatened against us in the ordinary course of business. These actions and proceedings may involve claims for, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, workers' compensation, employment discrimination, breach of contract or property damage. In addition, we may be subject to class action lawsuits involving allegations of violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act and state wage and hour laws. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such actions or proceedings. The outcome of litigation, particularly class action lawsuits and regulatory actions, is difficult to assess or quantify, as plaintiffs may seek recovery of very large or indeterminate amounts in these types of lawsuits, and the magnitude of the potential loss may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. In addition, plaintiffs in many types of actions may seek punitive damages, civil penalties, consequential damages or other losses, or injunctive or declaratory relief. The ultimate resolution of these matters through settlement, mediation, or court judgment could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. These proceedings could result in substantial cost and may require us to devote substantial resources to defend ourselves. For a description of current legal proceedings, see Item 3, Legal Proceedings, and Note 18, Commitments and Contingencies, of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe loss of one or more of our executive officers or other key employees could adversely affect our business. We depend on the services of our executive officers and the senior management of our subsidiaries who have many years of experience in our industry. The loss of any one of them could negatively affect our customer relationships or the ability to execute our business strategy, adversely affecting our operations. Although we have entered into employment agreements with certain of our executive officers and other key employees, we cannot guarantee that any of them or other key management personnel will remain employed by us for any length of time. We do not carry \"key-person\" life insurance on any of our employees.\nOur business is labor intensive, and we may be unable to attract and retain qualified employees. Our ability to employ, train, and retain skilled personnel is necessary to operate our business and maintain productivity and profitability. We cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain the skilled labor force necessary to operate efficiently and support our growth strategy. Our ability to do so depends on a number of factors, such as general rates of employment, competitive demands for employees possessing the skills we need and the level of compensation required to hire and retain qualified employees. In addition, our labor costs may increase when there is a shortage in the supply of skilled personnel and these increases may not be able to be passed on to our customers due to the long term nature of our contracts, thereby adversely affecting our results of operations.\nWe may be unable to secure sufficient independent subcontractors to fulfill our obligations, or our independent subcontractors may fail to satisfy their obligations. We contract with independent subcontractors to help manage fluctuations in work volumes and reduce the amount that we may otherwise be required to expend on fixed assets and working capital. If we are unable to secure independent subcontractors at a reasonable cost or at all, we may be delayed in completing work under a contract or the cost of completing the work may increase. In addition, we may have disputes with these independent subcontractors arising from, among other things, the quality and timeliness of the work they have performed. We may incur additional costs in order to correct such shortfalls in the work performed by subcontractors. Any of these factors could adversely affect the quality of our service, our ability to perform under certain contracts and the relationship with our customers, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity.\nThe nature of our business exposes us to warranty claims, which may reduce our profitability. We typically warrant the services we provide, guaranteeing the work performed against defects in workmanship and the material we supply. Historically, warranty claims have not been material as our customers evaluate much of the work we perform for defects shortly after work is completed. However, if warranty claims occur, we could be required to repair or replace warrantied items at our cost. In addition, our customers may elect to repair or replace the warrantied item by using the services of another provider and require us to pay for the cost of the repair or replacement. Costs incurred as a result of warranty claims could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nHigher fuel prices may increase our cost of doing business, and we may not be able to pass along added costs to customers. Fuel prices fluctuate based on market events outside of our control. Most of our contracts do not allow us to adjust our pricing for higher fuel costs during a contract term and we may be unable to secure price increases reflecting rising costs when renewing or bidding contracts. As a result, higher fuel costs may negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations. Although we may hedge our anticipated fuel purchases with the use of financial instruments, underlying commodity costs have been volatile in recent periods. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that, at any given time, we will have financial instruments in place to hedge against the impact of increased fuel costs. To the extent we enter into hedge transactions, declines\nin fuel prices below the levels established in the financial instruments may require us to make payments, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur results of operations fluctuate seasonally. Our revenues and results of operations exhibit seasonality as we perform a significant portion of our work outdoors. Consequently, extended periods of adverse weather impact our operations. Adverse weather is most likely to occur during the winter, our second and third fiscal quarters. In addition, a disproportionate percentage of paid holidays fall within our second fiscal quarter, which decreases the number of available workdays. Because of these factors, we may experience periods of reduced revenue and profitability. These periods are most likely to occur in the second and/or third quarters of our fiscal year.\nOur financial results include certain estimates and assumptions that may differ from actual results. In preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, a number of estimates and assumptions are made by management that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements. These estimates and assumptions must be made because certain information that is used in the preparation of our financial statements is either dependent on future events or cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from available data. In some instances, these estimates are particularly uncertain and we must exercise significant judgment. Estimates are primarily used in our assessment of the recognition of revenue for costs and estimated earnings under the percentage of completion method of accounting, allowance for doubtful accounts, the fair value of reporting units for goodwill impairment analysis, the assessment of impairment of intangibles and other long-lived assets, the purchase price allocations of businesses acquired, accrued insurance claims, income taxes, asset lives used in computing depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense for performance-based stock awards, and accruals for contingencies, including legal matters. At the time they are made, we believe that such estimates are fair when considered in conjunction with our consolidated financial position and results of operations taken as a whole. However, actual results could differ from those estimates and such differences may be material to our financial statements.\nFailure to integrate future acquisitions successfully could adversely affect our business and results of operations. As part of our growth strategy, we may acquire companies that expand, complement, or diversify our business. We regularly review various opportunities and periodically engage in discussions regarding possible acquisitions. Future acquisitions may divert management's attention from our existing business and expose us to operational challenges and risks, including retaining management and other key employees; unanticipated issues in integrating information, communications and other systems; assumption of unknown liabilities or liabilities for which inadequate reserves have been established; consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures; and failure to manage successfully and coordinate the growth of the combined company. These factors could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management's time and energy which could materially affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nUnanticipated changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income and other tax liabilities could affect our profitability. We are subject to income taxes in many different jurisdictions of the United States and Canada and certain of our tax liabilities are subject to the apportionment of income to different jurisdictions. Changes in the mix of earnings in locations with differing tax rates, the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or tax laws may adversely affect our effective tax rate. An increase to our effective tax rate may increase our tax obligations. In addition, the amount of income and other taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions, and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect our profitability.\nThe indenture under which our senior subordinated notes were issued and our bank credit facility impose restrictions that may prevent us from engaging in beneficial transactions. As of July 25, 2015, we had outstanding an aggregate principal amount of $277.5 million in senior subordinated notes due 2021. We also have a credit agreement with a syndicate of banks, which provides for a $150 million term loan and a $450 million revolving facility, including a sublimit of $200 million for the issuance of letters of credit. As of July 25, 2015, we had $95.3 million of outstanding borrowings under the revolving facility, $150.0 million outstanding under the term loan and $54.4 million of outstanding letters of credit issued under the credit agreement. The terms of our indebtedness contain covenants that restrict our ability to, among other things: make certain payments, including the payment of dividends, redeem or repurchase our capital stock, incur additional indebtedness and issue preferred stock, make investments or create liens, enter into sale and leaseback transactions, merge or consolidate with another entity, sell certain assets, and enter into transactions with affiliates. In addition, the credit agreement requires us to comply with a consolidated leverage ratio and a consolidated interest coverage ratio. A default under our credit agreement or the indenture governing the senior subordinated notes could result in the acceleration of our obligations under either or both of those instruments as a result of cross acceleration and cross default provisions. In addition, these covenants may prevent us from engaging in transactions that benefit us, including responding to changing business and economic conditions or securing additional financing, if needed.\nMany of our telecommunications customers are highly regulated, and new regulations or changes to existing regulations may adversely impact their demand for and the profitability of our specialty contracting service. The Federal Communications Commission (\u201cFCC\u201d) regulates many of our telecommunications customers and may alter its application of current regulations and impose additional regulations. If existing or new regulations adversely affect our telecommunications customers and the profitability of the services they provide, our customers may reduce expenditures, which could affect the demand for specialty contracting services.\nWe may incur liabilities or suffer negative financial impact relating to occupational health and safety matters. Our operations are subject to stringent laws and regulations governing workplace safety. Our workers frequently operate heavy machinery and work near high voltage lines, subjecting them and others to potential injury or death. If any of our workers or other persons are injured or killed in the course of our operations, we could be found to have violated relevant safety regulations, resulting in a fine or, in extreme cases, criminal sanction. In addition, if our safety record were to deteriorate substantially over time, customers could decide to cancel our contracts or not award us future business.\nOur failure to comply with environmental laws could result in significant liabilities. A significant portion of the work we perform is associated with the underground networks of our customers. We could be subject to potential material liabilities in the event we cause or are responsible for a release of hazardous substances or other environmental damage. Liabilities for contamination or exposure to hazardous materials, or failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations could result in significant costs including clean-up costs, fines, criminal sanctions for violations, and third party claims for property damage or personal injury. These costs as well as any direct impact to ongoing operations could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. In addition, new laws and regulations, altered enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or leaks, or the imposition of new clean-up requirements could require us to incur significant costs or create new or increased liabilities that could harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not have access in the future to sufficient funding to finance desired growth. Using cash for operational growth, capital expenditures, share repurchases, or acquisitions may limit our financial flexibility and make us more likely to seek additional capital through future debt or equity financings. Our existing debt agreements contain significant restrictions on our operational and financial flexibility, including our ability to incur additional debt. In addition, if we seek to incur more debt, we may be required to agree to additional covenants that further limit our operational and financial flexibility. If we pursue additional debt or equity financings, we cannot be certain that such funding will be available on terms acceptable to us or at all.\nOur capital expenditures may fluctuate because of changes in business requirements. Our anticipated capital expenditure requirements may vary from time to time because of changes in our business. Increased capital expenditures will use cash flow and may increase our borrowing costs if cash for capital expenditures is not available from operations.\nIncreases in our health insurance costs could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows. The costs of employee health care insurance have been increasing in recent years due to rising health care costs, legislative changes, and general economic conditions. Additionally, we may incur additional costs because of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the \"Health Care Reform Laws\"). Provisions of these laws have become and will become effective in calendar 2015 and at various dates over the next several years. Because of the breadth and complexity of these laws, the lack of regulations and guidance on implementation, and the phased-in nature of the new regulations, as well as other health care reform legislation considered by Congress and state legislations, we cannot predict with certainty the future effect of these laws on us. A continued increase in health care costs or additional costs incurred as a result of the Health Care Reform Laws or other future health care reform laws imposed by Congress or state legislations could have a negative impact on our financial position and results of operations.\nSeveral of our subsidiaries participate in multiemployer pension plans under which we could incur material liabilities in certain circumstances. Pursuant to collective bargaining agreements, several of our subsidiaries participate in various multiemployer pension plans that generally provide defined pension benefits to covered employees. Because of the nature of multiemployer plans, there are risks associated with participation in these plans that differ from single-employer plans. Assets contributed by an employer to a multiemployer plan are not segregated into a separate account and are not restricted to provide benefits only to employees of that contributing employer. Under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, absent an applicable exception, a contributing employer to an underfunded multiemployer plan is liable upon termination or withdrawal from a plan, for its proportionate share of the plan's unfunded vested liability. We currently do not intend to withdraw from any multiemployer plan in which we participate. However, a future withdrawal from a multiemployer pension plan in which we participate could result in a material withdrawal liability to the extent that any unfunded vested liability under such plan is allocable to the Company. In addition, if any of the plans in which we participate becomes underfunded as defined by the Pension Protection Act of 2006, we may be required to make additional cash contributions related to the underfunding of those plans.\nFailure to protect critical data and technology systems adequately could materially affect our operations. We use our own information technology systems as well as those of our business partners to maintain certain data and provide reports. Third-party security breaches, employee error, malfeasance or other irregularity may compromise our measures to protect these systems and may result in persons obtaining unauthorized access to our or our customers' data or accounts. The occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile. During fiscal 2015, our common stock fluctuated from a low of $25.67 per share to a high of $69.62. We may continue to experience significant volatility in the market price of our common stock due to numerous factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022fluctuations in our operating results or the operating results of one or more of our competitors;\n\u2022announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions or capital commitments;\n\u2022changes in recommendations or earnings estimates by securities analysts; and\n\u2022the impact of economic conditions on the credit and stock markets and on our customers\u2019 demand for our services.\nIn addition, factors unrelated to our operating performance, such as market disruptions, industry outlook, general economic conditions, and political events, could decrease the market price of our common stock and, as a result, investors could lose some or all of their investments.\nAnti-takeover provisions of Florida law and provisions in our articles of incorporation and by-laws could make it more difficult to effect an acquisition of our company or a change in our control. Certain provisions of our articles of incorporation and by-laws could delay or prevent an acquisition or change in control and the replacement of our incumbent directors and management. For example, our board of directors is divided into three classes. At any annual meeting of our shareholders, our shareholders only have the right to appoint approximately one-third of the directors on our board of directors. In addition, our articles of incorporation authorize our board of directors, without further shareholder approval, to issue up to 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock on such terms and with such rights as our board of directors may determine. The issuance of preferred stock could dilute the voting power of the holders of common stock, including by the grant of voting control to others. Our by-laws also restrict the right of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders. Lastly, we are subject to certain anti-takeover provisions of the Florida Business Corporation Act. These anti-takeover provisions could discourage or prevent a change in control.", "PERMNO": 12008, "SIC": 1623, "TIC": "DY"}
