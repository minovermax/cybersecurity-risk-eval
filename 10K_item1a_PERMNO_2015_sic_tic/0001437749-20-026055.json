{"cik": "1023844", "company": "NATIONAL HOLDINGS CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-12-29", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe financial statements contained in this report and the related discussions describe and analyze our financial performance and condition for the periods indicated. For the most part, this information is historical. Our prior results, however, are not necessarily indicative of our future performance or financial condition. We, therefore, have included the following discussion of certain factors that could affect our future performance or financial condition. These factors could cause our future performance or financial condition to differ materially from our prior performance or financial condition or from management\u2019s expectations or estimates of our future performance or financial condition. These factors, among others, should be considered in assessing our future prospects and prior to making an investment decision with respect to our stock. The COVID-19 pandemic has heightened, and in some cases manifested, certain of the risks we normally face in operating our business. The risks described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe may require additional financing but may not be able to obtain it, which could impair our business and financial condition.\nIn order to achieve profitability, we periodically may need to obtain additional financing, either through borrowings, public offerings, private offerings, or make acquisitions or some type of business combination (e.g., merger, buyout, etc.). The availability of additional financing, including access to the credit and capital markets, depends on a variety of factors, such as conditions in the debt and equity markets, the general availability of credit, the volume of securities trading activity and the overall availability of credit to the financial services sector. We may not be successful in any attempts to obtain additional financing. Failure to generate adequate cash from our operations or find sources of funding would require us to scale back or curtail our operations, including limiting our efforts to recruit additional registered representatives or acquire other businesses, and would have an adverse impact on our business and financial condition.\nOur investment banking activities place our capital at risk and subject us to potential liability under the securities laws.\nParticipation in an underwriting syndicate or a selling group involves both economic and regulatory risks. An underwriter may incur losses if it is unable to resell the securities it has committed to purchase or if it is forced to liquidate its commitment at less than the purchase price. In addition, under federal securities laws, other laws and court decisions with respect to underwriters\u2019 liabilities and limitations on the indemnification of underwriters by issuers, an underwriter is subject to substantial potential liability for misstatements or omissions of material facts in prospectuses and other communications with respect to such offerings. Acting as a managing underwriter increases these risks. Underwriting commitments constitute a charge against net capital and our ability to make underwriting commitments may be limited by the requirement that NSC, WEC and FSIC must at all times be in compliance with the Net Capital Rule.\nOur risk management policies and procedures may leave us exposed to unidentified risks or an unanticipated level of risk.\nThe policies and procedures we employ to identify, monitor and manage risks may not be fully effective. Some methods of risk management are based on the use of observed historical market behavior. As a result, these methods may not accurately predict future risk exposures, which could be significantly greater than the historical measures indicate. Other risk management methods depend on evaluation of information regarding markets, clients or other matters that are publicly available or otherwise accessible by us. This information may not be accurate, complete, up-to-date or properly evaluated. Management of operational, legal and regulatory risks requires, among other things, policies and procedures to properly record and verify a large number of transactions and events. We cannot ensure that our policies and procedures will effectively and accurately record and verify this information. We seek to monitor and control our risk exposure through a variety of separate but complementary financial, credit, operational and legal reporting systems. We believe that we are able to evaluate and manage the market, credit and other risks to which we are exposed. Nonetheless, our ability to manage risk exposure can never be completely assured. For example, unexpectedly large or rapid movements or disruptions in one or more markets or other unforeseen developments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. The consequences of these developments can include losses due to adverse changes in inventory values, decreases in the liquidity of trading positions, higher volatility in earnings, increases in our credit risk to customers as well as to third parties and increases in general systemic risk.\nWe depend on senior employees and the loss of their services could harm our business.\nWe depend on the continued services of our management team, as well as our ability to hire additional members of management, and to retain and motivate other officers and key employees. We may not be able to find appropriate replacements if the need should arise. Due to the regulated nature of some of our businesses, some of our executive officers, or other key personnel, could become subject to suspensions or other limitations on the scope of their services to us from time to time. If we lose the services of any executive officers or other key personnel, we may not be able to manage and grow our operations effectively, enter new brokerage markets or develop new products.\nFailure to comply with the net capital requirements could subject us to sanctions imposed by the SEC or FINRA.\nNSC, WEC and FSIC are subject to the Net Capital Rule, which, among other things, requires the maintenance of minimum net capital. At September 30, 2020, NSC had net capital of $3,812,891 which was $2,812,891 in excess of its required minimum net capital of $1,000,000, WEC had net capital of $467,947 which was $305,992 in excess of its required minimum net capital of $161,955, and FSIC had net capital of $117,538 which was $112,538 in excess of its required minimum net capital of $5,000. WEC's ratio of aggregate indebtedness to net capital was 5.2 to 1, FSIC's ratio of aggregate indebtedness to net capital was 0.2 to 1.\nThe Net Capital Rule is designed to measure the general financial integrity and liquidity of a broker-dealer. Compliance with the Net Capital Rule limits those operations of broker-dealers that require the intensive use of their capital, such as underwriting commitments and principal trading activities. The Net Capital Rule also limits the ability of securities firms to pay dividends or make payments on certain indebtedness, such as subordinated debt, as it matures. FINRA may enter the offices of a broker-dealer at any time, without notice, and calculate the firm\u2019s net capital. If the calculation reveals a deficiency in net capital, FINRA may immediately restrict or suspend certain or all of the activities of a broker-dealer. NSC, WEC and FSIC may not be able to maintain adequate net capital, or their net capital may fall below the minimum requirements established by the SEC, which could subject us to disciplinary action in the form of fines, censure, suspension, expulsion or the termination of business altogether. In addition, if the Net Capital Rule is changed or expanded, or if there is an unusually large charge against net capital, operations that require the intensive use of capital would be limited. A large operating loss or charge against net capital could adversely affect our ability to expand or even maintain present levels of business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business could be adversely affected by a breakdown in the financial markets.\nThe business of NSC, WEC and NAM is materially affected by conditions in the financial markets and the economy generally, both in the United States and elsewhere around the world. Many factors or events could lead to a breakdown in the financial markets including political turmoil, war, terrorism, natural catastrophes and other types of disasters. These types of events could cause people to begin to lose confidence in the financial markets and their ability to function effectively. If the financial markets are unable to effectively prepare for these types of events and ease public concern over their ability to function, our revenues would likely decline and our operations would likely be adversely affected.\nDamage to our reputation could damage our businesses.\nMaintaining our reputation is critical to attracting and maintaining clients, investors and associates. If we fail to address, or appear to fail to address, issues that may give rise to reputational risk, we could significantly harm our business prospects. These issues may include, but are not limited to, appropriately dealing with potential conflicts of interest, legal and regulatory requirements, ethical issues, money laundering, cybersecurity and privacy, record-keeping, and sales and trading practices, the failure to sell securities we have underwritten at anticipated price levels, and the proper identification of the legal, reputational, credit, liquidity, and market risks inherent in our products. Failure to maintain appropriate service and quality standards, or a failure or perceived failure to treat clients fairly can result in client dissatisfaction, litigation and heightened regulatory scrutiny, all of which can lead to lost revenue, higher operating costs and reputational harm. Negative publicity about us, whether or not true, may also harm our future business prospects.\nThe number and size of the transactions in which we provide services may decline in adverse market or economic conditions, which may adversely affect our revenues, results of operations and stockholders\u2019 equity.\nUnfavorable financial or economic conditions may reduce the number and size of the transactions in which we provide underwriting services, merger and acquisition consulting and other services. Our investment banking revenues, in the form of financial advisory, placement agent and underwriting fees, are directly related to the number and size of the transactions in which we participate and would therefore be adversely affected by a sustained market downturn. Additionally, a downturn in market conditions could lead to a decline in the volume of transactions that we execute for our customers and, therefore, to a decline in the revenues we receive from commissions and spreads. We must review customer relationships for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that impairment may be present. A significant decrease in revenues or cash flows derived from acquired customer relationships could result in a material, non-cash write-down of customer relationships. Such impairment may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and stockholders\u2019 equity.\nThe novel coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) and the response to it have negatively affected the global economy and financial markets and have disrupted and may further disrupt our operations and our registered representatives\u2019 operations, and we expect these circumstances, and potentially other, related circumstances that are unpredictable at this time, to have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition.\nIn December 2019, an outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus, commonly referred to as COVID-19, began in Wuhan, China. The World Health Organization has declared the outbreak a pandemic and a global public health emergency. In addition to those who have been directly affected, millions more have been affected by government efforts in the United States and around the world to slow the spread of the pandemic through quarantines, travel restrictions, heightened border scrutiny and other measures. The pandemic and measures taken in response by governments, private industry, individuals and others have also had significant direct and indirect adverse impacts on businesses and commerce as financial markets have been disrupted; facilities and production have been suspended; and demand for certain goods and services has spiked, while demand for other goods and services has decreased significantly.\nThe Company\u2019s management put cost-savings plans into effect to mitigate the cash drain that potential, downward pressure on its business might cause. In particular, the Company\u2019s management made the very difficult decision to downsize its staff, significantly reduce compensation for many employees and implement moratoriums in variable spending categories.\nThe future progression of the pandemic and its effects on our business and operations are highly uncertain. The pandemic has significantly impacted market valuations, resulting in significant inventory losses, and caused investment banking deals to be delayed, deferred and/or canceled, and may continue to do so. In addition, a sustained and continuing market downturn could lead to declines in customer trading volumes and, therefore, to a decline in the revenues we receive from commissions and transactions fees and clearing services. Furthermore, investment advisory fees have been and may continue to be negatively impacted by decreased market valuations. These developments have negatively impacted, and will likely continue to negatively impact, our liquidity position and our growth strategy.\nWe have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, disruptions in our operations and our registered representatives\u2019 operations. If members of our management and other key personnel in critical functions across our organization are unable to perform their duties or have limited availability due to COVID-19, we may not be able to execute on our business strategy and/or our operations may be negatively impacted. We may also experience limitations in employee resources, including because of the downsizing and salary reductions we have completed, sickness of employees or their families or the desire of employees to avoid contact with individuals or large groups of people.\nThe coronavirus pandemic continues to rapidly evolve. There may be other material adverse impacts on our business, operations and financial condition that are unpredictable at this time, including difficulties in recruiting registered representatives and qualified employees during the pandemic and once it subsides. The extent of the impact of COVID-19 on our operational and financial performance will depend on certain developments, including the duration and spread of the outbreak and impact on our employees, registered representatives, clients and the markets in which we operate our businesses, all of which are uncertain at this time and cannot be predicted.\nWe may experience trading losses due to market fluctuations and volatility, which may reduce our revenues and profitability.\nFinancial markets are susceptible to rapid depreciation in asset values accompanied by a reduction in asset liquidity. Our revenue and profitability may be adversely affected by declines in the volume of securities transactions and in market liquidity. Additionally, our profitability may be adversely affected by losses from the trading or underwriting of securities or failure of third parties to meet commitments. We act as a market maker in publicly traded shares of common stock. In market making transactions, we undertake the risk of price changes on the stock we hold in positions, or being unable to resell the shares of common stock we hold, or being unable to purchase the common stock we have sold but not yet purchased. These risks are heightened by the illiquidity of many of the shares of common stock we trade and/or in which we make a market. Any losses from our trading activities, including as a result of unauthorized trading by our employees, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nLower securities prices may also result in a reduced volume of transactions, as well as losses from declines in the market value of common stock held for trading purposes. During periods of declining volume and revenue, our profitability would be adversely affected. Declines in market values of shares of common stock and the failure of issuers and third parties to perform their obligations can result in illiquid markets.\nWe generally maintain trading and investment positions in the equity markets. To the extent that we own assets, i.e., have long positions, a downturn in those markets could result in losses from a decline in the value of such long positions. Conversely, to the extent that we have sold assets that we do not own, i.e., have short positions in any of those markets, an upturn could expose us to potentially unlimited losses as we attempt to cover our short positions by acquiring assets in a rising market.\nWe may, from time to time, have an arbitrage trading strategy consisting of holding a long position in one asset and a short position in another from which we expect to earn revenues based on changes in the relative value of the two assets. If, however, the relative value of the two assets changes in a direction or manner that we did not anticipate or against which we have not hedged, we might realize a loss in those paired positions. In addition, we maintain trading positions that can be adversely affected by the level of volatility in the financial markets.\nWe are a holding company and depend on payments from our subsidiaries.\nWe depend on dividends, distributions and other payments from our subsidiaries to fund our obligations. Regulatory and other legal restrictions may limit our ability to transfer funds freely, either to or from our subsidiaries. In particular, NSC and WEC are subject to laws and regulations that authorize regulatory bodies to block or reduce the flow of funds to the parent holding company, or that prohibit such transfers altogether in certain circumstances. These laws and regulations may hinder our ability to access funds that we may need to make payments on our obligations. In addition, because our interests in our subsidiaries consist of equity interests, our rights may be subordinated to the claims of the creditors of these subsidiaries.\nWe face strong competition from other financial firms, some of which have greater resources than we do, which may have a negative effect on our business.\nWe compete directly with national and regional full-service broker-dealers and a broad range of other financial service firms, including banks and insurance companies. Competition has increased as smaller securities firms have been acquired by or merged into other firms. Mergers and acquisitions have increased competition from these firms, many of which have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing, name recognition and other resources than we do. Many of these firms offer their customers more products and research than we currently offer. These competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities, technologies and client requirements. We also face competition from companies offering discount and/or electronic brokerage services, including brokerage services provided over the Internet, which we currently do not offer or intend to offer in the foreseeable future. These competitors may have lower costs or provide more services, and may offer their customers more favorable commissions, fees or other terms than those offered by us. If we are unable to compete effectively with our competitors, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nThe continued growth of electronic trading and the introduction of new technologies is changing our market-making business and presenting new challenges. Securities, futures and options transactions are increasingly occurring electronically, through alternative trading systems. The trend toward alternative trading systems will likely continue to accelerate. This acceleration could further increase program trading, increase the speed of transactions and decrease our ability to participate in transactions as principal, which would reduce the profitability of our market-making business. Some of these alternative trading systems compete with our market-making business, and we may experience continued competitive pressures in these and other areas.\nGovernment initiatives that simplify tax return preparation could reduce the need for tax preparation services as a third party tax return preparer.\nMany taxpayers seek assistance from paid tax return preparers such as our National Tax subsidiary, because of the level of complexity involved in the tax return preparation and filing process. From time to time, government officials propose measures seeking to simplify the preparation and filing of tax returns or to provide additional assistance with respect to preparing and filing such tax returns. The passage of any measures that significantly simplify tax return preparation or otherwise reduce the need for a third party tax return preparer could reduce demand for our services which may adversely affect operating results. Additionally, from time to time, the United States Treasury Department and the IRS adopt policy and rule changes and other initiatives that result in a decrease in the number of tax returns filed or reduce the size of tax refunds. Such changes in the tax law could reduce demand for our services, causing our operating results to be adversely affected.\nIf we do not continue to develop and enhance our services in a timely manner, our business may be harmed.\nOur future success will depend on our ability to develop and enhance our services and add new services. We operate in a very competitive industry in which the ability to develop and deliver advanced services through the Internet and other channels is a key competitive factor. There are significant risks in the development of new or enhanced services, including the risks that we will be unable to:\n\u2022\neffectively use new technologies;\n\u2022\nadapt our services to emerging industry or regulatory standards; or\n\u2022\nmarket new or enhanced services.\nIf we are unable to develop and introduce new or enhanced services quickly enough to respond to market or customer requirements or to comply with emerging industry standards, or if these services do not achieve market acceptance, our business could be seriously harmed.\nWe are currently subject to extensive securities regulation and the failure to comply with these regulations could subject us to penalties or sanctions.\nThe securities industry and our business are subject to extensive regulation by the SEC, state securities regulators and other governmental regulatory authorities. We are also regulated by industry self-regulatory organizations, such as FINRA. NSC, WEC and FSIC are registered broker-dealers with the SEC and member firms of FINRA. Broker-dealers are subject to regulations which cover all aspects of the securities business, including sales methods and supervision, trading practices among broker-dealers, use and safekeeping of customers\u2019 funds and securities, capital structure of securities firms, record keeping, and the conduct of directors, officers and employees. Changes in laws or regulations or in governmental policies could cause us to change the way we conduct our business, which could adversely affect our businesses and results of operations.\nCompliance with many of the regulations applicable to our subsidiaries involves a number of risks, particularly in areas where applicable regulations may be subject to varying interpretation. These regulations often serve to limit our activities, including through net capital, customer protection and market conduct requirements. If we are found to have violated an applicable regulation, administrative or judicial proceedings may be initiated against us that may result in a censure, fine, civil penalties, issuance of cease-and-desist orders, the deregistration or suspension of our regulated activities, the suspension or disqualification of our officers or employees, or other adverse consequences. The imposition of any of these or other penalties could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nWe rely on clearing brokers and unilateral termination of the agreements with these clearing brokers could disrupt our business.\nNSC and WEC are introducing brokerage firms that use third party clearing brokers to process their securities transactions and maintain customer accounts. The clearing brokers also provide billing services, extend credit and provide for control and receipt, custody and delivery of securities. We depend on the operational capacity and ability of the clearing brokers for the orderly processing of transactions. In addition, by engaging the processing services of a clearing firm, we are exempt from some capital reserve requirements and other regulatory requirements imposed by federal and state securities laws. If the clearing agreements are unilaterally terminated for any reason, we would be forced to find alternative clearing firms without adequate time to negotiate the terms of a new clearing agreement and without adequate time to plan for such change. There can be no assurance that if there were a unilateral termination of a clearing agreement that we would be able to find an alternative clearing firm on acceptable terms or at all.\nOur clearing brokers extend credit to our clients and we are liable if the clients do not pay.\nWe permit our clients to purchase securities on a margin basis or sell securities short, which means that the clearing firm extends credit to the client secured by cash and securities in the client\u2019s account. During periods of volatile markets, the value of the collateral held by clearing brokers could fall below the amount borrowed by the client. If margin requirements are not sufficient to cover losses, the clearing brokers sell or buy securities at prevailing market prices, and may incur losses to satisfy client obligations. We have agreed to indemnify our clearing brokers for losses they incur while extending credit to our clients.\nCredit risk exposes us to losses caused by financial or other problems experienced by third parties.\nWe are exposed to the risk that third parties that owe us money, securities or other assets will not perform their obligations. These parties include trading counterparts, customers, clearing agents, exchanges, clearing houses, and other financial intermediaries as well as issuers whose securities we hold. These parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons. This risk may arise, for example, from holding securities of third parties, executing securities trades that fail to settle at the required time due to non-delivery by the counterparty or systems failure by clearing agents, exchanges, clearing houses or other financial intermediaries, and extending credit to clients through bridge or margin loans or other arrangements. Significant failures by third parties to perform their obligations to us could adversely affect our revenues and perhaps our ability to borrow in the credit markets.\nAdverse results of litigation, including under the securities laws, would result in financial losses and divert management\u2019s attention from our business.\nMany aspects of our business involve substantial risks of liability. There is a risk of litigation and arbitration within the securities industry, including class action suits seeking substantial damages. We are subject to actual and potential claims by dissatisfied customers, including claims alleging they were damaged by improper sales practices such as unauthorized trading, sale of unsuitable securities, use of false or misleading statements in the sale of securities, mismanagement and breach of fiduciary duty. Even if the allegations involve acts by our retail brokers that we did not authorize, we could be liable if we fail to adequately supervise their conduct. As an underwriter, we may be subject to substantial potential liability under federal and state laws and court decisions, including liability for material misstatements and omissions in securities offerings. We may be required to contribute to a settlement, defense costs or a final judgment in legal proceedings or arbitrations involving a past underwriting and in actions that may arise in the future. We carry \u201cErrors and Omissions\u201d insurance to protect against such legal actions, however, our policy is limited in items and amounts covered and there can be no assurance that it will cover a particular complaint. Defending such actions would divert management's attention from running our business, and the adverse resolution of any legal proceeding involving us and/or our subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nFinancial services firms have been subject to increased scrutiny over the last several years, increasing the risk of financial liability and reputational harm resulting from adverse regulatory actions.\nFirms in the financial services industry have been operating in a difficult regulatory environment which we expect will become even more stringent in light of recent well-publicized failures of regulators to detect and prevent fraud. The industry has experienced increased scrutiny from a variety of regulators, including the SEC, the NYSE, FINRA and state attorneys general. Penalties and fines sought by regulatory authorities have increased substantially over the last several years. This regulatory and enforcement environment has created uncertainty with respect to a number of transactions that had historically been entered into by financial services firms and that were generally believed to be permissible and appropriate. We may be adversely affected by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules by these governmental authorities and self-regulatory organizations. Each of the regulatory bodies with jurisdiction over us has regulatory powers dealing with many aspects of financial services, including, but not limited to, the authority to fine us and to grant, cancel, restrict or otherwise impose conditions on the right to carry on particular businesses. For example, a failure to comply with the obligations imposed by the Exchange Act on broker-dealers and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 on investment advisers, including record-keeping, advertising and operating requirements, disclosure obligations and prohibitions on fraudulent activities, or by the Investment Company Act of 1940, could result in investigations, sanctions and reputational damage. We also may be adversely affected as a result of new or revised legislation or regulations imposed by the SEC, other U.S. or foreign governmental regulatory authorities or FINRA or other self-regulatory organizations that supervise the financial markets. Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us could have adverse financial effects on us or cause reputational harm to us, which could harm our business prospects.\nAsset management businesses have experienced a number of highly publicized regulatory inquiries which have resulted in increased scrutiny within the industry and new rules and regulations for mutual funds, investment advisors and broker-dealers. NAM is registered as an investment advisor with the SEC and the regulatory scrutiny and rulemaking initiatives may result in an increase in operational and compliance costs or the assessment of significant fines or penalties against our asset management business, and may otherwise limit our ability to engage in certain activities. In addition, the SEC staff has conducted studies with respect to soft dollar practices in the brokerage and asset management industries and proposed interpretive guidance regarding the scope of permitted brokerage and research services in connection with soft dollar practices. The SEC staff has indicated that it is considering additional rulemaking in this and other areas, and we cannot predict the effect that additional rulemaking may have on our asset management or brokerage business or whether it will be adverse to us. Certain investment advisors and/or the investment management products they advise are also subject to regulations by various regulatory authorities outside the U.S. including the U.K. FCA, the Swedish FCA and the European Securities and Market Authority and may indirectly be subject to MiFID II regulations. Moreover, recent rulemaking by the SEC and certain non-U.S. regulatory bodies have imposed trading restrictions and reporting requirements on short selling, which have impacted certain of the investment strategies implemented on behalf of the Company's Funds, and continued restrictions on or further regulations of short sales could also negatively impact their performance. It is impossible to determine the extent of the impact of any new laws, regulations or initiatives that may be proposed, or whether any of the proposals will become law. Compliance with any new laws or regulations could make compliance more difficult and expensive and affect the manner in which we conduct business.\nIt is difficult to predict what other changes may be instituted in the future in the regulation of us or the markets in which we invest, or the counterparties with which we do business, in addition to those changes already proposed or adopted in the U.S. or other countries. Any such regulation could have a material adverse effect on our business prospect.\nFinally, financial services firms are subject to numerous perceived or actual conflicts of interest, which have drawn and which we expect will continue to draw scrutiny from the SEC and other federal and state regulators. For example, the research areas of investment banks have been and remain the subject of heightened regulatory scrutiny, which has led to increased restrictions on the interaction between equity research analysts and investment banking personnel at securities firms. Regulations have also been focusing on potential conflicts of interest or issues relating to impermissible disclosure of material nonpublic information. Appropriately dealing with conflicts interest is complex and difficult, and our reputation could be damaged if it fails to do so. Such policies and procedures to address or limit actual or perceived conflicts may also result in increased costs, additional operational personnel and increased regulatory risk. Failure to adhere to these policies and procedures may result in regulatory sanctions or client litigation.\nThe potential for conflicts of interest within the Company, and a failure to appropriately identify and deal with conflicts of interest could adversely affect our businesses.\nDue to the combination of our investment management and broker-dealer businesses, we face an increased potential for conflicts of interest, including situations where our services to a particular client or investor or our own interests in our investments conflict with the interests of another client. Such conflicts may also arise if our broker-dealer business has access to material non-public information that may not be shared with our investment management business or vice versa. Further, our relationship with B. Riley as both a competitor and significant stockholder gives rise to the potential for additional conflicts of interest. Additionally, our regulators have the ability to scrutinize our activities for potential conflicts of interest, including through detailed examinations of specific transactions.\nAppropriately identifying and dealing with conflicts of interest is complex and difficult, and the willingness of clients to enter into transactions or engagements in which such a conflict might arise may be affected if we fail to identify and appropriately address potential conflicts of interest. In addition, potential or perceived conflicts could give rise to litigation or enforcement actions.\nWe face significant competition for registered representatives.\nOur retail brokerage business is dependent upon a large number of both independent contractor and employee registered representatives. We are exposed to the risk that a large group of registered representatives could decide to affiliate with another firm and we could be unable to recruit suitable replacements, which could have a material adverse impact on our ability to generate revenue in the retail brokerage business.\nA change in the \u201cindependent contractor\u201d status of registered representatives would adversely affect us.\nIndependent contractor registered representatives operate from their own offices and are responsible in large part for the costs and expenses involved in their operations. As of September 30, 2020, we had a total of approximately 1,010 associates, of which 620 were independent contractors. The enactment of any legislation that would affect the eligibility requirements for independent contractor status could have a significant effect on this business model and lead to additional costs and expenses, which could have a material adverse on our results of operations.\nWe run the risk that employee and independent contractor misconduct could occur.\nMisconduct by employees and independent contractors could include:\n\u2022\nemployees and independent contractors binding us to transactions that exceed authorized limits or present unacceptable risks to us;\n\u2022\nemployees and independent contractors hiding unauthorized or unsuccessful activities from us; or\n\u2022\nthe improper use of confidential information.\nThese types of misconduct could result in unknown and unmanaged risks or losses to us including regulatory sanctions and serious harm to our reputation. The precautions we take to prevent and detect these activities may not be effective. If employee and independent contractor misconduct does occur, our business operations could be materially adversely affected.\nInternet and internal computer system failures could damage our reputation and harm our business.\nWe are increasingly dependent upon technology systems and data to operate our business. In particular, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused us to modify our business practices. As a result, we are increasingly dependent upon our technology systems to operate our business and our ability to effectively manage our business depends on the security, reliability and adequacy of our technology systems and data.\nOur internal computer systems are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, unauthorized access, natural disasters, terrorism, war and telecommunication and electrical failures. The size and complexity of our information technology systems and the confidential information stored on those systems, including financial information of our clients, make such systems vulnerable to service interruptions or to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees, third-party vendors and/or business partners, or from cyber-attacks by malicious third parties. Cyber-attacks are increasing in their frequency, sophistication and intensity, and have become increasingly difficult to detect. Cyber-attacks could include the deployment of harmful malware, ransomware, denial-of-service attacks, social engineering and other means to affect service reliability and threaten the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information. Cyber-attacks also could include phishing attempts or e-mail fraud to cause payments or information to be transmitted to an unintended recipient.\nWhile we have not experienced a system failure, accident, cyber-attack or security breach that has resulted in a material interruption in our operations to date, if such an event were to occur, it could result in a material disruption of our development programs and our business operations. Additionally, any such event that leads to unauthorized access, use or disclosure of personal information, including personal information regarding our clients or employees, could harm our reputation, cause us not to comply with federal and/or state breach notification laws and foreign law equivalents and otherwise subject us to liability under laws and regulations that protect the privacy and security of personal information. Security breaches and other inappropriate access can be difficult to detect, and any delay in identifying them may lead to increased harm of the type described above. While we have implemented security measures to protect our information technology systems and infrastructure, there can be no assurance that such measures will prevent service interruptions or security breaches that could adversely affect our business and cause financial losses, liability to clients, regulatory sanctions and damage to our reputation.\nProcedures and requirements of the Patriot Act and similar laws may expose us to significant costs or penalties.\nAs a financial services firm, we are subject to laws and regulations, including the Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism Act of 2001 (the \u201cPatriot Act\u201d), that require that we know our customers and monitor transactions for suspicious financial activities. The cost of complying with the Patriot Act and related laws and regulations is significant. We face the risk that our policies, procedures, technology and personnel directed toward complying with the Patriot Act and similar laws and regulations are insufficient and that we could be subject to significant criminal and civil penalties or reputational damage due to noncompliance. Such penalties and subsequent remediation costs could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nOur principal stockholders, including B. Riley, as well as our directors and officers, control a large percentage of shares of our common stock, and can control our corporate actions.\nAs of September 30, 2020, B. Riley owned approximately 45.2% of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock. As a result B. Riley may be able to control most, if not all, of our corporate actions, including the election of directors, the appointment of officers, and potential merger or acquisition transactions, subject to restrictions on B. Riley's ability to take certain actions, including with respect to our Board, as set forth in the B. Riley Agreement. The concentration of the ownership of the shares of our common stock may also serve to limit the trading volume of our common stock. The common stock of B. Riley is traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market.\nUnder our agreement with B. Riley, B. Riley agreed to certain customary standstill provisions, effective as of the date of the B. Riley Agreement through December 31, 2021. Additionally, we have granted to B. Riley the right to appoint up to two B. Riley representatives to attend meetings of the Board and any committee thereof in a non-voting observer capacity. The B. Riley Agreement further permits B. Riley to participate pro rata in any bona fide common stock equity offering by us if the offering price of the Company\u2019s common stock in such offering is equal to or less than $3.25 per share, as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, stock combinations and similar events, subject to certain exceptions. This participation right will end upon the earlier of (x) the end of the Standstill Period and (y) a change in control of the Company, as defined in the B. Riley Agreement. On April 30, 2020, B. Riley and the Company entered into a limited waiver of certain provisions of the B. Riley Agreement and in connection therewith, B. Riley sent the Board a letter containing a proposal regarding the Company. The Board formed a Special Committee of non-executive, independent directors to review the B. Riley proposal.\nOur common stock has low trading volume and any sale of a significant number of shares is likely to depress the trading price.\nOur common stock is traded on the Nasdaq Capital Market under the symbol \u201cNHLD\u201d. Traditionally, the trading volume of our common stock has been limited. For the 30 trading days ending on September 30, 2020, the average daily trading volume was approximately 10,000 shares per day. During such 30-day period the closing price of our common stock ranged from a high of $2.53 to a low of $2.08. We expect that this limited trading volume will continue due to the concentrated ownership of our common stock by B. Riley. Because of this limited trading volume, holders of our common stock may not be able to sell quickly any significant number of such shares, and any attempted sale of a large number of our shares will likely have a material adverse impact on the price of our common stock. Because of the limited number of shares being traded, the price per share is subject to volatility and may continue to be subject to rapid price swings in the future.\nThe price of our common stock is volatile.\nThe price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially. The market price of our common stock may be highly volatile as a result of factors specific to us and the securities markets in general. Factors affecting volatility may include:\n\u2022\nvariations in our annual or quarterly financial results or those of our competitors;\n\u2022 the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022\neconomic conditions in general; and\n\u2022\nchanges in applicable laws or regulations, or their judicial or administrative interpretations affecting us or our subsidiaries or the securities industry.\nIn addition, volatility of the market price of our common stock is further affected by its thinly-traded nature.\nOur Board can issue shares of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock without further action by our stockholders.\nOur Board has the authority, without further action by our stockholders, to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the rights, preferences, privileges and restrictions in each series of the preferred stock, including:\n\u2022\ndividend rights;\n\u2022\nconversion rights;\n\u2022\nvoting rights, which may be greater or lesser than the voting rights of our common stock;\n\u2022\nrights and terms of redemption;\n\u2022\nliquidation preferences; and\n\u2022\nsinking fund terms.\nAt September 30, 2020, there are no shares of our preferred stock outstanding. The issuance of shares of preferred stock could adversely affect the voting power of holders of our common stock and the likelihood that these holders will receive dividends and payments upon our liquidation and could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of the Company.\nThe Nasdaq Capital Market imposes listing standards on our common stock that we may not be able to fulfill, thereby leading to a possible delisting of our common stock.\nAs a listed Nasdaq Capital Market company, we are subject to rules covering, among other things, certain major corporate transactions, the composition of our Board and the committees thereof, the holding of an annual meeting of our stockholders, minimum bid price of our common stock and minimum stockholders equity. The failure to meet these or other Nasdaq Capital Market requirements may result in the de-listing of our common stock from the Nasdaq Capital Market, which could adversely affect the liquidity and market price of our common stock.\nOn September 9, 2020, the Company notified Nasdaq of Nassos Michas\u2019s resignation from the Board and the Company\u2019s resulting non-compliance with the majority independent director requirement for continued listing on the Nasdaq Capital Market, as set forth in Listing Rule 5605(b)(1) (the \u201cMajority Independence Rule\u201d). On September 10, 2020, the Company received written notice from Nasdaq acknowledging the Company\u2019s non-compliance with the Majority Independence Rule. In accordance with the Majority Independence Rule, the Company has until the earlier of its next annual meeting of stockholders or September 7, 2021 to regain compliance with the Majority Independence Rule, provided, however, that if the Company\u2019s next annual meeting of stockholders is held on or before March 8, 2021, the Company shall have until March 8, 2021 to regain compliance with the Majority Independence Rule (the \u201cCure Period\u201d).\nThe Board intends to identify a suitable replacement candidate for Mr. Michas\u2019s position on the Board and to regain compliance with the Majority Independence Rule prior to the expiration of the applicable Cure Period but there can be no assurance it will be able to do so.\nWe do not expect to pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.\nWe do not anticipate that we will pay any cash dividends to holders of our common stock in the foreseeable future. We expect to retain all future earnings, if any, for investment in our business.", "PERMNO": 11441, "SIC": 6211, "TIC": "NHLD"}
