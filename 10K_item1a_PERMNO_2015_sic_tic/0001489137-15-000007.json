{"cik": "1489137", "company": "Molycorp, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-16", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nThe following are certain risk factors that could affect our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows. These risk factors should be considered along with the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K because these factors could cause our actual results or financial condition to differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. The following discussion is not an all-inclusive listing of risks, although we believe these are the more material risks that we face. If any of the following occur, our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows could be negatively affected.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nExistence of a material uncertainty casts substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.\nDue to continuing softness in the prices for our products, as well as inconsistent or depressed demand for certain of our products and the delayed ramp-up of operations at our Mountain Pass facility, we have incurred, and continue to incur, operating losses. In addition, we have significant capital requirements, including interest payments to service our debt. These circumstances, among others, indicate the existence of a material uncertainty that casts substantial doubt as to our ability to meet our business plan and our obligations as they come due and, accordingly, the appropriateness of the use of the accounting principles applicable to a going concern. As a result, the unqualified report of our independent auditors includes an explanatory paragraph highlighting the substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nWe have engaged financial and other advisors to assist us in restructuring our debt; however, there can be no assurance that these efforts will succeed. If we are unable to execute our business plan and restructure our debt, we may not be able to continue as a going concern.\nThe production of rare earth products is a capital-intensive business and our ongoing optimization efforts at our Mountain Pass facility will require the commitment of additional resources. Any unanticipated costs or further delays associated with our ongoing ramp up and optimization efforts at our Mountain Pass facility could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe have encountered cost pressures during the modernization, expansion and optimization efforts at our Mountain Pass facility that have led to significantly higher costs, both capital and operating, than previously expected. We previously implemented mitigation efforts to maintain costs in response to cost pressures. In addition, our estimated expenses may increase as consultants, personnel and equipment associated with advancing optimization and commercial production are added. The progress of our optimization efforts at our Mountain Pass facility and the amounts and timing of expenditures will depend in part on the following:\n\u2022\nthe results of consultants' analysis and recommendations;\n\u2022\nmaintaining required federal, state and local permits;\n\u2022\nadditional capital projects as part of our continuing optimization efforts;\n\u2022\non-time delivery of critical parts and equipment;\n\u2022\nimpact of planned and unplanned shut downs and delays on our production;\n\u2022\nnegotiating sales and off-take contracts for our planned production;\n\u2022\nthe execution of any joint venture agreements or similar arrangements with strategic partners; and\n\u2022\nother factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nMost of these activities require significant lead times and must be advanced concurrently. In addition, we have experienced delays associated with our modernization, expansion and optimization efforts at our Mountain Pass facility. As a result, our production in 2014, 2013 and 2012 was substantially lower than expected, which led to lower than expected production volumes, revenues and cash flows, and delayed our realization of the benefits of our vertical integration strategy while our other operations continued to purchase raw materials from third parties rather than accepting delivery of products from our Mountain Pass facility. At the end of the third quarter of 2014, we placed into service an expanded leach system at our Mountain Pass facility. We have experienced construction and installation issues with the expanded leach system that have limited our ability to achieve its anticipated benefits. These anticipated benefits have been constrained further due to limited on-site production and market availability of HCl. We expect that, once it is fully operational and sufficient supplies of HCl are available, the expanded leach system will help us increase rare earth production and lower operating costs.\nOn-site production of HCl has been hampered by quality issues with the brine feedstock that our Chlor-Alkali plant transforms into HCl and other chemical reagents necessary for the production of rare earths. However, during the fourth quarter of 2014, engineers at our Mountain Pass facility have identified a process change that, in combination with certain new equipment, should reduce the impurity level of the brine feedstock, and restore the operational efficiency of our Chlor-Alkali\nplant. However, it will take several months of optimization before we can fully resume on-site production of HCl at commercial production levels. Therefore, we have not yet realized our expected lower production costs, and any difficulties or delays in the optimization of the new leach system, the Chlor-Alkali plant, and other plants that are expected to improve our operational efficiency at the Mountain Pass facility would delay such cost reductions and negatively impacting cash flows. Any unanticipated costs or other further delays associated with our optimization efforts at our Mountain Pass facility could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations and could require us to seek additional capital, which may not be available on commercially acceptable terms or at all.\nWe may be unsuccessful in generating, securing and raising the necessary capital to execute our current business plan.\nWhile we have initiated measures to mitigate certain adverse cost trends and are continuing to re-evaluate the impact of cost pressures on the budget, we will incur additional costs if our mitigation measures are not successful.\nIn August 2014, we and certain of our subsidiaries entered into a commitment letter with Oaktree Capital Management, L.P. (collectively with certain of its affiliates and funds under its management, \"Oaktree\") pursuant to which Oaktree agreed to provide to us and certain of our subsidiaries up to approximately $400.0 million in secured financing through credit facilities and the sale and leaseback of certain equipment at our Mountain Pass facility (the \"2014 Financings\") for corporate, operating and capital expenditures purposes. On September 11, 2014, we executed agreements governing the 2014 Financings and received initial gross proceeds totaling $250.0 million from Oaktree, with the remaining $149.8 million available to be drawn until April 30, 2016, $134.8 million of which is available only if we achieve certain financial and operational performance targets.\nWe expect to finance the remaining capital expenditures and other capital expenditures related to operations at our Mountain Pass facility and all other operating facilities, our selling, general and administrative expenses, the execution of our business plan, as well as our working capital requirements with the net proceeds from the 2014 Financings, cash on hand, and anticipated cash flows from operations at certain segments (before debt service). Based on the restrictions in our existing financing documents, including the 2014 Financings, our ability to raise additional capital through debt financing is limited. Furthermore, our ability to access the remaining unused portion of the 2014 Financings depends on our ability to achieve specified production and earnings targets, which we may not be able to satisfy. Additionally, the full funding of our current business plan continues to be dependent on (i) the accuracy of our cost estimates for capital expenditures, (ii) our ability to operate and maintain our Mountain Pass facility and our other operations within our current estimates, (iii) our ability to ramp-up run rates at our Mountain Pass facility pursuant to our expectations without further delays, and to achieve lower cash costs of production as a result of further optimization of operations at our Mountain Pass facility, (iv) stable or improved market conditions, (v) our ability to sell our production of rare earths to external customers and our downstream facilities (including our ability to sell our cerium through market acceptance of SorbX\u00ae or otherwise), (vi) our ability to repatriate cash generated from our global operations, and (vii) the absence of payments on current and future contingent liabilities. If these assumptions prove inaccurate, our estimates could prove incorrect and we may need additional financing.\nAs part of our cash management procedures, we continue to evaluate opportunities to reduce our operating, administrative and interest costs. Additionally, we may from time to time seek to repurchase our outstanding debt securities with cash and/or exchanges for common stock, securities convertible into common stock or other debt securities.\nIn the event that we are unable to access the unused portion of the 2014 Financings or to obtain additional financing, or we are not successful in curtailing and/or deferring capital expenditures, we would have a liquidity shortfall and would be unable to execute our current business plan.\nThe actual amount of capital required to optimize our Mountain Pass facility may vary materially from our current estimates, in which case we would need to raise additional funds, which may delay operations and have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nThe anticipated funding required to optimize operations at our Mountain Pass facility is based on certain estimates and assumptions we have made about the time and effort required to complete such activities and other factors required to optimize operations at the project. If any of these estimates or assumptions change, the actual timing and amount of capital required to optimize operations of our Mountain Pass facility, including any future expansions, may vary materially from what we anticipate. Additional funds may be required in the event of significant departures from our current plan, unforeseen delays, cost overruns, engineering design changes or other unanticipated expenses. There can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us, or, if available, that it can be obtained on a timely basis and on commercially acceptable terms.\nThere is no assurance that we will be able to successfully complete the optimization of our Mountain Pass facility within our current timetable, that the actual costs of optimization will not exceed our current estimated costs or that we will be able to\nsecure off-take agreements for the incremental production capacity, and we cannot provide any assurance as to the actual operating costs once we have completed the optimization.\nOur Mountain Pass facility is the foundation for our vertical integration strategy. It is the largest rare earth mine outside of China, and has been producing rare earth products for over 60 years. Actual production of REO (including LREC) at our Mountain Pass facility has been lower than expected, as a result of production interruptions while we continue to optimize operations. We produced 4,769 mt of REO (including LREC) at our Mountain Pass facility during 2014. Actual production of REO (including LREC) in 2015 will depend on internal requirements for our Chemical and Oxides segment and our Magnetic Materials and Alloys segment and external customer demand as well as our success in ramping up and operating our Mountain Pass facility. We expect our Mountain Pass facility to be able to operate at its design capacity and, depending upon the volume of rare earths production, we expect our Mountain Pass facility to have production cash costs that are competitive with the lowest cost producers of rare earth products globally, but we can provide no assurances. Although the modernization and expansion of our Mountain Pass facility was planned to allow a design capacity increase of up to 40,000 mt of REO (including LREC) per year, we will not increase production beyond our current production plans unless market demand, product pricing, capital availability, and financial returns justify such increased production. Our actual production rate will be influenced by customer demand and end-market conditions, among other factors. We do not believe we will need to obtain additional permits for the future expansion of our Molycorp Mountain Pass facility, other than air and certain building permits and the modification of existing permits after 2021 in connection with the expansion of the pit boundary. However there is no assurance that we will not, in the future, learn of permits that we will be required to obtain or existing permits that we will be required to modify.\nWe may not be able to realize the benefits of the expansion and modernization of our Mountain Pass facility or be able to produce at the costs we are expecting. In particular, we will not be able to achieve anticipated production costs until all units of our Mountain Pass facility, including the new leach system, Chlor-Alkali plant and our multi-stage cracking units, are optimized and operating at commercial production rates, and any delays in such optimization will further exacerbate our higher cost structure. Any failure to successfully complete the optimization and ramp up of our Mountain Pass facility due to insufficient funding, delays or unanticipated costs, or to realize the anticipated benefits of such efforts, including securing off-take commitments for the incremental production, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business depends in large part on the optimization and ramp up of our Mountain Pass facility, which is our only rare earths mining facility.\nOur only rare earth mine at this time is located at our Mountain Pass facility. Our continued viability is based on successfully implementing our vertical integration strategy, including completion of the optimization and ramp up of our Mountain Pass facility. The deterioration or destruction of all or any part of our Mountain Pass facility, or our inability to complete the optimization and ramp up of our Mountain Pass facility within our expected time frame, will significantly hinder our ability to achieve our vertical integration strategy or at all. If we are unsuccessful in completing the optimization or ramp up of our Mountain Pass facility to full planned run rates within our expected time frames, we may not be able to build a sustainable or profitable business.\nWe may not be able to develop sufficient internal and external sources of demand for the rare earth products manufactured at our Mountain Pass facility.\nWe are working to establish stable internal and external sources of demand for the rare earth minerals and products we manufacture through our Resources segment at our Mountain Pass facility. We intend to allocate a portion of such rare earth minerals and products to our Chemicals and Oxides segment and our Magnetic Materials and Alloys segment as feedstock for our fully integrated downstream manufacturing facilities. We intend to enter into purchase orders and short-term sales contracts, and long-term sales contracts, with existing and new customers for planned production of rare earth minerals and products manufactured through our Resources segment and not allocated internally, but currently do not have binding contracts for a material portion of the planned production. Our ability to execute this strategy depends on the extent to which we are able to generate sufficient demand for downstream products manufactured by our Chemicals and Oxides segment and our Magnetic Metals and Alloys segment to cover the allocation of feedstock intended for these segments, and our ability to enter into contracts with existing and new customers for the unallocated portion of the rare earth minerals and products manufactured through our Resources segment. A substantial portion of our current production from the Resources segment is cerium, which is in surplus and prices for which have declined significantly since 2011. Since 2013, we have been evaluating the phosphorus-removal performance of SorbX\u00ae in full-scale trials conducted at several wastewater treatment plants. We are currently working with some of these plants to conduct long-term trials that demonstrate additional benefits of SorbX\u00ae beyond phosphorus removal. Since 2013, we have been selling limited, but growing, volumes of SorbX\u00ae. Sales of PhosFIX\u2122 for recreational water\napplications have been limited, but consistent, through the end of 2014. We may not be able to increase sales of SorbX\u00ae or PhosFIX\u2122 beyond the limited volumes.\nThe failure to enter into additional binding contracts, or the failure to meet the conditions necessary for customers to commence or continue purchasing under existing agreements, or the failure to allocate production of rare earth minerals and products for use in our downstream facilities in the amounts intended, may have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to produce sufficient volumes of products to meet the demands of existing and new customers.\nWe have entered into sales contracts with certain customers and are pursuing additional sales contracts with new customers for planned production of rare earth minerals and products manufactured through our Resources segment and not allocated internally. Our ability to execute our strategy depends on our ability to produce such rare earth minerals and products at sufficient quantities and quality to meet the requirements of such existing and new customers. The failure to meet the quantity and quality requirements of our existing and new customers may result in our inability to maintain such contractual relationships, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nWe may be adversely affected by fluctuations in demand for, and prices of, rare earth products.\nBecause our primary source of revenue is the sale of rare earth minerals and products, changes in demand for, and the market price of, rare earth minerals and products could significantly affect our profitability. The value and price of our securities and our financial results may be adversely affected by declines in the prices of rare earth minerals and products. Rare earth minerals and product prices fluctuate and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control such as interest rates, exchange rates, inflation or deflation, fluctuation in the relative value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies on the world market, global and regional supply and demand for rare earth minerals and products, and the political and economic conditions of countries that produce rare earth minerals and products.\nAs a result of the last global economic crisis, rare earth product prices declined by approximately 50% between 2008 and the end of the third quarter of 2009 before increasing during 2010 and most of 2011 and then declining since then. Pricing for REEs has experienced significant volatility over the past several years due to a number of factors: the most recent global financial crisis; a severe contraction by China, beginning in 2010, of rare earths it allowed for export; illegal mining in China; China's continuing efforts to institute stronger environmental reforms across its rare earths industry, forced industry consolidation, and constrict rare earths production; a build-up of stockpiles by rare earths consumers and government entities; product substitution; and a general lack of certainty among rare earths customers regarding the reliability of the future supply of REEs. Although current prices for all REEs other than lanthanum and cerium remain higher than historic (pre-2010) levels, sales prices for REEs, as well as demand for REEs, began to weaken in the second quarter of 2012 and have continued to decline since then. Protracted periods of low prices and demand for rare earth minerals and products such that we saw starting in 2012 could significantly reduce revenues and the availability of required development funds in the future. This could cause substantial reductions to, or a suspension of, rare earths production operations, impair asset values and reduce our proven and probable rare earth ore reserves.\nDemand for our products may be impacted by demand for downstream products incorporating rare earths, including hybrid and electric vehicles, wind power equipment and other clean technology products, as well as demand in the general automotive and electronic industries. Lack of growth in these markets may adversely affect the demand for our products, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nIn contrast, extended periods of high commodity prices may create economic dislocations that may be destabilizing to rare earth minerals supply and demand and ultimately to the broader markets. Periods of high rare earth mineral market prices generally are beneficial to our financial performance. However, strong rare earth mineral prices, as well as real or perceived disruptions in the supply of rare earth minerals, also create economic pressure to identify or create alternate technologies that ultimately could depress future long-term demand for rare earth minerals and products, and at the same time may incentivize development of otherwise marginal mining properties. We believe this occurred recently, when rising prices in 2011 and the first half of 2012 prompted such industrial substitution. For example, automobile manufacturers have announced plans to develop motors for electric and hybrid cars that do not require rare earth metals due to concerns about the available supply of rare earths. If the automobile industry or other industries reduce their reliance on rare earth products, the resulting change in demand could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nConditions in the rare earths industry have been, and may continue to be, extremely volatile, which could have a material impact on our company.\nConditions in the rare earths industry have been extremely volatile, and prices, as well as supply and demand, have been significantly impacted by a number of factors, principally changes in economic conditions and demand for rare earth materials\nand changes, or perceived changes, in Chinese quotas for the production and export of rare earth materials. After a spike of approximately 1,000% from the end of 2009 to the first half of 2011, average prices for most rare earths have declined significantly through the end of 2014. See the \"Average Free On Board (\"FOB\") China $/Kg of most common REEs Oxide 99%\" table in Item 1 of this Annual Report of Form 10-K for more information on rare earth prices. If conditions in our industry remain volatile, our stock price may continue to exhibit volatility as well. In particular, if prices or demand for rare earths were to decline, our stock price would likely decline, and this could also impair our ability to find purchasers for our products at prices acceptable to us.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry.\nThe rare earths mining and processing markets are capital intensive and competitive. Our Chinese competitors may have greater financial resources, as well as other strategic advantages to maintain, improve and expand their facilities. Additionally, the Chinese producers have historically been able to produce at relatively low costs due to domestic economic factors. Even upon successful implementation of the new processing technologies and capabilities at our Mountain Pass facility, if we are not able to achieve anticipated costs of production, then any strategic advantages that our competitors may have over us, such as lower labor costs, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe success of our business will depend, in part, on the establishment of new uses and markets for rare earth products.\nThe success of our business will depend, in part, on the establishment of new markets by us or third parties for certain rare earth products that may be in low demand. For example, cerium is, and is expected to remain, in global surplus. Although we have developed a proprietary line of cerium-based water treatment products, including SorbX\u2122 and PhosFIX\u2122, these products have been sold only in limited commercial quantities and have yet to be fully commercialized. In addition, although we are developing rare earth products for use in NdFeB magnets, which are used in critical existing and emerging technologies, such as hybrid and electric vehicles, wind power turbines and compact fluorescent lighting, the success of our business depends on creating new markets and successfully commercializing rare earth products in existing and emerging markets. Any unexpected costs or delays in the commercialization of any of the foregoing products and applications could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nAn increase in the global supply of rare earth products, dumping and predatory pricing by our competitors may materially adversely affect our profitability.\nThe pricing and demand for our products is affected by a number of factors beyond our control, including growth of economic development and the global supply and demand for rare earth products. According to IMCOA, it is estimated that China accounted for approximately 85% of global rare earths production in 2014. China also dominates the manufacture of metals and NdFeB magnets from rare earths, a capacity that is not currently found in the United States. Once we reach full planned run rates for rare earths and other planned downstream products, the increased competition may lead our competitors to engage in predatory pricing behavior. Any increase in the amount of rare earth products exported from other nations and increased competition may result in price reductions, reduced margins and loss of potential market share, any of which could materially adversely affect our profitability. As a result of these factors, we may not be able to compete effectively against current and future competitors.\nChanges in China's export policy may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn 1999, the government of China introduced an export quota system for the rare earths industry. In 2008, China imposed export taxes of up to 25% on selected rare earths (primarily heavy separated rare earth oxides) and up to 15% for all other rare earths (primarily light rare earth oxides). The Chinese government heightened international supply concerns beginning in August 2009, when China's Interior Ministry first signaled that it would further restrict exports of Chinese rare earth resources. Citing the importance of the availability of REEs to internal industries and the desire to conserve resources, the Chinese government announced export quotas, increased export tariffs and introduced a \"mining quotas policy\" that, in addition to imposing export quotas and export tariffs, also imposed production quotas and limits the issuance of new licenses for rare earths exploration. The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Commerce, or MOFCOM, increased China's export quota slightly in 2012, up to 30,996 mt of rare earth products, or approximately 3% from 2011.\nIn December 2014, the Chinese government announced that it would no longer impose quotas on the export of rare earths from China. However, the Chinese government also announced that government-issued licenses would be required to legally export rare earths from China, and that such exports would be allowed only through specified Chinese declaration ports. On January 21, 2015, MOFCOM announced that it intended to abolish current rare earth export duties on or before May 2, 2015.\nChanges in China's policy or the interpretation of China's policy on rare earths production or the import of rare earth feedstock may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to capture the expected cost reductions in the production of rare earth products at our operations in China depends on our ability to import rare earths into China produced from our Mountain Pass facility. Restrictions by China on the production of rare earth products in China or the import of rare earths into China for the production of rare earth products would adversely affect our ability to process rare earths produced from our Mountain Pass facility in our operations in China, and may have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not successfully establish or maintain collaborative, joint venture and licensing arrangements, or establish new ones, which could adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize our rare earth products.\nA key element of our business strategy is to utilize vertical integration through further downstream processing of our rare earths into rare earth metal alloys and finished magnets for clean-energy, high-technology and defense applications. To implement this vertical integration strategy successfully, we have in the past, and may in the future, need to form joint ventures with existing magnet producers for the final production of finished rare earth magnets. In addition, other licenses that may be necessary for some of these downstream processing steps have not yet been obtained. Any failure to establish or maintain collaborative, joint venture or licensing arrangements for the production of downstream products on favorable terms could adversely affect our business prospects, financial condition or ability to develop and commercialize downstream rare earth products.\nWe have a significant amount of goodwill and other intangible assets, and any future impairment of these assets could adversely impact our results of operations.\nWe had goodwill of approximately $102.8 million and other intangible assets of approximately $215.9 million at December 31, 2014. The occurrence of potential indicators of impairment affecting any of our reporting units, such as a longer than anticipated soft rare earths pricing environment, loss of some end-markets for our products, our inability to meet customer demand for rare earth products, a material negative change in relationships with significant customers, strategic decisions made in response to economic or competitive conditions, weak growth for some of our new applications, and delays in optimizing operations at our Mountain Pass facility that may defer our ability to enter into longer term contracts, could result in the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, which could adversely impact our net results of operations. We have suffered and continue to suffer from soft product pricing environments and increased stock price volatility, and, in connection with the ordinary course preparation of our financial statements, will evaluate if we will need to record additional impairment charges as required under GAAP.\nOur business will be adversely affected if we do not successfully implement new processing technologies and capabilities.\nOur processing technologies and capabilities are key components of our competitive strengths and are expected to contribute to low operating costs and increasing the life of the ore body at our Mountain Pass facility. We have not proven these technologies and capabilities at commercial rates over extended periods of time, and we may not be able to do so as planned. We are also working to optimize and ramp up to commercial production rates other steps in our production process, including our expanded leach system, multi-stage cracking unit and chloralkali facility. Any failure may affect our ability to achieve the expected benefits of the new technologies and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nMarkets for our rare earths, zirconium or other minor metal-based products are highly competitive and characterized by rapid technological change. Our future success depends upon our ability to continue to provide products that achieve market acceptance. As technologies develop, substitutes may be developed for our products that may have an adverse impact on their marketability. Since we specialize in a limited number of products, there is a risk that their replacement by other products may have a material adverse impact on our sales, financial condition and results of operations.\nPower shortages at our Mountain Pass facility may temporarily delay mining and processing operations and increase costs, which may materially adversely impact our business.\nDue to its position on the regional electric grid, our Mountain Pass facility faces occasional power shortages during peak periods. Instability in electrical supply in past years has caused sporadic outages and brownouts and higher costs. Such outages and brownouts have had a negative impact on production. We have installed a natural gas powered CHP plant as part of our modernization and expansion of our Mountain Pass facility to reduce energy costs in that facility as well as minimize or eliminate our reliance on the regional electric power grid. If this CHP plant is unable to provide sufficient power for the operation of our Mountain Pass facility, we will remain subject to the effects of occasional power outages and brownouts and could experience temporary interruptions of mining and processing operations. We then may be unable to fill customer orders in a timely manner and may be subject to higher power costs at our Mountain Pass facility. As a result, our revenue could be\nadversely impacted and our relationships with our customers could suffer, adversely impacting our ability to generate future revenue. In addition, if power to our Mountain Pass facility is disrupted during certain phases of our rare earths extraction process, we may incur significant expenses that may adversely affect our business.\nIncreasing costs or limited access to raw materials may adversely affect our profitability.\nWe use significant amounts of HCl and other chemical reagents to process rare earths at our Mountain Pass facility. Even though we have implemented a technology at our Mountain Pass facility that allows us to recycle wastewater and produce HCl and other chemical reagents, on-site production of these materials has been hampered by quality issues with the brine feedstock that our Chlor-Alkali plant transforms into HCl and other chemical reagents necessary for the production of rare earths. However, during the fourth quarter of 2014, engineers at our Mountain Pass facility have identified a process change that, in combination with certain new equipment, should allow us to stabilize the impurity level of the brine feedstock, and restore the operational efficiency of our Chlor-Alkali plant. However, it will take several months of optimization before we can fully resume on-site production of HCl and other chemical reagents and anticipated production levels. In the meantime, we will need to purchase HCl and other chemical reagents in the open market and, as a result, we could be subject to significant volatility in the cost or availability of these chemicals. We may not be able to pass increased prices for these chemicals through to our customers in the form of price increases. In addition, we will incur additional costs to haul wastewater from the site that otherwise would be used to produce HCl and other chemical reagents at our Chlor-Alkali plant. A significant increase in the price, or decrease in the availability, of these chemicals before we produce them on site, together with additional wastewater haulage costs, could materially increase our operating costs and adversely affect our profit margins from quarter to quarter.\nOur operations in China and Estonia are vulnerable to any volatility in the prices of raw materials because we do not currently have long-term raw material supply contracts. The Chinese government is aggressively monitoring and regulating rare earth mining operations. In some cases, it is shutting down or curtailing illegal or environmentally damaging mining activities. This could have an adverse impact on rare earth raw materials supply. Although we believe there is an adequate supply of rare earths feedstock for our processing facilities in China and Estonia, there is no assurance that the prices of such rare earths feedstock will not rise dramatically, in which case the increased cost of production may have a material adverse effect on our profit margins. Such rises in the prices of rare earths feedstock may be offset by increasing the prices of our rare earth related products; however, there is no assurance that the market will bear such price increases, and even if the market will bear such increases, our Chinese and Estonian businesses will have an increased cost of production since rare earths are a primary raw material. In addition, if market prices for mixed rare earth oxides and zirconium products decline, there is no assurance that raw material prices will decline sufficiently or in tandem to offset the decline in selling prices. Our Rare Metals operations are dependent on being able to secure an adequate supply of Tantalum and Gallium bearing scrap at economic prices in order to maintain and grow our Tantalum and Gallium recycling business. The inability of our Rare Metals segment to purchase Tantalum that meets the EICC requirements for Conflict Minerals, or to purchase Gallium bearing scrap at economic prices could result in a loss of sales and could materially adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.\nFluctuations in transportation costs or disruptions in transportation services could increase competition or impair our ability to supply rare earth minerals or products to our customers, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe transport Cerium, Lanthanum, Neodymium, Praseodymium and Didymium oxide products from our Mountain Pass facility to our customers and to several of our facilities around the world. Finding affordable and dependable transportation is important because it allows us to supply customers, third parties under tolling agreements, and our operating facilities around the world. Labor disputes, work stoppages, derailments, adverse weather conditions or other environmental events and changes to rail or ocean freight systems could interrupt or limit available transport services, which could result in customer dissatisfaction and loss of sales potential and could materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe must process rare earths to exacting specifications in order to provide customers with a consistently high quality product. An inability to perfect the mineral extraction process to meet individual customer specifications may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe process rare earths to meet customer needs and specifications and to provide customers with consistently high quality products and higher purity levels than previously achieved in prior mining operations at our Mountain Pass facility. An inability to perfect the mineral extraction process to meet individual customer specifications may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. In addition, customer needs and specifications may change with time. Any delay or failure in developing processes to meet changing customer needs and specifications may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nDiminished access to water may adversely affect our operations.\nProcessing of rare earths at our facilities requires significant amounts of water. The technology we are optimizing at our Mountain Pass facility to significantly reduce our need for fresh water, including the proprietary production of our own HCl and sodium hydroxide from wastewater at our Chlor-Alkali plant has not yet been fully optimized. Any decrease or disruption in our available water supply until this technology is successfully optimized may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, including significant costs to transport and dispose of waste water generated at the site.\nInaccuracies in our estimates of rare earths reserves and resource deposits could result in lower than expected revenues and higher than expected costs.\nWe base our rare earths reserve and resource estimates on engineering, economic and geological data assembled and analyzed by outside firms, which are reviewed by our engineers and geologists. Ore reserve estimates, however, are necessarily imprecise and depend to some extent on statistical inferences drawn from available drilling data, which may prove unreliable. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and qualities of rare earths reserves and non-reserve rare earths deposits and costs to mine recoverable reserves, including many factors beyond our control. Estimates of economically recoverable rare earths reserves necessarily depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions, all of which may vary considerably from actual results, such as:\n\u2022\ngeological and mining conditions and/or effects from prior mining that may not be fully identified by available data or that may differ from experience;\n\u2022\nassumptions concerning future prices of rare earth products, operating costs, mining technology improvements, development costs and reclamation costs; and\n\u2022\nassumptions concerning future effects of regulation, including the issuance of required permits and taxes by governmental agencies.\nIn April 2012, we revised our reserve estimate based on a topography as of January 4, 2012. While our probable reserves increased, our proven reserves decreased significantly. We have updated our proven reserve estimates since then by deducting our annual production from our reserves. Revised market prices and our revised operating cost estimates could impact the level of economically recoverable reserves. Any inaccuracy in our estimates related to our rare earths reserves and non-reserve rare earths deposits could result in lower than expected revenues and higher than expected costs or a shortened estimated life for the mine at our Mountain Pass facility.\nPeriod-to-period conversion of probable rare earths ore reserves to proven ore reserves may result in increases or decreases to the total reported amount of ore reserves. Conversion, an indicator of the success in upgrading probable ore reserves to proven ore reserves, is evaluated annually. Conversion rates are affected by a number of factors, including geological variability, applicable mining methods and changes in safe mining practices, economic considerations and new regulatory requirements.\nWork stoppages or similar difficulties could significantly disrupt our operations, reduce our revenues and materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2014, 282 employees, or approximately 59% of the workforce at our Mountain Pass facility, were represented by the United Steelworkers of America. Our contract with the United Steelworkers of America expires in March 2015. A proposal to renew the contract through March 2018 has been presented to the union for ratification. The union has not ratified the contract renewal yet, and we cannot guarantee that it will be approved. The failure of the union to renew the contract could disrupt operations at our Mountain Pass facility.\nAlso as of December 31, 2014, 155 employees, or approximately 28% of the workforce at our Molycorp Silmet facility, were unionized employees. Our contract with the labor union in Estonia is automatically renewed each year unless either party desires to make an amendment. A work stoppage at either or both our Mountain Pass or Molycorp Silmet facilities could significantly disrupt our operations, reduce our revenues and materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nA shortage of skilled technicians and engineers may further increase operating costs, which may materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nEfficient production of rare earth products using modern techniques and equipment requires skilled technicians and engineers. In the event that we are unable to hire, train and retain the necessary number of skilled technicians and engineers, there could be an adverse impact on our labor costs and our ability to reach full planned production levels in a timely manner, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe depend on key personnel for the success of our business.\nWe depend on the services of our senior management team and other key personnel. The loss of the services of any member of senior management or a key employee could have an adverse effect on our business. We may not be able to locate, attract or employ on acceptable terms qualified replacements for senior management or other key employees if their services are no longer available.\nBecause of the dangers involved in the mining of minerals and the manufacture of mineral products, there is a risk that we may incur liability or damages as we conduct our business.\nThe mining of minerals and the manufacture of mineral products involves numerous hazards, including:\n\u2022\nunusual and unexpected rock formations affecting ore or wall rock characteristics;\n\u2022\nground or slope failures;\n\u2022\nthe use of explosives in mining operations;\n\u2022\nenvironmental hazards;\n\u2022\nindustrial accidents;\n\u2022\nprocessing problems;\n\u2022\nthe use of hazardous chemicals in manufacturing operations, including at elevated pressures and temperatures;\n\u2022\nperiodic interruptions due to inclement or hazardous weather conditions or other acts of God; and\n\u2022\nmechanical equipment failure and facility performance problems.\nAlthough we maintain insurance to address certain risks involved in our business, such as coverage for property damage, business interruption and workers' compensation, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain insurance to cover these risks at economically feasible premiums or at all. Additionally, we cannot be certain that all claims we may make under our insurance policies will be deemed to be within the scope of, or fully covered by, our policies. Furthermore, we do not maintain coverage for losses resulting from acts of terrorism. We might also become subject to liability for environmental damage or other hazards that may be uninsurable or for which we may elect not to insure because of premium costs or commercial impracticality. Additionally, these policies contain limits of coverage and exclusions that are typical of such policies generally. The payment of such premiums, or the assumption of such liabilities, may have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nWe are currently subject to litigation, including a stockholder class action litigation and derivative litigation, the unfavorable outcome of which might have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating results and cash flow.\nFrom time to time, we may become subject to various legal and regulatory proceedings relating to our business.\nIn February 2012, a purported class action lawsuit was filed in the Colorado Federal District Court against us and certain of our current and former executive officers alleging violations of the federal securities laws. The Consolidated Class Action Complaint filed on July 31, 2012 also names most of our Board members and some of our stockholders as defendants, along with other persons and entities. That Complaint alleges 18 claims for relief arising out of alleged: (1) securities fraud in violation of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act, during the proposed class period from February 11, 2011 through November 10, 2011; and (2) materially untrue or misleading statements in registration statements and prospectuses for our public offering of preferred stock in February 2011 and of common stock in June 2011, in violation of the Securities Act of 1933. Our motion to dismiss that Complaint was filed in October 2012 and is pending. We believe that this lawsuit is without merit, and we intend to vigorously defend ourselves against these claims.\nCertain of our shareholders filed a consolidated stockholder derivative lawsuit purportedly on our behalf against us (as nominal defendant) and certain of our current and former directors, executive officers and shareholders in the Delaware Court of Chancery. A Consolidated Amended Stockholder Derivative Complaint was filed in August 2012. Pursuant to an order dated May 15, 2013, the Delaware Chancery Court stayed this derivative lawsuit pending the outcome of the Colorado class action lawsuit. On October 9, 2013, certain plaintiffs, purportedly on our behalf, filed a Motion to Lift the Stay and for Leave to File an Amended Complaint. Pursuant to a letter opinion dated May 12, 2014, the Delaware Chancery Court granted plaintiffs\u2019 motion to file a second consolidated amended derivative complaint. In addition, the Delaware Chancery Court lifted the stay of the action. The plaintiffs filed their Second Consolidated Amended Complaint on May 15, 2014, alleging breaches of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment, but dropping claims for material misstatements and for trading on material, non-public information. The defendants filed a Motion to Dismiss the Second Consolidated Amended Complaint on July 14, 2014, and oral arguments on the Motion to Dismiss were heard on January 16, 2015. The Delaware Chancery Court's decision on the Motion to Dismiss is pending.\nTwo additional shareholder derivative lawsuits were filed purportedly on our behalf against us (as nominal defendant) and certain of our current and former directors, executive officers and shareholders, in the Colorado Federal District Court. These lawsuits allege claims for breach of fiduciary duty, waste of corporate assets, and unjust enrichment based on events in 2011 and 2012. The Colorado Federal District Court dismissed these lawsuits. The plaintiffs filed an appeal of that ruling to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, and the Tenth Circuit remanded these cases back to the Colorado Federal District Court. Subsequently, a different shareholder, purportedly on our behalf, filed a new shareholder derivative lawsuit in the Colorado Federal District Court alleging claims for breach of fiduciary duty, waste of corporate assets, and unjust enrichment based on events during 2011 through 2013. The Colorado Federal District Court sua sponte consolidated this lawsuit with the remanded lawsuits. The plaintiff in the new derivative lawsuit filed a Motion to Vacate the consolidation order. On July 15, 2014, the Colorado Federal District Court ruled that, based on the Second Consolidated Amended Derivative Complaint filed in Delaware Chancery Court, the issues raised in the Colorado derivative cases were sufficiently distinct from the issues set forth in the Delaware derivative lawsuit, and reversed its original order dismissing the lawsuits. In its order, the Colorado Federal District Court left open the opportunity for the defendants to file a motion to stay the Colorado derivative lawsuits pending the resolution of the Colorado class action lawsuit. The motion to say was filed and fully briefed. The Colorado Federal District Court granted the defendants' Motion to Stay all of the Colorado derivative lawsuits pending resolution of the purported Colorado class action lawsuit, and further stayed the new Colorado derivative lawsuit pending resolution of the purported New York class action lawsuit. The Colorado Federal District Court subsequently administratively closed all of the Colorado derivative lawsuits.\nIn August 2013, two purported class action lawsuits were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against us and certain of our current and former executive officers, alleging violations of the federal securities laws. A Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint, filed on May 19, 2014, also names us and certain of our current and former executive officers. The Consolidated Amended Class Action Complaint alleges claims for relief arising out of alleged securities fraud in violation of the Exchange Act, during a purported class period from February 21, 2012 through October 15, 2013. Our Motion to Dismiss the consolidated lawsuit was filed on August 13, 2014. On March 12, 2015, the Federal Court for the Southern District of New York issued an order dismissing the lawsuit with prejudice. The plaintiffs have 14 days to move for reconsideration of the order, and 30 days from the date of entry of the judgment by the Court clerk to file a notice of appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. We believe that this lawsuit is without merit, and we intend to continue to vigorously defend ourselves against these claims.\nThe class action and derivative lawsuits described above have not progressed to a point where a reasonably possible range of losses associated with their ultimate outcome can be estimated at this time. If the final resolution of any such litigation or proceedings is unfavorable, our financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially affected.\nWe conduct our sales and distribution operations on a worldwide basis and are subject to the risks associated with doing business outside the United States.\nWe sell to customers outside of the United States from our United States and international operations. International shipments account for a significant portion of our sales.\nThere are a number of additional risks associated with international business activities, including:\n\u2022\nburdens to comply with multiple and potentially conflicting foreign laws and regulations, including import and export requirements, tariffs and other barriers, customs regulations, environmental health and safety requirements and unexpected changes in any of these factors;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on production and export quotas granted by the Chinese government for our Chinese operations;\n\u2022\nto the extent cash is held outside of the United States, our repatriation of such cash is subject to the approval of foreign governments and to the potentially adverse impact of foreign and domestic tax laws;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic instability and disruptions, including terrorist attacks;\n\u2022\ndisadvantages of competing against companies from countries that are not subject to U.S. laws and regulations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA;\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences due to overlapping or differing tax structures; and\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates.\nAny of these risks could have an adverse effect on our international operations by reducing the demand for our products or reducing the prices at which we can sell our products, which could result in an adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nIn addition, we could be adversely affected by violations of the FCPA and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws. The FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our policies mandate compliance with these\nanti-bribery laws. We operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. We cannot assure you that our internal controls and procedures always will protect us from the reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents. If we are found to be liable for FCPA violations, we could suffer from criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAdditionally, in connection with the disclosure requirements mandated by Section 1502 of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, certain of our customers have requested that we certify whether any \"conflict minerals\" (as such term is defined in Section 1502) used in the manufacturing of our rare earth products come from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (or an adjoining country). In January 2014, our Molycorp Silmet facility received a certification by the EICC that its purchases of tantalum comply with the CFS program assessment protocol through July 2015. During the period we were conducting the analysis of our supply chain that led to this certification, we lost Tantalum sales to competitors who had already received EICC certifications. Delays in resuming Tantalum sales to the customers we have lost to competitors during the analysis of our supply chain could continue to adversely affect the results of operations in our Rare Metals segment in the near future.\nOur international operations in China and Thailand are subject to a number of special risks including trade barriers, exchange controls and restrictions on currency conversion, political risks and risks of increased duties, customs regulations, taxes, tariffs and governmental royalties, as well as changes in laws and policies governing operations of foreign-based companies such as embargos. A change in policies by the Chinese or Thai governments could adversely affect our investment in those countries by, among other factors, changes in laws or regulations or changes in the interpretation thereof. Despite the activity and progress in developing their legal systems, neither China nor Thailand has a system of laws as comprehensive as in Canada or the United States.\nOur financial results are reported in U.S. dollars, which is subject to fluctuations in respect of the currencies of the countries in which we operate. We expect our revenues to be earned in a number of different currencies. Accordingly, fluctuations in the exchange rates of world currencies could have a positive or negative effect on our reported results on a consolidated basis. Given the constantly changing currency exposures and the substantial volatility of currency exchange rates, we cannot predict the effect of exchange rate fluctuations upon our future operating results. There can be no assurance that we will not experience currency losses in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, revenues, operating results and financial condition. In the event of a change in the value of the Chinese Renminbi relative to the U.S. dollar, there is no assurance, due to competitive pressure, of a corresponding change in selling prices of our products. We export a significant portion of our products from China. These exports are invoiced and paid for primarily in U.S. dollars.\nWe are dependent upon information technology systems, which are subject to disruption, damage, failure and risks associated with implementation and integration.\nWe are increasingly dependent upon information technology systems in the conduct of our business and operations. We have taken measures to protect the integrity of our technology infrastructure and the privacy of confidential information. However, our information technology systems are vulnerable to disruption, damage or failure from a variety of sources, including, without limitation, physical or electronic break-ins, viruses and other disabling devices, security breaches, cyber attacks, defects in design, and natural disasters such as fire, floods, earthquakes, power loss and telecommunications failures. Damage, disruption, or failure of one or more of our information technology systems may result in interruptions to our operations. In addition, if a person or entity circumvents our security measures, they could jeopardize the security of confidential information stored on our systems, misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions in our operations. As a result, we may be required to make substantial additional investments and efforts to protect against or remedy security breaches. Such systems failures or security breaches could damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of loss or liability.\nWe could also be adversely affected by system or network disruptions if new or upgraded information technology systems are defective, not installed properly or not properly integrated into our operations. We continue to implement a new enterprise software that we will use for our marketing, sales, manufacturing, logistics, customer service and accounting functions. If we are not able to successfully implement our new enterprise software in a timely manner across our operating segments, including our international operations, such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations and could adversely impact the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting.\nRisks Relating to Our Debt\nOur substantial debt could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our debt service and other obligations.\nWe have substantial debt and, as a result, we have significant debt service obligations. As of December 31, 2014, our total consolidated indebtedness was approximately $1.7 billion (excluding capital lease obligations of $22.4 million and without giving effect to the equity component of our 3.25% Convertible Senior Notes due 2016, our 6.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 2017, or our 5.50% Convertible Senior Notes due 2018, which we refer to together as our \"convertible notes\" or any debt discount). Our substantial debt could have important consequences to you. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations under our debt and our contractual and commercial commitments and increase the risk that we may default on our debt obligations;\n\u2022\nprevent us from raising the funds necessary to repurchase our senior secured notes tendered to us if there is a change of control, which would constitute a default under the indenture governing our senior secured notes;\n\u2022\nprevent us from raising the funds necessary to repurchase our convertible notes if our common stock is delisted from the New York Stock Exchange, or NYSE, which would constitute an event of default under the indentures governing our convertible notes;\n\u2022\nrequire us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay interest and principal on our debt, which would reduce the funds available for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit or eliminate our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other investments, or general corporate purposes, which may limit the ability to execute our business strategy;\n\u2022\nheighten our vulnerability to downturns in our business, our industry or in the general economy and restrict us from exploiting business opportunities or making acquisitions;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to those of our competitors that may have less debt;\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult to enter into contracts for the sale of our products to existing and new customers;\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to obtain goods and services on commercially reasonable terms or at all;\n\u2022\nlimit management's discretion in operating our business;\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult to attract and retain employees with the training, skills and experience necessary to operate our business;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, the industry in which we operate or the general economy; and\n\u2022\nresult in higher interest expense if interest rates increase and we have outstanding floating rate borrowings.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur additional debt in the future. If new debt or other liabilities are added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we and our subsidiaries now face could intensify.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our debt and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our debt, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance or restructure our debt obligations and to fund planned capital expenditures and expansion efforts and any strategic alliances or acquisitions we may make in the future depends on our ability to generate cash in the future and our financial condition and operating performance, which are subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our debt.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance our debt. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. If our operating results and available cash are insufficient to meet our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and might be required to dispose of material assets or operations to meet our debt service and other obligations. We may not be able to consummate those dispositions or to obtain the proceeds that we could realize from them, and these proceeds may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. Further, given our substantial level of debt we will need to refinance or restructure all or a portion of our debt, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to refinance or restructure any of our debt on commercially reasonable terms or at all. If we are unable to restructure or refinance our debt we may not be able to continue as a going concern.\nCertain of our debt obligations contain covenants that are subject to interpretation. Although we do not believe we are in breach of any such covenants, if a creditor under any such debt obligations decides to declare a breach of any such covenant, then such creditor could exercise its rights under the applicable debt obligations, which will trigger cross-defaults in other debt obligations. Such actions by creditors could require repayment of our debt before maturity, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to meet such repayment obligations.\nRestrictive covenants in the indenture governing our senior secured notes and the agreements entered into as part of the 2014 Financings, and the agreements governing our other indebtedness will restrict our ability to operate our business.\nThe senior secured indenture governing our senior secured notes, and the credit agreements entered into as part of the 2014 Financings each contains, and agreements governing indebtedness we may incur in the future may contain, covenants that restrict our ability to, among other things, incur additional debt, pay dividends, make investments, enter into transactions with affiliates, merge or consolidate with other entities or sell all or a material portion of our assets. The credit agreements entered into as part of the 2014 Financings contain provisions limiting our ability to access the remaining unused portion of the allocated funds if we do not meet the following targets: (a) consolidated adjusted EBITDA of no less than $20.0 million for each of two consecutive fiscal quarters, and (b) evidence that production at our Mountain Pass facility is equal to or greater than 4,000 mt for each of two consecutive fiscal quarters, in each case prior to, but including, the fiscal quarter ending on March 31, 2016. Certain springing maturity obligations may be triggered under the credit agreements entered into as part of the 2014 Financings in the event certain of our unsecured debt is not refinanced or repaid within certain specified time frames. Additionally, any asset-based credit facility may require us to maintain certain financial ratios. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default thereunder, which could allow the lenders to declare all amounts outstanding under the applicable debt immediately due and payable. We may also be prevented from taking advantage of business opportunities that arise because of the limitations imposed on us by the restrictive covenants under our indebtedness.\nCertain of the equipment at our Mountain Pass facility is subject to lease obligations that may restrict our ability to operate our business.\nAs part of the 2014 Financings, we entered into a sale and leaseback transaction with regard to certain equipment critical to the operation of our Mountain Pass facility. A failure to make scheduled lease payments, or a breach of any of the other covenants related to this transaction could result in a default thereunder, which could allow the lessor to remove the leased equipment from our Mountain Pass facility. The removal of such equipment would limit or eliminate our ability to continue operations at our Mountain Pass facility, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nIf we do not continue to meet the listing standards established by the New York Stock Exchange, our common stock may not remain listed for trading.\nThe NYSE Regulation, Inc. has established certain quantitative and qualitative standards that companies must meet in order to remain listed for trading on the NYSE. We have received notice that we are not in compliance with the continued listing standards of the NYSE, because the current trading price for our common stock is below the minimum listing requirements. We are taking actions to meet the compliance standards for continued listing on NYSE. However, we cannot guarantee that we will be able to meet the necessary requirements for continued listing, and therefore we cannot guarantee that our common stock will remain listed for trading on the NYSE or other similar markets.\nIf we fail to meet the necessary requirements for our common stock to remain listed on the NYSE or other similar markets, then we will be obligated to offer to repurchase all of our outstanding convertible notes. Our failure to make such an offer or repurchase any tendered convertible notes will result in an event of default under the indentures governing the convertible notes. Any such default will trigger a cross-default on our other debt obligations, including the 2014 Financings. Our inability to cure any such defaults, including the prepayment of our debt obligations, would have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly. Accordingly, stockholders could lose all or part of their investment.\nThe market price of our common stock has been, and is likely to continue to be, highly volatile and may be influenced by many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nthe extremely volatile rare earths industry;\n\u2022\nour quarterly or annual earnings or those of other companies in our industry;\n\u2022\nloss of a large customer;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u2022\nthe failure to comply with accounting standards applicable to us or to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting;\n\u2022\ninability to service our debt;\n\u2022\nfailure to meet the conditions necessary to remain listed for trading on the NYSE or other similar markets;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions;\n\u2022\nthe failure of securities analysts to cover our stock or changes in financial estimates by analysts;\n\u2022\nfuture sales of our common stock; and\n\u2022\nother factors described in this \"Risk Factors\" section.\nOur common stock price has been particularly affected by the volatility in the rare earths industry, as the high and the low sales price of our common stock in the period since we went public in July 2010 through January 2015 has ranged from a low of $0.28 to a high of $79.16. If conditions in our industry remain volatile, our common stock price may continue to exhibit volatility as well. In particular, if prices or demand for rare earths were to decline, our stock price would likely decline.\nReports published by securities or industry analysts, including projections in those reports that exceed our actual results, could adversely affect our stock price and trading volume.\nResearch analysts publish their own quarterly projections regarding our operating results. These projections may vary widely from one another and may not accurately predict the results we actually achieve. Our stock price may decline if we fail to meet securities research analysts' projections. Similarly, if one or more of the analysts who covers us downgrades our stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price could decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, our stock price or trading volume could decline.\nFuture sales, or availability for sale, of shares of common stock by stockholders could depress the market price of our common stock.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that large sales could occur as a result of the conversion into shares of our common stock of: (a) our convertible notes; (b) the warrants we issued to Oaktree as part of the 2014 Financings to purchase up to an aggregate of 24,477,359 shares of our common stock, which we refer to as the Oaktree warrants; or (c) the perception that any such exchange or conversion could occur, could depress the market price of our common stock. In addition, in December 2014, our Board of Directors approved the engagement of an independent investment bank and advisory firm to advise us in pursuing various financing alternatives to secure a more sustainable capital structure. While we are evaluating a number of alternatives, we may seek to convert a significant portion of our outstanding debt to equity, which could result in substantial dilution to our existing common stockholders.\nAs of March 13, 2015, we had 277,955,182 shares of our common stock outstanding. All of these shares are freely tradable, except for any shares held by our \"affiliates\" as defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act. Additionally, as of December 31, 2014, up to 57,239,439 shares of our common stock, subject, in each case, to anti-dilution, make-whole and other adjustments, will be issuable upon conversion of our convertible notes. The common stock issuable upon conversion of our convertible notes will be freely tradeable. In addition, pursuant to the 2014 Financings, we have an obligation to register the shares of common stock issuable upon Oaktree's exercise of the Oaktree warrants.\nCertain holders of shares of common stock are entitled to rights with respect to the registration under the Securities Act of such shares of common stock. These registration rights are contained in a registration rights agreement entered into with the former members of Molycorp, LLC in connection with our Corporate Reorganization. In addition, the 3,930,494 shares reserved for future issuance under our Molycorp, Inc. 2010 Equity and Performance Incentive Plan, as of December 31, 2014, would become eligible for sale in the public market in the future, subject to certain legal and contractual limitations. If these additional shares are sold, or if it is perceived that they will be sold, in the public market, the price of our common stock could decline substantially.\nThe availability of shares of our common stock for sale in the future could reduce the market price of our common stock and would be dilutive to our existing common stockholders.\nIn the future, we may issue additional securities to raise capital or in exchange for our debt. We may also acquire interests in other companies by using a combination of cash and our common stock or just our common stock. We may also issue securities convertible into our common stock in addition to our convertible notes. Any of these events may dilute your ownership interest in our company and have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock. In addition, sales of a substantial amount of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales may occur, could reduce the market price of our common stock. This could also impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of our securities.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock, in the foreseeable future.\nFor the foreseeable future, we intend to retain any earnings to finance the development of our business, and we do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock. Any future determination to pay dividends will be at the discretion of the Board and will be dependent upon then existing conditions, including our operating results and financial condition,\ncapital requirements, contractual restrictions, business prospects and other factors that the Board considers relevant. Accordingly, holders of our common stock must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize a return on their shares of common stock.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards in the United States may be subject to limitation due to significant changes in the ownership of our common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $538.0 million. Under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code, if a corporation undergoes an \"ownership change,\" the corporation's ability to use its pre-change net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes to offset its post-change income may be limited. An ownership change is defined generally for these purposes as a greater than 50% change in ownership over a three-year period, taking into account shareholders that own 5% or more by value of our common stock. It is possible that past and future transactions involving our common stock will cause an ownership change to occur that would limit our ability to use any net operating loss carryforwards and other tax attributes.\nAnti-takeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws provisions may have the effect of delaying, deferring or discouraging a prospective acquiror from making a tender offer for our shares or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us. To the extent that these provisions discourage takeover attempts, they could deprive stockholders of opportunities to realize takeover premiums for their shares. Moreover, these provisions could discourage accumulations of large blocks of common stock, thus depriving stockholders of any advantages which large accumulations of stock might provide.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. Section 203 prevents some stockholders holding more than 15% of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations unless the business combination was approved in advance by our board of directors, results in the stockholder holding more than 85% of our outstanding common stock or is approved by the holders of at least 66 2/3 % of our outstanding common stock not held by the stockholder engaging in the transaction.\nAny provision of our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.\nOur board of directors can issue, without stockholder approval, preferred stock with voting and conversion rights and convertible debt that could adversely affect the voting power of the holders of common stock.\nOur board of directors can issue, without stockholder approval, preferred stock with voting and conversion rights and convertible debt that could adversely affect the voting power of the holders of common stock and reduce the likelihood that such holders will receive dividend payments or payments upon liquidation, including shares of our mandatory convertible preferred stock and our convertible notes. Such issuance could have the effect of decreasing the market price of the common stock. The issuance of preferred stock and/or convertible debt or even the ability to issue preferred stock and/or convertible debt could also have the effect of delaying, deterring or preventing a change of control or other corporate action.\nOur convertible notes and the Oaktree warrants may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nThe market price of our common stock is likely to be influenced by our convertible notes and the Oaktree warrants. For example, the market price of our common stock could become more volatile and could be depressed by:\n\u2022\ninvestors' anticipation of the potential resale in the market of a substantial number of additional shares of our common stock received upon conversion of our convertible notes or the issuance of shares of our common stock pursuant to the Oaktree warrants; and\n\u2022\nhedging or arbitrage trading activity that may develop involving our convertible notes, the Oaktree warrants and our common stock.\nOur board of directors and management have broad discretion over the use of our cash reserves and might not apply this cash in ways that increase the value of your investment.\nOur board of directors and management have broad discretion to use our cash reserves, and you will be relying on their judgment regarding the application of this cash. Our board of directors and management might not apply the cash in ways that increase the value of your investment. Until we use the cash, we plan to invest it, and these investments may not yield a favorable rate of return. If we do not invest or apply the cash in ways that enhance stockholder value, we may fail to achieve expected financial results, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nRisks Related to Environmental Regulation\nOur operations are subject to extensive and costly environmental requirements; and current and future laws, regulations and permits will impose significant costs, liabilities or obligations or could limit or prevent our ability to continue our current operations or to undertake new operations.\nWe are subject to numerous and detailed international, national, federal, state and local environmental laws, regulations and permits, including those pertaining to employee health and safety, environmental permitting and licensing, air quality standards, greenhouse gas, or GHG, emissions, water usage and disposal, pollution, waste management, plant and wildlife protection, including the protection of endangered species, handling and disposal of radioactive substances, remediation of soil and groundwater contamination, land use, reclamation and restoration of properties, the discharge of materials into the environment and groundwater quality and availability. Our operations in Europe are subject to the environmental laws and regulations applicable to European Union member countries. These requirements may result in significant costs, liabilities and obligations, impose conditions that are difficult to achieve or otherwise delay, limit or prohibit current or planned operations. Failure to comply with these laws, regulations and permits may result in the assessment of administrative, civil and criminal penalties, the issuance of injunctions to limit or cease operations, the suspension or revocation of permits and other sanctions. Pursuant to such requirements, we may also be subject to third-party claims, including for damages to property or injury to persons arising from our operations. Moreover, these environmental requirements, and the interpretation and enforcement thereof, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. For example, GHG emission regulation is becoming more rigorous. As a result of our expansion at our Mountain Pass facility, we are required to report annual GHG emissions from our operations and to comply with the GHG cap and trade regulations promulgated by the state of California. The U.S. Congress is considering various legislative proposals to address climate change. In addition, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has issued regulations, including the \"Tailoring Rule,\" that subject GHG emissions from certain stationary sources to the Prevention of Significant Deterioration and Title V provisions of the federal Clean Air Act. Any such regulations could require us to modify existing permits or obtain new permits, implement additional pollution control technology, curtail operations or increase significantly our operating costs, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, reputation, operating performance and product demand. Any future changes in these laws, regulations or permits (or the interpretation or enforcement thereof) or any sanctions, damages, costs, obligations or liabilities in respect of these matters could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur operations comprising a significant portion of our Chemicals and Oxides, Magnetic Materials and Alloys, and Rare Metals segments, are subject to numerous and increasingly rigorous international, national, federal, state and local laws, regulations and permits affecting the mineral processing industry, including those pertaining to employee health and safety, environmental permitting and licensing, air quality standards, GHG emissions, water usage and disposal, pollution, waste management, plant and wildlife protection, handling and disposal of radioactive substances, remediation of soil and groundwater contamination, and the discharge of materials into the environment. Pursuant to certain environmental laws, regulations and permits, we may be subject to claims for toxic torts, natural resource damages and other liabilities, as well as for the investigation and remediation of soil, surface water, groundwater and other environmental media, in addition to claims we may be subject to as it relates to our mining and mineral recovery operations at the Mountain Pass facility. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations, or changes in such laws and regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof, and to obtain such permits could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Specifically, we are subject both to Chinese national and local environmental protection regulations that currently impose a graduated schedule of fees for the discharge of waste substances, require the payment of fines for discharges exceeding the standards, and provide for the closure of any facility which fails to comply with orders requiring it to cease or remedy certain activities causing environmental damage.\nWe are subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, the California Labor Code and regulations adopted pursuant thereto, and various regulations applicable in the other countries where we operate, which impose stringent health and safety standards on numerous aspects of our operations.\nOperations at our Mountain Pass facility are subject to the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, as amended by the Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of 2006, and the regulations adopted by the California Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which impose stringent health and safety standards on numerous aspects of mineral extraction and processing operations, including the training of personnel, operating procedures, operating equipment and other matters. Our operations at our U.S. facilities are also subject to the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970. Our operations outside the U.S. are subject to local health and safety requirements.\nOur failure to comply with these or other applicable safety and health standards, or changes in such standards or the interpretation or enforcement thereof, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or otherwise impose significant restrictions on our ability to conduct our operations.\nOur operations may affect the environment or cause exposure to hazardous substances, any of which could result in material costs, obligations or liabilities.\nOur operations currently use, and in the past have used, hazardous materials and generate, and in the past have generated, hazardous and naturally occurring radioactive wastes. Our Molycorp Silmet facility in Estonia has a long history of industrial use, including uranium ore and alum shale processing, as a result of which its operations may have impacted the environment. In addition, our Estonian operations require the management and disposal of radioactive wastes. Our Mountain Pass facility has been used for mining and related purposes since 1952, and contamination is known to exist around the facility. We may be subject to claims under environmental laws, regulations and permits for toxic torts, natural resource damages and other liabilities, as well as for the investigation and remediation of soil, surface water, groundwater and other environmental media. Our Mountain Pass facility is currently subject to an order issued by the Lahontan Regional Water Quality Control Board pursuant to which we have conducted various investigatory and remedial actions, primarily related to certain onsite impoundments, including groundwater monitoring, extraction and treatment and soil remediation. We are still in the process of delineating the extent of groundwater contamination at and around the facility and cannot assure you that we will not incur material costs relating to the remediation of such contamination. In addition to claims arising out of our current or former properties, such claims may arise in connection with contaminated third-party sites at which we have disposed of waste. As a matter of law, and despite any contractual indemnity or allocation arrangements or acquisition agreements to the contrary, our liability for these claims may be joint and several, so that we may be held responsible for more than our share of any contamination, or even for the entire share. These and similar unforeseen impacts that our operations may have on the environment, as well as human exposure to hazardous or radioactive materials or wastes associated with our operations, could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, results of operation and financial condition.\nWe may be unable to obtain, maintain or renew permits necessary for the development or operation of our facilities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe must obtain, for all our operations, a number of permits that impose strict conditions, requirements and obligations relating to various environmental and health and safety matters in connection with our current and future operations. To obtain, maintain and renew certain permits, we may be required to conduct environmental studies and collect and present data to governmental authorities pertaining to the potential impact of our current and future operations upon the environment, including the potential impact on endangered species, and to take steps to avoid or mitigate those impacts. The permitting rules, and interpretation thereof, are complex and have tended to become more stringent over time. In some cases, the public (including environmental interest groups) has rights to comment upon and submit objections to permit applications and environmental analysis prepared in connection therewith, and otherwise participate in the permitting process, including challenging the issuance of permits, validity of environmental analyses and determinations and performance of permitted activities. Accordingly, permits required for our operations may not be issued, maintained or renewed in a timely fashion or at all, may be issued or renewed with conditions that restrict our ability to conduct our operations economically, or may be subsequently revoked. Any such failure to obtain, maintain or renew permits, or other permitting delays or conditions, including in connection with any environmental impact analyses, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur inability to acquire, maintain or renew financial assurances related to the reclamation and restoration of mining property could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe are generally obligated to restore property after it has been mined in accordance with regulatory standards and our approved reclamation plan for our Mountain Pass facility, which is the only Molycorp operating facility where mining takes place. We are required under federal, state and local laws to maintain financial assurances, such as surety bonds, to secure such obligations. The failure to acquire, maintain or renew such assurances, as required by federal, state and local laws, could subject us to fines and penalties as well as the revocation of our operating permits. Such failure could result from a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe lack of availability, higher expense or unreasonable terms of such financial assurances;\n\u2022\nthe ability of current and future financial assurance counterparties to increase required collateral; and\n\u2022\nthe exercise by third-party financial assurance counterparties of any rights to refuse to renew the financial assurance instruments.\nOur inability to acquire or failure to maintain or renew such financial assurances could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf the assumptions underlying our reclamation plan and mine closure obligations are inaccurate, we could be required to expend materially greater amounts than anticipated to reclaim mined property, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFederal, state and local laws and regulations establish reclamation and closure standards applicable to our surface mining and other operations as well. Estimates of our total reclamation and mine closure liabilities are based upon our closure and reclamation plans, third-party expert reports, current applicable laws and regulations, certain permit terms and our engineering expertise related to these requirements. Any change in the underlying assumptions or other variation between the estimated liabilities and actual costs could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights. If we fail to adequately enforce or defend our intellectual property rights, our business may be harmed.\nMuch of the technology used in the markets in which we compete is protected by patents and trade secrets, and our commercial success will depend in significant part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent and trade secret protection for our products and methods. To compete in these markets, we rely on a combination of trade secret protection, nondisclosure and licensing agreements, patents and trademarks to establish and protect our proprietary intellectual property rights, including our proprietary rare earth production processes that are not patented. We intend to rely on patented products and applications, such as using rare earths for water treatment, and related licensing agreements to establish proprietary markets for low demand REEs. We are evaluating our current patent portfolio in order to focus our efforts on patents and patent applications that provide value to our businesses. As a result of this evaluation, we may abandon certain patents and decide not to pursue further certain patent applications.\nThese intellectual property rights may be challenged or infringed upon by third parties or we may be unable to maintain, renew or enter into new license agreements with third-party owners of intellectual property on reasonable terms. Identifying unauthorized use of our intellectual property may be difficult, and proceedings to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights could result in substantial costs. The enforcement of intellectual property rights is subject to considerable uncertainty, and patent reform laws, including the recently-enacted America Invents Act, and court decisions interpreting such laws, may create additional uncertainty around our ability to obtain and enforce patent protection for our technologies. If we seek to enforce our rights, we may also be subject to claims that our intellectual property rights are invalid or otherwise unenforceable. In addition, our intellectual property may be subject to infringement or other unauthorized use outside of the United States. In such case, our ability to protect our intellectual property rights by legal recourse or otherwise may be limited, particularly in countries where laws or enforcement practices are undeveloped or do not recognize or protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the United States. Unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights or our inability to preserve existing intellectual property rights could therefore adversely impact our competitive position and results of operations. The loss of our patents could also reduce the value of the related products. In addition, the cost to litigate infringements of our intellectual property, or the cost to defend ourselves against intellectual property infringement actions by others, could be substantial.\nProprietary trade secrets and unpatented know-how are also very important to our business. We rely on trade secrets to protect certain aspects of our technology, especially where we do not believe that patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. Our employees, consultants, contractors, outside scientific collaborators and other advisors may unintentionally or willfully disclose our confidential information to competitors, and confidentiality agreements may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential or proprietary information. Enforcing a claim that a third party illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets is expensive and time consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. Moreover, our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how. Failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive business position.\nIn addition, the most effective patent covering our manufacturing of Neo Powders\u2122 expired in July 2014. While we hold a wide range of additional patents and patent applications covering bonded magnets made with Neo Powders\u2122 whose expiration dates extend (and in the case of patent applications, will extend, if issued) beyond 2014, none are of an equally essential nature as our fundamental patent that expired in 2014. As a result, we may face increased competitive pressure, and we may be unable to defend against new competitors entering the marketplace for bonded magnets made with Neo Powders\u2122 or maintain our existing pricing of Neo Powders\u2122.\nWe may not be able to obtain additional patents and the legal protection afforded by any additional patents may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage.\nOur ability to obtain additional patents is uncertain and the legal protection afforded by these patents is limited and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage. In addition, the scope and enforceability of patent claims is highly uncertain due to the complex nature of the relevant legal, scientific and factual issues. Changes in either patent laws or interpretations of patent laws in the United States or elsewhere (including the recently enacted America Invents Act) may diminish the value of our intellectual property or narrow the scope of our patent protection. Even if patents are issued relating to our products and processes, our competitors may challenge the validity of those patents. Patents also will not protect our products and processes if competitors devise ways of making products without infringing our patents.\nIf we infringe, or are accused of infringing, the intellectual property rights of third parties, it may increase our costs or prevent us from being able to sell our existing products or commercialize new products.\nThere is a risk that we may infringe, or may be accused of infringing, the proprietary rights of third parties, including rights under patents and pending patent applications belonging to third parties that may exist in the United States and elsewhere in the world. Because the patent application process can take several years to complete, and patent applications may remain unpublished for 18 months or more, there may be currently pending applications, including applications of which we are currently unaware, that may later result in issued patents that cover our products and processes. In addition, our products and processes may infringe existing patents.\nDefending ourselves against third-party claims, including litigation in particular, would be costly and time consuming and would divert management's attention from our business, which could lead to delays in our expansion and modernization efforts. If third parties are successful in their claims, we might have to pay substantial damages or take other actions that are adverse to our business. As a result of intellectual property infringement claims, or to avoid potential claims, we might:\n\u2022\nbe prohibited from, or delayed in, selling or licensing some of our products or using some of our processes unless the intellectual property holder licenses the applicable intellectual property to us, which it is not required to do;\n\u2022\nbe required to pay substantial royalties or grant a cross-license to our intellectual property to another intellectual property holder; or\n\u2022\nbe required to redesign a product or process so it does not infringe a third party's intellectual property, which may not be possible or could require substantial funds and time and ultimately result in an inferior product or process.\nIn addition, we could be subject to claims that our employees, or we, have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of third parties.\nIf we are unable to resolve claims that may be brought against us by third parties related to their intellectual property rights on terms acceptable to us, in addition to paying substantial damages and royalties, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights and be precluded from offering some of our products or using some of our processes.", "PERMNO": 11999, "SIC": 3390, "TIC": "MCPIQ"}
