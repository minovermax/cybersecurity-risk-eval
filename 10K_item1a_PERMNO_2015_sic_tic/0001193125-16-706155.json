{"cik": "1342287", "company": "General Finance CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-09-09", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other information in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, you should consider the risks described below that we believe may be material to investors in evaluating us. This section contains forward-looking statements, and in considering these statements, you should refer to the qualifications and limitations on our forward-looking statements that are described in SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT before the beginning of Item 1.\nEconomic conditions and global credit market disruptions may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAn economic slowdown in the United States and/or globally, including reduced oil or gas prices and non-residential construction spending, would adversely affect our business. Worsening conditions could adversely affect, among other things, the collection of our trade receivables on a timely basis, resulting in additional reserves for uncollectible accounts; and, in the event of continued contraction in container, mobile office and modular unit sales and leasing, could lead to a build-up of inventory and lease fleet levels and a decline in leasing revenues. In addition, we engage in borrowing and repayment activities under our revolving credit facilities on an almost daily basis and have not had any disruption in our ability to access our revolving credit facilities as needed. However, disruptions in the global credit markets, such as those that occurred in the global financial crisis during the latter part of the past decade, could increase the likelihood that one or more of our lenders may be unable to honor its commitments under our revolving credit facilities, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDemand for a substantial portion of our lease fleet and manufacturing products in North America is, to a significant degree, dependent on the levels of expenditures and drilling activity by the oil and gas industry and can fluctuate significantly in a short period of time. A substantial or an extended decline in oil and gas prices could result in lower expenditures and reduced drilling by the oil and gas industry, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nDemand for a substantial portion of our lease fleet and manufacturing products in North America depends, to a significant degree, on the level of expenditures by the oil and gas industry for the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas reserves and can fluctuate significantly in a short period of time. These expenditures are generally dependent on numerous factors and events over which we have no control, including the industry\u2019s view of current and future oil and natural gas prices, future economic growth and the resulting impact on demand for oil and natural gas. Declines, as well as anticipated declines, in oil and gas prices could result in the reduction of drilling activity, project modifications, delays or cancellations, general business disruptions and delays in payment of, or nonpayment of, amounts that are owed to us. The oil and gas industry has historically experienced volatile prices for oil and gas and periodic downturns, which have been characterized by diminished demand for oilfield services and downward pressure on vendor prices charged. A significant and/or extended downturn in the oil and gas industry could result in a reduction in demand for our products, specifically our portable liquid containment products and services in North America, reduce the amounts we are able to borrow under our senior secured credit facilities and could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nChanges in regulatory, or governmental, oversight of hydraulic fracturing could materially adversely affect the demand for our portable liquid containment products.\nOil and gas exploration and extraction (including the use of tanks for hydraulic fracturing of gas and oil shale) are subject to numerous local, state and federal regulations. The hydraulic fracturing method of extraction has come under scrutiny in several states and by the federal government due to the potential adverse effects that hydraulic fracturing, and the liquids and chemicals used, may have on water quality and public health. In addition, the disposal of wastewater from the hydraulic fracturing process into injection wells may be proven to increase the rate of seismic activity near drill sites and could result in regulatory changes, delays or interruption of future activity. Changes in these regulations could limit, interrupt or stop exploration and extraction activities, which would negatively impact the demand for our portable liquid containment products and services in North America.\nWe operate with a significant amount of indebtedness, borrowed primarily under senior secured credit facilities, which include various restrictions, including liens on all or substantially all of our assets, variable interest rates and contains restrictive covenants.\nOur substantial indebtedness could have adverse consequences, such as:\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, which could reduce the availability of our cash flow to fund future operating capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\nI-18\n\u2022\nexpose us to the risk of increases in interest rates, as our borrowings on our secured senior credit facilities are at variable rates of interest;\n\u2022\nrequire us to sell assets to reduce indebtedness or influence our decisions about whether to do so;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry;\n\u2022\nprohibit us from making strategic acquisitions or pursuing business opportunities; and\n\u2022\nlimit, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness, among other things, our ability to borrow additional funds.\nViolating covenants in these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations; including substantially increasing our cost of borrowing and restricting our future operations, if not cured or waived. In addition, the lenders may be able to terminate any commitments they had made to supply us with further funds. Accordingly, we may not be able to fully repay our debt obligations, if some or all of our debt obligations are accelerated upon an event of default.\nOur senior credit agreements also contain various restrictive covenants that limit the operations of our business. Among other things, these agreements include covenants and restrictions relating to:\n\u2022\npayments and distributions to GFN;\n\u2022\nliens and sale-leaseback transactions;\n\u2022\nloans and investments;\n\u2022\ndebt and hedging arrangements;\n\u2022\nmergers, acquisitions and asset sales;\n\u2022\ntransactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022\nchanges in business activities.\nIn addition, we may incur substantial debt to complete business combinations. The incurrence of debt could result in:\n\u2022\ndefault and foreclosure on our assets if our operating revenues after a business combination are insufficient to repay our debt obligations;\n\u2022\nour immediate payment of all principal and accrued interest, if any, if the debt security is payable on demand; and\n\u2022\nour inability to obtain necessary additional financing if the agreements governing such indebtedness restrict our ability to obtain such financing while the debt instrument is outstanding.\nWhile we believe we will remain in compliance with the covenants in agreements governing such indebtedness in the foreseeable future and that our relationships with our senior lenders are good, there is no assurance our lenders would consent to an amendment or waiver in the event of noncompliance; or that such consent would not be conditioned upon the receipt of a cash payment, revised principal payout terms, increased interest rates or restrictions in the expansion of the credit facilities for the foreseeable future; or that our senior lenders would not exercise rights that would be available to them, including, among other things, demanding payment of outstanding borrowings. In addition, our ability to obtain additional capital or alternative borrowing arrangements at reasonable rates may be adversely affected. All or any of these adverse events would further limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to downturns in our business.\nSee also the significant risks related primarily to our 9.00% Series C Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock (the \u201cSeries C Preferred Shares\u201d or \u201cSeries C Preferred Stock\u201d) and our 8.125% Senior Notes Due 2021 (the \u201cSenior Notes\u201d). In addition, reference is made to Note 5 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding our indebtedness.\nWe may need additional capital which we may be unable to obtain.\nOur business is capital intensive and any inability to obtain capital in the amounts and at the times when needed, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including substantially increasing our cost of borrowing and restricting our future operations and impairing our ability to grow, improve and maintain our leased assets. We have a significant amount of our outstanding senior indebtedness maturing in the foreseeable future. We may not have sufficient cash flow from our operations to repay amounts coming due. If we are unable to refinance this indebtedness, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nDeclines in demand for our products and services could also lead to increased borrowings and reduced collateral values which could lower the amounts we can borrow under our senior credit facilities; which could, in turn, restrict our ability to grow our business.\nI-19\nWe are subject to fluctuations in the rates of exchanges in the translation of our foreign operations into the U.S dollar for financial reporting purposes.\nFluctuations in the rates of exchange for the U.S. dollar against the Australian, New Zealand and Canadian dollars could significantly affect our results of operations through lower than anticipated reported revenues and profitability as a result of the translation of our foreign operations\u2019 financial results into U.S. dollars.\nA write-off of all or a part of our goodwill and intangibles would hurt our operating results and reduce our stockholders\u2019 equity.\nAs a result of our acquisitions, we have recorded significant amounts of goodwill and intangible assets. Goodwill represents the excess of the total purchase price of these acquisitions over the fair value of the net assets acquired. We are not permitted to amortize goodwill under U.S. accounting standards and, instead, we review goodwill (as well as intangible assets) for impairment. Impairment may result from, among other things, deterioration in the performance of acquired businesses, adverse market conditions and adverse changes in applicable laws or regulations, including changes that restrict the activities of the acquired business. In the event impairment is identified, a charge to earnings would be recorded. Although it does not affect our cash flow, a write-off of all or a part of our goodwill or intangibles would adversely affect our operating results and equity.\nReference is made to Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding goodwill and intangible assets.\nFuture acquisitions of businesses and greenfield expansions could subject us to additional business, operating and industry risks, the impact of which cannot presently be evaluated, and which could adversely impact our capital structure.\nWe intend to pursue acquisition opportunities and greenfield expansions in an effort to diversify our investments and grow our business. Any business we acquire may cause us to be affected by numerous risks inherent in the target\u2019s business operations. If we acquire a business in an industry characterized by a high level of risk, we may be affected by the currently unascertainable risks of that industry. Although we will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular industry or target business, we cannot assure that we will be able to properly ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors.\nIn addition, the financing of any acquisition we complete could adversely impact our capital structure as any such financing would likely include the borrowing of additional funds and/or the issuance of additional equity securities. Increasing our indebtedness could increase the risk of a default that would entitle the holder to declare all of such indebtedness due and payable and/or to seize any collateral securing the indebtedness. In addition, default under one debt instrument could in turn permit lenders under other debt instruments to declare borrowings outstanding under those other instruments to be due and payable pursuant to cross default clauses. The issuance of additional equity securities may significantly reduce the equity interest of our stockholders and/or adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock.\nIn addition, integrating acquired businesses, greenfield expansions and assets into our business can be difficult and risky, especially if the acquired business or assets involve an industry segment with which our management has limited experience or where there are limited synergies with our current businesses. Our integration of acquired businesses and realization of all synergies or efficiencies that we believe may result from such acquisitions or expansions may not come into fruition, which could negatively impact our business.\nReference is made to Note 4 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding acquisitions.\nWhile part of our long-term business strategy is to acquire additional businesses, there is no assurance that we will be able to identify businesses that we can acquire upon terms we believe acceptable, or if such acquisitions require additional financing, that we could obtain such additional financing.\nWe cannot ascertain the availability of businesses to acquire, nor the capital requirements for future transactions. We cannot assure that, if required, additional financing will be available on acceptable terms, if at all. To the extent that additional financing proves to be unavailable when needed to consummate a particular acquisition, we would be compelled to either restructure the transaction or abandon that particular acquisition. In addition, if we consummate a future acquisition, we may require additional financing to fund the operations or growth of the target business. The failure to secure additional financing may impact the continued development or growth of the target business and could adversely impact our operating results.\nI-20\nOur long-term growth plan may include the expansion of operations into markets outside of North America and the Asia-Pacific area. Such international expansion may not prove successful, and may divert significant capital, resources and management\u2019s time and attention and adversely affect our on-going operations.\nTo date, we have conducted all of our business within North America and the Asia-Pacific area. However, we may in the future enter international markets, including possibly South America and the European markets, which would require substantial amounts of management time and attention. Our products and overall business approach may not be accepted in other markets to the extent needed to make our international expansion profitable. In addition, the additional demands on management from these activities may detract from our efforts in our current markets and adversely affect our operating results therein. Any international expansion will expose us to the risks normally associated with conducting international business operations, including unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, changes in foreign legislation, possible foreign currency controls, currency exchange rate fluctuations or devaluations, tariffs, difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations, difficulties in obtaining and managing vendors and distributors, potential negative tax consequences and asset management difficulties.\nOur long-term growth plan involves an element of risk and could strain our management resources.\nWe intend to pursue a growth strategy involving organic and non-organic growth. There is a no guarantee that such growth will occur or be successful. We may incur significant capital expenditures in connection with expansion plans that may not be realized or may not deliver the earnings that are expected. In addition, our expansion plans may, in the future, give rise to unforeseen risks or problems, and our future performance will depend in large part on our ability to manage our long-term planned growth that could strain our existing management, human and other resources. To successfully manage this growth, we must continue to add competent managers and employees and improve our operating, financial and other internal procedures and controls. We also must effectively motivate, train and manage employees. If we do not manage our growth effectively, it would adversely affect our future operating results.\nFailure to retain key executives could adversely affect our operations and could impede our ability to execute our business plan and growth strategy.\nOur growth strategies, operational guidance, capital allocation and capital markets support are managed largely by our existing corporate officers, including our President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, Ronald F. Valenta; as well as the senior management teams at our operating units in the Asia-Pacific area and North America. The continued success of our businesses will depend largely on the efforts and abilities of Mr. Valenta, the corporate executives and the operational senior management teams. These key personnel, particularly Mr. Valenta, have an understanding of our businesses that cannot be readily duplicated. However, we do not have key-man insurance on any of these key personnel. The loss of any of these key personnel, especially Mr. Valenta, could impair our ability to execute our business plan and growth strategy and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nWe may issue shares of our capital stock that would reduce the equity interest of our stockholders and could cause a change in control of our ownership.\nWe may seek to finance future transactions, including business combinations, or improve our financial position by issuing additional shares of our common stock and/or preferred stock. The issuance of any number of shares of our common stock or of our preferred stock:\n\u2022\nmay significantly reduce the equity interest of investors;\n\u2022\nmay subordinate the rights of holders of common stock if preferred stock is issued with rights senior to those afforded to our common stock;\n\u2022\nmay cause a change in control if a substantial number of our shares of common stock are issued, which may affect, among other things, our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards, if any, and could result in the resignation or removal of our present officers and directors; and\n\u2022\nmay adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock.\nBecause we have depended to a large extent on the success of our leasing operations, the failure to effectively and quickly remarket lease units that are returned could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nHistorically, our average monthly lease fleet utilization has averaged between 70% and 85% and the typical lease term has averaged over twelve months. These factors have provided us with a fairly predictable revenue stream. However, if utilization rates decline or should a significant number of our lease units be returned during any short period of time, we would have to re-lease a large supply of units at similar rates to maintain historic revenues from these operations. Our failure to effectively maintain historical utilization rates or remarket a large influx of units returning from leases could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nI-21\nOur lease fleet is subject to residual value risk upon disposition, and may not sell at the prices or in the quantities we expect.\nA significant portion of our revenues are from unit sales out of our lease fleet. The market value of any given unit of our lease fleet could be less than its depreciated value at the time it is sold. The market value of used rental equipment depends on several factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe market price for new equipment of a like kind;\n\u2022\nthe age of the equipment at the time it is sold, as well as wear and tear on the equipment relative to its age;\n\u2022\nthe supply of used equipment on the market;\n\u2022\ntechnological advances relating to the equipment;\n\u2022\nworldwide and domestic demand for used equipment; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions.\nWe include in operating income the difference between the sales price and the depreciated value of an item of equipment sold. Changes in our assumptions regarding depreciation could change our depreciation expense, as well as the gain or loss realized upon disposal of lease fleet. Sales of units from our lease fleet at prices that fall significantly below its carrying value will have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nUnionization by some or all of our employees could cause increases in operating costs.\nOur employees are not presently covered by collective bargaining agreements. Unions may attempt to organize our employees in the future. We are unable to predict the outcome of any continuing or future efforts to organize our employees, the terms of any future labor agreements, or the effect, if any, those agreements might have on our operations or financial performance.\nWe are subject to laws and governmental regulations and actions that affect our operating results and financial condition.\nOur business is subject to regulation and taxation under a wide variety of foreign and U.S. federal, state and local laws, regulations and policies including those imposed by the SEC, the Internal Revenue Service, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act and NASDAQ, as well as applicable labor laws. Although we have policies and procedures designed to comply with applicable laws and regulations, failure to comply with the various laws and regulations may result in civil and criminal liability, fines and penalties, increased costs of compliance, additional taxation and restatement of our financial statements.\nThere can also be no assurance that, in response to current economic conditions or the current political environment or otherwise, laws and regulations will not be implemented or changed in ways that adversely affect our operating results and financial condition, such as recently adopted legislation that expands health care coverage costs or facilitates union activity or federal legislative proposals to increase taxation and operating costs.\nFailure to comply with internal control attestation requirements could lead to loss of public confidence in our financial statements and negatively impact our stock price.\nAs a public reporting company, we are required to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, including Section 404, and the related rules and regulations of the SEC, including expanded disclosures and accelerated reporting requirements. Compliance with Section 404 and other related requirements has increased our costs and will continue to require additional management resources. We may need to continue to implement additional finance and accounting systems, procedures and controls to satisfy new reporting requirements, and there is no assurance that future assessments of the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting will be favorable. If we are unable to obtain future unqualified reports as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors could lose confidence in the reliability of our internal control over financial reporting, which could, among other things, adversely affect our stock price.\nWe are exposed to various possible claims relating to our business and our insurance may not fully protect us.\nWe are exposed to various possible claims relating to our business. These possible claims include those relating to: (i) personal injury or death caused by container products, mobile offices or modular units leased or sold by us; (ii) accidents involving our vehicles and our employees; (iii) employment-related claims; (iv) property damage;\nI-22\n(v) commercial claims and (vi) environmental contamination. We believe that we have adequate insurance coverage for the protection of our assets and operations. However, our insurance may not fully protect us for certain types of claims, such as claims for punitive damages or for damages arising from intentional misconduct, which are often alleged in third party lawsuits.\nIn addition, we may be exposed to uninsured liability at levels in excess of our policy limits. If we are found liable for any significant claims that are not covered by insurance, our liquidity and operating results could be materially adversely affected. It is possible that our insurance carriers may disclaim coverage for any class action and derivative lawsuits against us. It is also possible that some or all of the insurance that is currently available to us will not be available in the future on economically reasonable terms or not available at all. In addition, whether we are covered by insurance or not, certain claims may have the potential for negative publicity surrounding such claims, which may adversely impact our operating results, value of our public securities, or give rise to additional similar claims being filed.\nDisruptions in our information technology systems could limit our ability to effectively monitor and control our operations and adversely affect our operations.\nOur information technology systems facilitate our ability to monitor and control our operations and adjust to changing market conditions. Any disruption in our information technology systems or the failure of these systems to operate as expected could, depending on the magnitude of the problem, adversely affect our operating results by limiting our capacity to effectively transact business, monitor and control our operations and adjust to changing market conditions in a timely manner. Like other companies, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to a variety of interruptions due to our own error or events beyond our control, including, but not limited to, cyber-security breaches, natural disasters, terrorist attacks, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, hackers and other security issues. The failure of these systems to operate effectively could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to us or our customers. This could include the improper use of personal information or other \u201cidentity theft.\u201d Each of these situations or data privacy breaches may cause delays in customer service, reduce efficiency in our operations, require significant capital investments to remediate the problem, or result in negative publicity that could harm our reputation and results.\nIn addition, the delay or failure to implement information system upgrades and new systems effectively could disrupt our business, distract management\u2019s focus and attention from our business operations and growth initiatives and increase our implementation and operating costs, any of which could negatively impact our operations and operating results.\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, which may make it difficult for stockholders to resell common stock when they want or at a price they find attractive.\nWe expect that the market price of our common stock will fluctuate. Our common stock price can fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results;\n\u2022\nchanges in interest rates and other general economic conditions;\n\u2022\nsignificant acquisitions or business combinations, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by or involving us or our competitors;\n\u2022\noperating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us;\n\u2022\nnews reports relating to trends, concerns, litigation, regulatory changes and other issues in our industry;\n\u2022\ngeopolitical conditions such as acts or threats of terrorism or military conflicts;\n\u2022\nrelatively low trading volume; and\n\u2022\nsignificant concentration of ownership in our common stock.\nIf equity research analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they issue unfavorable commentary or downgrade our common stock, the price of our common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will rely in part on the research and reports that equity research analysts publish about us and our business. We do not control these analysts. The price of our stock could decline if one or more equity analysts downgrade our stock or if those analysts issue other unfavorable commentary or cease publishing reports about us or our business.\nWe do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock, which may limit the return on your investment in us.\nExcept for payment of dividends on our preferred stock and on the capital stock of Royal Wolf, we intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.\nI-23\nSignificant Risks Related Primarily to Our Leasing Operations in North America\nGeneral or localized economic downturns or weakness may adversely affect our customers, in particular those in the oil and gas and construction industries, which may reduce demand for our products and services and negatively impact our future revenues and results of operations.\nA significant portion of our revenues in our North American leasing operations is derived from customers who are in industries and businesses that are cyclical in nature and subject to changes in general economic conditions, including the oil and gas and the construction industries. Although the variety of our products, the breadth of our customer base and the number of markets we serve throughout North America limit our exposure to economic downturns, general economic downturns or localized downturns in markets where we operate could reduce demand for our products, especially in the construction or oil and gas industries, and negatively impact our future revenues, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn the oil and gas industry, lower or the perception of lower or unstable domestic oil or gas prices have an adverse effect on our portable liquid containment business. Such market conditions cause customers to limit or stop exploration and extraction activities, resulting in lower rental demand and rates for our portable liquid containment products. Also, a weak U.S. economy may negatively impact infrastructure construction and industrial activity. Any of these factors would adversely affect our cash flows and financial performance and could result in excess lease fleet or impairment charges.\nWe may be brought into tort or environmental litigation or held responsible for cleanup of spills if the customer fails to perform, or an accident occurs in the use of our tank container products, which could materially adversely affect our business, future operating results or financial position.\nOur portable liquid tank containers and containment products are used by customers to store non-hazardous and certain hazardous liquids on customer sites. Customers are responsible for proper operation of our fleet equipment while on lease and returning a cleaned and undamaged container upon completion of use, but we cannot always assure that these responsibilities are fully met in all cases. Our operations are subject to operational hazards, including accidents or equipment issues that can cause pollution and other damage to the environment. Hazards inherent in the oil and natural gas industry, such as, but not limited to, accidents, blowouts, explosions, pollution and other damage to the environment, fires and hydrocarbon spills, may delay or halt operations at extraction sites which we service. These conditions can cause:\n\u2022\npersonal injury or loss of life;\n\u2022\nliabilities from accidents by our fleet of trucks and other equipment;\n\u2022\ndamage to or destruction of property, equipment and the environment; and\n\u2022\nthe suspension of operations.\nIn the event of a spill or accident, we may be brought into a lawsuit or enforcement action by either our customer or a third party on numerous potential grounds, including that an inherent flaw in a container tank contributed to the accident or that the container tank had suffered some undiscovered harm from a previous customer\u2019s use. In the event of a spill caused by our customers, we may be held responsible for cleanup under environmental laws and regulations concerning obligations of suppliers of rental products to effect remediation. In addition, applicable environmental laws and regulations may impose liability on us for conduct of third parties, or for actions that complied with applicable regulations when taken, regardless of negligence or fault. Substantial damage awards have also been made in certain jurisdictions against lessors of industrial equipment based upon claims of personal injury, property damage, and resource damage caused by the use of various products. While we try to take reasonable precautions that our lease equipment is in good and safe condition prior to lease and carry insurance to protect against certain risks of loss or accidents, liability could adversely impact our profitability.\nWe maintain insurance coverage that we believe to be customary in the industry against these hazards. We may not be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider reasonable. In addition, insurance may not be available to cover any or all of the risks to which we are subject, or, even if available, the coverage provided by such insurance may be inadequate, or insurance premiums or other costs could make such insurance prohibitively expensive. It is likely that, in our insurance renewals, our premiums and deductibles will be higher, and certain insurance coverage either will be unavailable or considerably more expensive than it has been in the recent past. In addition, our insurance is subject to coverage limits, and some policies exclude coverage for damages resulting from environmental contamination.\nI-24\nWe face significant competition in the modular space industry, especially from several national competitors in the United States who have greater financial resources and pricing flexibility than we do. If we are unable to compete successfully, we could lose customers and our future revenues could decline.\nAlthough our competition varies significantly by market, the modular space markets in which we compete are dominated primarily by four participants and are highly competitive. In addition, we compete with a number of large to mid-sized regional competitors, as well as many smaller, full and part-time operators in many local regions. The modular space industry is highly competitive, subject to stiff pricing competition and almost all of the competitors have portable storage product offerings. The primary modular national competitors with portable storage product offerings have greater financial resources and pricing flexibility. If they focus on portable storage and are unable to compete successfully, we could lose customers and our future revenues and results of operations could decline.\nThe portable storage industry in North America is highly competitive, and we face intense competition that may lead to our inability to increase or maintain our prices, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nThe portable storage industry in North America is highly competitive and fragmented. Many of the markets in which we operate are served by numerous competitors, ranging from national companies to smaller multi-regional companies and small, independent businesses with a limited number of locations. Some of these competitors currently offer products outside of our offerings or may have better brand recognition in some market sectors. If these competitors use their brand awareness to promote products that compete with our product offerings, customers may choose these competitors\u2019 products over ours, and we could lose business. A number of our competitors are competing aggressively on the basis of pricing and may drive down prices. Additionally, general economic factors could drive down market prices. To the extent that we choose to match our competitors\u2019 declining prices, it could harm our results of operations as we would have lower margins. To the extent that we choose not to match or remain within a reasonable competitive distance from our competitors\u2019 pricing, it could also harm our results of operations, as we may lose rental volume.\nThe portable liquid containment rental industry is highly competitive, and competitive pressures could impair our ability to increase market share and to rent or sell, equipment at favorable prices.\nThe portable liquid containment rental industry is highly competitive. We compete against national, regional and local companies, some of which are significantly larger than we are and have greater financial and marketing resources than we have. Some of our competitors also have longer operating histories, lower cost rental equipment and lower cost structures and more established relationships with equipment manufacturers than we have. In addition, certain of our competitors are more geographically diverse than we are and have greater name recognition among customers than we do. As a result, our competitors that have these advantages may be better able to attract customers.\nWe believe that local relationships, equipment quality, service levels and fleet size are key competitive factors in the portable liquid containment industry. From time to time, we or our competitors may attempt to compete aggressively by lowering rental rates or prices. Competitive pressures could adversely affect our future revenues and operating results by depressing the rental rates. To the extent we lower lease rates or increase our fleet size in order to retain or increase market share, our operating margins would be adversely impacted. In addition, we may not be able to match a larger competitor\u2019s price reductions or fleet investment because of its greater financial resources, all of which could adversely impact our future operating results.\nSeasonality of the portable liquid containment industry may impact future quarterly results.\nActivity may decline in our second quarter months of November and December and our third quarter months of January and February. These months may have lower rental activity in parts of the country where inclement weather may delay, or suspend, customer projects. The impact of these delays may be to decrease the number of frac tank containers on lease until companies are able to resume their projects when weather improves. These seasonal factors may impact our future quarterly results in each year\u2019s second and third quarters.\nSignificant increases in raw material costs could increase our operating costs significantly and harm our future results of operations.\nWe purchase raw materials, including metals, lumber, siding and roofing and other products, to construct and modify modular buildings and to modify containers to its customers\u2019 requirements. We also maintain a truck fleet to deliver units to and return units from customers. During periods of rising prices for raw materials, especially oil and fuel for delivery vehicles, and in particular when the prices increase rapidly or to levels significantly higher than normal, we may incur significant increases in operating costs and may not be able to pass price increases through to customers in a timely manner, which could harm our future results of operations.\nI-25\nA key for success in the oil and gas industry in North America is our ability to continue to employ and retain skilled and unskilled personnel. Any difficulty we experience replacing or adding personnel could adversely affect our business.\nWe may not be able to find enough skilled and unskilled labor to meet our needs, which could limit our growth. Oil and gas business activity historically decreases or increases with the prices of oil and natural gas. We may have problems retaining and finding enough laborers in the future, particularly if the demand for our portable liquid containment products and fluid management services increases significantly in a relatively short period of time. Other factors may also inhibit our ability to find enough workers to meet our employment needs.\nWe believe that a key to our success in the oil and gas industry in North America is our ability to continue to employ and retain skilled and unskilled personnel. Our inability to employ or retain personnel generally could have a significant adverse effect on our operations.\nA substantial portion of the revenues of Lone Star are earned from a limited number of major customers, and the loss of any one or more of these customers could adversely affect our results of operations.\nLone Star earns a substantial portion of its revenue from a limited number of major customers. One or more of these customers could cancel their leases and cease doing business with Lone Star for a variety of reasons beyond our control. The loss of one or more of these major customers could adversely affect our results of operations.\nFailure by our manufacturers to sell and deliver products in a timely fashion may harm our reputation and financial condition.\nWe currently purchase new modular buildings and components, mobile offices and container products directly from manufacturers. Although we are not dependent on any one manufacturer and are able to purchase products from a variety of suppliers, the failure of one or more of our suppliers to timely manufacture and deliver storage containers to us could adversely affect our operations. We purchase new modular buildings and components, mobile offices and storage containers under purchase orders issued to various manufacturers, which the manufacturers may or may not accept or be able to fill. We have no contracts with any supplier. If these suppliers do not timely fill our purchase orders, or do not properly manufacture the ordered products, our reputation and financial condition could be harmed.\nSome zoning laws restrict the use of our storage units and therefore limit our ability to offer products in all markets.\nMany of our customers use our storage units to store goods on their own properties. Local zoning laws in some of our markets prohibit customers from maintaining mobile offices or storage containers on their properties or require that mobile offices or storage containers be located out of sight from the street. If local zoning laws in one or more of our geographic markets were to ban or restrict our products from being stored on customers\u2019 sites, our business in that market could suffer.\nAs Department of Transportation regulations increase, our operations could be negatively impacted and competition for qualified drivers could increase.\nWe operate in the United States pursuant to operating authority granted by the U.S. Department of Transportation (\u201cDOT\u201d). Our company drivers must comply with the safety and fitness regulations of the DOT, including those relating to drug and alcohol testing and hours-of-service. Such matters as equipment weight and dimensions also are subject to government regulations. Our safety record could be ranked poorly compared to our peer firms. A poor fleet ranking may result in the loss of customers or difficulty attracting and retaining qualified drivers which could affect our results of operations. Should additional rules be enacted in the future, compliance with such rules could result in additional costs.\nSignificant Risks Related Primarily to Our Leasing Operations in the Asia-Pacific\nThe future performance of Royal Wolf depends on customer demand for portable container solutions as well as the expansion of the portable container solutions products market in Australia.\nAny reduction in customer demand, failure of customer demand to grow, or failure of Royal Wolf to meet changes in customer demand or preferences may adversely affect Royal Wolf\u2019s businesses, operational performance, growth prospects and financial position. For example, if expected growth in the portable container buildings market fails to come to fruition, or if businesses and individuals no longer demand portable container buildings at current levels, Royal Wolf\u2019s return on its portable container building investments could be negatively impacted. The demand for Royal Wolf\u2019s assets is dependent on the key industry segments into which Royal Wolf sells and lease assets, such as oil and gas, mining, construction, industrial and retail. A significant reduction in the business climate in these industry segments, could negatively impact Royal Wolf\u2019s results of operations.\nI-26\nThe success and ability to drive future growth is dependent to a large extent on brand reputation.\nRoyal Wolf believes its brand reputation is a key driver in its success and its ability to drive future growth. Any adverse change to the reputation of Royal Wolf may adversely affect the Company\u2019s businesses, operational performance and financial condition. Royal Wolf licenses the \u201cRoyal Wolf\u201d trademark in Australia, New Zealand and surrounding islands in the Asia-Pacific region. There is a risk that use of the \u201cRoyal Wolf\u201d brand by third parties in jurisdictions in which Royal Wolf does not own the trademark may adversely impact the Royal Wolf brand and consequently its business.\nRoyal Wolf\u2019s ability to achieve its long-term business strategy is dependent to a certain extent on its supply chain and purchasing.\nRoyal Wolf\u2019s long-term business strategy assumes a certain level of growth in Australian and New Zealand demand for container based solutions. Royal Wolf\u2019s ability to meet this demand is dependent, to a certain extent, on the ability of Royal Wolf to purchase storage containers economically and on a timely basis. Historically, Royal Wolf has successfully worked with shipping lines and international container leasing companies to purchase used containers, and with manufacturers and brokers, including in China, to purchase new containers, but there can be no guarantee of this in the future. Changes to shipping line practices with respect to used containers, and adverse changes in trade practices, regulations and relations between Australia and its trading partners, including China, could adversely impact Royal Wolf\u2019s ability to purchase containers or impact the price at which Royal Wolf is able to purchase containers.\nHistorically, Royal Wolf has relied on internal supply chain and sourcing arrangements, international suppliers and the logistics industry to relocate containers. Changes to these arrangements, constraints on the supply chain, failure of suppliers to deliver or deliver in a timely manner or material increases in the price of new or used containers could have an adverse impact on Royal Wolf\u2019s business, operational performance, profit margins and financial results. Royal Wolf purchases new storage container products under purchase orders issued to container manufacturers, which the manufacturers may or may not accept or be able to fill. There are several alternative sources of supply for storage containers. Though Royal Wolf is not dependent upon any one manufacturer in purchasing storage container products, the failure of one or more of its suppliers to timely deliver containers to Royal Wolf could adversely affect its operations. If these suppliers do not timely fill Royal Wolf\u2019s purchase orders or do not properly manufacture the ordered products, Royal Wolf\u2019s reputation and financial condition also could be harmed.\nRoyal Wolf conducts its business in a highly competitive sector.\nRoyal Wolf\u2019s faces competition in the portable buildings, freight and portable storage markets. Royal Wolf also faces potentially significant competition from modular industry companies who have non-container portable building offerings, especially several national competitors in Australia who have greater financial resources and pricing flexibility than Royal Wolf. As a result, Royal Wolf is subject to potential competition from new domestic and foreign competitors and the provision of new products or services, aggressive pricing and lease rates offered by existing competitors. Competition varies by region and Royal Wolf may not always be able to match its competitors in service levels, functionality and price in each or all regions. The emergence of a new competitor with international reach, or increased focus on the rental model by existing competitors, particularly with an extensive distribution network, could have an adverse effect on Royal Wolf\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects. Also, continued service improvement by competitors may result in Royal Wolf\u2019s customers using substitutes in place of some of Royal Wolf\u2019s products. Royal Wolf may not always be able to match its competitors in both functionality and price, which could negatively impact Royal Wolf\u2019s revenues. In addition, some of Royal Wolf\u2019s unique products are the subject of patent applications only and there is no guarantee that those applications will become effective. If the patent applications do not become effective, there is a risk that Royal Wolf\u2019s competitors could produce similar rival products, which may have an adverse effect on Royal Wolf.\nRoyal Wolf is subject to foreign exchange rate fluctuations.\nRoyal Wolf is subject to exchange rate fluctuations, particularly as it sources a substantial portion of its portable container solutions fleet from China in purchases, which are U.S. dollar-denominated. While Royal Wolf has a hedging policy to mitigate this risk, unhedged exchange rate fluctuations in the Australian dollar relative to the U.S. dollar and, to a lesser extent, the New Zealand dollar, may adversely affect the financial performance of Royal Wolf, including its financial position, cash flows, distributions, growth prospects and share price.\nI-27\nRoyal Wolf is subject to Australian and New Zealand taxation and tariff regulation.\nSignificant recent reforms and current proposals for further reforms to tax laws in the jurisdictions within which Royal Wolf operates may give rise to uncertainty. The precise scope and impact of future changes to tax laws may not be known. Royal Wolf is also subject to import tariffs with respect to the portable container products it sources from overseas. Any changes to such tax or tariff laws (including the imposition of, or increases to, such taxes or tariffs), their interpretation or the manner in which they are administered by the relevant government agency or the current rate of company income tax or import tariff may impact the operational or financial performance of Royal Wolf (or customers in its key end markets).\nRoyal Wolf may face a tightening labor force and is subject to Workplace Health and Safety regulations.\nRoyal Wolf\u2019s ability to remain productive, profitable and competitive and to effect its planned growth initiatives depends on its ability to attract and retain workers. Tightening of the labor market in key regions due to a shortage of suitably skilled workers may inhibit Royal Wolf\u2019s ability to hire and retain employees. Additionally, rising wages paid to employees may pose a risk to Royal Wolf\u2019s margins if it is unable to pass on such higher costs through price increases.\nRoyal Wolf is also subject to Workplace Health and Safety regulations. If Royal Wolf is not able to maintain its working conditions to meet Workplace Health and Safety regulations it may impact Royal Wolf\u2019s operations and ability to attract and retain workers and also result in contravention of those regulations, which may give rise to potential criminal and civil liability and also damage Royal Wolf\u2019s brand and reputation.\nSignificant Risks Related Primarily to Our Manufacturing Operations in North America\nDemand for our manufacturing products in North America is to a significant degree dependent on the levels of expenditures and drilling activity by the oil and gas industry, primarily in Texas, and can fluctuate significantly in a short period of time. The viability of our manufacturing operations during times of reductions in domestic drilling activity and demand for our portable liquid containment products may be significantly reliant on the commercial success of other steel-based products to industry sectors outside of the oil and gas market.\nThe substantial downturn in the domestic oil and gas industry since the second quarter of our fiscal year ended June 30, 2015 has resulted in lower expenditures and reduced drilling, which in turn has had a material adverse effect on the results of operations and cash flows of our manufacturing operations in North America. In order to remain commercially viable and diversify outside of the portable liquid containment business, our manufacturing operations have focused on introducing steel-based products for non-oil and gas markets, which include a chassis product line targeted to the North American transportation market and the production of GLOs for the portable storage market. While we closely monitor the situation and are hopeful of the commercial success of these new steel-based products, there is no assurance that such commercial success or viability will be attained. In FY 2016, operating losses from reduced demand of our portable liquid containment tanks and related products and the manufacturing inefficiencies inherent in the introduction of new product lines resulted in the recording of a goodwill impairment charge.\nSignificant competition in the oil and gas industry in which Southern Frac produces its portable liquid containment products may result in its competitors offering new or better products and services or lower prices, which could result in a loss of customers and a decrease in revenues.\nThe portable liquid storage tank container manufacturing industry is highly competitive. Southern Frac competes with other manufacturers of varying sizes, some of which have substantial financial resources. Manufacturers compete primarily on the quality of their products, customer relationships, service availability and cost. Barriers to entry are low. As a result, it is possible that additional competitors could enter the market at any time. If Southern Frac is unable to successfully compete with other portable liquid storage tank container manufacturers it could lose customers and our revenues may decline.\nSeasonality of the portable liquid containment industry may impact future quarterly results.\nWhile the oil and gas industry is extremely volatile, historically, activity may typically decline in our second quarter months of November and December and our third quarter months of January and February. These months may have lower rental activity in parts of the country where inclement weather may delay, or suspend, customer projects. The impact of these delays may be to decrease the number of frac tank containers sold until companies are able to resume their projects when weather improves. These seasonal factors may impact Southern Frac\u2019s future operating results in each fiscal year\u2019s second and third quarters.\nI-28\nDifficulties Associated with Fixed Capacity Levels\nSouthern Frac\u2019s ability to increase manufacturing capacity may require significant investments in equipment and personnel. To the extent that we make investments to increase manufacturing capacity and demand for our products is not sustained, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. Conversely, if we choose not to make investments to increase manufacturing capacity, our ability to meet customer demand for our products and increase revenues may be adversely affected. Additionally, operating our facilities at near full capacity levels may cause us to incur labor costs at premium rates in order to meet customer requirements, experience increased maintenance expenses or require us to replace our machinery and equipment on an accelerated basis, each of which could cause our results of operations and financial condition to be adversely affected.\nImplementation of Operational Improvements\nAs part of our ongoing focus on being a low-cost provider of high quality products, we periodically analyze our business to further improve our operations. Our continued analysis may include identifying and implementing opportunities for: (i) further rationalization of manufacturing capacity; (ii) streamlining of selling, general and administrative overhead; or (iii) efficient investment in new equipment and the upgrading of existing equipment. We may be unable to successfully identify or implement plans targeting these initiatives, or fail to realize the benefits of the plans we have already implemented, as a result of operational difficulties, a weakening of the economy or other factors.\nCost reductions may not fully offset decreases in the prices of our products due to the time required to develop and implement cost reduction initiatives. Additional factors, such as inconsistent customer ordering patterns, increasing product complexity and heightened quality standards, may also make it more difficult to reduce our costs. It is also possible that as we incur costs to implement improvement strategies, the initial impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flow may be adverse and we may not be able to successfully realize sufficient cost savings to mitigate this adverse impact.\nSouthern Frac\u2019s business could be harmed if we fail to maintain proper inventory levels.\nSouthern Frac is required to maintain sufficient inventories to accommodate the needs of its customers including, in many cases, short lead times on delivery requirements. We purchase raw materials on a regular basis in an effort to maintain our inventory at levels that we believe are sufficient to satisfy the anticipated needs of our customers based upon orders, customer volume expectations, historic buying practices and market conditions. Inventory levels in excess of customer demand may result in the use of higher-priced inventory to fill orders reflecting lower selling prices, if steel prices have significantly decreased. These events could adversely affect our financial results. Conversely, if we underestimate demand for our products or if our suppliers fail to supply quality products in a timely manner, we may experience inventory shortages. Inventory shortages could result in unfilled orders, negatively impacting our customer relationships and resulting in lost revenues, which could harm our business and adversely affect our financial results.\nSouthern Frac\u2019s future operating results may be affected by fluctuations in raw material prices, and it may be unable to pass on any increases in raw material costs to its customers.\nSouthern Frac\u2019s principal raw material is steel. The steel industry as a whole has been cyclical, and at times availability and steel prices can be volatile due to a number of factors beyond our control. These factors include general economic conditions, domestic and worldwide demand, the influence of hedge funds and other investment funds participating in commodity markets, curtailed production from major suppliers due to factors such as the closing or idling of facilities, accidents or equipment breakdowns, repairs or catastrophic events, labor costs or problems, competition, new laws and regulations, import duties, tariffs, energy costs, availability and cost of steel inputs (e.g., ore, scrap, coke and energy), currency exchange rates and other factors. This volatility, as well as any increases in raw material costs, could significantly affect our steel costs and adversely impact our financial results. If our suppliers increase the prices of our critical raw materials, we may not have alternative sources of supply. In addition, in an environment of increasing prices for steel and other raw materials, competitive conditions may impact how much of the price increases we can pass on to our customers. To the extent we are unable to pass on future price increases in our raw materials to customers, our financial results could be adversely affected. Also, if steel prices decrease, competitive conditions may impact how quickly we must reduce our prices to our customers, and we could be forced to use higher-priced raw materials to complete orders for which the selling prices have decreased. Decreasing steel prices could also require us to write-down the value of our inventory to reflect current market pricing.\nThe loss of key supplier relationships could adversely affect Southern Frac.\nSouthern Frac has developed relationships with certain steel and other suppliers which have been beneficial to us by providing more assured delivery and a more favorable all-in cost, which includes price and shipping costs. If any of those relationships were disrupted, it could have an adverse effect on delivery times and the overall cost and quality of\nI-29\nour raw materials, which could have a negative impact on our business. In addition, we do not have long-term contracts with any of our suppliers. If, in the future, we are unable to obtain sufficient amounts of steel and other products at competitive prices and on a timely basis from our traditional suppliers, we may be unable to obtain these products from alternative sources at competitive prices to meet our delivery schedule, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe costs of manufacturing Southern Frac\u2019s products and its ability to supply customers could be negatively impacted if we experience interruptions in deliveries of needed raw materials or supplies.\nIf, for any reason, Southern Frac\u2019s supply of steel is curtailed or it otherwise is unable to obtain the quantities it needs at competitive prices, our business could suffer and our financial results could be adversely affected. Such interruptions could result from a number of factors, including a shortage of capacity in the supplier base of raw materials, energy or the inputs needed to make steel or other supplies, a failure of suppliers to fulfill their supply or delivery obligations, financial difficulties of suppliers resulting in the closing or idling of supplier facilities, other significant events affecting supplier facilities, significant weather events and other factors, all of which are beyond our control.\nThe loss of significant volume from key customers could adversely affect Southern Frac.\nA significant loss of, or decrease in, business from any of its key customers could have an adverse effect on Southern Frac\u2019s sales and financial results if it cannot obtain replacement business. In addition, certain of its top customers may be able to exert pricing and other influences on Southern Frac, requiring it to market, deliver and promote its products in a manner that may be more costly. Moreover, Southern Frac generally does not have long-term contracts with its customers. As a result, although its customers periodically provide indications of their product needs and purchases, they generally purchase Southern Frac\u2019s products on an order-by-order basis, and the relationship, as well as particular orders, can be terminated at any time.\nSignificant Risks Related Primarily to Our Series C Preferred Stock\nWe cannot assure that quarterly dividends on, or any other payments in respect of, the Series C Preferred Shares will be made timely or at all.\nWe cannot assure that we will be able to pay quarterly dividends on the Series C Preferred Shares or to redeem the Series C Preferred Shares, if we wanted to do so. Quarterly dividends on our Series C Preferred Shares will be paid from funds legally available for such purpose when, as and if declared by our board of directors. Certain factors may influence our decision, or adversely affect our ability, to pay dividends on, or make other payments in respect of, our Series C Preferred Shares, including, among other things:\n\u2022\nthe amount of our available cash or other liquid assets, including the impact of any liquidity shortfalls caused by the below-described restrictions on the ability of our subsidiaries to generate and transfer cash to us;\n\u2022\nour ability to service and refinance our current and future indebtedness;\n\u2022\nchanges in our cash requirements to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions or other operational or strategic initiatives;\n\u2022\nour ability to borrow or raise additional capital to satisfy our capital needs;\n\u2022\nrestrictions imposed by our existing, or any future, credit facilities, debt securities or leases, including restricted payment and leverage covenants that could limit our ability to make payments to holders of the Series C Preferred Shares;\n\u2022\nlimitations on our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to distribute cash to us due to third parties holding equity interests in those subsidiaries; and\n\u2022\nlimitations on cash payments to shareholders under Delaware law, including limitations that require dividend payments be made out of surplus or, subject to certain limitations, out of net profits for the then-current or preceding year in the event there is no surplus.\n\u2022\nOur ability to maintain a Fixed Charge Ratio, as defined, of no less than 2.00.\nBased on its evaluation of these and other relevant factors, our board of directors may, in its sole discretion, decide not to declare a dividend on the Series C Preferred Shares for any quarterly period for any reason, regardless of whether we have funds legally available for such purpose. In such event, a holder\u2019s sole recourse will be its rights as a holder of Series C Preferred Shares, which includes the right to cumulative dividends and, under certain specified circumstances, to additional interest and limited conditional voting rights.\nI-30\nGFN\u2019s ability, as a holding company, to make payments in respect of the Series C Preferred Shares depends on the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us.\nGFN is a holding company and, accordingly, substantially all of our operations are conducted through our subsidiaries. As a result, GFN\u2019s cash flow and ability to make dividend payments to our stockholders depend on the earnings of our subsidiaries, the distribution from our subsidiaries and compliance with the covenants governing the indebtedness of our subsidiaries, including, without limitation, covenants of the senior credit facilities of our subsidiaries that permit dividends and other payments from such subsidiaries to GFN. Payments by our subsidiaries to GFN are also contingent upon those subsidiaries\u2019 earnings and business considerations. Furthermore, GFN\u2019s right to receive any assets of any of our subsidiaries upon their liquidation, reorganization or otherwise, and thus the ability of a holder of Series C Preferred Stock to benefit indirectly from such distribution, will be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiaries\u2019 creditors.\nThe terms of the revolving senior secured credit facility with a syndicate led by Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (\u201cWells Fargo\u201d) limit the ability of our North American Leasing operations to upstream funds to GFN that would be used to pay dividends on the Series C Preferred Stock. If the amount of the dividends payable on the Series C Preferred Stock exceeds the amount of the funds our North American Leasing operations are permitted to pay GFN, and GFN is unable to generate sufficient cash from its other subsidiaries for a dividend payment, GFN may not be able to make the required dividend payment on the Series C Preferred Stock. Our ability to pay dividends or make other payments to the holders of our Series C Preferred Shares will be adversely affected if the senior credit facility prohibits the transfer of funds to GFN.\nThe Series C Preferred Shares represent perpetual equity interests.\nThe Series C Preferred Shares represent perpetual equity interests in us and, unlike our indebtedness, will not entitle the holders thereof to receive payment of a principal amount at a particular date. As a result, holders of the Series C Preferred Shares may be required to bear the financial risks of an investment in the Series C Preferred Shares for an indefinite period of time. In addition, the Series C Preferred Shares will rank junior to all our indebtedness and other liabilities, and to any other senior securities we may issue in the future with respect to assets available to satisfy claims against us. In addition, the lack of a fixed mandatory redemption date for the Series C Preferred Shares will increase your reliance on the secondary market for liquidity purposes.\nInvestors should not expect us to redeem the Series C Preferred Shares on the date the Series C Preferred Shares become redeemable by the Company or on any particular date afterwards.\nThe shares of Series C Preferred Shares have no maturity or mandatory redemption date and are not redeemable at the option of investors under any circumstances. By their terms, the Series C Preferred Shares may be redeemed by us at our option either in whole or in part at any time on or after May 17, 2018 or, under certain circumstances, may be redeemed by us at our option, in whole, sooner than that date. Any decision we may make at any time regarding whether to redeem the Series C Preferred Shares will depend upon a wide variety of factors, including our evaluation of our capital position, our capital requirements and general market conditions at that time. However, investors should not assume that we will redeem the Series C Preferred Shares at any particular time, or at all.\nIncreases in market interest rates may adversely affect the trading price of our Series C Preferred Shares.\nOne of the factors that will influence the trading price of our Series C Preferred Shares will be the dividend yield on the Series C Preferred Shares relative to market interest rates. An increase in market interest rates may reduce demand for our Series C Preferred Shares and would likely increase our borrowing costs and potentially decrease funds available for distribution. Accordingly, higher market interest rates could cause the market price of our Series C Preferred Shares to decrease.\nThe Series C Preferred Shares have not been rated and the lack of a rating may adversely affect the trading price of the Series C Preferred Shares.\nWe have not sought to obtain a rating for the Series C Preferred Shares, and the shares may never be rated. It is possible, however, that one or more rating agencies might independently determine to assign a rating to the Series C Preferred Shares or that we may elect to obtain a rating of our Series C Preferred Shares in the future. In addition, we may elect to issue other securities for which we may seek to obtain a rating. The market value of the Series C Preferred Shares could be adversely affected if:\n\u2022\nany ratings assigned to the Series C Preferred Shares in the future or to other securities we issue in the future are lower than market expectations or are subsequently lowered or withdrawn;\n\u2022\nor ratings for such other securities would imply a lower relative value for the Series C Preferred Shares.\nI-31\nThe interests of holders in the Series C Preferred Shares could be diluted by our issuance of additional shares of preferred stock, including additional Series C Preferred Shares, and by other transactions.\nOur charter currently authorizes the issuance of up to one million shares of preferred stock in one or more classes or series, and we will be permitted, without notice to or consent of the holders of Series C Preferred Shares, to issue additional Series C Preferred Shares or other securities that have rights junior to such shares, up to the maximum aggregate number of authorized shares of our preferred stock. The issuance of additional preferred stock on a parity with or senior to our Series C Preferred Shares would dilute the interests of the holders of our Series C Preferred Shares, and any issuance of preferred stock senior to or on a parity with our Series C Preferred Shares or of additional indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to pay dividends on, redeem or pay the liquidation preference on our Series C Preferred Shares. We cannot assure that quarterly dividends on, or any other payments in respect of, the Series C Preferred Shares will be made timely or at all and there are effectively no provisions relating to our Series C Preferred Shares that protect the holders of our Series C Preferred Shares in the event of a highly leveraged or other transaction, including a merger or the sale, lease or conveyance of all or substantially all our assets or business; any of which might adversely affect the holders of our Series C Preferred Shares.\nA holder of Series C Preferred Shares has extremely limited voting rights.\nVoting rights as a holder of Series C Preferred Shares will be extremely limited. However, in the event that six quarterly dividends, whether consecutive or not, payable on Series C Preferred Shares are in arrears or a listing failure has occurred and is continuing, the holders of Series C Preferred Shares will have the right, voting together as a class with all other classes or series of parity securities upon which like voting rights have been conferred and are exercisable, to elect two additional directors to serve on our board of directors.\nThe Series C Preferred Shares are not convertible, and purchasers may not realize a corresponding benefit if the trading price of our common stock rises.\nThe Series C Preferred Shares are not convertible into our common shares and do not have exchange rights or entitled or subject to any preemptive or similar rights. Accordingly, the market value of the Series C Preferred Shares may depend to some degree on, among other things, dividend and interest rates for other securities and other investment alternatives and our actual and perceived ability to make dividend or other payments in respect of our Series C Preferred Shares rather than the trading price of our common stock. In addition, our right to redeem the Series C Preferred Shares on or after May 17, 2018 or in the event of a change in control could impose a ceiling on their value.\nSignificant Risks Related Primarily to Our Senior Notes\nThe Senior Notes are not rated, and the issuance of a credit rating could adversely affect the market price of the Senior Notes.\nAt their issuance, the Senior Notes were not rated by any credit rating agency. However, the Senior Notes may subsequently be rated by one or more of the credit rating agencies. If the Senior Notes are rated, the rating could be lower than expected, and such a rating could have an adverse effect on the market price of the Senior Notes. Furthermore, credit rating agencies revise their ratings from time to time and could lower or withdraw any rating issued with respect to the Senior Notes. Any real or anticipated downgrade or withdrawal of any ratings of the Senior Notes could have an adverse effect on the market price or liquidity of the Senior Notes.\nRatings reflect only the views of the issuing credit rating agency or agencies and are not recommendations to purchase, sell or hold any particular security, including the Senior Notes. In addition, ratings do not reflect market prices or suitability of a security for a particular investor, and any future rating of the Senior Notes may not reflect all risks related to us and our business or the structure or market value of the Senior Notes.\nWe are the sole obligor of the Senior Notes, and our direct and indirect subsidiaries do not guarantee our obligations under the Senior Notes and do not have any obligation with respect to the Senior Notes. Furthermore, your right to receive payment on the Senior Notes will be structurally subordinated to the liabilities of our subsidiaries.\nGFN is a holding company with no business operations or assets other than the capital stock of its direct and indirect subsidiaries. Consequently, we will be dependent on loans, dividends and other payments from these subsidiaries to make payments of principal and interest on the Senior Notes. However, our subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities, and they will have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay the amounts due under the Senior Notes or to make any funds available to pay those amounts, whether by dividend, distribution, loan or other payments. Holders of the Senior Notes will not have any direct claim on the cash flows or assets of our direct and indirect subsidiaries.\nI-32\nThe ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends and make other payments to us will depend on their cash flows and earnings, which, in turn, will be affected by all of the factors discussed in our Annual Report on Form 10-K. The ability of our direct and indirect subsidiaries to pay dividends and make distributions to us may be restricted by, among other things, applicable laws and regulations and by the terms of the agreements into which they enter. If we are unable to obtain funds from our direct and indirect subsidiaries as a result of restrictions under their debt or other agreements, applicable laws and regulations or otherwise, we may not be able to pay cash interest or principal on the Senior Notes when due.\nThe Senior Notes are structurally subordinated to all indebtedness of our subsidiaries. While the indenture governing the Senior Notes will limit the indebtedness and activities of these subsidiaries, holders of indebtedness of, and trade creditors of, our subsidiaries, are entitled to payments of their claims from the assets of such subsidiaries before those assets are made available for distribution to us, as direct or indirect shareholder. Accordingly, in the event that any of our subsidiaries becomes insolvent, liquidates or otherwise reorganizes:\n\u2022\nthe creditors of such subsidiary (including the holders of the Senior Notes) will have no right to proceed against such subsidiary\u2019s assets; and\n\u2022\nthe creditors of such subsidiary, including trade creditors, will generally be entitled to payment in full from the sale or other disposal of assets of such subsidiary before we, as direct or indirect stockholder, will be entitled to receive any distributions from such subsidiary.\nGFN\u2019s ability, as a holding company, to make payments in respect of the Senior Notes depends on the ability of our subsidiaries to transfer funds to us.\nGFN\u2019s cash flow and ability to make payments in respect of the Senior Notes depends on the earnings of our subsidiaries, the distribution from our subsidiaries and compliance with the covenants governing the indebtedness of our subsidiaries, including, without limitation, covenants of the senior credit facilities of our subsidiaries that permit dividends and other payments from such subsidiaries to GFN. Payments by our subsidiaries to GFN are also contingent upon those subsidiaries\u2019 earnings and business considerations. Furthermore, GFN\u2019s right to receive any assets of any of our subsidiaries upon their liquidation, reorganization or otherwise, and thus the ability of a holder of Senior Notes to benefit indirectly from such distribution, will be subject to the prior claims of the subsidiaries\u2019 creditors.\nThe terms of the revolving senior credit facility with a syndicate led by Wells Fargo limit the ability of our North American Leasing operations to upstream funds to GFN that would be used to pay interest on the Senior Notes. If the amount of the interest payable on the Senior Notes exceeds the amount of the funds our North American Leasing operations are permitted to pay GFN, and GFN is unable to generate sufficient cash from its other subsidiaries for an interest payment, GFN may not be able to make the required interest payment on the Senior Notes. Our ability to pay interest or principal to the holders of our Senior Notes will be adversely affected if the senior credit facility prohibits the transfer of funds to GFN.\nWe may be unable to repurchase the Senior Notes upon a change of control.\nIn the event of a \u201cchange of control,\u201d as defined in the indenture governing our Senior Notes, we must offer to purchase the Senior Notes at a purchase price equal to 101% of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of repurchase. In the event that we are required to make such offer with respect to the Senior Notes, there can be no assurance that we would have sufficient funds available to purchase any Senior Notes, and we may be required to refinance the Senior Notes. There can be no assurance that we would be able to accomplish a refinancing or, if a refinancing were to occur, that it would be accomplished on commercially reasonable terms. The revolving credit facilities of our subsidiaries prohibit us from repurchasing any of the Senior Notes, except under limited circumstances. The revolving credit facilities of our subsidiaries also provide that certain change of control events would constitute a default. In the event a change of control occurs at a time when we are prohibited from purchasing the Senior Notes, we could seek the consent of the lenders under the revolving credit facilities of our U.S. subsidiaries to purchase the Senior Notes. If we did not obtain such consent, we would remain prohibited from purchasing the Senior Notes. In this case, our failure to purchase would constitute an event of default under the indenture governing the Senior Notes.\nChanges in the credit markets could adversely affect the market price of the Senior Notes.\nThe market price for the Senior Notes will be based on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe prevailing interest rates being paid by other companies similar to us; and\n\u2022\nand the overall condition of the financial markets.\nI-33\nThe condition of the credit markets and prevailing interest rates have fluctuated in the past and can be expected to fluctuate in the future. Fluctuations in these factors could have an adverse effect on the price and liquidity of the Senior Notes.\nAn increase in market interest rates could result in a decrease in the relative value of the Senior Notes.\nIn general, as market interest rates rise, Senior Notes bearing interest at a fixed rate generally decline in value. Consequently, if you purchase these Senior Notes and market interest rates increase, the market values of your Senior Notes may decline. We cannot predict the future level of market interest rates.\nWe could enter into various transactions that could increase the amount of our outstanding debt, or adversely affect our capital structure or credit rating, or otherwise adversely affect holders of the Senior Notes.\nSubject to certain exceptions relating to incurring certain liens or entering into certain sale and leaseback transactions, the terms of the Senior Notes do not prevent us from entering into a variety of acquisition, divestiture, refinancing, recapitalization or other highly leveraged transactions. As a result, we could enter into any such transaction even though the transaction could increase the total amount of our outstanding indebtedness, adversely affect our capital structure or credit rating or otherwise adversely affect the holders of the Senior Notes.\nRedemption may adversely affect your return on the Senior Notes.\nWe have the right to redeem some or all of the Senior Notes prior to maturity. We may redeem the Senior Notes at times when prevailing interest rates may be relatively low compared to rates at the time of issuance of the Senior Notes. Accordingly, you may not be able to reinvest the redemption proceeds in a comparable security at an effective interest rate as high as that of the Senior Notes.", "PERMNO": 91299, "SIC": 7359, "TIC": "GFN"}
