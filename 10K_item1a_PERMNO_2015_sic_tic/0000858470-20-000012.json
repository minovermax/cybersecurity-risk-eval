RISK FACTORS\nCommodity prices fluctuate widely, and low prices for an extended period would likely have a material adverse impact on our business.\nOur revenues, operating results, financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prices we receive for the natural gas that we sell. Lower commodity prices may reduce the amount of natural gas that we can produce economically. Historically, commodity prices have been volatile, with prices fluctuating widely, and they are likely to continue to be volatile. Because substantially all of our reserves are natural gas, changes in natural gas prices have a more significant impact on our financial results. Natural gas prices, based on the NYMEX Henry Hub Natural Gas Futures Final Settlement prices, were $3.642 per Mmbtu in January 2019 and $2.470 per Mmbtu in December 2019. Prices have continued to decline to $1.877 per Mmbtu in February 2020. Any substantial or extended decline in future commodity prices would have, a material adverse effect on our future business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity or ability to finance planned capital expenditures and commitments. Furthermore, substantial, extended decreases in commodity prices may cause us to delay or postpone a significant portion of our exploration, development and exploitation projects or may render such projects uneconomic, which may result in significant downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves and could negatively impact our ability to borrow and cost of capital and our ability to access capital markets, increase our costs under our revolving credit facility, and limit our ability to execute aspects of our business plans. Refer to \"Risk Factors-Future commodity price declines may result in write-downs of the carrying amount of our oil and gas properties, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\"\nWide fluctuations in commodity prices may result from relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for natural gas and oil, market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control. These factors include but are not limited to the following:\n\u2022\nthe levels and location of natural gas and oil supply and demand and expectations regarding supply and demand, including the potential long-term impact of an abundance of natural gas from shale (such as that produced from our Marcellus Shale properties) on the global natural gas supply;\n\u2022\nthe level of consumer demand for natural gas and oil;\n\u2022\nweather conditions;\n\u2022\npolitical conditions or hostilities in natural gas and oil producing regions, including the Middle East, Africa, South America and the United States;\n\u2022\nthe ability and willingness of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other exporting nations to agree to and maintain oil price and production controls;\n\u2022\nthe price level and quantities of foreign imports;\n\u2022\nactions of governmental authorities;\n\u2022\nthe availability, proximity and capacity of gathering, transportation, processing and/or refining facilities in regional or localized areas that may affect the realized price for natural gas and oil;\n\u2022\ninventory storage levels;\n\u2022\nthe nature and extent of domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxation, including environmental and climate change regulation;\n\u2022\nthe price, availability and acceptance of alternative fuels;\n\u2022\ntechnological advances affecting energy consumption;\n\u2022\nspeculation by investors in oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nvariations between product prices at sales points and applicable index prices; and\n\u2022\noverall economic conditions, including the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other major currencies.\nThese factors and the volatile nature of the energy markets make it impossible to predict the future commodity prices. If commodity prices remain low or continue to decline significantly for a sustained period of time, the lower prices may cause us\nto reduce our planned drilling program or adversely affect our ability to make planned expenditures, raise additional capital or meet our financial obligations.\nDrilling natural gas and oil wells is a high-risk activity.\nOur growth is materially dependent upon the success of our drilling program. Drilling for natural gas and oil involves numerous risks, including the risk that no commercially productive reservoirs will be encountered. The cost of drilling, completing and operating wells is substantial and uncertain, and drilling operations may be curtailed, delayed or canceled as a result of a variety of factors beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\ndecreases in commodity prices;\n\u2022\nunexpected drilling conditions, pressure or irregularities in formations;\n\u2022\nequipment failures or accidents;\n\u2022\nadverse weather conditions;\n\u2022\nsurface access restrictions;\n\u2022\nloss of title or other title related issues;\n\u2022\nlack of available gathering or processing facilities or delays in the construction thereof;\n\u2022\ncompliance with, or changes in, governmental requirements and regulation, including with respect to wastewater disposal, discharge of greenhouse gases and fracturing; and\n\u2022\ncosts of shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs or crews and the delivery of equipment and materials.\nOur future drilling activities may not be successful and, if unsuccessful, such failure will have an adverse effect on our future results of operations and financial condition. Our overall drilling success rate or our drilling success rate within a particular geographic area may decline. We may be unable to lease or drill identified or budgeted prospects within our expected time frame, or at all. We may be unable to lease or drill a particular prospect because, in some cases, we identify a prospect or drilling location before seeking an option or lease rights in the prospect or location. Similarly, our drilling schedule may vary from our capital budget. The final determination with respect to the drilling of any scheduled or budgeted wells will be dependent on a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe results of exploration efforts and the acquisition, review and analysis of seismic data;\n\u2022\nthe availability of sufficient capital resources to us and the other participants for the drilling of the prospects;\n\u2022\nthe approval of the prospects by other participants after additional data has been compiled;\n\u2022\neconomic and industry conditions at the time of drilling, including prevailing and anticipated prices for natural gas and oil and the availability of drilling rigs and crews;\n\u2022\nour financial resources and results; and\n\u2022\nthe availability of leases and permits on reasonable terms for the prospects and any delays in obtaining such permits.\nThese projects may not be successfully developed and the wells, if drilled, may not encounter reservoirs of commercially productive natural gas or oil.\nOur proved reserves are estimates. Any material inaccuracies in our reserve estimates or underlying assumptions could cause the quantities and net present value of our reserves to be overstated or understated\nReserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of natural gas and oil that cannot be measured in an exact manner. The process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is complex and inherently imprecise, and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates. The process relies on interpretations of available geologic, geophysical, engineering and production data. The extent, quality and reliability of this technical data can vary. The process also requires certain economic assumptions, some of which are mandated by the SEC, such as commodity prices. Additional assumptions include drilling and operating expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. Furthermore, different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserves and cash flows based on the same data.\nResults of drilling, testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revising the original estimate. Accordingly, initial reserve estimates often vary from the quantities of natural gas and oil that are ultimately recovered, and such variances may be material. Any significant variance could reduce the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves.\nAs of December 31, 2019, approximately 38 percent of our estimated proved reserves (by volume) were undeveloped. These reserve estimates reflect our plans to make capital expenditures for estimated future development costs of $1.8 billion to convert our PUD reserves into proved developed reserves. The estimated future development costs associated with our PUD reserves may not equal our actual costs, development may not occur as scheduled and results may not be as estimated. If we choose not to develop our PUD reserves, or if we are not otherwise able to successfully develop them, we will be required to remove them from our reported proved reserves. In addition, under the SEC\u2019s reserve reporting rules, because PUD reserves generally may be booked only if they relate to wells scheduled to be drilled within five years of the date of booking, we may be required to remove any PUD reserves that are not developed within this five-year time frame.\nYou should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows from our proved reserves is the current market value of our estimated reserves. In accordance with SEC requirements, we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on the 12-month average index price for the respective commodity, calculated as the unweighted arithmetic average for the first day of the month price for each month and costs in effect on the date of the estimate, holding the prices and costs constant throughout the life of the properties. Actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the net present value estimate, and future net present value estimates using then current prices and costs may be significantly less than the current estimate. In addition, the 10 percent discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flows for reporting requirements in compliance with the applicable accounting standards may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and gas industry in general.\nFuture commodity price declines may result in write-downs of the carrying amount of our oil and gas properties, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe value of our oil and gas properties depends on commodity prices. Declines in these prices as well as increases in development costs, changes in well performance, delays in asset development or deterioration of drilling results may result in our having to make material downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves, and could result in an impairment charge and a corresponding write-down of the carrying amount of our oil and natural gas properties. Because substantially all of our reserves are natural gas, changes in natural gas prices have a more significant impact on our financial results.\nWe evaluate our oil and gas properties for impairment on a field-by-field basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate a property's carrying amount may not be recoverable. We compare expected undiscounted future cash flows to the net book value of the asset. If the future undiscounted expected cash flows, based on our estimate of future commodity prices, operating costs and anticipated production from proved reserves and risk-adjusted probable and possible reserves, are lower than the net book value of the asset, the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value. Commodity pricing is estimated by using a combination of assumptions management uses in its budgeting and forecasting process as well as historical and current prices adjusted for geographical location and quality differentials, as well as other factors that management believes will impact realizable prices. In the event that commodity prices decline, there could be a significant revision in the future.\nOur producing properties are geographically concentrated in the Marcellus Shale in northeast Pennsylvania, making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating in one major geographic area.\nOur producing properties are geographically concentrated in the Marcellus Shale in northeast Pennsylvania. At December 31, 2019 substantially all of our proved developed reserves and equivalent production were attributable to our properties located in the Marcellus Shale. As a result of this concentration, we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of regional supply and demand factors, state and local political forces and governmental regulation, processing or transportation capacity constraints, market limitations, severe weather events, water shortages or other conditions or interruption of the processing or transportation of oil, natural gas or NGLs in the region.\nOur future performance depends on our ability to find or acquire additional natural gas and oil reserves that are economically recoverable.\nIn general, the production rate of oil and gas properties declines as reserves are depleted, with the rate of decline depending on reservoir characteristics. Unless we successfully replace the reserves that we produce, our reserves will decline, eventually resulting in a decrease in natural gas production and lower revenues and cash flow from operations. Our future production is, therefore, highly dependent on our level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves. We may not be\nable to replace reserves through our exploration, development and exploitation activities or by acquiring properties at acceptable costs. Low commodity prices may further limit the kinds of reserves that we can develop and produce economically.\nOur reserve report estimates that production from our proved developed reserves as of December 31, 2019 will decrease at a rate of 13 percent, 26 percent, 18 percent and 14 percent during 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023, respectively. Future development of proved undeveloped and other reserves currently not classified as proved developed producing will impact these rates of decline. Because of higher initial decline rates from newly developed reserves, we consider this pattern to be fairly typical.\nExploration, development and exploitation activities involve numerous risks that may result in, among other things, dry holes, the failure to produce natural gas and oil in commercial quantities and the inability to fully produce discovered reserves.\nWe have substantial capital requirements, and we may not be able to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms, if at all.\nWe make and expect to make substantial capital expenditures in connection with our development and production projects. We rely upon access to both our revolving credit facility and longer-term capital markets as sources of liquidity for any capital requirements not satisfied by cash flow from operations or other sources. Future challenges in the global financial system, including the capital markets, may adversely affect our business and our financial condition. Our ability to access the capital markets may be restricted at a time when we desire, or need, to raise capital, which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions. Adverse economic and market conditions could adversely affect the collectability of our trade receivables and cause our commodity hedging counterparties to be unable to perform their obligations or to seek bankruptcy protection. Future challenges in the economy could also lead to reduced demand for natural gas which could have a negative impact on our revenues.\nRisks associated with our debt and the provisions of our debt agreements could adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $1.2 billion of debt outstanding and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future. Increases in our level of indebtedness may:\n\u2022\nrequire us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow to make debt service payments, which will reduce the funds that would otherwise be available for operations, returning free cash flow to shareholders and future business opportunities;\n\u2022\nlimit our operating flexibility due to financial and other restrictive covenants, including restrictions on incurring additional debt, making certain investments, and paying dividends;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors with lower debt service obligations;\n\u2022\ndepending on the levels of our outstanding debt, limit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, general corporate and other purposes; and\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to downturns in our business or the economy, including declines in commodity prices.\nIn addition, the margins we pay under our revolving credit facility depend on our leverage ratio. Accordingly, increases in the amount of our indebtedness without corresponding increases in our consolidated EBITDAX, or decreases in our EBITDAX without a corresponding decrease in our indebtedness, may result in an increase in our interest expense.\nOur debt agreements also require compliance with covenants to maintain specified financial ratios. If commodity prices deteriorate from current levels or continue for an extended period, it could lead to reduced revenues, cash flow and earnings, which in turn could lead to a default due to lack of covenant compliance. Because the calculations of the financial ratios are made as of certain dates, the financial ratios can fluctuate significantly from period to period. A prolonged period of lower commodity prices could further increase the risk of our inability to comply with covenants to maintain specified financial ratios. In order to provide a margin of comfort with regard to these financial covenants, we may seek to reduce our capital expenditures, sell non-strategic assets or opportunistically modify or increase our derivative instruments to the extent permitted under our debt agreements. In addition, we may seek to refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to successfully execute any of these strategies, and such strategies may be unavailable on favorable terms or at all. For more information about our debt agreements, please read \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Financial Condition - Capital Resources and Liquidity.\u201d\nThe borrowing base under our revolving credit facility may be reduced, which could limit us in the future.\nThe borrowing base under our revolving credit facility is currently $3.2 billion, and lender commitments under our revolving credit facility are $1.5 billion. The borrowing base is redetermined annually under the terms of our revolving credit facility on April 1. In addition, either we or the banks may request an interim redetermination twice a year or in conjunction with certain acquisitions or sales of oil and gas properties. Our borrowing base may decrease as a result of lower commodity prices, operating difficulties, declines in reserves, lending requirements or regulations, the issuance of new indebtedness or for any other reason. In the event of a decrease in our borrowing base due to declines in commodity prices or otherwise, our ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility may be limited and we could be required to repay any indebtedness in excess of the redetermined borrowing base. In addition, we may be unable to access the equity or debt capital markets, including the market for senior unsecured notes, to meet our obligations, including any such debt repayment obligations.\nStrategic determinations, including the allocation of capital and other resources to strategic opportunities, are challenging, and our failure to appropriately allocate capital and resources among our strategic opportunities may adversely affect our financial condition and reduce our growth rate.\nOur future growth prospects are dependent upon our ability to identify optimal strategies for our business. In developing our business plan, we considered allocating capital and other resources to various aspects of our businesses including well-development (primarily drilling), reserve acquisitions, exploratory activity, corporate items and other alternatives. We also considered our likely sources of capital. Notwithstanding the determinations made in the development of our 2020 plan, business opportunities not previously identified periodically come to our attention, including possible acquisitions and dispositions. If we fail to identify optimal business strategies, or fail to optimize our capital investment and capital raising opportunities and the use of our other resources in furtherance of our business strategies, our financial condition and growth rate may be adversely affected. Moreover, economic or other circumstances may change from those contemplated by our 2020 plan, and our failure to recognize or respond to those changes may limit our ability to achieve our objectives.\nNegative public perception regarding us and/or our industry could have an adverse effect on our operations.\nNegative public perception regarding us and/or our industry resulting from, among other things, concerns raised by advocacy groups about hydraulic fracturing, oil spills, greenhouse gas or methane emissions and explosions of natural gas transmission lines, may lead to increased regulatory scrutiny, which may, in turn, lead to new state and federal safety and environmental laws, regulations, guidelines and enforcement interpretations. These actions may cause operational delays or restrictions, increased operating costs, additional regulatory burdens and increased risk of litigation. Moreover, governmental authorities exercise considerable discretion in the timing and scope of permit issuance and the public may engage in the permitting process, including through intervention in the courts. Negative public perception could cause the permits we need to conduct our operations to be withheld, delayed, or burdened by requirements that restrict our ability to profitably conduct our business.\nOur ability to sell our natural gas production and/or the prices we receive for our production could be materially harmed if we fail to obtain adequate services such as transportation and processing.\nThe sale of our natural gas production depends on a number of factors beyond our control, including the availability and capacity of transportation and processing facilities. We deliver our natural gas production primarily through gathering systems and pipelines that we do not own. The lack of available capacity on these systems and facilities could reduce the price offered for our production or result in the shut-in of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for properties. Third-party systems and facilities may be unavailable due to market conditions or mechanical or other reasons. In addition, at current commodity prices, construction of new pipelines and building of such infrastructure may be slower to build out. To the extent these services are unavailable, we would be unable to realize revenue from wells served by such facilities until suitable arrangements are made to market our production. Our failure to obtain these services on acceptable terms could materially harm our business.\nFor example, the Marcellus Shale wells we have drilled to date have generally reported very high initial production rates. The amount of natural gas being produced in the area from these new wells, as well as natural gas produced from other existing wells, may exceed the capacity of the various gathering and intrastate or interstate transportation pipelines currently available. In such an event, this could result in wells being shut in or awaiting a pipeline connection or capacity and/or natural gas being sold at much lower prices than those quoted on NYMEX or than we currently project, which would adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to complex laws and regulations, including environmental and safety regulations, which can adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of doing business.\nOur operations are subject to extensive federal, state and local laws and regulations, including drilling, permitting and safety laws and regulations and those relating to the generation, storage, handling, emission, transportation and discharge of materials into the environment. These laws and regulations can adversely affect the cost, manner or feasibility of doing business. Many laws and regulations require permits for the operation of various facilities, and these permits are subject to revocation, modification and renewal. Governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with their regulations, and violations could subject us to fines, injunctions or both. These laws and regulations have increased the costs of planning, designing, drilling, installing and operating natural gas and oil facilities, and new laws and regulations or revisions or reinterpretations of existing laws and regulations could further increase these costs. In addition, we may be liable for environmental damages caused by previous owners or operators of property we purchase or lease. Risks of substantial costs and liabilities related to environmental compliance issues are inherent in natural gas and oil operations. For example, we could be required to install expensive pollution control measures or limit or cease activities on lands located within wilderness, wetlands or other environmentally or politically sensitive areas. Failure to comply with these laws also may result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative, civil and criminal penalties as well as the imposition of corrective action orders. It is possible that other developments, such as stricter environmental laws and regulations, and claims for damages to property or persons resulting from natural gas and oil production, would result in substantial costs and liabilities.\nAcquired properties may not be worth what we pay due to uncertainties in evaluating recoverable reserves and other expected benefits, as well as potential liabilities.\nSuccessful property acquisitions require an assessment of a number of factors beyond our control. These factors include estimates of recoverable reserves, exploration potential, future commodity prices, operating costs, production taxes and potential environmental and other liabilities. These assessments are complex and inherently imprecise. Our review of the properties we acquire may not reveal all existing or potential problems. In addition, our review may not allow us to fully assess the potential deficiencies of the properties. We do not inspect every well, and even when we inspect a well we may not discover structural, subsurface, or environmental problems that may exist or arise.\nThere may be threatened or contemplated claims against the assets or businesses we acquire related to environmental, title, regulatory, tax, contract, litigation or other matters of which we are unaware, which could materially and adversely affect our production, revenues and results of operations. We often assume certain liabilities, and we may not be entitled to contractual indemnification for pre-closing liabilities, including environmental liabilities, and our contractual indemnification may not be effective. At times, we acquire interests in properties on an \"as is\" basis with limited representations and warranties and limited remedies for breaches of such representations and warranties. In addition, significant acquisitions can change the nature of our operations and business if the acquired properties have substantially different operating and geological characteristics or are in different geographic locations than our existing properties.\nThe integration of the businesses and properties we may acquire could be difficult, and may divert management's attention away from our existing operations.\nThe integration of the businesses and properties we may acquire could be difficult, and may divert management's attention and financial resources away from our existing operations. These difficulties include:\n\u2022\nthe challenge of integrating the acquired businesses and properties while carrying on the ongoing operations of our business;\n\u2022\nthe inability to retain key employees of the acquired business;\n\u2022\npotential lack of operating experience in a geographic market of the acquired properties; and\n\u2022\nthe possibility of faulty assumptions underlying our expectations.\nThe process of integrating our operations could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of our business. Members of our management may be required to devote considerable amounts of time to this integration process, which will decrease the time they will have to manage our existing business. If management is not able to effectively manage the integration process, or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the integration process, our business could suffer.\nWe face a variety of hazards and risks that could cause substantial financial losses.\nOur business involves a variety of operating risks, including:\n\u2022\nwell site blowouts, cratering and explosions;\n\u2022\nequipment failures;\n\u2022\npipe or cement failures and casing collapses, which can release natural gas, oil, drilling fluids or hydraulic fracturing fluids;\n\u2022\nuncontrolled flows of natural gas, oil or well fluids;\n\u2022\npipeline ruptures;\n\u2022\nfires;\n\u2022\nformations with abnormal pressures;\n\u2022\nhandling and disposal of materials, including drilling fluids and hydraulic fracturing fluids;\n\u2022\nrelease of toxic gas;\n\u2022\nbuildup of naturally occurring radioactive materials;\n\u2022\npollution and other environmental risks, including conditions caused by previous owners or operators of our properties; and\n\u2022\nnatural disasters.\nAny of these events could result in injury or loss of human life, loss of hydrocarbons, significant damage to or destruction of property, environmental pollution, regulatory investigations and penalties, suspension or impairment of our operations and substantial losses to us.\nOur utilization of natural gas gathering and pipeline systems also involves various risks, including the risk of explosions and environmental hazards caused by pipeline leaks and ruptures. The location of pipelines near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers and industrial sites, could increase these risks.\nWe may not be insured against all of the operating risks to which we are exposed.\nWe maintain insurance against some, but not all, operating risks and losses. We do not carry business interruption insurance. In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. The occurrence of an event not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have limited control over the activities on properties we do not operate.\nOther companies operate some of the properties in which we have an interest. As of December 31, 2019, non-operated wells represented approximately nine percent of our total owned gross wells, or approximately one percent of our owned net wells. We have limited ability to influence or control the operation or future development of these non-operated properties, including compliance with environmental, safety and other regulations, or the amount of capital expenditures that we are required to fund with respect to them. The failure of an operator of our wells to adequately perform operations, an operator's breach of the applicable agreements or an operator's failure to act in ways that are in our best interest could reduce our production and revenues. Our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects and our limited ability to influence or control the operation and future development of these properties could materially adversely affect the realization of our targeted returns on capital in drilling or acquisition activities and lead to unexpected future costs.\nCompetition in our industry is intense, and many of our competitors have substantially greater financial and technological resources than we do, which could adversely affect our competitive position.\nCompetition in the natural gas and oil industry is intense. Major and independent natural gas and oil companies actively bid for desirable natural gas and oil properties, as well as for the capital, equipment and labor required to operate and develop these properties. Our competitive position is affected by price, contract terms and quality of service, including pipeline connection times, distribution efficiencies and reliable delivery record. Many of our competitors have financial and technological resources and exploration and development budgets that are substantially greater than ours. These companies\nmay be able to pay more for exploratory projects and productive natural gas and oil properties and may be able to define, evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or human resources permit. In addition, these companies may be able to expend greater resources on the existing and changing technologies that we believe will be increasingly important to attaining success in the industry. These companies may also have a greater ability to continue drilling activities during periods of low natural gas and oil prices and to absorb the burden of current and future governmental regulations and taxation.\nWe may have hedging arrangements that expose us to risk of financial loss and limit the benefit to us of increases in prices for natural gas.\nFrom time to time, when we believe that market conditions are favorable, we use financial derivative instruments to manage price risk associated with our natural gas production. While there are many different types of derivatives available, we generally utilize collar, swap and basis swap agreements to manage price risk more effectively.\nThe collar arrangements are put and call options used to establish floor and ceiling prices for a fixed volume of production during a certain time period. They provide for payments to counterparties if the index price exceeds the ceiling and payments from the counterparties if the index price falls below the floor. The swap agreements call for payments to, or receipts from, counterparties based on whether the index price for the period is greater or less than the fixed price established for that period when the swap is put in place. These arrangements limit the benefit to us of increases in prices. In addition, these arrangements expose us to risks of financial loss in a variety of circumstances, including when:\n\u2022\nthere is an adverse change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the derivative instrument and actual prices received for our production;\n\u2022\nproduction is less than expected; or\n\u2022\na counterparty is unable to satisfy its obligations.\nThe CFTC has promulgated regulations to implement statutory requirements for swap transactions. These regulations are intended to implement a regulated market in which most swaps are executed on registered exchanges or swap execution facilities and cleared through central counterparties. While we believe that our use of swap transactions exempt us from certain regulatory requirements, the changes to the swap market due to increased regulation could significantly increase the cost of entering into new swaps or maintaining existing swaps, materially alter the terms of new or existing swap transactions and/or reduce the availability of new or existing swaps. If we reduce our use of swaps as a result of the Dodd-Frank Act and regulations, our results of operations may become more volatile and our cash flows may be less predictable.\nWe will continue to evaluate the benefit of utilizing derivatives in the future. Please read \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in Item 7 and \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\" in Item 7A for further discussion concerning our use of derivatives.\nThe loss of key personnel could adversely affect our ability to operate.\nOur operations are dependent upon a relatively small group of key management and technical personnel, and one or more of these individuals could leave our employment. The unexpected loss of the services of one or more of these individuals could have a detrimental effect on us. In addition, our drilling success and the success of other activities integral to our operations will depend, in part, on our ability to attract and retain experienced geologists, engineers and other professionals. Competition for experienced geologists, engineers and some other professionals is extremely intense. If we cannot retain our technical personnel or attract additional experienced technical personnel, our ability to compete could be harmed.\nOil and natural gas production operations, especially those using hydraulic fracturing, are substantially dependent on the availability of water. Our ability to produce natural gas economically and in commercial quantities could be impaired if we are unable to acquire adequate supplies of water for our operations or are unable to dispose of or recycle the water we use economically and in an environmentally safe manner.\nWater is an essential component of oil and natural gas production during the drilling, and in particular, hydraulic fracturing, process. Our inability to locate sufficient amounts of water, or dispose of or recycle water used in our exploration and production operations, could adversely impact our operations. For water sourcing, we first seek to use non-potable water supplies for our operational needs. In certain areas, there may be insufficient local aquifer capacity to provide a source of water for drilling activities. Water must then be obtained from other sources and transported to the drilling site. An inability to secure sufficient amounts of water or to dispose of or recycle the water used in our operations could adversely impact our operations in certain areas. The imposition of new environmental regulations could further restrict our ability to conduct operations such as hydraulic fracturing by restricting the disposal of things such as produced water and drilling fluids.\nFederal and state legislation, judicial actions and regulatory initiatives related to oil and gas development, including hydraulic fracturing, could result in increased costs and operating restrictions or delays and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nMost of our exploration and production operations depend on the use of hydraulic fracturing to enhance production from oil and gas wells. This technology involves the injection of fluids-usually consisting mostly of water but typically including small amounts of several chemical additives-as well as sand or other proppants into a well under high pressure in order to create fractures in the rock that allow oil or gas to flow more freely to the wellbore. Most of our wells would not be economical without the use of hydraulic fracturing to stimulate production from the well. Hydraulic fracturing operations have historically been overseen by state regulators as part of their oil and gas regulatory programs; however, the EPA has asserted federal regulatory authority over certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving diesel under the Safe Drinking Water Act and has released permitting guidance for hydraulic fracturing activities that use diesel in fracturing fluids in those states where the EPA is the permitting authority, including Pennsylvania. As a result, we may be subject to additional permitting requirements for hydraulic fracturing operations as well as various restrictions on those operations. These permitting requirements and restrictions could result in delays in operations at well sites as well as increased costs to make wells productive. Several candidates in the 2020 United States presidential campaign have indicated that they would support federal government efforts to limit or prohibit hydraulic fracturing. In addition, from time to time, legislation has been introduced, but not enacted, in Congress that would provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the Safe Drinking Water Act and require the public disclosure of certain information regarding the chemical makeup of hydraulic fracturing fluids. If enacted, this legislation could establish an additional level of regulation and permitting at the federal, state or local levels, and could make it easier for third parties opposed to the hydraulic fracturing process to initiate legal proceedings based on allegations that specific chemicals used in the fracturing process could adversely affect the environment, including groundwater, soil or surface water. In March 2015, the Department of the Interior's Bureau of Land Management issued a final rule to regulate hydraulic fracturing on public and Indian land; however, these rules were rescinded by rule in December 2017. We voluntarily disclose on a well-by-well basis the chemicals we use in the hydraulic fracturing process at www.fracfocus.org.\nIn addition, state and federal regulatory agencies recently have focused on a possible connection between the operation of injection wells used for oil and gas waste disposal and seismic activity. Similar concerns have been raised that hydraulic fracturing may also contribute to seismic activity. When caused by human activity, such events are called induced seismicity. In March 2016, the United States Geological Survey identified six states with the most significant hazards from induced seismicity, including Oklahoma, Kansas, Texas, Colorado, New Mexico, and Arkansas. In light of these concerns, some state regulatory agencies have modified their regulations or issued orders to address induced seismicity. Certain environmental and other groups have also suggested that additional federal, state and local laws and regulations may be needed to more closely regulate the hydraulic fracturing process. We cannot predict whether additional federal, state or local laws or regulations applicable to hydraulic fracturing will be enacted in the future and, if so, what actions any such laws or regulations would require or prohibit. Increased regulation and attention given to induced seismicity could lead to greater opposition to, and litigation concerning, oil and gas activities utilizing hydraulic fracturing or injection wells for waste disposal, which could have an adverse effect on oil and natural gas production activities, including operational delays or increased operating costs in the production of oil and natural gas from developing shale plays, or could make it more difficult to perform hydraulic fracturing.\nOn August 16, 2012, the EPA published final rules that establish new air emission control requirements for natural gas and NGL production, processing and transportation activities, including NSPS to address emissions of sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds, and NESHAPS to address hazardous air pollutants frequently associated with gas production and processing activities. In June 2016, the EPA published a final rule that updates and expands the NSPS by setting additional emissions limits for volatile organic compounds and regulating methane emissions for new and modified sources in the oil and gas industry. In June 2017, the EPA proposed a two year stay of certain requirements contained in the June 2016 rule and in November 2017 issued a notice of data availability in support of the stay proposal and provided a 30-day comment period on the information provided. In March 2018, the EPA published a final rule that amended two narrow provisions of the NSPS, removing the requirement for completion of delayed repair during emergency or unscheduled vent blowdowns. A 2016 information collection request made to oil and natural gas facilities by the EPA in connection with its intention at the time to regulate methane emissions from existing sources were withdrawn in March 2017. The EPA also published a final rule in June 2016 concerning aggregation of sources that affects source determinations for air permitting in the oil and gas industry.\nCompliance with these requirements, especially the new methane regulation, may require modifications to certain of our operations or increase the cost of new or modified facilities, including the installation of new equipment to control emissions at the well site that could result in significant costs, including increased capital expenditures and operating costs, and could adversely impact our business. Similarly, aggregating our oil and gas facilities for permitting could result in more complex, costly, and time consuming air permitting. Particularly in regard to obtaining pre-construction permits, the final aggregation rule could add costs and cause delays in our operations.\nIn addition to these federal legislative and regulatory proposals, some states in which we operate, such as Pennsylvania, and certain local governments have adopted, and others are considering adopting, regulations that could restrict hydraulic fracturing in certain circumstances, including requirements regarding chemical disclosure, casing and cementing of wells, withdrawal of water for use in high-volume hydraulic fracturing of horizontal wells, baseline testing of nearby water wells, and restrictions on the type of additives that may be used in hydraulic fracturing operations. For example, New York issued a statewide ban on hydraulic fracturing in June 2015. In addition, Pennsylvania's Act 13 of 2012 became law on February 14, 2012 and amended the state's Oil and Gas Act to, among other things, increase civil penalties and strengthen the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection's (PaDEP) authority over the issuance of drilling permits. Although the Pennsylvania Supreme Court struck down portions of Act 13 that made statewide rules on oil and gas preempt local zoning rules, this could lead to additional local restrictions on oil and gas activity in the state. In addition, if existing laws and regulations with regard to hydraulic fracturing are revised or reinterpreted or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations through judicial or administrative actions, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected. For example, a Pennsylvania state trial court in 2018 refused to apply the established common law rule of capture in a case concerning claims of trespass by hydraulic fracturing. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court heard the appeal of this ruling and on January 22, 2020 affirmed the rule of capture and remanded the case to the Pennsylvania state trial court for further proceedings. Depending on the ultimate outcome at the Pennsylvania state trial court, this case could still have a material impact on our operations.\nWe use a significant amount of water in our hydraulic fracturing operations. Our inability to locate sufficient amounts of water, or dispose of or recycle water used in our operations, could adversely impact our operations. Moreover, new environmental initiatives and regulations could include restrictions on our ability to conduct certain operations such as hydraulic fracturing or disposal of waste, including, but not limited to, produced water, drilling fluids and other wastes associated with the exploration, development or production of natural gas. Compliance with environmental regulations and permit requirements governing the withdrawal, storage and use of surface water or groundwater necessary for hydraulic fracturing of wells may increase our operating costs and cause delays, interruptions or termination of our operations, the extent of which cannot be predicted, all of which could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition. For example, in April 2011, PaDEP called on all Marcellus Shale natural gas drilling operators to voluntarily cease by May 19, 2011 delivering wastewater to those centralized treatment facilities that were grandfathered from the application of PaDEP's Total Dissolved Solids regulations. In June 2016, the EPA published final pretreatment standards for disposal of wastewater produced from shale gas operations to publicly owned treatment works. The regulations were developed under the EPA's Effluent Guidelines Program under the authority of the Clean Water Act. In response to these actions, operators including us have begun to rely more on recycling of flowback and produced water from well sites as a preferred alternative to disposal.\nA number of federal agencies are analyzing, or have been requested to review, a variety of environmental issues associated with hydraulic fracturing practices. For example, the EPA conducted a study of the potential environmental effects of hydraulic fracturing on drinking water and groundwater. The EPA released its final report in December 2016. It concluded that hydraulic fracturing activities can impact drinking water resources under some circumstances, including large volume spills and inadequate mechanical integrity of wells. This study and other studies that may be undertaken by the EPA or other federal agencies could spur initiatives to further regulate hydraulic fracturing under the Safe Drinking Water Act, the Toxic Substances Control Act, or other statutory and/or regulatory mechanisms.\nClimate change and climate change legislation and regulatory initiatives could result in increased operating costs and decreased demand for the oil and natural gas that we produce.\nScientific studies have suggested that emissions of certain gases, commonly referred to as \u201cgreenhouse gases\u201d (GHGs), including carbon dioxide and methane, may be contributing to warming of the earth\u2019s atmosphere and other climatic changes. In response to such studies, the issue of climate change and the effect of GHG emissions, in particular emissions from fossil fuels, has and continues to attract political and social attention. The regulatory response to and physical effects of climate change have the potential to negatively affect our business in many ways, including increasing the costs to provide our products and services, reducing the demand for and consumption of our products and services (due to change in both costs and weather patterns), and the economic health of the regions in which we operate, all of which can create financial risks.\nLegislation to regulate GHG emissions has periodically been introduced in the U.S. Congress and such legislation may be proposed or adopted in the future. In addition, the EPA has adopted regulations addressing GHG emissions. In 2009 and 2010, the EPA adopted rules requiring the monitoring, reporting and recordkeeping of GHG emissions from specified sources in the United States, including onshore and offshore oil and natural gas production facilities that emit 25,000 metric tons or more of CO2e per year. Since 2012, we have been required to report our GHG emissions to the EPA each year in March under these rules and have submitted our annual reports in compliance with the deadline. In 2015, the EPA finalized rules adding additional sources to the scope of the GHG monitoring and reporting requirements, including gathering and boosting facilities as well as completions and workovers from hydraulically fractured oil wells, and adding well identification reporting requirements for\ncertain facilities. The EPA published a final rule in 2016 adding monitoring methods for detecting leaks from oil and gas equipment and emission factors for leaking equipment to be used to calculate and report GHG emissions resulting from equipment leaks. In addition to the GHG monitoring and reporting rules, the EPA adopted rules requiring permits for GHGs for certain large stationary sources beginning in 2011. However, in 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court, in Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA, limited the application of the GHG permitting requirements under the Prevention of Significant Deterioration and Title V permitting programs to sources that would otherwise need permits based on the emission of conventional pollutants. A discussion of federal methane regulations is provided in the preceding risk factor.\nThere have also been international efforts seeking legally binding reductions in GHG emissions. The United States was actively involved in the negotiations at the 21st Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in Paris (the \u201cUNFCCC\u201d), which led to the creation of the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement requires countries to review and \"represent a progression\" in their nationally determined contributions, which set emissions reduction goals, every five years. The United States was a signatory to the Paris Agreement, which entered into full force in November 2016. On June 1, 2017, the President of the United States announced that the United States planned to withdraw from the Paris Agreement and to seek negotiations to either reenter the Paris Agreement on different terms or establish a new framework agreement. The earliest possible effective date for the United States withdrawal is November 4, 2020, which is four years from the date the agreement took effect. The United States\u2019 adherence to the exit process is uncertain, and the terms on which the United States may reenter the Paris Agreement, or a separately negotiated agreement are unclear at this time.\nIt is not possible at this time to predict the timing and effect of climate change or to predict the effect of the Paris Agreement or whether additional GHG legislation, regulations or other measures will be adopted at the federal, state or local levels. However, more aggressive efforts by governments and non-governmental organizations to reduce GHG emissions appear likely and any such future laws and regulations could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions. For example, several U.S. states and cities have committed to advance the objectives of the Paris Agreement at the state or local level despite the pending federal withdrawal.\nThe passage of any federal or state climate change laws or regulations in the future could result in increased costs to (i) operate and maintain our facilities, (ii) install new emission controls on our facilities and (iii) administer and manage any GHG emissions program. If we are unable to recover or pass through a significant level of our costs related to complying with climate change regulatory requirements imposed on us, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. To the extent financial markets view climate change and GHG emissions as a financial risk, this could negatively impact our cost of and access to capital. Legislation or regulations that may be adopted to address climate change could also affect the markets for our products by making our products more or less desirable than competing sources of energy.\nBeyond financial and regulatory impacts, climate change poses potential physical risks. Scientific studies forecast that these risks include an increase in sea level, stresses on water supply and changes in weather conditions, such as an increase in changes in precipitation and extreme weather events. The projected physical effects of climate change have the potential to directly affect, delay and result in increased costs related to our operations. In addition, warmer winters as a result of global warming could also decrease demand for natural gas. However, because the nature and timing of changes in extreme weather events (such as increased frequency, duration, and severity) are uncertain, any estimations of future financial risk to our operations caused by these potential physical risks of climate change would be unreliable.\nTerrorist activities and the potential for military and other actions could adversely affect our business.\nThe threat of terrorism and the impact of military and other action have caused instability in world financial markets and could lead to increased volatility in prices for natural gas and oil, all of which could adversely affect the markets for our operations. Acts of terrorism, including cybersecurity threats to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information or to render data or systems unusable, could be directed against companies operating in the United States. The U.S. government has issued public warnings that indicate energy assets might be specific targets of terrorist organizations. These developments have subjected our operations to increased risk and, depending on their ultimate magnitude, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nCyber-attacks targeting our systems, the oil and gas industry systems and infrastructure, or the systems of our third-party service providers could adversely affect our business.\nOur business and the oil and gas industry in general have become increasingly dependent on digital data, computer networks and connected infrastructure, including technologies that are managed by third-party providers on whom we rely to help us collect, host or process information. We depend on this technology to record and store financial data, estimate quantities of natural gas and crude oil reserves, analyze and share operating data and communicate internally and externally. Computers\ncontrol nearly all of the oil and gas distribution systems in the United States, which are necessary to transport our products to market, to enable communications and to provide a host of other support services for our business.\nCyber-attacks are becoming more sophisticated and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, phishing, ransomware, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data, and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. Unauthorized access to our seismic data, reserves information, customer or employee data or other proprietary or commercially sensitive information could lead to data corruption, communication interruption, or other disruptions in our exploration or production operations or planned business transactions, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. If our information technology systems cease to function properly or our cybersecurity is breached, we could suffer disruptions to our normal operations, which may include drilling, completion, production and corporate functions. A cyber-attack involving our information systems and related infrastructure, or that of our business associates, could result in supply chain disruptions that delay or prevent the transportation and marketing of our production, non-compliance leading to regulatory fines or penalties, loss or disclosure of, or damage to, our or any of our customer\u2019s or supplier\u2019s data or confidential information that could harm our business by damaging our reputation, subjecting us to potential financial or legal liability, and requiring us to incur significant costs, including costs to repair or restore our systems and data or to take other remedial steps.\nIn addition, certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance, may remain undetected for an extended period, and our systems and insurance coverage for protecting against such cybersecurity risks may not be sufficient. As cyber-attackers become more sophisticated, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to protect our business or remediate the damage from cyber-attacks. Furthermore, the continuing and evolving threat of cyber-attacks has resulted in increased regulatory focus on prevention, and we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities. To the extent we face increased regulatory requirements, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to meet such requirements.\nWe are subject to a number of privacy and data protection laws, rules and directives (collectively, \u201cdata protection laws\u201d) relating to the processing of personal data.\nThe regulatory environment surrounding data protection laws is uncertain. Complying with varying jurisdictional requirements could increase the costs and complexity of compliance, and violations of applicable data protection laws can result in significant penalties. A determination that there have been violations of applicable data protection laws could expose us to significant damage awards, fines and other penalties that could materially harm our business and reputation.\nAny failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with applicable data protection laws could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others, subject us to significant fines, penalties, judgments and negative publicity, require us to change our business practices, increase the costs and complexity of compliance, and adversely affect our business. As noted above, we are also subject to the possibility of security and privacy breaches, which themselves may result in a violation of these laws. Additionally, the acquisition of a company that is not in compliance with applicable data protection laws may result in a violation of these laws.\nTax law changes could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted legislation referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act). The Tax Act significantly changed U.S. corporate income tax laws beginning, generally, in 2018. Refer to Note 11 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, Income Taxes, for a discussion on the impact of the Tax Act on us. There exist various uncertainties and ambiguities in the application of certain provisions of the Tax Act. In the absence of guidance, we have used what we believe are reasonable interpretations and assumptions in applying the Tax Act. It is possible that the Internal Revenue Service could issue subsequent regulations or other guidance or take positions on audit that differ from our prior interpretations and assumptions, which could adversely impact our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWhile the Tax Act maintained many of the tax incentives and deductions that are used by U.S. oil and gas companies, including the percentage depletion allowance for oil and natural gas companies, the ability to fully deduct intangible drilling costs in the year incurred, and the current amortization period of geological and geophysical expenditures for independent producers, the U.S. tax law is always subject to change. Periodically, legislation is proposed to repeal these industry tax incentives and deductions, and/or to impose new industry taxes. In addition, various states are still determining if and to what extent they will conform to the Tax Act. Further, many states are currently in deficits, and have been enacting laws eliminating or limiting certain deductions, carryforwards, and credits in order to increase tax revenue.\nShould the U.S. or the states publish guidance or pass tax legislation limiting any currently allowed tax incentives and deductions, our taxes would increase, potentially significantly, which would have a negative impact on our net income and cash\nflows. This could also reduce our drilling activities in the U.S. Since future changes to federal and state tax legislation and regulations are unknown, we cannot know the ultimate impact such changes may have on our business.\nProvisions of Delaware law and our bylaws and charter could discourage change in control transactions and prevent stockholders from receiving a premium on their investment.\nOur charter authorizes our Board of Directors to set the terms of preferred stock. In addition, Delaware law contains provisions that impose restrictions on business combinations with interested parties. Our bylaws prohibit the calling of a special meeting by our stockholders and place procedural requirements and limitations on stockholder proposals at meetings of stockholders. Because of these provisions of our charter, bylaws and Delaware law, persons considering unsolicited tender offers or other unilateral takeover proposals may be more likely to negotiate with our Board of Directors rather than pursue non-negotiated takeover attempts. As a result, these provisions may make it more difficult for our stockholders to benefit from transactions that are opposed by an incumbent Board of Directors.\nThe personal liability of our directors for monetary damages for breach of their fiduciary duty of care is limited by the Delaware General Corporation Law and by our charter.\nThe Delaware General Corporation Law allows corporations to limit available relief for the breach of directors' duty of care to equitable remedies such as injunction or rescission. Our charter limits the liability of our directors to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law. Specifically, our directors will not be personally liable for monetary damages for any breach of their fiduciary duty as a director, except for liability:\n\u2022\nfor any breach of their duty of loyalty to the Company or our stockholders;\n\u2022\nfor acts or omissions not in good faith or that involve intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law;\n\u2022\nunder provisions relating to unlawful payments of dividends or unlawful stock repurchases or redemptions; and\n\u2022\nfor any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit.\nThis limitation may have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against directors, and may discourage or deter stockholders or management from bringing a lawsuit against directors for breach of their duty of care, even though such an action, if successful, might otherwise have benefited our stockholders.", "PERMNO": 76082, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "COG"}
