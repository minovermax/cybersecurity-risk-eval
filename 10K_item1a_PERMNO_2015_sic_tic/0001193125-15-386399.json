RISK FACTORS\nIn conjunction with evaluating an investment in the Company and the forward-looking information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or presented elsewhere by management from time to time, you should carefully read the following risk factors. Any of the following risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition, and the actual outcome of matters as to which forward-looking statements are made and could adversely affect the value of an investment in our common stock as well. While we believe we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that adversely affect our business, performance, or financial condition in the future that are not presently known, are not currently believed to be significant, or are not identified below because they are common to all businesses.\nOverall Economic and Supply/Demand Conditions-A weakening or reversal of economic recovery or product supply versus demand imbalance in certain markets in which the Company does business may decrease the demand for its goods and services and adversely impact its revenues, operating results, and cash flow.\nDemand for the Company\u2019s products and services depends in part on the general economic conditions affecting the countries and industries in which the Company does business. In the past few years, uncertain economic conditions in certain geographies and changing supply and demand balances in markets served by the Company have impacted and may in the future impact demand for the Company\u2019s products and services, in turn negatively impacting the Company\u2019s revenues and earnings. Unfavorable conditions can depress sales in a given market, affect our margins, constrain our operating flexibility, impact new project on-stream timing, or result in charges which are unusual or nonrecurring. Excess capacity in the Company\u2019s or its competitors\u2019 manufacturing facilities could decrease the Company\u2019s ability to maintain pricing and generate profits. Unanticipated contract terminations or project delays by current customers can also negatively impact financial results. Our operating results in one or more segments may also be affected by uncertain or deteriorating economic conditions particularly germane to that segment or to particular customer markets within that segment.\nOperational, Political, and Legal Risks of International Operations-The Company\u2019s foreign operations can be adversely impacted by nationalization or expropriation of property, undeveloped property rights and legal systems, or political instability. Developing market operations present special risks.\nThe Company has extensive international operations. In addition, the Company is actively investing significant capital and other resources in emerging markets. The Company\u2019s operations in certain foreign jurisdictions may be subject to project delays due to unanticipated government actions and to nationalization and expropriation risk, and some of its contractual relationships within these jurisdictions are subject to cancellation without full compensation for loss. Economic and political conditions within foreign jurisdictions, social unrest, or strained relations between countries can cause fluctuations in demand, price volatility, supply disruptions, or loss of property. The occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operation, and cash flow.\nOur developing market operations may be subject to greater risks than those faced by our operations in mature economies, including geopolitical, legal, economic and talent risks. Our success will depend, in part, on our ability to manage the risks inherent in operating in a developing market, including unfamiliar regulatory environments, new relationships with local partners, language and cultural differences, and tailoring products for acceptance by local markets.\nCurrency Fluctuations-Changes in foreign currencies may adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial results.\nThe majority of the Company\u2019s revenue is generated from sales outside the United States, exposing it to risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. Our Industrial Gases business is primarily exposed to translational currency risk as the results of its foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars at current exchange rates throughout the fiscal period. Our Materials Technologies business is also significantly exposed to transactional currency impacts as many of its products are manufactured in one country and sold in another.\nThe Company uses certain financial instruments to mitigate some of these effects. The Company\u2019s policy is to minimize cash flow volatility from changes in currency exchange rates. The Company chooses not to hedge the translation of its foreign subsidiaries\u2019 earnings into dollars. Accordingly, reported sales, net earnings, cash flows,\nand fair values have been and in the future will be affected by changes in foreign exchange rates. For a more detailed discussion of currency exposure, see Item 7A, below.\nInterest Rate Increases-The Company\u2019s earnings, cash flow, and financial position can be impacted by interest rate increases and access to credit.\nAt 30 September 2015, the Company had total consolidated debt of $5,879.0 million, of which $1,929.9 million will mature in the next twelve months. The Company expects to continue to incur indebtedness to fund new projects and replace maturing debt. Although the Company actively manages its interest rate risk through the use of derivatives and diversified debt obligations, not all borrowings at variable rates are hedged, and new debt will be priced at market rates. If interest rates increase, the Company\u2019s interest expense could increase significantly, affecting earnings and reducing cash flow available for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and other purposes. In addition, changes by any rating agency to the Company\u2019s outlook or credit ratings could increase the Company\u2019s cost of borrowing and weaken our ability to access capital and credit markets on terms commercially acceptable to us. For a more detailed discussion of interest rate risk, see Item 7A, below.\nNew Technologies-New technologies create performance risks that could impact our financial results or reputation.\nA number of new technologies and new product offerings are being developed or implemented by the Company. Some of our existing technologies are being implemented in products and designs beyond our experience base. These technological expansions can create nontraditional performance risks to our operations. Failure of the technologies to work as predicted or unintended consequences of new designs or uses, could lead to cost overruns, project delays, financial penalties, damage to our reputation, or impairment of assets. In particular, the Company has invested approximately $1 billion to date into two waste-to-energy projects in Tees Valley, United Kingdom, which rely on technological processes that have not been commercialized to date at the same scale or in the same combination. The Company has experienced technical challenges and on-stream delays in starting up the first of these projects and, as a result, additional capital investments are expected.\nOur restructuring actions could have long-term adverse effects on our business.\nWe reorganized the Company effective 1 October 2014. This reorganization and our cost reduction measures may reduce our available talent and other resources, impact our ability to attract and retain key employees, could slow improvements in our products and services, and adversely affect our ability to respond to customers. Failure to achieve targeted improvements may diminish the operational and financial benefits we realize from such actions. These circumstances could adversely impact our business and financial statements.\nRaw Material and Energy Cost and Availability-Interruption in ordinary sources of supply or an inability to recover increases in energy and raw material costs from customers could result in lost sales or reduced profitability.\nHydrocarbons, including natural gas, are the primary feedstock for the production of hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and syngas. Energy, including electricity, natural gas, and diesel fuel for delivery trucks, is the largest cost component of the Company\u2019s business. Because the Company\u2019s industrial gas facilities use substantial amounts of electricity, energy price fluctuations could materially impact the Company\u2019s revenues and earnings. A disruption in the supply of energy, components, or raw materials, whether due to market conditions, legislative or regulatory actions, natural events, or other disruption, could prevent the Company from meeting its contractual commitments, harming its business and financial results.\nThe Company\u2019s supply of crude helium for purification and resale is largely dependent upon natural gas production by crude helium suppliers. Lower natural gas production (which may result from natural gas pricing or supplier operating issues) or interruptions in sales from other crude helium suppliers, can reduce the Company\u2019s supplies of crude helium available for processing and resale to its customers.\nThe Materials Technologies segment uses a wide variety of raw materials, including alcohols, ethyleneamines, cyclohexylamine, acrylonitriles, and glycols. Shortages or price escalation in these materials could negatively impact financial results.\nThe Company typically contracts to pass through cost increases in energy and raw materials to its customers, but cost variability can still have a negative impact on its results. The Company may not be able to raise prices as quickly as costs rise, or competitive pressures may prevent full recovery. Increases in energy or raw material\ncosts that cannot be passed on to customers for competitive or other reasons would negatively impact the Company\u2019s revenues and earnings. Even where costs are passed through, price increases can cause lower sales volume.\nRegulatory Compliance-The Company is subject to extensive government regulation in jurisdictions around the globe in which it does business. Changes in regulations addressing, among other things, environmental compliance, import/export restrictions, anti-bribery and corruption, and taxes, can negatively impact the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operation and cash flow.\nThe Company is subject to government regulation in the United States and foreign jurisdictions in which it conducts its business. The application of laws and regulations to the Company\u2019s business is sometimes unclear. Compliance with laws and regulations may involve significant costs or require changes in business practice that could result in reduced profitability. Determination of noncompliance can result in penalties or sanctions that could also impact financial results. Compliance with changes in laws or regulations can require additional capital expenditures or increase operating costs. Export controls or other regulatory restrictions could prevent the Company from shipping its products to and from some markets or increase the cost of doing so. Export restrictions continue to attract external focus by multiple customs and export enforcement authorities. Changes in tax laws and regulations and international tax treaties could affect the financial results of the Company\u2019s businesses. Increasingly aggressive enforcement of anti-bribery and anti-corruption requirements, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United Kingdom Bribery Act and the China Anti-Unfair Competition Law, could subject the Company to criminal or civil sanctions if a violation occurs. We have internal control policies and procedures to foster compliance with these laws, including compliance and training programs for our employees and established due diligence procedures with regard to third parties; however, the foregoing cannot eliminate the risk that violations could be committed by our employees, agents or joint venture partners.\nGreenhouse Gases-Legislative and regulatory responses to global climate change create financial risk.\nSome of the Company\u2019s operations are within jurisdictions that have or are developing regulatory regimes governing emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG). These include existing coverage under the European Union Emission Trading Scheme, California\u2019s cap and trade scheme, Alberta\u2019s Emission Reduction Program, China\u2019s Emission Trading Scheme pilots, South Korea\u2019s Emission Trading Scheme, and mandatory reporting and anticipated constraints on GHG emissions under an Ontario cap and trade scheme, nation-wide expansion of the China Emission Trading Scheme, and federal emission performance standards in Canada. In addition, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requires mandatory reporting of GHG emissions and is regulating GHG emissions for new construction and major modifications to existing facilities. Moreover, some jurisdictions have various mechanisms to target the power sector (e.g. U.S. EPA Clean Power Plan) to achieve emission reductions. These reductions often result in higher power costs.\nIncreased public concern may result in more international, U.S. federal, and/or regional requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of GHG. Although uncertain, these developments could increase the Company\u2019s costs related to consumption of electric power, hydrogen production, and fluorinated gases production. The Company believes it will be able to mitigate some of the increased costs through its contractual terms, but the lack of definitive legislation or regulatory requirements prevents an accurate estimate of the long-term impact on the Company. Any legislation that limits or taxes GHG emissions could impact the Company\u2019s growth, increase its operating costs, or reduce demand for certain of its products.\nEnvironmental Compliance-Costs and expenses resulting from compliance with environmental regulations may negatively impact the Company\u2019s operations and financial results.\nThe Company is subject to extensive federal, state, local, and foreign environmental and safety laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions in the air; discharges to land and water; and the generation, handling, treatment, and disposal of hazardous waste and other materials. The Company takes its environmental responsibilities very seriously, but there is a risk of environmental impact inherent in our manufacturing operations and transportation of chemicals. Future developments and more stringent environmental regulations may require the Company to make additional unforeseen environmental expenditures. In addition, laws and regulations may require significant expenditures for environmental protection equipment, compliance, and remediation. These additional costs may adversely affect financial results. For a more detailed description of these matters, see \u201cNarrative Description of the Company\u2019s Business Generally-Environmental Controls,\u201d above.\nWe may not be able to successfully control or reduce costs to improve productivity and streamline operations.\nAchieving our financial goals depends significantly on our efforts to control or reduce our operating costs. Because many of our costs are affected by factors outside or substantially outside our control, we generally must seek to control or reduce costs through operating efficiency. If we are not able to identify and execute efforts designed to control or reduce costs and increase operating efficiency, our ability to attain our goals could be adversely impacted.\nCatastrophic Events-Catastrophic events could disrupt the Company\u2019s operations or the operations of its suppliers or customers, having a negative impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial results, and cash flow.\nThe Company\u2019s operations could be impacted by catastrophic events outside the Company\u2019s control, including severe weather conditions such as hurricanes, floods, earthquakes, storms, epidemics, or acts of war and terrorism. Any such event could cause a serious business disruption that could affect the Company\u2019s ability to produce and distribute its products and possibly expose it to third-party liability claims. Additionally, such events could impact the Company\u2019s suppliers or customers, in which event energy and raw materials may be unavailable to the Company, or its customers may be unable to purchase or accept the Company\u2019s products and services. Any such occurrence could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s operations and financial results.\nOperational Risks-Operational and execution risks may adversely affect the Company\u2019s operations or financial results.\nThe Company\u2019s operation of its facilities, pipelines, and delivery systems inherently entails hazards that require continuous oversight and control, such as pipeline leaks and ruptures, fire, explosions, toxic releases, mechanical failures, or vehicle accidents. If operational risks materialize, they could result in loss of life, damage to the environment, or loss of production, all of which could negatively impact the Company\u2019s ongoing operations, reputation, financial results, and cash flow. In addition, the Company\u2019s operating results are dependent on the continued operation of its production facilities and its ability to meet customer requirements, which depends, in part, on the Company\u2019s ability to properly maintain and replace aging assets. Operating results are also dependent on the Company\u2019s ability to complete new construction projects on time, on budget, and in accordance with performance requirements, which depends, in part, on the availability of adequate sources of labor in the geographies where the Company intends to build new plants. Failure to do so may expose the Company to loss of revenue, potential litigation, and loss of business reputation.\nInformation Security-The security of the Company\u2019s Information Technology systems could be compromised, which could adversely affect its ability to operate.\nWe depend on information technology to enable us to operate efficiently and interface with customers as well as to maintain financial accuracy and efficiency. Our information technology capabilities are delivered through a combination of internal and external services and services providers. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper technology infrastructure, we could be subject to transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, the loss of customers, business disruptions, or the loss of or damage to our confidential business information or multiple site impact through a security breach. As with all large systems, our information systems could be penetrated by outside parties intent on extracting information, corrupting information, disrupting business processes, or causing harm to persons or property. The Company\u2019s systems have in the past been and likely will in the future be subject to sophisticated cyber security threats. To date, the Company is not aware of any significant impact on its operations or financial results from such attempts; however, unauthorized access could disrupt our business operations, result in the loss of assets, and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s business involves the use, storage, and transmission of information about its employees, vendors, and customers. The protection of such information, as well as the Company\u2019s information, is critical to the Company. The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with the frequent imposition of new and constantly changing requirements. The Company has established policies and procedures to help protect the security and privacy of this information. The Company also, from time to time, exports sensitive customer data and technical information to recipients outside the United States. Breaches of our security measures or the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure, or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data about us or our customers, including the\npotential loss or disclosure of such information or data as a result of fraud, trickery, or other forms of deception, could expose us, our customers, or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, result in litigation and potential liability for us, damage our reputation, or otherwise harm our business.\nLitigation and Regulatory Proceedings-The Company\u2019s financial results may be affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings, including those involving antitrust, tax, environmental, or other matters.\nThe Company is subject to litigation and regulatory proceedings in the normal course of business and could become subject to additional claims in the future, some of which could be material. While the Company seeks to limit its liability in its commercial contractual arrangements, there are no guarantees that each contract will contain suitable limitations of liability or that limitations of liability will be enforceable at law. Also, the outcome of existing legal proceedings may differ from the Company\u2019s expectations because the outcomes of litigation, including regulatory matters, are often difficult to predict reliably. Various factors or developments can lead the Company to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables, where applicable, or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible to reasonable estimates, such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment, a significant settlement, significant regulatory developments, or changes in applicable law. A future adverse ruling, settlement, or unfavorable development could result in charges that could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flow in any particular period. For a more detailed discussion of the legal proceedings involving the Company, see Item 3, below.\nOur reputation, ability to do business, and results of operations may be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents, or business partners.\nWhile we strive to maintain high standards, we cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by our employees, agents, or business partners that would violate U.S. and/or non-U.S. laws or fail to protect our confidential information. Any such violations of law or improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions, lead to substantial civil or criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties, and increased costs of compliance, and damage our reputation.\nAsset Impairments-The Company may be required to record impairment on its long-lived assets.\nWeak demand may cause underutilization of the Company\u2019s manufacturing capacity or elimination of product lines; contract terminations, customer shutdowns or default, or other inability to profitably operate facilities may force sale or abandonment of facilities and equipment or projects not to reach on-stream; and contractual provisions may allow customer buyout of facilities or equipment. These or other events associated with weak economic conditions or specific end market, product, or customer events may require the Company to record an impairment on tangible assets, such as facilities and equipment, or intangible assets, such as intellectual property or goodwill, which would have a negative impact on its financial results. If the Company is unable to recover its investment in the Tees Valley waste-to-energy projects, the Company may record an impairment on those investments.\nCompetition-Inability to compete effectively in a segment could adversely impact sales and financial performance.\nThe Company faces strong competition from several large global competitors and many smaller regional ones in many of its business segments. Introduction by competitors of new technologies, competing products, or additional capacity could weaken demand for or impact pricing of the Company\u2019s products, negatively impacting financial results. In addition, competitors\u2019 pricing policies could affect the Company\u2019s profitability or its market share.\nThe proposed spin-off of our Materials Technologies business may not be completed on the currently contemplated timeline or terms, or at all, and may not achieve the intended benefits.\nThere can be no assurance that the spin-off of Materials Technologies will be completed in the contemplated manner or timeframe or at all. If the spin-off transaction is not completed in the contemplated manner or timeframe or not completed at all, among other things, the price of the Company\u2019s stock may decline.\nWe cannot predict with certainty when the benefits expected from the proposed transaction will occur or the extent to which they will be achieved, if at all. For example, there can be no assurance that analysts and investors will place values on each of the independent companies that combined will equal the current trading value of the\nCompany. In addition, if the proposed spin-off is consummated, our operational and financial profile will change and we will face new risks, including the possibility of reduced financial resources and less diversification of our revenue sources which could adversely impact our future results. Also, the changes in our operational and financial profile may not coincide with some of our shareholders\u2019 investment strategies, which could cause investors to sell their shares and otherwise decrease demand for the Company\u2019s common stock. Excess selling could cause the relative market price of our common stock to decrease and be subject to greater volatility following the consummation of the proposed spin-off.\nIf the spin-off of the Materials Technologies business, together with certain related transactions, does not qualify as a transaction that is generally tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Company and its shareholders could be subject to significant tax liabilities.\nA condition to the spin-off of the Materials Technologies business is the receipt by us of an opinion of tax counsel, substantively to the effect that, among other things, the distribution of shares to our shareholders, will qualify as tax-free for U.S. federal income tax purposes under Sections 355 and 368(a)(1)(D) of the Internal Revenue Code. Notwithstanding receipt of an opinion of tax counsel, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service could determine on audit that the distribution is taxable if it determines that any of the facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings underlying the opinion are not correct or have been violated or if it disagrees with the conclusions in the opinion. In addition, we intend for certain related transactions to qualify for tax-free treatment under federal, state and local tax law and/or foreign tax law.\nIf the distribution is determined to be taxable for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Company and its shareholders that are subject to U.S. federal income tax could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities. For example, if the distribution fails to qualify for tax-free treatment, we would, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, be treated as if we had sold the common stock of the new company in a taxable sale for its fair market value, and our shareholders who are subject to U.S. federal income tax would be treated as receiving a taxable distribution in an amount equal to the fair market value of the common stock received in the distribution. In addition, if certain related transactions fail to qualify for tax-free treatment under federal, state, and local tax law and/or foreign tax law, the Company could incur significant tax liabilities under U.S. federal, state, local and/or foreign tax law.", "PERMNO": 28222, "SIC": 2810, "TIC": "APD"}
