{"cik": "894671", "company": "OHIO VALLEY BANC CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-03-16", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A - RISK FACTORS\nCautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information\nCertain statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K which are not statements of historical fact constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including, without limitation, the statements specifically identified as forward-looking statements within this document. In addition, certain statements in future filings by Ohio Valley with the SEC, in press releases, and in oral and written statements made by or with the approval of Ohio Valley which are not statements of historical fact constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. Examples of forward-looking statements include: (i) projections of income or expense, earnings per share, the payment or non-payment of dividends, capital structure and other financial items; (ii) statements of plans and objectives of Ohio Valley or our management or Board of Directors, including those relating to products or services and strategic plans, such as mergers; (iii) statements of future economic performance; and (iv) statements of assumptions underlying such statements. Words such as \"believes,\" \"anticipates,\" \"expects,\" \"intends,\" \"targeted,\" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward-looking statements but are not the exclusive means of identifying those statements.\nThe Private Securities Litigation Reform Act provides a \"safe harbor\" for forward-looking statements to encourage companies to provide prospective information so long as those statements are identified as forward-looking and are accompanied by meaningful cautionary statements identifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements. We desire to take advantage of the \"safe harbor\" provisions of that Act.\nForward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially from those predicted by the forward-looking statements because of various factors and possible events, including those factors identified below. There is also the risk that Ohio Valley's management or Board of Directors incorrectly analyzes these risks and forces, or that the strategies Ohio Valley develops to address them are unsuccessful.\nForward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and, except as may be required by law, Ohio Valley undertakes no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made to reflect unanticipated events. All subsequent written and oral forward-looking statements attributable to Ohio Valley or any person acting on our behalf are qualified in their entirety by the following cautionary statements.\nThe following are certain risks that management believes are specific to our business. This should not be viewed as an all-inclusive list of risks or presenting the risk factors listed in any particular order.\nRisks Related to Economic, Political and Market Conditions\nChanges in economic and political conditions -- local, national and international -- could adversely affect our earnings, cash flows and capital, as our borrowers' ability to repay loans and the value of the collateral securing our loans decline.\nOur success depends, to a certain extent, upon economic and political conditions, local, national and even international, as well as governmental fiscal and monetary policies. Inflation, recession, unemployment, changes in interest rates, money supply and other factors beyond our control may adversely affect our asset quality, deposit levels and loan demand and, therefore, our financial condition and results of operations. The election of a new United States President in 2016 has resulted in substantial changes in economic and political conditions for the United States and the remainder of the world. Economic turmoil in Europe and Asia and changes in oil production in the Middle East affect the economy and stock prices in the United States. In June 2016, a vote held in the United Kingdom resulted in a determination that the United Kingdom should exit the European Union. The details of the exit and how it will affect the United Kingdom and the economy of the United States are unknown. Because a significant amount of our loans are secured by real estate, additional decreases in real estate values likely would adversely affect the value of property used as collateral and our ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure. Adverse changes in the economy may also have a negative effect on the ability of our borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans, which would have an adverse impact on our earnings and cash flows.\nIn addition, consistent with our community banking philosophy, substantially all of our loans are to individuals and businesses in Ohio and West Virginia. Therefore, our local and regional economies have a direct impact on our ability to generate deposits to support loan growth, the demand for loans, the ability of borrowers to repay loans, the value of collateral securing our loans (particularly loans secured by real estate), and our ability to collect, liquidate and restructure problem loans. Consequently, any decline in the economy of this market area could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. We are less able than larger financial institutions to spread risks of unfavorable local economic conditions across a large number of diversified economies.\nOur earnings are significantly affected by the fiscal and monetary policies of the U.S. Government and its agencies, sometimes adversely.\nThe policies of the Federal Reserve Board impact us significantly. The Federal Reserve Board regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States. Its policies directly and indirectly influence the rate of interest earned on loans and paid on borrowings and interest-bearing deposits and can also affect the value of financial instruments we hold. Those policies determine to a significant extent our cost of funds for lending and investing. Changes in those policies are beyond our control and are difficult to predict. Federal Reserve Board policies can also affect our borrowers, potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans. For example, a tightening of the money supply by the Federal Reserve Board could reduce the demand for a borrower's products and services. This could adversely affect the borrower's earnings and ability to repay its loan, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur earnings depend substantially on our interest rate spread, which is the difference between (i) the rates we earn on loans, securities and other earning assets and (ii) the interest rates we pay on deposits and other borrowings. These rates are highly sensitive to many factors beyond our control, including general economic conditions and the policies of various governmental and regulatory authorities. While we have taken measures intended to manage the risks of operating in a changing interest rate environment, there can be no assurance that such measures will be effective in avoiding undue interest rate risk. As market interest rates rise, we will have competitive pressures to increase the rates we pay on deposits, which will result in a decrease of our net interest income and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAdverse changes in the financial markets may adversely impact our results of operations.\nWhile we generally invest in securities with limited credit risk, certain investment securities we hold possess higher credit risk since they represent beneficial interests in structured investments collateralized by residential mortgages. Regardless of the level of credit risk, all investment securities are subject to changes in market value due to changing interest rates and implied credit spreads.\nStructured investments have at times been subject to significant market volatility due to the uncertainty of the credit ratings, deterioration in credit losses occurring within certain types of residential mortgages, changes in prepayments of the underlying collateral and the lack of transparency related to the investment structures and the collateral underlying the structured investment vehicles.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe operate in an extremely competitive market, and our business will suffer if we are unable to compete effectively.\nIn our market area, we encounter significant competition from other commercial banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions, mortgage banking firms, consumer finance companies, securities brokerage firms, insurance companies, money market mutual funds and other financial institutions. The increasingly competitive environment is a result primarily of changes in regulation, changes in technology and product delivery systems and the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial service providers. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources and lending limits than we do and may offer services that we do not or cannot provide. Technology and other changes are allowing parties to complete financial transactions that historically have involved banks at one or both ends of the transaction. For example, consumers can now pay bills and transfer funds directly without banks. The process of eliminating banks as intermediaries could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of customer deposits and income generated from those deposits. Our ability to maintain our history of strong financial performance and return on investment to shareholders will depend in part on our continued ability to compete successfully in our market area and on our ability to expand our scope of available financial services as needed to meet the needs and demands of our customers.\nOur small to medium-sized business target market may have fewer financial resources to weather a downturn in the economy.\nWe target our business development and marketing strategy primarily to serve the banking and financial services needs of small to medium-sized businesses. These small to medium-sized businesses generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger companies. If general economic conditions negatively impact our Ohio and West Virginia markets or the other geographic markets in which we operate, our results of operations and financial condition may be negatively affected.\nOur business strategy includes growth plans. Our financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected if we fail to grow or fail to manage our growth effectively.\nWe intend to continue pursuing a profitable growth strategy. Our prospects must be considered in light of the risks, expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in significant growth stages of development. We cannot assure you that we will be able to expand our market presence in our existing markets or successfully enter new markets or that any such expansion will not adversely affect our results of operations. Failure to manage our growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business, future prospects, financial condition or results of operations and could adversely affect our ability to successfully implement our business strategy. Also, if we grow more slowly than anticipated, our operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nOur ability to grow successfully will depend on a variety of factors, including the continued availability of desirable business opportunities, the competitive responses from other financial institutions in our market areas, our ability to raise sufficient capital and our ability to manage our growth. While we believe we have the management resources and internal systems in place to successfully manage our future growth, there can be no assurance growth opportunities will be available or growth will be successfully managed.\nWe may acquire other financial institutions or parts of institutions in the future and may open new branches. We also may consider and enter into new lines of business or offer new products or services. Expansions of our business involve a number of expenses and risks, including:\n\u00b7\nthe time and costs associated with identifying and evaluating potential acquisitions or new products or services;\n\u00b7\nthe potential inaccuracy of estimates and judgments used to evaluate credit, operations, management and market risk with respect to the target institutions;\n\u00b7\nthe time and costs of evaluating new markets, hiring local management and opening new offices, and the delay between commencing these activities and the generation of profits from the expansion;\n\u00b7\nour ability to finance an acquisition or other expansion and the possible dilution to our existing shareholders;\n\u00b7\nthe diversion of management's attention to the negotiation of a transaction and the integration of the operations and personnel of the combining businesses;\n\u00b7\nentry into unfamiliar markets;\n\u00b7\nthe possible failure of the introduction of new products and services into our existing business;\n\u00b7\nthe incurrence and possible impairment of goodwill associated with an acquisition and possible adverse short-term effects on our results of operations; and\n\u00b7\nthe risk of loss of key employees and customers.\nWe may incur substantial costs to expand, and we can give no assurance that such expansion will result in the levels of profits we expect. Neither can we assure that integration efforts for any future acquisitions will be successful. We may issue equity securities in connection with acquisitions, which could dilute the economic and voting interests of our existing shareholders. We may also lose customers as we close one or more branches as part of a plan to expand into other areas or become more productive from other branches.\nPeriodic regulatory reviews may affect our operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to periodic reviews from state and federal regulators, which may impact our operations and our financial condition. As part of the regulatory review, the loan portfolio and the allowance for loan losses are evaluated. As a result, the incurred loss identified on loans or the assigned loan rating could change and may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or loan charge-offs. In addition, any downgrade in loan ratings could impact our level of impaired loans or classified assets. Any increase in our provision for loan losses or loan charge-offs as required by these regulatory authorities could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Findings of deficiencies in compliance with regulations could result in restrictions on our activities or even a loss in our financial holding company status.\nOur exposure to credit risk could adversely affect our earnings and financial condition.\nMaking loans carries inherent risks, including interest rate changes over the time period in which loans may be repaid, risks resulting from changes in the economy, risks that we will have inaccurate or incomplete information about borrowers, risks that borrowers will become unable to repay loans; and, in the case of loans secured by collateral, risks resulting from uncertainties about the future value of the collateral.\nCommercial and commercial real estate loans comprise a significant portion of our loan portfolio. Commercial loans generally are viewed as having a higher credit risk than residential real estate or consumer loans because they usually involve larger loan balances to a single borrower and are more susceptible to a risk of default during an economic downturn. Since our loan portfolio contains a significant number of commercial and commercial real estate loans, the deterioration of one or a few of these loans could cause a significant increase in nonperforming loans, and ultimately could have a material adverse effect on our earnings and financial condition. We may also have concentrated credit exposure to a particular industry, resulting in a risk of a material adverse effect on our earnings or financial condition if there is an event adversely affecting that industry.\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with customers and counterparties, we may rely on information provided to us by customers and counterparties, including financial statements and other financial information. We may also rely on representations of customers and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and, with respect to financial statements, on reports of independent auditors. For example, in deciding whether to extend credit to a business, we may assume that the customer's audited financial statements conform with GAAP and present fairly, in all material respects, the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the customer. We may also rely on the audit report covering those financial statements. Our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted to the extent that we rely on financial statements that do not comply with GAAP or on financial statements and other financial information that are materially misleading.\nWe may be required to repurchase loans we have sold or indemnify loan purchasers under the terms of the sale agreements, which could adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.\nWhen the Bank sells a mortgage loan, it agrees to repurchase or substitute a mortgage loan if it is later found to have breached any representation or warranty the Bank made about the loan or if the borrower is later found to have committed fraud in connection with the origination of the loan. While we have underwriting policies and procedures designed to avoid breaches of representations and warranties as well as borrower fraud, we cannot assurance that no breach or fraud will ever occur. Required repurchases, substitutions or indemnifications could have an adverse effect on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf our actual loan losses exceed our allowance for loan losses, our net income will decrease.\nOur loan customers may not repay their loans according to their terms, and the collateral securing the payment of these loans may be insufficient to pay any remaining loan balance. We may experience significant loan losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we maintain an allowance for loan losses to provide for loan defaults and non-performance, which when combined, we refer to as the allowance for loan losses. Our allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual credit losses, and future provisions for credit losses could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Our allowance for loan losses is based on prior experience, as well as an evaluation of the risks in the current portfolio. The amount of future losses is susceptible to changes in economic, operating and other conditions, including changes in interest rates that may be beyond our control, and these losses may exceed current estimates. Federal regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, review our loans and allowance for loan losses. Moreover, the Financial Accounting Standards Board has changed its requirements for establishing the allowance, which will be effective for us in the first quarter of 2020. We cannot assure you that we will not further increase the allowance for loan losses or that regulators will not require us to increase this allowance. Either of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nMoreover, the Financial Accounting Standards Board has changed its requirements for establishing the allowance for loan losses. The new guidance is effective for annual reporting periods and interim reporting periods within those annual periods, beginning after December 15, 2019. Management is currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of this accounting guidance on the Bank's allowance for loan losses.\nThe discontinuance of tax refund services or a reduction in fees under a contract pursuant to an arrangement with a single tax refund product provider could have an adverse effect on our net income.\nThrough our relationship with a single tax refund product provider, the Bank offers products to facilitate the payment of tax refunds for customers who electronically file their tax returns. Under this program, the taxpayer may receive an electronic refund check or electronic refund deposit (\"ERC/ERD\"). In return, the Bank charges a fee for the service. For the 2017 tax season, the Company recorded ERC/ERD fee income of $1,692,000.\nOn October 21, 2014, the Bank entered into a new agreement with the third-party tax refund product provider. The new agreement generally provided for a different fee structure, including different fees depending upon the tax refund product selected, and fees that generally will be lower for each refund facilitated, with a reduction in per transaction fees in future years. It is impossible to predict the number of refunds that will be facilitated, the products chosen and therefore the fees that will be received by the Bank. Nevertheless, we anticipate that without a significant increase in the number of refunds we facilitate, the fees we receive from this arrangement will be significantly reduced in future years.\nWe will continue to face risks within our ERC/ERD business that could potentially terminate our agreement with the third-party tax refund product provider. These risks include not being able to perform the required ERC/ERD clearing services and/or regulatory scrutiny that could lead to a discontinuation in offering the ERC/ERD product. Also, having an agreement with just one tax refund product provider, a termination of that relationship could significantly reduce our ability to offer ERC's and ERD's due to limited alternatives of replacement. The termination of the ERC/ERD product would have a negative effect on earnings.\nWe may lose business due to declining use by consumers of banks to complete financial transactions or increased depositing of funds electronically with banks outside of our market area, which could negatively affect our net financial condition and results of operations.\nTechnology and other changes allow parties to complete financial transactions without banks. For example, consumers can pay bills and transfer funds directly without banks. Consumers can also shop for higher deposit interest rates at banks across the country, which may offer higher rates because they have few or no physical branches and open deposit accounts electronically. This process could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of client deposits and the income generated from those deposits, in addition to increasing our funding costs.\nFailures of, or material breaches in security of, our systems or those of third-party service providers may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business requires that we collect, process and store sensitive consumer data by utilizing computer systems and telecommunications networks operated by both us and third-party service providers. Our dependence upon automated systems to record and process the Bank's transactions poses the risk that technical system flaws, employee errors, tampering or manipulation of those systems, or attacks by third parties will result in losses and may be difficult to detect. Our inability to use these information systems at critical points in time could unfavorably impact the timeliness and efficiency of our business operations. In recent years, some banks have experienced denial of service attacks in which individuals or organizations flood the bank's website with extraordinarily high volumes of traffic, with the goal and effect of disrupting the ability of the bank to process transactions. We could also be adversely affected if one of our employees causes a significant operational break-down or failure, either as a result of human error or where an individual purposefully sabotages or fraudulently manipulates our operations or systems. We are further exposed to the risk that third-party service providers may be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations or will be affected by the same risks as the Bank has. These disruptions may interfere with service to the Bank's customers, cause additional regulatory scrutiny and result in a financial loss or liability. We are also at risk of the impact of natural disasters, terrorism and international hostilities on our systems or for the effects of outages or other failures involving power or communications systems operated by others.\nEmployees could engage in fraudulent, improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of clients or improper use of confidential information. We may not be able to prevent employee errors or misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect this type of activity might not be effective in all cases. Employee errors or misconduct could subject us to civil claims for negligence or regulatory enforcement actions, including fines and restrictions on our business.\nIn addition, there have been instances where financial institutions have been victims of fraudulent activity in which criminals pose as customers to initiate wire and automated clearinghouse transactions out of customer accounts. The recent massive breach of the systems of a credit bureau presents additional threats as criminals now have more information about a larger portion of our country's population than past breaches have involved, which could be used by criminals to pose as customers initiating transfers of money from customer accounts. Although we have policies and procedures in place to verify the authenticity of our customers, we cannot assure that such policies and procedures will prevent all fraudulent transfers. Such activity can result in financial liability and harm to our reputation.\nManagement cannot be certain that the security controls we have adopted will prevent unauthorized access to our computer systems or those of our third-party service providers, whom we require to maintain similar controls. A security breach of the computer systems and loss of confidential information, such as customer account numbers or personal information, could result in a loss of customers' confidence and, thus, loss of business. In addition, unauthorized access to or use of sensitive data could subject us to litigation and liability and costs to prevent further such occurrences.\nFurther, we may be affected by data breaches at retailers and other third parties who participate in data interchanges with us and our customers that involve the theft of customer credit and debit card data, which may include the theft of our debit card PIN numbers and commercial card information used to make purchases at such retailers and other third parties. Such data breaches could result in us incurring significant expenses to reissue debit cards and cover losses, which could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur assets at risk for cyber-attacks include financial assets and non-public information belonging to customers. We use several third-party vendors who have access to our assets via electronic media. Certain cyber security risks arise due to this access, including cyber espionage, blackmail, ransom, and theft. As cyber and other data security threats continue to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify and enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any security vulnerabilities.\nOur ability to pay cash dividends is limited, and we may be unable to pay cash dividends in the future even if we would like to do so.\nWe are dependent primarily upon the earnings of our operating subsidiaries for funds to pay dividends on our common stock. The payment of dividends by us is also subject to certain regulatory restrictions. As a result, any payment of dividends in the future will be dependent, in large part, on our ability to satisfy these regulatory restrictions and our subsidiaries' earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and other factors. Although our financial earnings and financial condition have allowed us to declare and pay periodic cash dividends to our shareholders, there can be no assurance that our dividend policy or the size of dividend distribution will continue in the future, even if we are able to pay dividends. Our failure to pay dividends on our common shares could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common shares.\nWe may be compelled to seek additional capital in the future but may not be able to access capital when needed.\nOhio Valley and the Bank are required by regulatory authorities to maintain specified levels of capital. Federal banking agencies have adopted extensive changes to their capital requirements, including raising required amounts and eliminating inclusion of certain instruments from the calculation of capital. We began transitioning to the new requirements on January 1, 2015. Ohio Valley may be required to raise additional capital. If Ohio Valley experiences increased loan losses, additional capital may need to be obtained. In addition, Ohio Valley may elect to raise additional capital to support its business, to finance acquisitions, if any, or for other purposes. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on our financial performance, conditions in the capital markets, economic conditions and a number of other factors, many of which are outside of our control. There can be no assurance, therefore, that we can raise additional capital at all or on terms acceptable to us. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed or desired, it may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThe loss of key members of our senior management team could adversely affect our business.\nWe believe that our success depends largely on the efforts and abilities of our senior management. Their experience and industry contacts significantly benefit us. In addition, our success depends in part upon senior management's ability to implement our business strategy. The competition for qualified personnel in the financial services industry is intense, and the loss of services of any of our senior executive officers or an inability to continue to attract, retain and motivate key personnel could adversely affect our business. We cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our existing key personnel or attract additional qualified personnel.\nLoss of key employees may disrupt relationships with certain customers.\nOur business is primarily relationship-driven in that many of our key employees have extensive customer relationships. Loss of a key employee with such customer relationships may lead to the loss of business if the customers were to follow that employee to a competitor. While we believe our relationships with our key producers is good, we cannot guarantee that all of our key personnel will remain with our organization. Loss of such key personnel, should they enter into an employment relationship with one of our competitors, could result in the loss of some of our customers.\nManagement's accounting policies and methods are the basis of how we report our financial condition and results of operations, and these policies may require management to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain.\nManagement's accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. Our management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting policies and methods in order to ensure that they comply with generally accepted accounting principles and reflect management's judgment as to the most appropriate manner in which to record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, management must select the accounting policy or method to apply from two or more alternatives, any of which might be reasonable under the circumstances yet might result in reporting materially different amounts than would have been reported under a different alternative.\nManagement has identified several accounting policies that are considered significant (one as being \"critical\") to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations because they require management to make particularly subjective and/or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because of the likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. Because of the inherent uncertainty of estimates about these matters, no assurance can be given that the application of alternative policies or methods might not result in our reporting materially different amounts.\nIf we foreclose on collateral property and own the underlying real estate, we may be subject to the increased costs associated with the ownership of real property, resulting in reduced revenues.\nWe may have to foreclose on collateral property to protect our investment and may thereafter own and operate such property, in which case we will be exposed to the risks inherent in the ownership of real estate. The amount that we, as a mortgagee, may realize after a default is dependent upon factors outside of our control, including, but not limited to: (i) general or local economic conditions; (ii) neighborhood values; (iii) interest rates; (iv) real estate tax rates; (v) operating expenses of the mortgaged properties; (vi) supply of and demand for rental units or properties; (vii) ability to obtain and maintain adequate occupancy of the properties; (viii) zoning laws; (ix) governmental rules, regulations and fiscal policies; and (x) acts of God. Certain expenditures associated with the ownership of real estate, principally real estate taxes and maintenance costs, may adversely affect the income from the real estate. Therefore, the cost of operating a real property may exceed the rental income earned from such property, and we may have to advance funds in order to protect our investment, or we may be required to dispose of the real property at a loss. The foregoing expenditures and costs could adversely affect our ability to generate revenues, resulting in reduced levels of profitability.\nEnvironmental liability associated with commercial lending could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn the course of our business, we may acquire, through foreclosure, commercial properties securing loans that are in default. There is a risk that hazardous substances could be discovered on those properties. In this event, we could be required to remove the substances from and remediate the properties at our cost and expense. The cost of removal and environmental remediation could be substantial. We may not have adequate remedies against the owners of the properties or other responsible parties and could find it difficult or impossible to sell the affected properties. These events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation.\nA default by another larger financial institution could adversely affect financial markets generally.\nThe commercial soundness of many financial institutions may be closely interrelated as a result of relationships between the institutions. As a result, concerns about, or a default or threatened default by, one institution could lead to significant market-wide liquidity and credit problems, losses or defaults by other institutions. This \"systemic risk\" may adversely affect our business.\nIncreases in FDIC insurance premiums may have a material adverse effect on our earnings.\nIncreased bank failures for several years commencing in 2008 greatly increased resolution costs of the FDIC and depleted the deposit insurance fund In order to maintain a strong funding position and restore reserve ratios of the deposit insurance fund, the FDIC took a number of actions, including increasing assessment rates of insured institutions, requiring riskier institutions to pay a larger share of premiums by factoring in rate adjustments based on secured liabilities and unsecured debt levels, changing the assessment base and requiring a prepayment of assessments for over three years.\nWe are generally unable to control the amount of premiums that we are required to pay for FDIC insurance. If there are additional financial institution failures, we may be required to pay even higher FDIC premiums. Increases in FDIC insurance premiums may materially adversely affect our results of operations and our ability to continue to pay dividends on our common shares at the current rate or at all. The FDIC has recently adopted rules revising its assessments in a manner benefitting banks with assets totaling less than $10 billion. There can be no assurance, though, that assessments will not be changed in the future.\nThe failure of our common shares to be included in the Russell 3000 Index could result in the market for our common shares to become limited and volatile and the price at which you can sell your shares to decrease.\nYour ability to sell or purchase our common shares depends upon the existence of an active trading market for our common shares. Additionally, a fair valuation of the purchase or sales price of our common shares also depends upon an active trading market, and thus the price you receive for a thinly-traded stock may not reflect its true value. A limited trading market for common shares may cause fluctuations in the market value of those common shares to be exaggerated, leading to price volatility in excess of that which would occur in a more active trading market.\nAlthough our common shares are quoted on The NASDAQ Global Market, the volume of trades on any given day has been limited historically, as a result of which shareholders might not have been able to sell or purchase our common shares at the volume, price or time desired. On June 26, 2017, our common shares were added to the Russell 3000\u00ae Index. The addition of our common shares to the Russell 3000\u00ae Index increased the volume of trading in our shares as well as the price at which our shares trade. There can be no assurance that our common shares will remain in that index. If our common shares are removed from the Russell 3000\u00ae Index, the volume of trading in our shares may decrease materially as well as the prices at which our shares trade.\nOur organizational documents may have the effect of discouraging a third party from acquiring us by means of a tender offer, proxy contest or otherwise.\nOur articles of incorporation contain provisions that make it more difficult for a third party to gain control or acquire us without the consent of our board of directors. These provisions also could discourage proxy contests and may make it more difficult for dissident shareholders to elect representatives as directors and take other corporate actions. These provisions of our governing documents may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a transaction or a change in control that might be in the best interests of our shareholders.\nRisks Related to the Legal and Regulatory Environment\nNew laws and increased regulatory oversight may significantly affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe financial services industry is extensively regulated. We are subject to extensive state and federal regulation, supervision and legislation that govern almost all aspects of our operations. Laws and regulations may change from time to time and are primarily intended for the protection of consumers, depositors, borrowers, the FDIC's Deposit Insurance Fund and the banking system as a whole, and not to benefit our shareholders. Regulations affecting banks and financial services businesses are undergoing continuous changes, and management cannot predict the effect of these changes. Moreover, the current United States President and certain legislators have taken steps to make extensive changes to regulations affecting financial institutions. The impact of any changes to laws and regulations or other actions by regulatory agencies may negatively impact us or our ability to increase the value of our business. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on the operation of an institution, the classification of assets held by an institution and the adequacy of an institution's allowance for loan losses. Additionally, actions by regulatory agencies against us could cause us to devote significant time and resources to defending our business and may lead to penalties that materially affect us and our shareholders. Even the reduction of regulatory restrictions could have an adverse effect on us and our shareholders if such lessening of restrictions increases competition within our industry or market area.\nIn light of conditions in the global financial markets and the global economy that occurred in the last decade, regulators increased their focus on the regulation of the financial services industry. New statutes and regulations subjected us to additional restrictions and requirements that have had an impact on our business and results of operations.\nIn 2013, the Federal Reserve Board published final rules (the \"Basel III Capital Rules\") establishing a new comprehensive capital framework for U. S. banking organizations. The rules implement the Basel Committee's December 2010 framework for strengthening international capital standards as well as certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Basel III Capital Rules substantially revise the risk-based capital requirements applicable to financial holding companies and other bank holding companies as well as depository institutions. The Basel III Capital Rules became effective for us on January 1, 2015 (subject to a phase-in period). Although the implementation of the Basel III Capital Rules, once fully phased in, is not expected to have a material impact on our capital ratios, any future changes to capital requirements could have such an effect.\nIn addition to laws, regulations and actions directed at the operations of banks in general, the CFPB has adopted regulations directed at consumer lending in particular.\nIn addition to laws, regulations and actions directed at the operations of banks, proposals to reform the housing finance market could negatively affect our ability to sell loans.\nAlthough it is impossible for us to predict at this time what changes in laws and regulations will be implemented and the effect they will have on us and the rest of our industry, it is possible that our revenue could decrease, our interest expense could increase and deposit insurance premiums could change, and steps may need to be taken to increase qualifying capital. Our operating and compliance costs could increase and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in tax laws could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to extensive federal, state and local taxes, including income, excise, sales/use, payroll, franchise, withholding and ad valorem taxes. Changes to our taxes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, our customers are subject to a wide variety of federal, state and local taxes. Changes in taxes paid by our customers, including changes in the deductibility of mortgage loan related expenses, may adversely affect their ability to purchase homes or consumer products, which could adversely affect their demand for our loans and deposit products. In addition, such negative effects on our customers could result in defaults on the loans we have made and decrease the value of mortgage-backed securities in which we have invested.\nOn December 22, 2017, H.R.1, formally known as the \"Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,\" was enacted into law. This new tax legislation, among other changes, limits the amount of state, federal and local taxes that taxpayers are permitted to deduct on their individual tax returns and eliminates other deductions in their entirety. Such limits and eliminations may result in customer defaults on loans we have made and decrease the value of mortgage-backed securities in which we have invested.\nIn October 2017, the CFPB issued a final rule with respect to certain consumer loans to be effective on January 16, 2018, although compliance with most sections to be required starting on August 19, 2019. The first major part of the rule makes it an unfair and abusive practice for a lender to make short-term and longer-term loans with balloon payments (with certain exceptions) without reasonably determining that the borrower has the ability to repay the loan. The second major part of the rule applies to the same types of loans as well as longer-term loans with an annual percentage rate greater than 36 percent that are repaid directly from the borrower's account. The rule states that it is an unfair and abusive practice for the lender to withdraw payment from the borrower's account after two consecutive payment attempts have failed, unless the lender obtains the consumer's new and specific authorization to make further withdrawals from the account. The rule also requires lenders to provide certain notices to the borrower before attempting to withdraw payment on a covered loan from the borrower's account.\nOn January 16, 2018, the CFPB issued a press release stating that it \"intends to engage in a rulemaking process so that the Bureau may reconsider the Payday Rule.\"\nWe are currently assessing the expected effect of this new rule on the Bank's and Loan Central's lending businesses and on the Company's financial condition and results of operations. The costs of copmlying with this regulation or a determination to discontinue certain types of consumer lending in light of the expense of compliance could have an adverse effect on the financial conditions and results of operations of the Company.", "PERMNO": 83155, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "OVBC"}
