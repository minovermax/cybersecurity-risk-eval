{"cik": "946647", "company": "PREMIER FINANCIAL CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe risks listed below present risks that could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, or business. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing the Company. Additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or that management currently deems immaterial may also impair the Company\u2019s business operations.\nEconomic and Market Risks\nThe economic impact of COVID-19 or any other pandemic could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, liquidity, cash flows, and results of operations.\nCOVID-19 has negatively impacted global, national and local economies, disrupted global supply chains, lowered equity market valuations, created significant volatility and disruption in financial markets, increased unemployment levels and decreased consumer confidence, generally. In addition, the pandemic resulted in temporary closures of many businesses and the institution of social distancing and sheltering in place requirements in many states and communities and may result in the same or similar restrictions in the future. As a result, the demand for our products and services have been and may continue to be significantly impacted, which could adversely affect our revenue and results of operations. Furthermore, the pandemic could continue to result in the recognition of credit losses in our loan portfolios and increase our allowance for credit losses, particularly if businesses are required to operate at diminished capacities or are required to close again, the impact on the global, national and local economies worsen, or more customers draw on their lines of credit or seek additional loans to help finance their businesses. Our business operations may also be disrupted if significant portions of our workforce are unable to work effectively, including because of illness, quarantines, government actions, or other restrictions in connection with COVID-19. The pandemic could also affect the stability of our deposit base as well as our capital and liquidity position, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, result in lost revenue and cause us to incur additional expenses. Similarly, because of changing economic and market conditions affecting issuers, we may be required to recognize other-than-temporary impairments in future periods on the securities we hold as well as reductions in other comprehensive income.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Bank holds and services PPP loans. These PPP loans are subject to the provisions of the CARES Act and to complex and evolving rules and guidance issued by the SBA and other government agencies. While a large number of our PPP borrowers have applied for or received full or partial forgiveness of their loan obligations we still have credit risk on the remaining PPP loans in the event the SBA determines that there is a deficiency in the manner in which we originated, funded or serviced such loans, including any issue with the eligibility of a borrower to receive funding. We could face additional risks in our administrative capabilities to service our PPP loans and to properly determine loan forgiveness. In the event of a loss resulting from a default on a PPP loan and a determination by the SBA that there was a deficiency in the manner in which we originated, funded or serviced the PPP loan, the SBA may deny its liability under the guaranty, reduce the amount of the guaranty or, if the SBA has already paid under the guaranty, seek recovery of any loss related to the deficiency.\nCOVID-19, the rise of new strains thereof, or a new pandemic could subject us to any of the following risks that cannot be predicted, any of which could, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations:\n\u2022demand for our products and services may decline, making it difficult to grow assets and income;\n\u2022if the economy is unable to re-open, loan delinquencies, problem assets, and foreclosures may increase, resulting in increased charges and reduced income;\n\u2022collateral for loans, especially real estate, may decline in value, which could cause credit losses to increase;\n\u2022our allowance for credit losses may have to be increased if borrowers experience financial difficulties beyond forbearance periods, which will adversely affect our net income;\n\u2022the net worth and liquidity of loan guarantors may decline, impairing their ability to honor commitments to us;\n\u2022we rely on third party vendors for certain services and the unavailability of a critical service due to COVID-19 could have an adverse effect on us; and\n\u2022continued adverse economic conditions could result in protracted volatility in the price of our common shares.\nMoreover, our future success and profitability substantially depend on the management skills of our executive officers and directors, many of whom have held officer and director positions with us for many years. The unanticipated loss or unavailability of key employees due to COVID-19,including any new variations thereof, or any similar pandemic could harm our ability to operate our business or execute our business strategy. We may not be successful in finding and integrating suitable successors in the event of key employee loss or unavailability.\nEven after the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, the U.S. economy will likely require time to recover, the length of which is unknown and during which the U.S. may experience a recession or market correction. Our business could be materially and adversely affected by such recession or market correction.\nWe continue to closely monitor COVID-19 and related risks as they evolve. To the extent the effects of COVID-19 adversely impact our business, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this item.\nPremier\u2019s loan portfolio includes a concentration of commercial real estate loans and commercial loans, which involve risks specific to real estate value and the successful operations of these businesses.\nAt December 31, 2021, the Bank\u2019s portfolio of commercial real estate loans totaled $2.5 billion, or approximately 42.5% of total loans. The Bank\u2019s commercial real estate loans typically have higher principal amounts than residential real estate loans, and many of our commercial real estate borrowers have more than one loan outstanding. As a result, an adverse development on one loan can expose Premier to greater risk of loss on other loans. Additionally, repayment of the loans is generally dependent, in large part, on sufficient income from the properties securing the loans to cover operating expenses and debt service. Economic conditions and events outside of the control of the borrower or lender, including COVID-19, could negatively impact the future cash flows and market values of the affected properties.\nAt December 31, 2021, the Bank\u2019s portfolio of commercial loans totaled $896,000 million, or approximately 15.5% of total loans. Commercial loans generally expose Premier to a greater risk of nonpayment and loss than commercial real estate or residential real estate loans since repayment of such loans often depends on the successful operations and income stream of the borrowers. The Bank\u2019s commercial loans are primarily made based on the identified cash flow of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower such as accounts receivable, inventory, machinery or real estate. In the case of loans secured by accounts receivable, the availability of funds for the repayment of these loans may be substantially dependent on the ability of the borrower to collect amounts due from its customers. The collateral securing other loans may depreciate over time, may be difficult to appraise and may fluctuate in value based on the success of the business. Credit support provided by the borrower for most of these loans and the probability of repayment is based on the liquidation of the pledged collateral and enforcement of a personal guarantee, if any exists.\nPremier targets its business lending towards small- and medium-sized businesses, many of which have fewer financial resources than larger companies and may be more susceptible to economic downturns. If general economic conditions negatively impact these businesses, Premier\u2019s results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nIf Premier's actual credit losses exceed its allowance for credit losses, Premier's net income will decrease.\nIn accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d), Premier must maintain an allowance for credit losses that it believes is a reasonable estimate of the expected credit losses within the CECL model. Premier's allowance for credit losses is based upon a number of relevant factors, including, but not limited to, trends in the level of nonperforming assets and classified loans, current and projected economic conditions in the primary lending area, prior experience, possible losses arising from specific\nproblem loans, and management's evaluation of the risks in the current portfolio. However, there are many factors that can result in actual credit losses exceeding the allowance.\nFor instance, in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with customers and counterparties, Premier may rely on information provided to it by customers and counterparties, including financial statements and other financial information. Premier may also rely on representations of customers and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and, with respect to financial statements, on reports of independent auditors. Such information may not turn out to be accurate. Further, Premier's loan customers may not repay their loans according to their terms, and the collateral securing the payment of these loans may be insufficient to pay any remaining loan balance. As a result, Premier may experience significant credit losses, which could have a material adverse effect on its operating results.\nThe amount of future losses also is susceptible to changes in economic, operating and other conditions, including changes in unemployment and interest rates that may be beyond management's control, and these losses may exceed current estimates. Further, federal regulatory agencies, as an integral part of their examination process, review Premier's loans and allowance for credit losses and may require that Premier increase its allowance. Moreover, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) has changed its requirements for establishing the allowance, which became effective for Premier in the first quarter of 2020. Under the CECL model, we are required to use historical information, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts to estimate the expected credit losses. That accounting change exposes Premier to increased risk of failure to establish a sufficient allowance due to incorrect or inadequate methodologies and assumptions and the possibility that Premier will need to increase its allowance substantially through an increase to the provision for credit losses, which will adversely affect Premier's net income.\nAs a result of any of the above factors, Premier's allowance for credit losses may not be adequate to cover actual credit losses, and future provisions for credit losses could have a material adverse effect on Premier's operating results. There is no assurance that Premier will not further increase the allowance for credit losses. Either of these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on Premier's financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in interest rates can adversely affect Premier\u2019s profitability.\nPremier\u2019s earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon its net interest income, which is the difference between interest income earned on interest-earning assets such as loans and securities, and interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond Premier\u2019s control, including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the Federal Reserve. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, could influence not only the interest Premier receives on loans and securities and the amount of interest it pays on deposits and borrowings, but such changes could also affect Premier\u2019s ability to originate loans and obtain deposits, the fair value of Premier\u2019s financial assets and liabilities, and the average duration of certain assets and liabilities. If the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments, Premier\u2019s net interest income, and therefore earnings, could be adversely affected. Earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings. While we generally invest in securities with limited credit risk, certain investment securities we hold possess higher credit risk, especially in light of the continued economic effects of COVID-19, since they represent beneficial interests in structured investments collateralized by residential mortgages. All investment securities are subject to changes in market value due to changing interest rates and implied credit spreads. Any substantial, unexpected, or prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on Premier\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Bank originates a significant amount of residential mortgage loans that it sells in the secondary market. The origination of residential mortgage loans is highly dependent on the local real estate market and the current interest rates. Increasing interest rates tend to reduce the origination of loans for sale and consequently fee income, which Premier reports as mortgage banking income. Conversely, decreasing interest rates have the effect of causing clients to refinance mortgage loans faster than anticipated. This causes the value of mortgage servicing rights on the loans sold to be lower than originally anticipated. If this happens, Premier may be required to write down the value of its mortgage servicing rights faster than anticipated, which will increase expense and lower earnings. Accelerated repayments on loans and mortgage-backed securities could result in the reinvestment of funds at lower rates than the loans or securities were paying.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nLaws, regulations and periodic regulatory reviews may affect Premier\u2019s results of operations.\nThe financial services industry is extensively regulated. Premier is subject to extensive state and federal regulation, supervision and legislation that govern almost all aspects of its operations. Laws and regulations may change from time to time and are primarily intended for the protection of consumers, depositors, borrowers, the DIF and the banking system as a whole, and not to benefit Premier\u2019s shareholders. Regulations affecting banks and financial services businesses are undergoing continuous changes, and management cannot predict the effect of these changes. The impact of any changes to laws and regulations or other actions by regulatory agencies may\nnegatively impact Premier and its ability to increase the value of its business, possibly limiting the services it provides, increasing the potential for competition from non-banks, or requiring it to change the way it operates.\nRegulatory authorities have extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on the operation of an institution, the classification of assets held by an institution, the adequacy of an institution\u2019s allowance for credit losses and the ability to complete acquisitions. Additionally, actions by regulatory agencies against Premier could cause it to devote significant time and resources to defending its business and may lead to penalties that materially affect Premier and its shareholders. Even the reduction of regulatory restrictions could have an adverse effect on Premier and its shareholders if such lessening of restrictions increases competition within Premier\u2019s industry or market area.\nIn addition to laws, regulations and actions directed at the operations of banks, proposals to reform the housing finance market could negatively affect Premier\u2019s ability to sell loans.\nThe laws and regulations applicable to the banking industry could change at any time. The potential exists for new laws and regulations, and bank regulatory agencies are expected to be active in responding to concerns and trends identified in examinations. Increased regulation could increase Premier\u2019s cost of compliance and reduce its income to the extent that they limit the manner in which Premier may conduct business, including its ability to offer new products, charge fees for specific products and services, obtain financing, attract deposits, make loans and achieve satisfactory interest spreads.\nChanges in tax laws could adversely affect Premier's financial condition and results of operations.\nPremier is subject to extensive federal, state and local taxes, including income, excise, sales/use, payroll, franchise, withholding and ad valorem taxes. Changes to the tax laws could have a material adverse effect on Premier's results of operations. In addition, Premier's customers are subject to a wide variety of federal, state and local taxes. Changes in taxes paid by customers, including changes in the deductibility of mortgage loan related expenses, may adversely affect their ability to finance activities or purchase properties or consumer products, which could adversely affect their demand for Premier's loans and deposit products. In addition, such negative effects on Premier's customers could result in defaults on the loans already made and decrease the value of mortgage-backed securities in which Premier has invested.\nIncreasing scrutiny and evolving expectations from customers, regulators, investors, and other stakeholders with respect to our environmental, social and governance practices may impose additional costs on us or expose us to new or additional risks.\nCompanies are facing increasing scrutiny from customers, regulators, investors, and other stakeholders related to their environmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) practices and disclosure. Investor advocacy groups, investment funds and influential investors are also increasingly focused on these practices, especially as they relate to the environment, health and safety, diversity, labor conditions and human rights. Increased ESG-related compliance costs for us as well as among our third party vendors and various other parties within our supply chain could result in increases to our overall operational costs. Failure to adapt to or comply with regulatory requirements or investor or stakeholder expectations and standards could negatively impact our reputation, ability to do business with certain partners, access to capital, and the price of our common shares.\nBusiness and Operational Risks\nPremier\u2019s ability to meet cash flow needs on a timely basis at a reasonable cost may adversely affect net income.\nPremier\u2019s principal sources of liquidity are local deposits and wholesale funding sources such as FHLB advances, Federal Funds purchased, securities sold under repurchase agreements, and brokered or other out-of-market certificate of deposit purchases. Premier also maintains a portfolio of securities that can be used as a secondary source of liquidity. Premier\u2019s access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance or capitalize its activities or on terms that are acceptable could be impaired by factors that affect Premier directly or the financial services industry or economy in general, such as further disruptions in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry.\nOther possible sources of liquidity include the sale or securitization of loans, the issuance of additional collateralized borrowings beyond those currently utilized with the FHLB, the issuance of debt securities and the issuance of preferred or common securities in public or private transactions, or borrowings from a commercial bank.\nAny decline in available funding could adversely impact our ability to originate loans, invest in securities, meet our expenses, pay dividends to our shareholders, or fulfill obligations such as repaying Premier\u2019s borrowings or meeting deposit withdrawal demands, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, prior debt offerings could potentially have important consequences to Premier and its debt and equity investors, including:\n\u2022requiring a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to make interest payments;\n\u2022making it more difficult to satisfy debt service and other obligations;\n\u2022increasing the risk of a future credit ratings downgrade of its debt, which could increase future debt costs and limit the future availability of debt financing;\n\u2022increasing its vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022reducing the cash flow available to fund capital expenditures and other corporate purposes and to grow its business;\n\u2022limiting its flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in its business and the industry;\n\u2022placing it at a competitive disadvantage relative to its competitors that may not be as highly leveraged with debt; and\n\u2022limiting its ability to borrow additional funds as needed or to take advantage of business opportunities as they arise, pay cash dividends or repurchase securities.\nWe are continuing to evaluate these risks on an ongoing basis.\nIntegrating Premier and UCFC after the Merger may be more difficult, costly, or time consuming than expected and the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the Merger may not be realized.\nAlthough the Merger closed on January 31, 2020, the integration of Premier and UCFC is an ongoing process. Premier\u2019s ability to successfully combine and integrate the businesses of Premier and UCFC in a manner that permits growth opportunities and does not materially disrupt the existing customer relations nor result in decreased revenues due to loss of customers poses a risk to the business. It is possible that the integration process could result in inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect Premier\u2019s ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, depositors and employees, or to achieve the anticipated benefits and cost savings of the Merger. Further, Premier is dependent upon several outside vendors to make the integration successful.\nCompetition affects Premier\u2019s earnings.\nPremier\u2019s continued profitability depends on its ability to continue to effectively compete to originate loans and attract and retain deposits. Competition for both loans and deposits is intense in the financial services industry. The Company competes in its market area by offering superior service and competitive rates and products. The types of institutions Premier competes with include large regional commercial banks, smaller community banks, savings institutions, mortgage banking firms, credit unions, finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance agencies and mutual funds. As a result of their size and ability to achieve economies of scale, certain of Premier\u2019s competitors can offer a broader range of products and services than the Company can offer. . In addition, an inability to timely adapt to technological advances could pose a risk to the future success of our business operations. Digital or cryptocurrencies, blockchain, and other \u201cfintech\u201d technologies are designed to enhance transactional security and have the potential to disrupt the financial industry, change the way banks do business, and reduce the need for banks as financial deposit-keepers and intermediaries. Consumers may move money out of bank deposits in favor of other investments, including digital or cryptocurrency. Consumers can also shop for higher deposit interest rates at banks across the country, which may offer higher rates because they have few or no physical branches. To stay competitive in its market area, Premier may need to adjust the interest rates on its products to match rates of its competition, which could have a negative impact on net interest margin and results of operations.\nNegative public opinion could damage our reputation and impact business operations and revenues.\nAs a financial institution, our earnings and capital are subject to risks associated with negative public opinion. Negative public opinion could result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including lending practices, the failure of any product or service sold by us to meet our clients\u2019 expectations or applicable regulatory requirements, corporate governance and acquisitions, social media and other marketing activities, the implementation of environmental, social, and governance practices, or from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to any of the foregoing. Negative public opinion could affect our ability to attract or retain clients, could expose us to litigation and regulatory action, and could have a material adverse effect on our stock price or result in heightened volatility. Negative public opinion could also affect our ability to borrow funds in the unsecured wholesale debt markets.\nThe increasing complexity of Premier\u2019s operations presents varied risks that could affect its earnings and financial condition.\nPremier processes a large volume of transactions on a daily basis and is exposed to numerous types of risks related to internal processes, people and systems. These risks include, but are not limited to, the risk of fraud by persons inside or outside the Company, the execution of unauthorized transactions by employees, errors relating to transaction processing and systems, breaches of data security and our internal control system and compliance with a complex array of consumer and safety and soundness regulations. Premier could also experience additional loss as a result of potential legal actions that could arise as a result of operational deficiencies or as a result of noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations.\nPremier has established and maintains a system of internal controls that provides management with information on a timely basis and allows for the monitoring of compliance with operational standards. These systems have been designed to manage operational risks at an appropriate, cost effective level. Procedures exist that are designed to ensure that policies relating to conduct, ethics, and\nbusiness practices are followed. Losses from operational risks may still occur, however, including losses from the effects of operational errors.\nUnauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or customer information or confidential trade secrets, whether through a breach of the Company\u2019s computer systems or otherwise, could severely harm its business.\nPotential misuse of funds or information by Premier\u2019s employees or by third parties could result in damage to Premier\u2019s customers for which Premier could be held liable, subject Premier to regulatory sanctions and otherwise adversely affect Premier\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nPremier\u2019s employees handle a significant amount of funds, as well as financial and personal information. Premier also depends upon third-party vendors who have access to funds and personal information about customers. Cybersecurity breaches of other companies, such as the breach of the systems of a credit bureau, may result in criminals using personal information obtained from such other source to impersonate a customer of Premier and obtain funds from customer accounts. Further, Premier may be affected by data breaches at retailers and other third parties who participate in data interchanges with Premier\u2019s customers that involve the theft of customer credit and debit card data, which may include the theft of debit card personal identification numbers and commercial card information used to make purchases at such retailers and other third parties. Such data breaches could result in Premier incurring significant expenses to reissue debit cards and cover losses, which could result in a material adverse effect on Premier\u2019s results of operations.\nAlthough Premier has implemented systems to minimize the risk of fraudulent taking or misuse of funds or information, there can be no assurance that such systems will be adequate or that a taking or misuse of funds or information by employees, by third parties who have authorized access to funds or information, or by third parties who are able to access funds or information without authorization will never occur. Premier could be held liable for such an event and could also be subject to regulatory sanctions. Premier could also incur the expense of developing additional controls and investing in additional equipment or contracts to prevent future such occurrences. Although Premier has insurance to cover such potential losses, Premier cannot provide assurance that such insurance will be adequate to meet any liability, and insurance premiums may rise substantially if Premier suffers such an event. In addition, any loss of trust or confidence placed in Premier by our customers could result in a loss of business, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations, or result in a loss of investor confidence, adversely affecting Premier\u2019s stock price and ability to acquire capital in the future. Premier could also lose revenue by the wrongful appropriation of confidential information about its business operations by competitors who use the information to compete with Premier.\nPremier could suffer a material adverse impact from interruptions in the effective operation of, or security breaches affecting, Premier\u2019s computer systems.\nPremier relies heavily on its own information systems and those of vendors to conduct business and to process, record, and monitor transactions. Risks to the system could result from a variety of factors, including the potential for bad acts on the part of hackers, criminals, employees and others. As one example, some banks have experienced denial of service attacks in which individuals or organizations flood the bank\u2019s website with extraordinarily high volumes of traffic, with the goal and effect of disrupting the ability of the bank to process transactions. Other businesses have been victims of a ransomware attack in which a business becomes unable to access its own information and is presented with a demand to pay a ransom in order to once again have access to its information. Premier is also at risk for the impact of natural disasters, terrorism and international hostilities on its systems or for the effects of outages or other failures involving power or communications systems operated by others. These risks also arise from the same types of threats to businesses with which Premier deals.\nPotential adverse consequences of attacks on Premier\u2019s computer systems or other threats include damage to Premier\u2019s reputation, loss of customer business, costs of incentives to customers or business partners in order to maintain their relationships, loss of investor confidence and a reduction in Premier\u2019s stock price, litigation, increased regulatory scrutiny and potential enforcement actions, repairs of system damage, increased investments in cybersecurity (such as obtaining additional technology, making organizational changes, deploying additional personnel, training personnel and engaging consultants), and increased insurance premiums, all of which could result in financial loss and material adverse effects on Premier\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nIf Premier forecloses on collateral property resulting in Premier\u2019s ownership of the underlying real estate, Premier may be subject to the increased costs associated with the ownership of real property, resulting in reduced income.\nA significant portion of Premier\u2019s loan portfolio is secured by real property. During the ordinary course of business, Premier may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans. In doing so, there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties. If hazardous or toxic substances are found, Premier may be liable for remediation costs, as well as for personal injury and property damage.\nIn addition, when Premier forecloses on real property, the amount Premier realizes after a default is dependent upon factors outside of Premier\u2019s control, including, but not limited to, economic conditions, neighborhood real estate values, interest rates, real estate taxes, operating expenses of the mortgaged properties, zoning laws, governmental rules, regulations and fiscal policies, and acts\nof God. Certain expenditures associated with the ownership of real estate, principally real estate taxes and maintenance costs, may adversely affect the income from the real estate. Therefore, the cost of operating real property may exceed the rental income earned from such property, and Premier may have to sell the property at a loss. The foregoing expenditures could adversely affect Premier\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nPremier\u2019s business strategy focuses on planned growth, including strategic acquisitions, and its financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected if Premier fails to grow or fails to manage its growth effectively.\nPremier\u2019s ability to grow successfully will depend on a variety of factors, including the continued availability of desirable business opportunities, its ability to integrate mergers and other acquisitions and manage growth and Premier\u2019s ability to raise capital. There can be no assurance that growth opportunities will be available.\nPremier may acquire other financial institutions or parts of institutions in the future, open new branches, and consider new lines of business and new products or services. Expansions of its business would involve a number of expenses and risks, including:\n\u2022the time and costs associated with identifying and evaluating potential acquisitions or expansions into new markets;\n\u2022the potential inaccuracy of estimates and judgments used to evaluate the business and risks with respect to target institutions;\n\u2022the time and costs of hiring local management and opening new offices;\n\u2022the delay between commencing making acquisitions or engaging in new activities and the generation of profits from the expansion;\n\u2022Premier\u2019s ability to finance an expansion and the possible dilution to existing shareholders;\n\u2022the diversion of management\u2019s attention to the expansion;\n\u2022management\u2019s lack of familiarity with new market areas;\n\u2022the integration of new products and services and new personnel into Premier\u2019s existing business;\n\u2022the incurrence and possible impairment of goodwill associated with an acquisition and effects on Premier\u2019s results of operations; and\n\u2022the risk of loss of key employees and customers.\nIf Premier\u2019s growth involves the acquisition of companies through mergers or other acquisitions, the success of such acquisitions will depend on, among other things, Premier\u2019s ability to combine the businesses in a manner that permits growth opportunities and cost efficiencies, and does not cause inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect the ability of Premier to maintain relationships with customers and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions.\nFailure to manage Premier\u2019s growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on its business, future prospects, financial condition or results of operations and could adversely affect Premier\u2019s ability to successfully implement its business strategy.\nThe Bank\u2019s ability to pay dividends is subject to regulatory limitations which, to the extent Premier requires such dividends in the future, may affect its ability to pay dividends or repurchase its stock.\nPremier is a separate legal entity from the Bank and does not have significant operations of its own. Dividends from the Bank provide a significant source of capital for Premier. The availability of dividends from the Bank is limited by various statutes and regulations. The federal and state banking regulators require that insured financial institutions and their holding companies should generally only pay dividends out of current operating earnings. It is possible, depending upon the financial condition of the Bank and other factors, that the Bank\u2019s primary regulator could assert that the payment of dividends or other payments by the Bank are an unsafe or unsound practice. In the event the Bank is unable to pay dividends to Premier, Premier may not be able to pay its obligations as they become due, repurchase its stock, or pay dividends on its common stock. Consequently, the potential inability to receive dividends from the Bank could adversely affect Premier\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations or prospects.\nFailure to integrate or adopt new technology may undermine Premier\u2019s ability to meet customer demands, leading to adverse effects on Premier\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. Premier\u2019s future success depends, in part, upon its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in operations. Digital or cryptocurrencies, blockchain, and other \u201cfintech\u201d technologies are being developed to change the way banks operate and are eliminating the need for banks as financial deposit-keepers and intermediaries. Premier may not be able to effectively implement or have the resources to implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products\nand services to its customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could adversely affect Premier\u2019s business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nThe transition away from The London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) as a reference rate for financial contracts could negatively affect Premier\u2019s income and expenses and the value of various financial contracts.\nLIBOR is used extensively in the U.S. and globally as a benchmark for various commercial and financial contracts, including adjustable rate mortgages, corporate debt, interest rate swaps and other derivatives. LIBOR is set based on interest rate information reported by certain banks, which may stop reporting such information after 2021.\nIn 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (\u201cFCA\u201d) announced that after 2021 it would no longer compel banks to submit rates required to calculate LIBOR. On November 30, 2020, to facilitate an orderly LIBOR transition, the OCC, the FDIC, and the Federal Reserve jointly announced that entering into new contracts using LIBOR as a reference rate after December 31, 2021, would create a safety and soundness risk. On March 5, 2021, the FCA announced that all LIBOR settings will either cease to be provided by any administrator or no longer be representative immediately after December 31, 2021, in the case of 1-week and 2-month LIBOR, and immediately after June 30, 2023, in the case of the remaining LIBOR settings. In the United States, efforts to identify a set of alternative U.S. dollar reference interest rates are ongoing, and the Alternative Reference Rate Committee (\"ARRC\") has recommended the use of a Secured Overnight Funding Rate (\"SOFR\"). SOFR is different from LIBOR in that it is a backward looking secured rate rather than a forward looking unsecured rate.\nThese differences could lead to a greater disconnect between our costs to raise funds for SOFR as compared to LIBOR. For cash products and loans, ARRC has also recommended Term SOFR, which is a forward looking SOFR based on SOFR futures and may in part reduce differences between SOFR and LIBOR. There are operational issues which may create a delay in the transition to SOFR or other substitute indices, leading to uncertainty across the industry.\nIt is currently unknown whether these recommendations and proposals will be broadly accepted, whether they will continue to evolve, and what effect of their implementation may have on the markets for floating-rate financial instruments. Any discontinuance, modification, alternative reference rates or other reforms may adversely affect interest rates on our current or future indebtedness and other financial instruments.\nThe Bank has ceased originating loans, derivative contracts, borrowings and other financial instruments that are directly or indirectly dependent on LIBOR. The transition from LIBOR could create considerable costs and additional risk for Premier. Since proposed alternative rates are calculated differently, payments under contracts referencing new rates will differ from these referencing LIBOR. The transition will change Premier\u2019s market risk profiles, requiring changes to risk and pricing models, valuation tools, product design and hedging strategies. Further, Premier\u2019s failure to adequately manage this transition process with its customers could adversely impact its reputation. Although Premier is currently unable to assess what the ultimate impact of the transition from LIBOR will be, any market-wide transition away from LIBOR could have an adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nEconomic, political and financial market conditions may adversely affect Premier\u2019s operations and financial condition.\nPremier\u2019s financial performance generally, and in particular the ability of borrowers to pay interest on and repay principal of outstanding loans and the value of collateral securing those loans, as well as demand for loans and other products and services Premier offers, is highly dependent upon the business environment in the markets where the Company operates, mainly in the State of Ohio, Northeast Indiana and Southeast Michigan. A favorable business environment is generally characterized by, among other factors, economic growth, efficient capital markets, low inflation, low unemployment, high business and investor confidence, and strong business earnings. Unfavorable or uncertain economic and market conditions can be caused by declines in economic growth, business activity or investor or business confidence; limitations on the availability of or increases in the cost of credit and capital; increases in inflation or interest rates; high unemployment, natural disasters; or a combination of these or other factors. Conditions such as inflation, recession, unemployment, changes in interest rates, fiscal and monetary policy, tariffs, a U.S. withdrawal from a significant renegotiation of trade agreements, trade wars, and other factors beyond Premier\u2019s control may adversely affect its deposit levels and composition, the quality of its assets including investment securities available for purchase, demand for loans, the ability of its borrowers to repay their loans and the value of the collateral securing the loans it makes. Because Premier has a significant amount of real estate loans, decreases in real estate values could adversely affect the value of property used as collateral and Premier\u2019s ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure.\nPremier is at risk of increased losses from fraud.\nCriminals are committing fraud at an increasing rate and are using more sophisticated techniques. In some cases, these individuals are part of larger criminal rings, which allow them to be more effective. Such fraudulent activity has taken many forms, ranging from debit card fraud, check fraud, mechanical devices attached to ATM machines, social engineering and phishing attacks to obtain personal information, or impersonation of clients through the use of falsified or stolen credentials. Additionally, an individual or business entity may properly identify itself, yet seek to establish a business relationship for the purpose of perpetrating fraud. An emerging type of fraud even involves the creation of synthetic identification in which fraudsters \"create\" individuals for the purpose of perpetrating fraud. Further, in addition to fraud committed directly against it, Premier may suffer losses as a result of fraudulent activity committed against third parties. Increased deployment of technologies, such as chip card technology, defray and reduce certain aspects of fraud; however, criminals are turning to other sources to steal personally identifiable information, such as unaffiliated healthcare providers and government entities, in order to impersonate the consumer and thereby commit fraud.\nPremier may be the subject of litigation, which would result in legal liability and damage to its business and reputation.\nFrom time to time, Premier and its subsidiaries may be subject to claims or legal action from customers, employees or others. Financial institutions like Premier are facing a growing number of significant class actions, including those based on the manner of calculation of interest on loans and the assessment of overdraft fees. Future litigation could include claims for substantial compensatory and/or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. Premier is also involved from time to time in other reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by governmental and other agencies regarding its businesses. These matters also could result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief. Like other financial institutions, Premier is also subject to risk from potential employee misconduct, including non-compliance with policies and improper use or disclosure of confidential information. Substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against Premier could materially adversely affect its business, financial condition or results of operations and/or cause significant reputational harm to its business.", "PERMNO": 79382, "SIC": 6035, "TIC": "PFC"}
