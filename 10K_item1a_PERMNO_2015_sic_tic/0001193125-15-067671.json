{"cik": "97210", "company": "TERADYNE, INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A: Risk Factors\nRisks Associated with Our Business\nThe risks described below are not the only risks that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results.\nOur business is impacted by global and industry-specific economic cycles, which are difficult to predict, and actions we have taken or may take to offset these cycles may not be sufficient.\nCapital equipment providers in the electronics and semiconductor industries, such as Teradyne, have, in the past, been negatively impacted by both sudden slowdowns in the global economies and recurring cyclicality within those industries. These cycles have resulted in periods of over-supply; a trend we believe will continue to occur for newer generations of electronic products. Our business and results of operations depend, in significant part, upon capital expenditures of manufacturers of semiconductors and other electronics, which in turn depend upon the current and anticipated market demand for those products. Disruption or deterioration in economic conditions may reduce customer purchases of our products, thereby reducing our revenues and earnings. In addition, such adverse changes in economic conditions, and resulting slowdowns in the market for our products, may, among other things, result in increased price competition for our products, increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories, increased risk in the collectability of our accounts receivable from our customers, potential reserves for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable, increased risk of restructuring charges, and\nhigher operating costs as a percentage of revenues, which, in each case and together, adversely affect our operating results. We are unable to predict the likely duration, frequency and severity of disruptions in financial markets, credit availability, and adverse economic conditions throughout the world, and we cannot ensure that the level of revenues or new orders for a fiscal quarter will be sustained in subsequent quarters. We have taken actions to address the effects of general economic variability and recurring industry cyclicality, including implementing cost control and reduction measures. If our businesses experience further downturns, whether due to a deterioration in global economic conditions or slowdowns in specific markets we serve, we may need to take further cost control and reduction measures. We cannot predict whether these measures will be sufficient to offset global or market-specific disruptions that might affect our test businesses.\nIn 2013, revenues from our Storage Test business unit were significantly lower than in 2012 due to lower hard disk drive demand from lower shipments of personal computers. In response to this lower demand, during the third quarter of 2013, we implemented a headcount reduction in the Storage Test business unit. It is possible that we may need to take further cost control and reduction measures including reducing the number of employees and reducing manufacturing capacity. A prolonged slowdown in hard disk drive demand may result in increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories, asset write-offs and restructuring charges.\nWe are subject to intense competition.\nWe face significant competition throughout the world in each of our reportable segments. Some of our competitors have substantial financial and other resources to pursue engineering, manufacturing, marketing and distribution of their products. We also face competition from emerging Asian equipment companies and internal development at several of our customers. Some of our competitors have introduced or announced new products with certain performance characteristics which may be considered equal or superior to those we currently offer. We expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and to introduce new products or new technologies that provide improved cost of ownership and performance characteristics. New product introductions by competitors could cause a decline in revenues or loss of market acceptance of our products.\nThe market for our products is concentrated, and our business depends, in part, on obtaining orders from a few significant customers.\nThe market for our products is concentrated with a limited number of significant customers accounting for a substantial portion of the purchases of test equipment. In each of the years 2014, 2013 and 2012, our three largest customers in aggregate accounted for 21%, 26% and 29% of consolidated revenues, respectively. In any one reporting period, a single customer or several customers may contribute even a larger percentage of our consolidated revenues. In addition, our ability to increase sales will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain orders from current or new significant customers. The opportunities to obtain orders from these customers may be limited, which may impair our ability to grow revenues. We expect that sales of our products will continue to be concentrated with a limited number of significant customers for the foreseeable future. The loss of a significant customer or any reduction in orders by these customers, including reductions due to market or competitive conditions, would likely have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nFailure to realize the estimated sales value of equipment leased to our customers may adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe occasionally lease equipment to our customers, typically for a term of one year. Subsequent to the one year term, the customer can cancel the lease by providing us two months notice. In 2014, the volume of leasing transactions and the value of equipment under leases increased significantly. The cost of the leased equipment is recorded as an asset on our balance sheet and depreciated over an estimated useful life of approximately four years. Realization of the leased equipment\u2019s value depends on numerous factors including: the technological\nobsolescence of the leased equipment; elections by customers to terminate a lease prior to scheduled termination; the general market conditions at the time of expiration of the lease; the customer\u2019s election to renew the lease; and the cost of comparable new equipment. Our inability to realize the leased equipment\u2019s value could cause a decrease in revenues and an increase in asset write-offs which would in each case reduce our operating income.\nOur operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly.\nOur operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could materially adversely affect revenues or profitability. The following factors could impact future operations:\n\u2022\na worldwide economic slowdown or disruption in the global financial markets;\n\u2022\ncompetitive pressures on selling prices;\n\u2022\nour ability to introduce, and the market acceptance of, new products;\n\u2022\nchanges in product revenues mix resulting from changes in customer demand;\n\u2022\nthe level of orders received which can be shipped in a quarter because of the tendency of customers to wait until late in a quarter to commit to purchase due to capital expenditure approvals and constraints occurring at the end of a quarter, or the hope of obtaining more favorable pricing from a competitor seeking the business;\n\u2022\nengineering and development investments relating to new product introductions, and the expansion of manufacturing, outsourcing and engineering operations in Asia;\n\u2022\nprovisions for excess and obsolete inventory relating to the lack of demand for and the discontinuance of products;\n\u2022\nimpairment charges for certain long-lived and intangible assets and goodwill;\n\u2022\nan increase in the leasing of our products to customers;\n\u2022\nparallel or multi-site testing could lead to a decrease in the ultimate size of the market for our products; and\n\u2022\nthe ability of our suppliers and subcontractors to meet product quality or delivery requirements needed to satisfy customer orders for our products, especially if product demand increases.\nAs a result of the foregoing and other factors, we have experienced and may continue to experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results or stock price.\nWe are subject to risks of operating internationally.\nA significant portion of our total revenues is derived from customers outside the United States. Our international sales and operations are subject to significant risks and difficulties, including:\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in legal and regulatory requirements affecting international markets;\n\u2022\nchanges in tariffs and exchange rates;\n\u2022\nsocial, political and economic instability, acts of terrorism and international conflicts;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in protecting intellectual property;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in accounts receivable collection;\n\u2022\ncultural differences in the conduct of business;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in staffing and managing international operations;\n\u2022\ncompliance with customs regulations; and\n\u2022\ncompliance with international tax laws and regulations.\nIn addition, an increasing portion of our products and the products we purchase from our suppliers are sourced or manufactured in foreign locations, including China, and a large portion of the devices our products test are fabricated and tested by foundries and subcontractors in Taiwan, China, Singapore and other parts of Asia. As a result, we are subject to a number of economic and other risks, particularly during times of political or financial instability in these regions. Disruption of manufacturing or supply sources in these international locations could materially adversely impact our ability to fill customer orders and potentially result in lost business.\nIf we fail to develop new technologies to adapt to our customers\u2019 needs and if our customers fail to accept our new products, our revenues will be adversely affected.\nWe believe that our technological position depends primarily on the technical competence and creative ability of our engineers. In a rapidly evolving market, such as ours, the development or acquisition of new technologies, commercialization of those technologies into products and market acceptance and customer demand for those products are critical to our success. Successful product development or acquisition, introduction and acceptance depend upon a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nnew product selection;\n\u2022\nability to meet customer requirements;\n\u2022\ndevelopment of competitive products by competitors;\n\u2022\ntimely and efficient completion of product design;\n\u2022\ntimely and efficient implementation of manufacturing and manufacturing processes;\n\u2022\ntimely remediation of product performance issues, if any, identified during testing;\n\u2022\nassembly processes and product performance at customer locations;\n\u2022\ndifferentiation of our products from our competitors\u2019 products;\n\u2022\nmanagement of customer expectations concerning product capabilities and product life cycles;\n\u2022\nability to attract and retain technical talent; and\n\u2022\ninnovation that does not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties.\nIf our suppliers do not meet product or delivery requirements, we could have reduced revenues and earnings.\nCertain components, including semiconductor chips, may be in short supply from time to time because of high industry demand or the inability of some vendors to consistently meet our quality or delivery requirements. Approximately 25% of material purchases require some custom work where having multiple suppliers would be cost prohibitive. If any of our suppliers were to cancel contracts or commitments or fail to meet the quality or delivery requirements needed to satisfy customer orders for our products, we could lose time-sensitive customer orders, have significantly decreased revenues and earnings and be subject to contractual penalties, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we rely on contract manufacturers for certain subsystems used in our products, and our ability to meet customer orders for those products depends upon the timeliness and quality of the work performed by these subcontractors, over whom we do not exercise any control.\nTo a certain extent, we are dependent upon the ability of our suppliers and contractors to help meet increased product or delivery requirements. It may be difficult for certain suppliers to meet delivery requirements in a period of rapid growth, therefore impacting our ability to meet our customers\u2019 demands.\nWe rely on the financial strength of our suppliers. There can be no assurance that the loss of suppliers either as a result of financial viability, bankruptcy or otherwise will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nOur operations may be adversely impacted if our outsourced contract manufacturers or service providers fail to perform.\nWe depend on Flextronics International Ltd. (\u201cFlextronics\u201d) to manufacture and test our FLEX and J750 family of products from its facility in China and on other contract manufacturers to manufacture other products. If for any reason these contract manufacturers cannot provide us with these products in a timely fashion, or at all, we may not be able to sell these products to our customers until we enter a similar arrangement with an alternative contract manufacturer. If we experience a problem with our supply of products from Flextronics or our other contract manufacturers, it may take us significant time to either manufacture the product or find an alternate contract manufacturer, which could result in substantial expense and disruption to our business.\nWe have also outsourced a number of our general and administrative functions, including information technology, to reputable service providers, many of which are in foreign countries, sometimes impacting communication with them because of language and time differences. Their presence in foreign countries also increases the risk they could be exposed to political risk. Additionally, there may be difficulties encountered in coordinating the outsourced operations with existing functions and operations. If we fail in successfully coordinating and managing the outsourced service providers, it may cause an adverse effect on our operations which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe may not fully realize the benefits of our acquisitions or strategic alliances.\nWe may acquire businesses, form strategic alliances or create joint ventures with third parties that we believe will complement or augment our existing businesses. We may not be able to realize the expected synergies and cost savings from the integration with our existing operations of other businesses or technologies that we may acquire. In addition, the integration process for our acquisitions may be complex, costly and time consuming and include unanticipated issues, expenses and liabilities. We may have difficulty in developing, manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a manner that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or product lines and allows us to realize value from expected synergies. Following an acquisition, we may not achieve the revenues or net income levels that justify the acquisition. Acquisitions may also result in one-time charges (such as acquisition-related expenses, write-offs or restructuring charges) or in the future, impairment of goodwill, that adversely affect our operating results. Additionally, we may fund acquisitions of new businesses, strategic alliances or joint ventures by utilizing our cash, raising debt, issuing shares of our common stock, or by other means.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2014, we performed our annual goodwill impairment test and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $98.9 million in our Wireless Test segment as a result of decreased projected demand attributable to an estimated smaller future wireless test market due to reuse of wireless test equipment, price competition and different testing techniques. Further reductions in the size of the wireless test market may occur, which may result in additional goodwill impairment charges, increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories, asset write-offs and restructuring charges.\nWe may incur significant liabilities if we fail to comply with environmental regulations.\nWe are subject to both domestic and international environmental regulations and statutory strict liability relating to the use, storage, discharge, site cleanup and disposal of hazardous chemicals used in our\nmanufacturing processes. If we fail to comply with present and future regulations, or are required to perform site remediation, we could be subject to future liabilities or cost, including penalties or the suspension of production. Present and future regulations may also:\n\u2022\nrestrict our ability to expand facilities;\n\u2022\nrestrict our ability to ship certain products;\n\u2022\nrequire us to modify our operations logistics;\n\u2022\nrequire us to acquire costly equipment; or\n\u2022\nrequire us to incur other significant costs and expenses.\nPursuant to present regulations and agreements, we are conducting groundwater and subsurface assessment and monitoring and are implementing remediation and corrective action plans for facilities located in Massachusetts and New Hampshire which are no longer conducting manufacturing operations. As of December 31, 2014, we have not incurred material costs as result of the monitoring and remediation steps taken at the Massachusetts and New Hampshire sites.\nOn January 27, 2003, the European Union adopted the following directives: (i) the directive on the Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (the \u201cRoHS Directive\u201d); and (ii) the directive on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (the \u201cWEEE Directive\u201d). The WEEE Directive became effective August 13, 2005 and the RoHS Directive became effective on July 6, 2006. Both the RoHS Directive and the WEEE Directive alter the form and manner in which electronic equipment is imported, sold and handled in the European Union. Other jurisdictions, such as China, have followed the European Union\u2019s lead in enacting legislation with respect to hazardous substances and waste removal. Ensuring compliance with the RoHS Directive, the WEEE Directive and similar legislation in other jurisdictions, and integrating compliance activities with our suppliers and customers could result in additional costs and disruption to operations and logistics and thus, could have a negative impact on our business, operations or financial condition.\nWe currently are, and in the future may be, subject to litigation or regulatory proceedings that could have an adverse effect on our business.\nFrom time to time, we may be subject to litigation or other administrative, regulatory or governmental proceedings, including tax audits and resulting claims that could require significant management time and resources and cause us to incur expenses and, in the event of an adverse decision, pay damages or incur costs in an amount that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.\nThird parties may claim we are infringing their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation costs, licensing expenses or be prevented from selling our products.\nWe have been sued for patent infringement in the past and receive notifications from time to time that we may be in violation of patents held by others. An assertion of patent infringement against us, if successful, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell our products or it could force us to seek a license to the intellectual property rights of others or alter such products so that they no longer infringe the intellectual property rights of others. A license could be very expensive to obtain or may not be available at all. Similarly, changing our products or processes to avoid infringing the rights of others may be costly or impractical. Additionally, patent litigation could require a significant use of management resources and involve a lengthy and expensive defense, even if we eventually prevail. If we do not prevail, we might be forced to pay significant damages, obtain licenses, modify our products, or stop making our products; each of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating results or cash flows.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property (\u201cIP\u201d), we may lose a valuable asset or may incur costly litigation to protect our rights.\nWe protect the technology that is incorporated in our products in several ways, including through patent, copyright, and trade secret protection and by contractual agreement. However, even with these protections, our IP may still be challenged, invalidated or subject to other infringement actions. While we believe that our IP has value in the aggregate, no single element of our IP is in itself essential. If a significant portion of our IP is invalidated or ineffective, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nWe may incur higher tax rates than we expect and may have exposure to additional international tax liabilities and costs.\nWe are subject to paying income taxes in the United States and various other countries where we operate. Our effective tax rate is dependent on where our earnings are generated and the tax regulations and the interpretation and judgment of administrative tax or revenue entities in the United States and other countries. We have pursued a global tax strategy which could adversely be affected by the mix of earnings and tax rates in the countries where we operate, changes to tax laws or an adverse tax ruling by administrative entities. We are also subject to tax audits in the countries where we operate. Any material assessment resulting from an audit from an administrative tax or revenue entity could also negatively affect our financial results.\nAs a multinational corporation, we are subject to income taxes as well as non-income based taxes, in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. In certain foreign jurisdictions, we qualify for tax incentives and tax holidays based on our ability to meet, on a continuing basis, various tests relating to our employment levels, research and development expenditures and other qualification requirements in a particular foreign jurisdiction. While we intend to operate in such a manner to maintain and maximize our tax incentives, no assurance can be given that we have so qualified or that we will so qualify for any particular year or jurisdiction. If we fail to qualify and to remain qualified for certain foreign tax incentives and tax holidays, we may be subject to further taxation or an increase in our effective tax rate which would adversely impact our financial results. In Singapore, we operate under a tax holiday which is effective through December 31, 2015. The tax savings attributable to the Singapore tax holiday for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 were $13.2 million or $0.06 per diluted share, $4.7 million or $0.02 per diluted share and $10.9 million or $0.05 per diluted share, respectively. We are in discussions with the Singapore Economic Development Board with respect to extension of the tax holiday for periods after December 31, 2015. No assurances can be given that such discussions will be successful. If we are unable to reach an agreement with the Singapore Economic Development Board, our results of operations and financial condition for periods after December 31, 2015 will be adversely affected.\nIn addition, we may incur additional costs, including headcount expenses, in order to obtain or maintain a foreign tax incentive in a particular foreign jurisdiction.\nWe have significant guarantees, indemnification and customer confidentiality obligations.\nFrom time to time, we make guarantees to customers regarding the delivery, price and performance of our products and guarantee certain indebtedness, performance obligations or lease commitments of our subsidiary and affiliate companies. We also have agreed to provide indemnification to our officers, directors, employees and agents, to the extent permitted by law, arising from certain events or occurrences while the officer, director, employee or agent, is or was serving at our request in such capacity. Additionally, we have confidentiality obligations to certain customers and if breached would require the payment of significant penalties. If we become liable under any of these obligations, it could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. For additional information see Note J: \u201cCommitments and Contingencies-Guarantees and Indemnification Obligations\u201d in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe may discontinue or reduce our quarterly cash dividend or share repurchase program.\nIn January 2014, our Board of Directors initiated a quarterly dividend of $0.06 per share. In January 2015, our Board of Directors authorized Teradyne to repurchase up to $500 million of common stock, $300 million of which we intend to repurchase in 2015. Holders of our common stock are only entitled to receive dividends when and if they are declared by our Board of Directors. Future cash dividends and share repurchases are subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend, among other things, upon our earnings, capital requirements and financial condition. While we have declared a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock and authorized a share repurchase program, we are not required to do either and may reduce or eliminate our cash dividend or share repurchase program in the future. The reduction or elimination of our cash dividend or our share repurchase program could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur business may suffer if we are unable to attract and retain key employees.\nCompetition for employees with skills we require is intense in the high technology industry. Our success will depend on our ability to attract and retain key technical employees. The loss of one or more key or other employees, a decrease in our ability to attract additional qualified employees, or the delay in hiring key personnel could each have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nNew regulations related to conflict minerals may adversely affect us.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act imposes new disclosure requirements regarding the use of \u201cconflict\u201d minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries in our products, whether or not these products are manufactured by third parties. This requirement could affect the pricing, sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of components we use in our products. In addition, there are additional costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements, such as costs related to determining the source of any conflict minerals used in our products. Our supply chain is complex and we may be unable to verify the origins for all minerals used in our products. As a result, we may be unable to certify that our products are conflict free.\nOur operations, and the operations of our customers and suppliers, are subject to risks of natural catastrophic events, widespread health epidemics, acts of war, terrorist attacks and the threat of domestic and international terrorist attacks, any one of which could result in cancellation of orders, delays in deliveries or other business activities, or loss of customers and could negatively affect our business and results of operations.\nOur business is international in nature, with our sales, service and administrative personnel and our customers and suppliers located in numerous countries throughout the world. Our operations, and those of our customers and suppliers, are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons, including work stoppages, acts of war, terrorism, health epidemics, fires, earthquakes, hurricanes, volcanic eruptions, energy shortages, telecommunication failures, tsunamis, flooding or other natural disasters. Such disruption could materially increase our costs and expenses as well as cause delays in, among other things, shipments of products to our customers, our ability to perform services requested by our customers, or the installation and acceptance of our products at customer sites. Any of these conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions or results of operations.\nA breach of our operational or security systems could negatively affect our business and results of operations.\nWe rely on various information technology networks and systems, some of which are managed by third parties, to process, transmit and store electronic information, including confidential data, and to carry out and support a variety of business activities, including manufacturing, research and development, supply chain management, sales and accounting. A failure in or a breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of our suppliers and other service providers, including as a result of cyber attacks, could disrupt our business, result in the disclosure or misuse of proprietary or confidential information, damage our reputation, cause losses and increase our costs.\nWe may face risks associated with shareholder activism.\nPublicly traded companies have increasingly become subject to campaigns by shareholders advocating corporate actions such as financial restructuring, increased borrowing, special dividends, stock repurchases or divestitures. We may become subject in the future to such shareholder activity and demands. Such activities could interfere with our ability to execute our business plans, be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations, divert the attention of management or result in our initiating borrowing or increasing our share repurchase plan or dividend, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business or stock price.\nProvisions of our charter and by-laws and Massachusetts law make a takeover of Teradyne more difficult.\nThere are provisions in our basic corporate documents and under Massachusetts law that could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control, even if a change in control may be regarded as beneficial to some or all of our stockholders.", "PERMNO": 51369, "SIC": 3825, "TIC": "TER"}
