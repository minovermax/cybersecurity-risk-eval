{"cik": "706688", "company": "AARON'S INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-20", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe Company\u2019s business is subject to certain risks and uncertainties. Any of the following risk factors could cause our actual results to differ materially from historical or anticipated results. These risks and uncertainties are not the only ones we face, but represent the risks that we believe are material. However, there may be additional risks that we currently consider not to be material or of which we are not currently aware, and any of these risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from historical or anticipated results.\nFederal and state regulatory authorities are increasingly focused on our industry, and in addition to being subject to various existing federal and state laws and regulations, we may be subject to new or additional federal and state laws and regulations (or changes in interpretations of existing laws and regulations) that could expose us to government investigations, significant additional costs or compliance-related burdens that could force us to change our business practices in a manner that may be materially adverse to our operations, prospects or financial condition.\nAs indicated by Progressive Leasing\u2019s proposed settlement with the FTC that we announced on February 20, 2020, federal regulatory authorities such as the FTC are increasingly focused on the subprime financial marketplace in which the lease-to-own industry operates, and any of these federal agencies, as well as state regulatory authorities, may propose and adopt new regulations (or interpret existing regulations) that could result in significant adverse changes in the regulatory landscape for businesses such as ours. In addition, we believe, with increasing frequency, federal and state regulators are holding businesses like ours to higher standards of monitoring, disclosure and reporting, regardless of whether new laws or regulations governing our industry have been adopted. Regulators and courts may apply laws or regulations to our businesses in incorrect, inconsistent or unpredictable ways that may make compliance more difficult, expensive and uncertain. This increased attention at the federal and state levels, as well as the potential for scrutiny by certain municipal governments, could increase our compliance costs significantly and materially and adversely impact the manner in which we operate.\nNearly every state, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and most provinces in Canada specifically regulate lease-to-own transactions. This includes states in which our Progressive Leasing business has retail partners as well as ones in which we currently operate our Aaron\u2019s Business stores. Furthermore, certain aspects of our business, such as the content of our advertising and other disclosures to customers about our lease-to-own transactions; and our collection practices (as well as those of third parties), the manner in which we contact our customers, our decisioning process regarding whether to lease merchandise to customers, our credit reporting practices, and the manner in which we process and store certain customer, employee and other information are subject to federal and state laws and regulatory oversight. For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the \u201cCCPA\u201d), which became effective on January 1, 2020, has changed the manner in which our transactions with California residents are regulated with respect to the manner in which we collect, store and use consumer data, which will result in increased regulatory oversight and litigation risks and increase our compliance-related costs in California. Moreover, other states may adopt privacy-related laws whose restrictions and requirements differ from those of the CCPA, requiring us to design, implement and maintain different types of state-based, privacy-related compliance controls and programs simultaneously in multiple states, thereby further increasing the complexity and cost of compliance.\nMany of these laws and regulations are evolving, unclear and inconsistent across various jurisdictions, and complying with them is difficult, expensive and uncertain. Furthermore, legislative or regulatory proposals regarding our industry, or interpretations of them, may subject our Company to \"headline risks\" that could negatively impact our business in a particular market or in general and, therefore, may adversely affect our share price. For example, in early February 2020, news reports in California raised concerns that California\u2019s governor is proposing \u201cnew rent-to-own oversight\u201d rules for the state. Investors worried that this implied a new, lower cap on the fees rent-to-own companies, like us, would be able to charge in the future, which resulted in significant stock price volatility in our shares.\nWe have incurred and will continue to incur substantial costs to comply with federal and state laws and regulations. In addition to compliance costs, we may continue to incur substantial expenses to respond to federal and state government investigations and enforcement actions, proposed fines and penalties, criminal or civil sanctions, and private litigation, including those arising out of our or our franchisees\u2019 alleged violations of existing laws and/or regulations.\nFurther, certain political candidates for various offices have from time-to-time indicated a desire to increase the level of regulation and regulatory scrutiny applicable to lease-to-own and similar subprime financial services providers. If elected, these candidates may propose new laws and regulations (or appoint individuals who could reinterpret existing regulations) that, if adopted, would adversely impact our current operations and the regulatory landscape for businesses such as ours. Our manufacturing and distribution functions are also subject to various federal, state and municipal laws and regulations, including those regarding environmental, health and safety and transportation. Failure by us to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines, penalties or limitations on our ability to conduct our business, or federal, state or municipal actions, or private litigation, any of which could significantly harm our reputation, both with consumers as well as with Progressive Leasing\u2019s and Vive\u2019s retail and merchant partners, which could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects and financial condition.\nAdditionally, as we execute on our strategic plans, we may continue to expand into complementary businesses, such as Vive, that engage in financial, banking or lending services, or rent-to-own or rent-to-rent transactions involving products that we do not currently offer our customers, all of which may be subject to a variety of statutes and regulatory requirements in addition to those regulations currently applicable to our legacy operations, which may impose significant costs, limitations or prohibitions on the manner in which we currently conduct our businesses as well as those we may acquire in the future. Our aarons.com e-commerce business may also be subject to laws and regulatory requirements in addition to those that apply to our legacy store-based operations, and/or existing laws and regulations may apply to our e-commerce business in ways that are different from their application to our legacy store-based operations.\nThe effects on our business of our announcement of Progressive Leasing\u2019s proposed settlement with the FTC are not certain; it may have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, and financial results, as could our failure to comply with the settlement.\nWe announced on February 20, 2020, that Progressive Leasing had reached a proposed settlement with the staff of the FTC to resolve the Civil Investigative Demand that Progressive Leasing received from the FTC in July 2018, regarding whether Progressive Leasing's disclosures to customers violated the FTC Act. Under the proposed agreement, which remains subject to the approval of the FTC Commissioners and the United States District Court for the Northern District of Georgia, Progressive Leasing would make a payment of $175 million to the FTC and enhance certain compliance-related activities, including monitoring, disclosure and reporting requirements.\nOur announcement about the proposed settlement may lead to unfavorable media coverage and other negative publicity, Progressive Leasing\u2019s existing retail partners reducing or terminating their relationships with Progressive Leasing, and prospective retail partners refusing to do business with Progressive Leasing. It also creates risks that third-parties may bring actions against Progressive Leasing, whether in the form of state or other federal regulatory investigations or proceedings, or private litigation, any of which could lead to substantial legal fees and costs for extended periods of time, monetary settlements, fines, penalties or injunctions, and distraction to our management team. The loss of retail partners and/or the incurrence of substantial costs to respond to third-party actions and investigations could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAssuming the proposed settlement agreement with the FTC is finalized, compliance with it will require the cooperation of Progressive Leasing\u2019s retail partners, over whom we do not have the same level of influence or control as we have over our own business, including, for example, with respect to advertising and explaining lease transactions to consumers. In the event Progressive Leasing is found to be in violation of the terms of the FTC settlement, the FTC could, among other things, initiate further enforcement actions, seek an injunction or other restrictive orders and impose civil monetary penalties against Progressive Leasing and its officers, which could harm Progressive Leasing\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nProgressive Leasing's virtual lease-to-own business, as well as our e-commerce-based business, differs in some potentially significant respects from the risks of the traditional store-based Aaron's Business lease-to-own business. The risks could have a material negative effect on Progressive Leasing, which could result in a material adverse effect on our entire business.\nOur Progressive Leasing segment offers its lease-to-own solution through the stores of third-party retailers, which we have historically referred to as \u201cretail partners\u201d. Progressive Leasing consequently faces some different risks than are associated with our traditional store-based sales and lease ownership concept, which our Aaron\u2019s Business segment and its franchisees offer through their own stores. These potential risks include, among others:\n\u2022\nProgressive Leasing\u2019s reliance on third-party retailers (over whom Progressive Leasing cannot exercise the degree of control and oversight that the Aaron\u2019s Business and its franchisees can assert over their own respective employees) for many important business functions, from advertising through assistance with lease transaction applications, including, for example, explaining the nature of the lease-to-own transaction when asked to do so by the customer, and that the transaction is with Progressive Leasing and not with its retail partner;\n\u2022\nthe potential that, notwithstanding Progressive Leasing\u2019s proposed settlement with the FTC, the FTC and additional federal regulators, such as the CFPB, may continue to target (and state regulators may begin to target and certain municipal governments may begin to scrutinize) the virtual lease-to-own transaction and/or adopt new regulations or legislation (or existing laws and regulations, including those that were adopted before the virtual lease-to-own transaction became available, or that otherwise were never intended to apply to the virtual lease-to-own transaction, may be interpreted in a manner) that negatively impact Progressive Leasing\u2019s ability to offer virtual lease-to-own programs through its retail partners, and/or that regulators and/or courts may attempt to force the application of laws and regulations on Progressive Leasing\u2019s virtual lease-to-own business in inconsistent and unpredictable ways that could increase the compliance-related costs incurred by Progressive Leasing, and negatively impact Progressive Leasing\u2019s financial and operational performance;\n\u2022\nindemnification obligations to Progressive Leasing\u2019s retail partners and their service providers for losses stemming from, among other matters, Progressive Leasing\u2019s violation of federal, state or local laws or regulations or failure to take the appropriate steps to protect its retail partners\u2019 and their customers\u2019 data and information from being accessed or stolen by unauthorized third parties through cyber-attacks or \u201chacking\u201d or similar occurrences;\n\u2022\nreliance on automatic bank account drafts for lease payments, which may become disfavored as a payment method for these transactions by regulators and/or providers, or may otherwise become unavailable; and\n\u2022\nan increase in the risk of occurrences of consumer fraud with respect to Progressive Leasing\u2019s virtual lease-to-own business and the e-commerce business (and also with the e-commerce business of our Aaron\u2019s Business), as compared to our traditional store-based business.\nThese risks could have a material negative effect on Progressive Leasing, which could result in a material adverse effect on our entire business.\nProgressive Leasing\u2019s loss of operating revenues from key retail partners could materially and adversely affect our business.\nProgressive Leasing\u2019s relationship with its largest retail partners will have a significant impact on our operating revenues in future periods. The loss of any key retailers would have a material adverse effect on our business and could be caused by factors beyond our control, such as by any negative publicity or public scrutiny associated with our announcement on February 20, 2020 of Progressive Leasing\u2019s proposed settlement with the FTC. For example, during 2019, three retail partners each individually provided greater than 10% of the lease merchandise acquired by Progressive Leasing and subsequently leased to customers, and the top ten retail partners provided approximately 68% of that merchandise. In addition, the customers that Progressive Leasing obtained through its relationship with one of its retail partners, Big Lots Stores, Inc., accounted for 12% of our consolidated revenues for our 2019 fiscal year. Any extended discontinuance of Progressive Leasing\u2019s relationship with any of those retail partners or other high visibility retailers could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations. In addition, in the event that Progressive Leasing enters into new or amended business or contractual terms or conditions with any of its largest retail partners that are less favorable to Progressive Leasing than its current arrangements with those retail partners, including with respect to the prices Progressive Leasing pays those retail partners for merchandise that Progressive Leasing leases to its customers, our business could be materially and adversely effected.\nAny publicity associated with the loss of any of Progressive Leasing\u2019s large retail partners could harm our reputation, making it more difficult to attract and retain consumers and other retail partners, and could lessen Progressive Leasing\u2019s negotiating power with its remaining and prospective retail partners. Our operating revenues and operating results could also suffer if any of Progressive Leasing\u2019s retail partners experiences a significant decline in sales for any reason.\nMany of Progressive Leasing\u2019s contracts with its retail partners can be terminated by them on relatively short notice, and all can be terminated in limited circumstances, such as our material breach or insolvency, and certain changes in control of Progressive Leasing. There can be no assurance that Progressive Leasing will be able to continue its relationships with its largest retail partners on the same or more favorable terms in future periods or that its relationships will continue beyond the terms of our existing contracts with them. Our operating revenues and operating results could suffer if, among other things, any of Progressive Leasing\u2019s retail partners renegotiates, terminates or fails to renew, or fails to renew on similar or favorable terms, their agreements with Progressive Leasing or otherwise chooses to modify the level of support they provide for Progressive Leasing\u2019s lease-purchase option.\nWe continue to implement an aggressive strategic plan within the Aaron\u2019s Business and there is no guarantee that it will be successful.\nOur strategic plan for the Aaron\u2019s Business includes a number of key initiatives to improve profitability, including centralizing key processes, rationalizing and repositioning real estate, and enhancing our e-commerce platform. For example, with respect to centralizing key processes, we expect to implement a centralized customer lease decisioning process for all of our Company-owned Aaron\u2019s stores before the end of 2020. We may not be successful in executing the systems, procedural and operational changes necessary to implement the centralized decisioning initiative, and it is possible that centralized customer lease decisioning will not be as effective or accurate as the decentralized, store-based decisioning process we historically used in our Aaron\u2019s Business. Regarding our real estate strategy, the buildout of our next generation stores includes geographically repositioning a significant number of our store locations into larger buildings and/or into different geographic locations that we believe will be more advantageous. We expect to incur significant capital costs, including build-out costs for these next generation stores and exit costs from the termination of current leases and sale of current properties. There can be no assurance that the real estate component of our strategy will be successful. For example, we may not be successful in transitioning the customers of the Company-operated Aaron\u2019s stores that are closed or repositioned to other Company-operated stores that remain open or to new next generation store locations, and thus, could experience a reduction in revenue and profits associated with such a loss of customers. Our e-commerce platform also is a significant component of our strategic plan for the Aaron\u2019s Business and we believe it will drive future growth of this segment. However, to promote our products and services and allow customers to transact online and reach new customers, we must effectively maintain, improve and grow our e-commerce platform. Many of the traditional, virtual and \u201cbig-box\u201d retailers and other companies with whom we compete have more robust e-commerce platforms than ours, and have more resources to dedicate to improving and growing their e-commerce platforms. There can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively compete against those companies\u2019 e-commerce platforms, or maintain, improve or grow our e-commerce platform in a profitable manner.\nThere can be no guarantee that our current strategy for the Aaron\u2019s Business, and our current or future business improvement initiatives related thereto, will yield the results we currently anticipate (or results that will exceed those that might be obtained under prior or other strategies). We may fail to successfully execute on one or more elements of our current strategy, even if we successfully implement one or more other components. In addition, the estimated costs and charges associated with these initiatives may vary materially and adversely based upon various factors.\nIf we cannot address these challenges successfully, or overcome other critical obstacles that may emerge as we continue to pursue our current strategy, we may not be able to achieve our profitability goals at the rates we currently contemplate, if at all.\nOur Aaron\u2019s Business faces many challenges which could materially and adversely affect our overall results of operations, including the commoditization of certain product categories; increasing competition from a growing variety of sources; a decentralized, high-fixed-cost operating model; adverse consequences to our supply chain function from decreased procurement volumes; increasing costs for labor and transportation; and lower lease volumes on important categories such as consumer electronics.\nOur Aaron\u2019s Business currently faces and may face new challenges relating to the commoditization of certain product categories. For example, due to an increasing supply of consumer electronics, and retail strategies that include implementing frequent price-lowering sales and using certain consumer electronics as \u201closs leaders\u201d to increase customer traffic in stores, there is significant price-based competition or \u201ccommoditization\u201d of consumer electronics, particularly for televisions. We do not expect the commoditization of the consumer electronics category to subside and it may expand to other product categories with increasing frequency in the future, including appliances and furniture. Our Aaron\u2019s Business also faces competition from a growing variety of sources, including traditional and on-line rent-to-own and rent-to-rent companies, traditional and \u201cbig-box\u201d retailers, the continued expansion of digital retail, which includes a wide array of e-commerce retailers that have established far larger digital operations than our Aarons.com e-commerce platform has been able to achieve to date, traditional and on-line providers of used goods, and indirectly from financing companies, such as pay-day and title loan companies, who provide customers with loans that enable them to shop at traditional retailers. This increasing competition from these sources may reduce the market share held by our Aaron\u2019s Business as well as its operating margins, and may materially and adversely affect our overall results of operations. Many of the competitors discussed above have more advanced and modern e-commerce, logistics and other technology applications and systems that offer them a competitive advantage in attracting and retaining customers for whom our Aaron\u2019s Business competes, especially with respect to younger customers. In addition, those competitors may offer a larger selection of products and more competitive prices than our Aaron\u2019s Business.\nWe believe the significant increase in the amount and type of competition, as discussed above, may result in those customers of our Aaron\u2019s Business curtailing entering into sales and lease ownership agreements for the types of merchandise we offer, or entering into agreements that generate less revenue for us, resulting in lower same store sales, revenue and profits. For example, our Company-operated stores experienced flat same store revenue in fiscal year 2019 and a decline of 1.5% in 2018. We calculate same store revenue growth by comparing revenues for comparable periods for stores open during the entirety of those periods. A number of factors have historically affected our same store revenues for our Aaron's Business, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in competition;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions;\n\u2022\neconomic challenges faced by our customer base;\n\u2022\nnew product introductions;\n\u2022\nconsumer trends;\n\u2022\nchanges in our merchandise mix;\n\u2022\ntiming of promotional events; and\n\u2022\nour ability to execute our business strategy effectively.\nOur Aaron\u2019s Business has a decentralized, high fixed cost operating model due to, among other factors, our significant manufacturing operations, our fulfillment centers and related logistics functions, the costs associated with our last-mile delivery, and decentralized store-based decisioning, selling and collections functions. That model may result in negative operating leverage in a declining revenue environment, as we may not be able to reduce or \u201cdeleverage\u201d those fixed costs in proportion to any reduction in the revenues of our Aaron\u2019s Business, if at all, and our failure to do so may adversely affect our overall results of operations.\nIn addition, our supply chain function and financial performance may suffer adverse consequences related to the decreases we have experienced, and may continue to experience, in the volume of merchandise we purchase from third party suppliers, due to, among other factors, our closures of Company-operated Aaron\u2019s stores, declining sales of merchandise to franchisees, and lower lease volumes. Those consequences may include, for example, smaller discounts from our vendors, or the elimination of discount programs previously offered to us, which may have an adverse impact on our results of operations. Declining merchandise purchase volumes have caused us to rationalize and consolidate, and may result in us further rationalizing and consolidating, vendors for certain product categories, and we may not effectively implement those vendor consolidation initiatives, which could lead to disruptions to our supply chain, including delivery delays or unavailability of certain types of merchandise for our Company-operated stores and our franchisees\u2019 stores.\nOur Aaron\u2019s Business has experienced and may continue to experience increases in the costs it incurs to purchase certain merchandise that it offers to sale or lease to its customers, due to tariffs, increases in prices for certain commodities and increases in the costs of shipping the merchandise to its distribution centers and store locations. At the same time, it has experienced and may continue to experience significant increases in labor costs, including due to wage inflation for hourly employees in many regions, and increasing competition to recruit and retain both professional and hourly employees as a result of relatively low unemployment rates. The Aaron\u2019s Business has limited or no control over many of these inflationary forces on its costs. In addition, it may not be able to recover all or even a portion of such cost increases by increasing its merchandise prices, fees, or otherwise, and even if it is able to increase merchandise prices or fees, those cost increases to its customers could result in the customers curtailing entering into sales and lease ownership agreements for the types of merchandise we offer, or entering into agreements that generate less revenue for us, resulting in lower same store sales, revenue and profits.\nIf our Aaron\u2019s Business is unable to successfully address these challenges, its goodwill may become impaired, and our overall business and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected as well.\nThe transactions offered to consumers by our businesses may be negatively characterized by consumer advocacy groups, the media and certain federal, state and local government officials, and if those negative characterizations become increasingly accepted by consumers and/or Progressive Leasing\u2019s or Vive\u2019s retail and merchant partners, demand for our goods and the transactions we offer could decrease and our business could be materially adversely affected.\nCertain consumer advocacy groups, media reports, federal and state regulators, and certain candidates for political offices have asserted that laws and regulations should be broader and more restrictive regarding lease-to-own transactions. The consumer advocacy groups and media reports generally focus on the total cost to a consumer to acquire an item, which is often alleged to be higher than the interest typically charged by banks or similar lending institutions to consumers with better credit histories. This \u201ccost-of-rental\u201d amount, which is generally defined as lease fees paid in excess of the \u201cretail\u201d price of the goods, is from time to time characterized by consumer advocacy groups and media reports as predatory or abusive without discussing benefits associated with our lease-to-own programs or the lack of viable alternatives for our customers\u2019 needs. Although we strongly disagree with these characterizations, if the negative characterization of these types of lease-to-own transactions becomes increasingly accepted by consumers or Progressive Leasing\u2019s or Vive\u2019s retail and merchant partners, demand for our products and services could significantly decrease, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, if the negative characterization of these types of transactions is accepted by regulators and legislators, or if political candidates who have a negative view of the lease-to-own industry are ultimately elected, we could become subject to more restrictive laws and regulations and more stringent enforcement of existing laws and regulations, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. The vast expansion and reach of technology, including social media platforms, has increased the risk that our reputation could be significantly impacted by these negative characterizations in a relatively short amount of time. If we are unable to quickly and effectively respond to such characterizations, we may experience declines in customer loyalty and traffic and our relationships with our retail partners may suffer, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, any failure by our competitors, including smaller, regional competitors, for example, to comply with the laws and regulations applicable to the traditional and/or virtual lease-to-own models, or any actions by those competitors that are challenged by consumers, advocacy groups, the media or governmental agencies or entities as being abusive or predatory could result in our Aaron\u2019s Business and/or Progressive Leasing being mischaracterized, by implication, as engaging in similar unlawful or inappropriate activities or business practices, merely because we operate in the same general industries as such competitors.\nFrom time to time we are subject to regulatory and legal proceedings which seek material damages or seek to place significant restrictions on our business operations. These proceedings may be negatively perceived by the public and by Progressive Leasing\u2019s existing and prospective retail partners, and materially and adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to legal and regulatory proceedings from time to time which may result in material damages or place significant restrictions on our business operations. We cannot assure you that we will not incur material damages or penalties in a lawsuit or other proceeding in the future and/or significant defense costs related to such lawsuits or regulatory proceedings. For example, we operate a fleet of approximately 80 long haul trucks and 1,600 delivery trucks and, in addition to the significant compliance-related costs associated with operating such a fleet, we may incur significant adverse judgments, damages and penalties related to accidents that those trucks may be involved in from time to time. Significant adverse judgments, penalties, settlement amounts, amounts needed to post a bond pending an appeal or defense costs could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources. It is also possible that, as a result of a present or future governmental or other proceeding or settlement, significant restrictions will be placed upon, or significant changes made to, our business practices, operations or methods, including pricing or similar terms. Any such restrictions or changes may adversely affect our profitability or increase our compliance costs.\nWe are currently subject to settlements with the FTC that we entered into in 2013, as well as the State of California and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania regarding our business practices and compliance with privacy laws in those states. Those settlements prohibit us from engaging in certain business practices that many of our competitors continue to engage in, and that our competitors have not been prohibited from engaging in, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage. If we violate the terms of those settlements, we may be subject to additional proceedings, further restrictions on our business, or civil or other penalties.\nCertain judicial or regulatory decisions may restrict or eliminate the enforceability of certain types of contractual provisions designed to limit costly litigation, including class actions, as a dispute resolution method.\nTo attempt to limit costly and lengthy consumer, employee and other litigation, including class actions, the Company requires its customers and employees to sign arbitration agreements and class action waivers, many of which offer opt-out provisions. Recent judicial and regulatory actions have attempted to restrict or eliminate the enforceability of such agreements and waivers. If the Company is not permitted to use arbitration agreements and/or class action waivers, or if the enforceability of such agreements and waivers is restricted or eliminated, the Company could incur increased costs to resolve legal actions brought by customers, employees and others, as it would be forced to participate in more expensive and lengthy dispute resolution processes.\nOur competitors could impede our ability to attract new customers, or cause current customers to cease doing business with us.\nThe industries in which we operate are highly competitive and highly fluid, particularly in light of the sweeping new regulatory environment we are witnessing from regulators such as the FTC, among others, as discussed above.\nThe competitors of our Aaron\u2019s Business include national, regional and local operators of lease-to-own stores, virtual lease-to-own companies, traditional and on-line providers of used goods and merchandise, traditional, \u201cbig-box\u201d and e-commerce retailers (including many retailers who offer layaway programs) and various types of consumer finance companies, including installment, payday and title loan companies, that may enable our customers to shop at traditional or on-line retailers, as well as rental stores that do not offer their customers a purchase option. Our Progressive Leasing segment also faces competition from other virtual lease-to-own companies, traditional store-based lease to own companies and consumer finance companies, including installment, payday and title loan companies, that may enable Progressive Leasing\u2019s customers to shop at traditional or on-line retailers. Our competitors in the traditional and virtual sales and lease ownership and traditional retail markets may have significantly greater financial and operating resources and greater name recognition in certain markets. Greater financial resources may allow our competitors to grow faster than us, including through acquisitions. This in turn may enable them to enter new markets before we can, which may decrease our opportunities in those markets. Greater name recognition, or better public perception of a competitor\u2019s reputation, may help them divert market share away from us, even in our established markets. Some competitors may be willing to offer competing products on an unprofitable basis in an effort to gain market share, which could compel us to match their pricing strategy or lose business. In addition, some competitors of Progressive Leasing may be willing to lease certain types of products that Progressive Leasing will not agree to lease, enter into customer leases that have services, as opposed to goods, as a significant portion of the lease value, or engage in other practices related to pricing, compliance, and other areas that Progressive Leasing will not, in an effort to gain market share at Progressive Leasing\u2019s expense. Our Progressive Leasing business relies heavily on relationships with retail partners. An increase in competition could cause our retail partners to no longer offer the Progressive Leasing product in favor of our competitors, or to offer the Progressive Leasing product and the products of its competitors simultaneously at the same store locations, which could slow growth in the Progressive Leasing business and limit or reduce profitability. Furthermore, Progressive Leasing\u2019s virtual lease to own competitors may deploy different business models, such as direct-to-consumer strategies, that forego reliance on retail partner relationships that may prove to be more successful.\nIf we do not maintain the privacy and security of customer, retail partner, employee or other confidential information, due to cybersecurity-related \u201chacking\u201d attacks, intrusions into our systems by unauthorized parties or otherwise, we could incur significant costs, litigation, regulatory enforcement actions and damage to our reputation, any one of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur business involves the collection, processing, transmission and storage of customers\u2019 personal and confidential information, including social security numbers, dates of birth, banking information, credit and debit card information, data we receive from consumer reporting companies, including credit report information, as well as confidential information about our retail partners and employees, among others. Much of this data constitutes confidential personally identifiable information (\u201cPII\u201d) which, if unlawfully accessed, either through a \u201chacking\u201d attack or otherwise, could subject us to significant liabilities as further discussed below. We also serve as an information technology provider to our franchisees, including by storing and processing PII relating to their customers and potential customers.\nCompanies like us that possess significant amounts of PII and/or other confidential information have experienced a significant increase in cyber security risks in recent years from increasingly aggressive and sophisticated cyberattacks, including hacking, computer viruses, malicious or destructive code, ransomware, social engineering attacks (including phishing and impersonation), denial-of-service attacks and other attacks and similar disruptions from the unauthorized use of or access to information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) systems. Our IT systems are subject to constant attempts to gain unauthorized access in order to disrupt our business operations and capture, destroy or manipulate various types of information that we rely on, including PII and/or other confidential information. In addition, various third parties, including employees, contractors or others with whom we do business may attempt to circumvent our security measures in order to obtain such information, or inadvertently cause a breach involving such information. Any significant compromise or breach of our data security, whether external or internal, or misuse of PII and/or other confidential information may result in significant costs, litigation and regulatory enforcement actions and, therefore, may have a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition. Further, if any such compromise, breach or misuse is not detected quickly, the effect could be compounded.\nWhile we have implemented network security systems and processes to protect against unauthorized access to or use of secured data and to prevent data loss and theft, there is no guarantee that these procedures are adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches or misuse of the data. We maintain private liability insurance intended to help mitigate the financial risks of such incidents, but there can be no guarantee that insurance will be sufficient to cover all losses related to such incidents, and our exposure resulting from any serious unauthorized access to, or use of, secured data, or serious data loss or theft, could far exceed the limits of our insurance coverage for such events. Further, a significant compromise of PII and/or other confidential information could result in regulatory penalties and harm our reputation with our customers, retail partners and others, potentially resulting in a material adverse impact on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe regulatory environment related to information security, data collection and use, and privacy is increasingly rigorous, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business, and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs. For example, we are currently subject to settlements with the FTC that we entered into in 2013, as well as the State of California and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania regarding our business practices and compliance with privacy laws in those states, and data breaches of this nature could result in additional penalties under the terms of those settlements. In addition, and as discussed above, the CCPA, which became effective in January 2020, has changed the manner in which our transactions with California residents are regulated with respect to the manner in which we collect, store and use consumer and employee data; expose our operations in California to increased regulatory oversight and litigation risks; and increase our compliance-related costs. These costs, including others relating to increased regulatory oversight and compliance, could be substantial and adversely impact our business.\nWe also believe successful data breaches or cybersecurity incidents at other companies, whether or not we are involved, could lead to a general loss of customer confidence that could negatively affect us, including harming the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures or financial technology in general. We believe our exposure to this risk will increase as we expand our use of financial technology to communicate with our customers and retail partners and as we increase the number of retail partners with whom we work.\nOur proprietary algorithms and customer lease decisioning tools used to approve customers could no longer be indicative of our customers\u2019 ability to perform under their lease agreements with us.\nWe believe Progressive Leasing\u2019s proprietary, centralized customer lease decisioning process to be a key to the success of the Progressive Leasing business. That and other decisioning processes and tools are also used to approve customers of Vive and our Aarons.com e-commerce offering, and, as discussed above, we expect to implement that centralized lease decisioning process in all of our Company-operated Aaron\u2019s stores before the end of 2020. We assume behavior and attributes observed for prior customers, among other factors, are indicative of performance by future customers. Unexpected changes in behavior caused by macroeconomic conditions, including, for example, the U.S. economy experiencing a recession and job losses related thereto, increases in interest rates, inflationary pressures, changes in consumer preferences, availability of alternative products or other factors, however, could lead to increased incidence and costs related to defaulted leases and/or merchandise losses. In addition, with respect to our expectation to implement a centralized customer lease decision process in all of the Company-operated stores of our Aaron\u2019s Business, we may not be successful in executing the systems and procedural changes necessary to implement that centralized decisioning initiative, and it is possible that the centralized decisioning process will not be as effective or accurate as the decentralized, store-based decisioning process we historically used in our Aaron\u2019s Business stores.\nWe could lose our access to data sources, which could cause us competitive harm and have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nWe are heavily dependent on data provided by third-party providers. For example, our Progressive Leasing business employs a proprietary customer lease decisioning algorithm when making lease approval decisions for its customers. This algorithm depends extensively upon continued access to and receipt of data from external sources, such as third-party data vendors. In addition, our Aarons.com and Vive businesses are similarly dependent on customer attribute data provided by external sources, and our Company-operated Aaron\u2019s stores will become dependent on the data provided by those external sources as we carry out our expected implementation of a centralized customer lease decisioning process in all of those stores before the end of 2020. Our data providers could stop providing data, provide untimely, incorrect or incomplete data, or increase the costs for their data for a variety of reasons, including a perception that our systems are insecure as a result of a data security breach, regulatory concerns or for competitive reasons. We could also become subject to increased legislative, regulatory or judicial restrictions or mandates on the collection, disclosure or use of such data, in particular if such data is not collected by our providers in a way that allows us to legally use the data. If we were to lose access to this external data or if our access or use were restricted or were to become less economical or desirable, our Progressive Leasing, Aaron\u2019s Business and Vive businesses would be negatively impacted, which would adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. We cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in maintaining our relationships with these external data source providers or that we will be able to continue to obtain data from them on acceptable terms or at all. Furthermore, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to obtain data from alternative sources if our current sources become unavailable.\nIf our information technology systems are impaired, our business could be interrupted, our reputation could be harmed and we may experience lost revenues and increased costs and expenses.\nWe rely on our information technology systems to process transactions with our customers, including tracking lease payments on merchandise, and to manage other important functions of our business. Failures of our systems, such as \u201cbugs,\u201d crashes, internet failures and outages, operator error, or catastrophic events, could seriously impair our ability to operate our business, and our business continuity and contingency plans related to such information technology failures may not be adequate to prevent that type of serious impairment. If our information technology systems are impaired, our business (and that of our franchisees) could be interrupted, our reputation could be harmed, we may experience lost revenues or sales and we could experience increased costs and expenses to remediate the problem.\nWe may pursue acquisitions or investments of complementary companies or businesses, and the failure of an acquisition or investment to produce the anticipated results or the inability to fully integrate the acquired companies could have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe may from time to time acquire or invest in complementary companies or businesses, and acquire our franchisees, as we have done in recent years. For example, we acquired the operations of a total of 263 of our former franchisees\u2019 store locations during 2017 and 2018. There can be no assurance that those acquisitions will produce the results we expected at the time we entered into those acquisitions, or that we will be able to successfully integrate the operations of those former franchisee locations, including their customers and personnel. The companies and businesses we may acquire may operate lines of business or offer services and products that we have never operated or offered previously. These companies and businesses may also be subject to regulatory regimes that have not previously applied and may significantly impact our business. The success of any acquisitions or investments we undertake is based on our ability to make accurate assumptions regarding the valuation, operations, growth potential, integration and other factors relating to the respective business.\nThere can be no assurance that our acquisitions or investments will produce the results that we expect at the time we enter into or complete the transaction. Furthermore, acquisitions may result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, amortization expenses or write-offs of goodwill or other intangibles, any of which could harm our financial condition. We also may not be able to successfully integrate operations that we acquire, including their customers, personnel, financial systems, supply chain and other operations, which could adversely affect our business. Acquisitions may also result in the diversion of our capital and our management\u2019s attention from other business issues and opportunities and from our on-going strategic plan to improve the performance of the Aaron\u2019s Business even if we are unable to successfully complete the acquisition.\nOur stock price is volatile, and you may not be able to recover your investment if our stock price declines.\nThe price of our common stock has been volatile and may be significantly affected by factors such as:\n\u2022\nOur announcement of Progressive Leasing\u2019s proposed settlement agreement with the FTC and any negative effects to our business associated with that announcement.\n\u2022\nour ability to meet market expectations with respect to the growth and profitability of each of our operating segments;\n\u2022\nquarterly variations in our results of operations, which may be impacted by, among other things, changes in same store revenues or when and how many locations we acquire, open or close;\n\u2022\nquarterly variations in our competitors\u2019 results of operations;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates or buy/sell recommendations by financial analysts;\n\u2022\nhow our actual financial performance compares to the financial performance outlook we provide;\n\u2022\nstate or federal legislative or regulatory proposals, initiatives, actions or changes that are, or are perceived to be, adverse to our operations;\n\u2022\nthe stock price performance of comparable companies; and\n\u2022\ncontinuing unpredictable global and regional economic conditions.\nIn addition, the stock market as a whole historically has experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price of many specialty retailers in ways that may have been unrelated to these companies\u2019 operating performance.\nWe may engage in litigation with our franchisees.\nAlthough we believe we generally enjoy a positive working relationship with our franchisees, the nature of the franchisor-franchisee relationship may give rise to litigation with our franchisees. In the ordinary course of business, we are the subject of complaints or litigation from franchisees, usually related to alleged breaches of contract or wrongful termination under the franchise arrangements. We may also engage in future litigation with franchisees to enforce the terms of our franchise agreements and compliance with our brand standards as determined necessary to protect our brand, the consistency of our products and the customer experience. In addition, we may be subject to claims by our franchisees relating to our franchise disclosure documents, including claims based on financial information contained in those documents. Engaging in such litigation may be costly, time-consuming and may distract management and materially adversely affect our relationships with franchisees. Any negative outcome of these or any other claims could materially adversely affect our results of operations and may damage our reputation and brand. Furthermore, existing and future franchise-related legislation could subject us to additional litigation risk in the event we terminate or fail to renew a franchise relationship.\nWe must successfully order and manage our Aaron\u2019s Business inventory to reflect customer demand and anticipate changing consumer preferences and buying trends or our revenue and profitability will be adversely affected.\nThe success of our Aaron\u2019s Business depends upon our ability to successfully manage our inventory and to anticipate and respond to merchandise trends and customer demands in a timely manner. We cannot always accurately predict consumer preferences and they may change over time. We must order certain types of merchandise, such as consumer electronics, well in advance of seasonal increases in customer demand for those products. The extended lead times for many of our purchases may make it difficult for us to respond rapidly to new or changing product trends or changes in prices. If we misjudge either the market for our merchandise, our customers\u2019 product preferences or our customers\u2019 leasing habits, our revenue may decline significantly and we may not have sufficient quantities of merchandise to satisfy customer demand or we may be required to mark down excess inventory, either of which would result in lower profit margins. In addition, our level of profitability and success in our Aaron\u2019s Business depends on our ability to successfully re-lease or sale our inventory of merchandise that we take back from the customers of our Aaron\u2019s Business, due to their lease agreements expiring, or otherwise.\nWe depend on hiring an adequate number of hourly employees to run our business and are subject to government regulations concerning these and our other employees, including wage and hour regulations.\nOur workforce is comprised primarily of employees who work on an hourly basis. To grow our operations and meet the needs and expectations of our customers, we must attract, train, and retain a large number of hourly associates, while at the same time controlling labor costs. These positions have historically had high turnover rates, which can lead to increased training, retention and other costs. In certain areas where we operate, there is significant competition for employees, including from retailers and restaurants. The lack of availability of an adequate number of hourly employees, or our inability to attract and retain them, or an increase in wages and benefits to attract and maintain current employees could adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition. We are subject to applicable rules and regulations relating to our relationship with our employees, including wage and hour regulations, health benefits, unemployment and payroll taxes, overtime and working conditions and immigration status. Accordingly, federal, state or local legislated increases in the minimum wage, as well as increases in additional labor cost components such as employee benefit costs, workers\u2019 compensation insurance rates, compliance costs and fines, would increase our labor costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe geographic concentration of our Aaron\u2019s stores, as well as those of Progressive Leasing\u2019s retail partners, may magnify the impact of conditions in a particular region, including economic downturns and other occurrences.\nThe concentration of our Aaron\u2019s stores, and/or those of our retail partners at Progressive Leasing, in one region or a limited number of markets may expose us to risks of adverse economic developments that are greater than if our store portfolio and retail partners were more geographically diverse.\nIn addition, our store operations, as well as those of our retail partners at Progressive Leasing, are subject to the effects of adverse acts of nature, such as winter storms, hurricanes, hail storms, strong winds, earthquakes and tornadoes, which have in the past caused damage such as flooding and other damage to our stores and those of our retail partners in specific geographic locations, including in Florida and Texas, two of our large markets, and may, depending upon the location and severity of such events, unfavorably impact our business continuity. Additionally, we cannot assure you that the amount of our hurricane, windstorm, earthquake, flood, business interruption or other casualty insurance we maintain from time to time would entirely cover damages caused by any such event.\nVive\u2019s \u201csecond-look\u201d credit programs for below-prime consumers differ in significant respects from the risks of Aaron\u2019s store-based lease-to-own business. The risks could have a material negative effect on Progressive Leasing, which could result in a material adverse effect on our entire business.\nAs discussed above, as we execute on our strategic plans, we may continue to expand into complementary businesses that engage in financial, banking or lending services. For example, Vive, which through its VIVEcard\u00ae (previously known as the HELPcard\u00ae) and other private label credit products, offers merchant partners one source for a variety of open-end credit programs for below-prime consumers, is a business that differs in significant respects from our sales and lease ownership businesses. Consequently, Vive faces different risks than are associated with Aaron\u2019s sales and lease ownership concept, which Aaron\u2019s and its franchisees offer through their own stores. Because Vive is associated with Progressive Leasing in the view of certain of Progressive Leasing and Vive's retail and merchant partners, the risks Vive faces could have a material negative effect on Progressive Leasing, which could result in a material adverse effect on our entire business. These potential risks include, among others, Vive\u2019s:\n\u2022\nreliance on third-party retailers (over whom Vive cannot exercise the degree of control and oversight that Aaron\u2019s Business, including franchisees, can assert over their own respective employees) for many important business functions, from advertising through assistance with finance applications;\n\u2022\nreliance on bank partners to issue Vive\u2019s VIVEcard\u00ae and other credit products. The banks\u2019 regulators, including the FDIC, could at any time limit or otherwise modify the banks\u2019 ability to continue their relationships with Vive and any significant interruption of those relationships would result in Vive being unable to use exported rates or acquire new receivables without moving to a costly and inefficient state-by-state model, and being unable to provide other credit products. It is possible that a regulatory position or action taken with respect to Vive\u2019s issuing banks might result in the banks\u2019 inability or unwillingness to originate future credit products on Vive\u2019s behalf or in partnership with it, which would adversely affect Vive\u2019s ability to grow its point-of-sale and direct-to-consumer credit products and other consumer credit offerings and underlying receivables. In addition, Vive\u2019s agreements with its issuing bank partners have scheduled expiration dates. Although those expiration dates are several months apart, if Vive is unable to extend or execute new agreements with both of its issuing banks upon the expiration of its current agreements, or if its existing agreements both were terminated or otherwise disrupted, there is a risk that Vive would not be able to enter into an agreement with an alternative bank provider on terms that Vive would consider favorable or in a timely manner without disruption of its business; and\n\u2022\ndifferent legal and regulatory risks, and different regulators (including the FDIC, for example), than those applicable to Aaron\u2019s and Progressive Leasing\u2019s sales and lease ownership businesses, including risks arising from the Truth in Lending Act, state credit laws and the offering of open-end credit, the potential that regulators may target Vive\u2019s operating model and the interest rates it charges, and the risk of unfavorable court decisions relating to the True Lender Doctrine, including among other factors, exporting of interest rates and state usury laws.\nThese risks could have a material negative effect on Progressive Leasing, which could result in a material adverse effect on our entire business.\nThe loss of the services of our key executives, or our inability to attract and retain key talent could have a material adverse impact on our operations.\nWe believe that we have benefited substantially from our current executive leadership and that the unexpected loss of their services in the future could adversely affect our business and operations. We also depend on the continued services of the rest of our management team. The loss of these individuals without adequate replacement could adversely affect our business. Further, we believe that the unexpected loss of certain key talent in the future could adversely affect our business and operations. We do not carry key man life insurance on any of our personnel. The inability to attract and retain qualified individuals, or a significant increase in the costs to do so, would materially adversely affect our operations.\nIf we fail to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, or report them in a timely manner.\nAs a public company, we are required to document and test our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 so that our management can certify, on an annual basis, that our internal control over financial reporting is effective. In addition, we are required to, among other things, establish and periodically evaluate procedures with respect to our disclosure controls and procedures.\nIf we fail to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, or report them in a timely manner, which could cause a decline in our stock price and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, if our senior management is unable to conclude that we have effective internal control over financial reporting, or to certify the effectiveness of such controls, or if our independent registered public accounting firm cannot render an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, when required, or if material weaknesses in our internal controls are identified, we could be subject to increased regulatory scrutiny and a loss of public and investor confidence, which could also have a material adverse effect on our business and our stock price.\nOperational and other failures by our franchisees may adversely impact us.\nQualified franchisees who conform to our standards and requirements are important to the overall success of our business. Our franchisees, however, are independent businesses and not employees, and consequently we cannot and do not control them to the same extent as our Company-operated stores. Our franchisees may fail in key areas, or experience significant business or financial difficulties, which could slow our growth, reduce our franchise revenues, damage our reputation, expose us to regulatory enforcement actions or private litigation and/or cause us to incur additional costs. If our franchisees experience business or financial difficulties, we could suffer a loss of franchisee fees, royalties, and revenue and profits derived from our sales of merchandise to franchisees, and could suffer write-downs of outstanding receivables those franchisees owe us if they fail to make those payments to us. If we fail to adequately mitigate any such future losses, our business and financial condition could be materially adversely impacted.\nWe are subject to laws that regulate franchisor-franchisee relationships. Our ability to enforce our rights against our franchisees may be adversely affected by these laws, which could impair our growth strategy and cause our franchise revenues to decline.\nAs a franchisor, we are subject to regulation by the FTC, state laws and certain Canadian provincial laws regulating the offer and sale of franchises. Our failure to comply with applicable franchise regulations could cause us to lose franchise fees and ongoing royalty revenues. Moreover, state and provincial laws that regulate substantive aspects of our relationships with franchisees may limit our ability to terminate or otherwise resolve conflicts with our franchisees or enforce contractual duties or rights we believe we have with respect to our franchisees.\nChanges to current law with respect to the assignment of liabilities in the franchise business model could adversely impact our profitability.\nOne of the legal foundations fundamental to the franchise business model has been that, absent special circumstances, a franchisor is generally not responsible for the acts, omissions or liabilities of its franchisees. Recently, established law has been challenged and questioned by the plaintiffs\u2019 bar and certain regulators, and the outcome of these challenges and new regulatory positions remains unknown. If these challenges and/or new positions are successful in altering currently settled law, it could significantly change the way we and other franchisors conduct business and adversely impact our profitability.\nFor example, a determination that we are a joint employer with our franchisees or that franchisees are part of one unified system with joint and several liability under the National Labor Relations Act, statutes administered by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, OSHA regulations and other areas of labor and employment law could subject us and/or our franchisees to liability for the unfair labor practices, wage-and-hour law violations, employment discrimination law violations, OSHA regulation violations and other employment-related liabilities of one or more franchisees. Furthermore, any such change in law would create an increased likelihood that certain franchised networks would be required to employ unionized labor,\nwhich could impact franchisors like us through, among other things, increased labor costs and difficulty in attracting new franchisees. In addition, if these changes were to be expanded outside of the employment context, we could be held liable for other claims against franchisees. Therefore, any such regulatory action or court decisions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe are subject to sales, income and other taxes, which can be difficult and complex to calculate due to the nature of our various businesses. A failure to correctly calculate and pay such taxes could result in substantial tax liabilities and a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe application of indirect taxes, such as sales tax, is a complex and evolving issue, particularly with respect to the lease-to-own industry generally and our virtual lease-to-own Progressive Leasing and Aarons.com businesses more specifically. Many of the fundamental statutes and regulations that impose these taxes were established before the growth of the lease-to-own industry and e-commerce and, therefore, in many cases it is not clear how existing statutes apply to our various businesses. In addition, governments are increasingly looking for ways to increase revenues, which has resulted in discussions about tax reform and other legislative action to increase tax revenues, including through indirect taxes. This also could result in other adverse changes in or interpretations of existing sales, income and other tax regulations. For example, from time to time, some taxing authorities in the United States have notified us that they believe we owe them certain taxes imposed on transactions with our customers, including some state tax authorities suggesting that our Progressive Leasing business may owe certain state taxes based on the locations of Progressive Leasing\u2019s retail partners where Progressive Leasing\u2019s lease-to-own transactions are originated. Although these notifications have not resulted in material tax liabilities to date, there is a risk that one or more jurisdictions may be successful in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nEmployee misconduct or misconduct by third parties acting on our behalf, or third parties to whom our Aaron\u2019s Business previously sold certain of its past due customer accounts for the third parties to attempt to collect, could harm us by subjecting us to monetary loss, significant legal liability, regulatory scrutiny and reputational harm.\nOur reputation is critical to maintaining and developing relationships with our existing and potential customers and third parties with whom we do business. There is a risk that our employees or the employees of a third-party retailer with whom our Progressive Leasing business partners, or of a third-party merchant with whom our Vive segment does business, or a third-party to whom our Aaron\u2019s Business previously sold past due customer accounts for the third-party to attempt to collect, a type of transaction we no longer enter into, could engage in misconduct that adversely affects our reputation and business. For example, if one of our employees engages in discrimination or harassment in the workplace, or if an employee or a third-party directly or indirectly associated with our business were to engage in, or be accused of engaging in, illegal or suspicious activities including fraud or theft of our customers\u2019 information, we could suffer direct losses from the activity and, in addition, we could be subject to regulatory sanctions and suffer serious harm to our reputation, financial condition, customer relationships and ability to attract future customers. Employee or third-party misconduct could prompt regulators to allege or to determine based upon such misconduct that we have not established adequate supervisory systems and procedures to inform employees of applicable rules or to detect violations of such rules. Our Company-operated Aaron\u2019s Business stores have experienced employee fraud from time to time, and it is not always possible to deter employee or third-party misconduct. The precautions that we take to detect and prevent misconduct may not be effective in all cases. Misconduct by our employees or third-party contractors or other third parties who are directly or indirectly associated with our business, or even unsubstantiated allegations of misconduct, could result in a material adverse effect on our reputation and our business.\nProduct safety and quality control issues, including product recalls, could harm our reputation, divert resources, reduce sales and increase costs.\nThe products we sell and lease in our Aaron\u2019s Business and lease through our Progressive Leasing business are subject to regulation by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission and similar state regulatory authorities. Such products could be subject to recalls and other actions by these authorities. Product safety or quality concerns may require us to voluntarily remove selected products from our Aaron\u2019s stores, or from our customers\u2019 homes. Such recalls and voluntary removal of products can result in, among other things, lost sales, diverted resources, potential harm to our reputation and increased customer service costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition. In addition, given the terms of our lease agreements with our customers, in the event of such a product quality or safety issue, our customers who have leased the defective merchandise from us could terminate their lease agreements for that merchandise and/or not renew those lease arrangements, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, if we are unable to recover those losses from the vendor who supplied us with the defective merchandise.\nWe may be alleged to have infringed upon intellectual property rights owned by others, or may be unable to protect our intellectual property.\nCompetitors or other third parties may allege that we, or consultants or other third parties retained or indemnified by us, infringe on their intellectual property rights, including with respect to the manner in which our omnichannel platform and aspects of Progressive Leasing\u2019s virtual lease-to-own technology are designed and operate, whether in conjunction with the e-commerce platforms of Progressive Leasing\u2019s retail partners, or otherwise. Given the complex, rapidly changing and competitive technological and business environment in which we operate, and the potential risks and uncertainties of intellectual property-related litigation, an assertion of an infringement claim against us may cause us to spend significant amounts to defend the claim (even if we ultimately prevail); to pay significant money damages; to lose significant revenues; to be prohibited from using the relevant systems, processes, technologies or other intellectual property; to cease offering certain products or services or to incur significant license, royalty or technology development expenses. Even in instances where we believe that claims and allegations of intellectual property infringement against us are without merit, defending against such claims is time consuming and expensive and could result in the diversion of time and attention of our management and employees. Moreover, we rely on a variety of measures to protect our intellectual property and proprietary information. These measures may not prevent misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property or proprietary information and a resulting loss of competitive advantage, and in any event, we may be required to litigate to protect our intellectual property and proprietary information from misappropriation or infringement by others, which is expensive, could cause a diversion of resources and may not be successful.\nInterest rates on certain of our outstanding indebtedness are tied to LIBOR and may be subject to change.\nLIBOR and certain other \u201cbenchmarks\u201d are the subject of recent national, international, and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. These reforms may cause such benchmarks to perform differently than in the past or have other consequences which cannot be predicted. In particular, on July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, publicly announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. It is unclear whether, at that time, LIBOR will cease to exist or if new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established. As of December 31, 2019, approximately $219 million of our outstanding indebtedness had interest rate payments determined based directly or indirectly on LIBOR, including our outstanding indebtedness under our revolving credit and term loan agreement (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d). If there is uncertainty as to whether LIBOR will continue to be quoted, if LIBOR ceases to exist or if the methods of calculating LIBOR change from current methods for any reason, the interest rates on this indebtedness may increase substantially from those we have previously experienced. Further, our Credit Agreement contains provisions specifying that, if LIBOR is no longer available and the condition is unlikely to be temporary, then we and the lenders can establish an alternative benchmark rate for indebtedness under our Credit Agreement. Any such alternative benchmark rate would give due consideration to prevailing market convention for determining rates for syndicated loans in the United States. At this point it is not clear what, if any, alternative benchmark measure may be adopted in the marketplace generally to replace LIBOR should it cease to exist, however, any alternative benchmark rate could increase the interest expense we have historically realized on our indebtedness or realize on future indebtedness.", "PERMNO": 78049, "SIC": 7359, "TIC": "AAN"}
