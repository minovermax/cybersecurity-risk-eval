RISK FACTORS\nWe are subject to numerous known and unknown risks, many of which are presented below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. You should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K in evaluating us and our common stock. Any of the risk factors described below, or additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us, or that we currently deem immaterial, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. The headings provided in this Item 1A are for convenience and reference purposes only and shall not limit or otherwise affect the extent or interpretation of the risk factors.\nRisks Relating to Our Industries\nA substantial or extended decline in refining margins would reduce our operating results and cash flows and could materially and adversely impact our future rate of growth and the carrying value of our assets.\nOur earnings, cash flow and profitability from our refining operations are substantially determined by the difference between the market price of refined products and the market price of crude oil, which often move independently of each other and are referred to as the crack spread, refining margin or refined products margin. Refining margins historically have been volatile, and we believe they will continue to be volatile. Although we monitor our refinery operating margins and seek to optimize results by adjusting throughput volumes, throughput types and product slates, there are inherent limitations on our ability to offset the effects of adverse market conditions.\nMany of the factors influencing changes in crack spreads and refining margins are beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u2022\nchanges in global and local economic conditions, e.g., as a result of the recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus;\n\u2022\ndomestic and foreign supply and demand for crude oil and refined products;\n\u2022\nthe level of foreign and domestic production of crude oil and refined petroleum products;\n\u2022\nincreased regulation of feedstock production activities, such as hydraulic fracturing;\n\u2022\ninfrastructure limitations that restrict, or events that disrupt, the distribution of crude oil, other feedstocks and refined petroleum products;\n\u2022\nexcess or overbuilt infrastructure;\n\u2022\nan increase or decrease of infrastructure limitations (or the perception that such an increase or decrease could occur) on the distribution of crude oil, other feedstocks or refined products;\n\u2022\ninvestor speculation in commodities;\n\u2022\nworldwide political conditions, particularly in significant oil producing regions such as the Middle East, Africa, the former Soviet Union and South America;\n\u2022\nthe ability or inability of the members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to maintain oil price and production controls;\n\u2022\npricing and other actions taken by competitors that impact the market;\n\u2022\nthe level of crude oil, other feedstocks and refined petroleum products imported into and exported out of the United States;\n\u2022\nexcess capacity and utilization rates of refineries worldwide;\n\u2022\ndevelopment and marketing of alternative and competing fuels, such as ethanol and biodiesel;\n\u2022\nchanges in fuel specifications required by environmental and other laws, particularly with respect to oxygenates and sulfur content;\n\u2022\nlocal factors, including market conditions, adverse weather conditions and the level of operations of other refineries and pipelines in our markets;\n\u2022\nvolatility in the costs of natural gas and electricity used by our refineries;\n\u2022\naccidents, interruptions in transportation, inclement weather or other events, including cyber-attacks, that can cause unscheduled shutdowns or otherwise adversely affect our refineries or the supply and delivery of crude oil from third parties; and\n\u2022\nUnited States government regulations.\nSome of these factors can vary by region and may change quickly, adding to market volatility, while others may have longer-term effects. The long-term effects of these and other factors on prices for crude oil, refinery feedstocks and refined products could be substantial.\nThe crude oil we purchase, and the refined products we sell, are commodities whose prices are mainly determined by market forces beyond our control. While an increase or decrease in the price of crude oil will often result in a corresponding increase or decrease in the wholesale price of refined products, a change in the price of one commodity does not always result in a corresponding change in the other. A substantial or prolonged increase in crude oil prices without a corresponding increase in refined product prices, or a substantial or prolonged decrease in refined product prices without a corresponding decrease in crude oil prices, could also have a significant negative effect on our results of operations and cash flows. This is especially true for non-transportation refined products, such as asphalt, butane, coke, sulfur, propane and slurry, whose prices are less likely to correlate to fluctuations in the price of crude oil, all of which we produce at our refineries.\n30 |\nRisk Factors\nAlso, the price for a significant portion of the crude oil processed at our refineries is based upon the WTI benchmark for such oil rather than the Brent benchmark. While the prices for WTI and Brent historically correlate to one another, elevated supply of WTI-priced crude oil in the Mid-Continent region has caused WTI prices to fall significantly below Brent prices at different points in time in recent years. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2019, this daily differential ranged from highs of $11.37 and $10.99, respectively, to lows of $1.37 and $3.53, respectively. Our ability to purchase and process favorably priced crude oil has allowed us to achieve higher net income and cash flow in recent years; however, we cannot assure that these favorable conditions will continue. A substantial or prolonged narrowing in (or inversion to) the price differential between the WTI and Brent benchmarks for any reason, including, without limitation, increased crude oil distribution capacity from the Permian Basin, crude oil exports from the United States or actual or perceived reductions in Mid-Continent crude oil inventories, could negatively impact our earnings and cash flows, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, because the premium or discount we pay for a portion of the crude oil processed at our refineries is established based upon this differential during the month prior to the month in which the crude oil is processed, rapid decreases in the differential may negatively affect our results of operations and cash flows.\nAdditionally, governmental and regulatory actions, including continued resolutions by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to restrict crude oil production levels and executive actions by the current U.S. presidential administration to advance certain energy infrastructure projects may continue to impact crude oil prices and crude oil differentials. Any increase in crude oil prices or unfavorable movements in crude oil differentials due to such actions or changing regulatory environment may negatively impact our ability to acquire crude oil at economical prices and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry and increased costs of compliance with, or liability for violation of, existing or future laws, regulations and other requirements could significantly increase our costs of doing business, thereby adversely affecting our profitability.\nOur industry is subject to extensive laws, regulations, permits and other requirements including, but not limited to, those relating to the environment, fuel composition, safety, transportation, pipeline tariffs, employment, labor, immigration, minimum wages, overtime pay, health care benefits, working conditions, public accessibility, retail fuel pricing, the sale of alcohol and tobacco and other requirements. These permits, laws and regulations are enforced by federal agencies including the EPA, DOT, PHMSA, Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (\"FMCSA\"), Federal Railroad Administration (\"FRA\"), OSHA, National Labor Relations Board (\"NLRB\"), Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (\"EEOC\"), Federal Trade Commission (\"FTC\") and the FERC, and numerous other state and federal agencies. We anticipate that compliance with environmental, health and safety regulations could require us to spend significant amounts in capital costs during the next five years. These estimates do not include amounts related to capital investments that management has deemed to be strategic investments. These amounts could materially change as a result of governmental and regulatory actions.\nVarious permits, licenses, registrations and other authorizations are required under these laws for the operation of our refineries, biodiesel facilities, terminals, pipelines, retail locations and related operations, and these permits are subject to renewal and modification that may require operational changes involving significant costs. If key permits cannot be renewed or are revoked, the ability to continue operation of the affected facilities could be threatened.\nOngoing compliance with, or violation of, laws, regulations and other requirements could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We face potential exposure to future claims and lawsuits involving environmental matters, including, but not limited to, soil, groundwater and waterway contamination, air pollution, personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by substances we manufactured, handled, used, released or disposed. We are, and have been, the subject of various state, federal and private proceedings relating to environmental regulations, conditions and inquiries.\nIn addition, new legal requirements, new interpretations of existing legal requirements, increased legislative activity and governmental enforcement and other developments could require us to make additional unforeseen expenditures. Companies in the petroleum industry, such as us, are often the target of activist and regulatory activity regarding pricing, safety, environmental compliance, derivatives trading and other business practices, which could result in price controls, fines, increased taxes or other actions affecting the conduct of our business. The specific impact of laws and regulations or other actions may vary depending on a number of factors, including the age and location of operating facilities, marketing areas, crude oil and feedstock sources and production processes.\nWe generate wastes that may be subject to RCRA and comparable state and local requirements. The EPA and various state agencies have limited the approved methods of managing, transporting, recycling and disposal of hazardous and certain non-hazardous wastes. Our refineries are large quantity generators of hazardous waste and require hazardous waste permits issued by the EPA or state agencies. Additionally, certain of our other facilities, such as terminals and biodiesel plants, generate lesser quantities of hazardous wastes.\nUnder RCRA, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (\"CERCLA\") and other federal, state and local environmental laws, as the owner or operator of refineries, biodiesel plants, bulk terminals, pipelines, tank farms, rail cars, trucks and retail locations, we may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of contamination at our existing or former locations, whether we knew of, or were responsible for, the presence of such contamination. We have incurred such liability in the past, and several of our current and former locations are the subject of ongoing remediation projects. The failure to timely report and properly remediate contamination may subject us to liability to third parties and may adversely affect our ability to sell or rent our property or to borrow money using our property as collateral. Additionally, persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous substances also may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of these substances at sites where they are located, regardless of whether the site is owned or operated by that person. We typically arrange for the treatment or disposal of hazardous\n31 |\nRisk Factors\nsubstances generated by our refining and other operations. Therefore, we may be liable for removal or remediation costs associated with releases of these substances at third party locations, as well as other related costs, including fines, penalties and damages resulting from injuries to persons, property and natural resources. Our El Dorado refinery is a minor potentially responsible party at a Superfund site, for which we expect our costs to be non-material. In the future, we may incur substantial expenditures for investigation or remediation of contamination that has not been discovered at our current or former locations or locations that we may acquire or at third party sites where hazardous substances from these locations have been treated or disposed.\nOur operations are subject to certain requirements of the CAA, as well as related state and local laws and regulations governing air emissions. Certain CAA regulatory programs applicable to our refineries, terminals and other operations require capital expenditures for the installation of air pollution control devices, operational procedures to minimize emissions and monitoring and reporting of emissions. In 2012, the EPA announced an industry-wide enforcement initiative directed at flaring operations and performance at refineries and petrochemical plants and finalized revisions to NSPS Subpart Ja that primarily affects flares and process heaters. We completed capital and other projects at our refineries related to flare compliance with NSPS Ja in 2015 and 2016.\nA consent decree was entered in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas in June 2019 resolving alleged historical violations of the CAA at our Big Spring refinery. In addition to a civil penalty of $0.5 million that we paid in June 2019, we will be required to expend capital for pollution control equipment that may be significant over the next 10 years. According to the EPA, approximately 95% of the nation's refining capacity has entered into \"global\" settlements under the EPA National Refinery Initiative. Our El Dorado and Tyler refineries entered into similar global settlements in 2002 and 2009. A similar consent decree covering the Krotz Springs refinery entered into in 2005 by a previous owner was terminated by the court in October 2017.\nIn 2015, the EPA finalized reductions in the NAAQS for ozone, from 75 ppb to 70 ppb. Our Tyler refinery is located near areas that have been reclassified as being in non-attainment with the new standard. However, the refinery area has not been classified as being in non-attainment with the new standard. If air quality near our facilities worsens in the future, it is possible that these area(s) could be reclassified as being in non-attainment for the new ozone standard which could require us to install additional air pollution control equipment for ozone forming emissions in the future. We do not believe such capital expenditures, or the changes in our operation, will result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn late 2015, the EPA finalized additional rules regulating refinery air emissions from a variety of sources (such as cokers, flares, tanks and other process units) through additional NSPS and National Emission Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants and changing the way emissions from startup, shutdown and malfunction operations are regulated (the \"Refinery Risk and Technology Review Rules\" or \u201cRTR\u201d). The RTR rule also requires that we monitor property line benzene concentrations at our refineries, and report those concentrations quarterly to the EPA, which will make the results available to the public. Even though the concentrations are not expected to exceed regulatory or health-based standards, the availability of such data may increase the likelihood of lawsuits against our refineries by the local public or organized public interest groups. Delek has obtained 1-year compliance extensions to certain provisions of the rule. Most of the capital cost needed to comply with these new rules has already been spent. We do not anticipate that any additional capital costs or future operating costs will be material, and do not believe compliance will affect our production capacities or have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition to our operations, many of the fuel products we manufacture are subject to requirements of the CAA, as well as related state and local laws and regulations. The EPA has the authority, under the CAA, to modify the formulation of the refined transportation fuel products we manufacture, in order to limit the emissions associated with their final use. In 2007, the EPA issued final Mobile Source Air Toxic II rules for gasoline formulation that required the reduction of annual average benzene content by July 1, 2012. We have purchased credits in the past to comply with these content requirements for two of our refineries. Although credits have been readily available, there can be no assurance that such credits will continue to be available for purchase at reasonable prices, or at all, and we could have to implement capital projects in the future to reduce benzene levels.\nIn March 2014, the EPA issued final Tier 3 gasoline rules that require a reduction in annual average gasoline sulfur content from 30 ppm to 10 ppm by January 1, 2017 for \"large refineries\" and retains the current maximum per-gallon sulfur content limit of 80 ppm. In April 2016, the EPA finalized a change to the Tier 3 standard, requiring small volume refineries that increase their annual average crude processing rate above 75,000 bpd to meet the Tier 3 sulfur limits 30 months from that \u201cdisqualifying\u201d date. Under the final rules, all of our refineries are considered \u201csmall refineries\u201d and are exempt until January 1, 2020. We anticipate that our refineries will meet these new limits when they become effective and that capital spending at our refineries to achieve compliance by the effective date were $12.0 million through 2019. We do not anticipate that this rule change will affect our refineries.\nOur operations are also subject to the CWA, the OPA-90 and comparable state and local requirements. The CWA, and similar laws, prohibit any discharge into surface waters, ground waters, injection wells and publicly-owned treatment works, except as allowed by pre-treatment permits and NPDES permits issued by federal, state and local governmental agencies. The OPA-90 prohibits the discharge of oil into \"Waters of the U.S.\" and requires that affected facilities have plans in place to respond to spills and other discharges. The CWA also regulates filling or discharges to wetlands and other \"Waters of the U.S.\" In 2015, the EPA, in conjunction with the Army Corps of Engineers, issued a final rule expanding the definition of \u201cWaters of the U.S.\u201d The rule, which was subject to litigation and judicial stays, was repealed in December 2019 and the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers have published a proposed rule containing an alternative definition of \u201cWaters of the U.S.\u201d that is intended to increase predictability and consistency and generally adopts a narrower definition than the 2015 rule. However, legal challenges continue and the ultimate resolution is uncertain at this time. To the extent a final rule expands the scope of the CWA\u2019s jurisdiction, we could face increased operating costs\n32 |\nRisk Factors\nor other impediments that could alter the way we conduct our business, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to regulation by the DOT and various state agencies in connection with our pipeline, trucking and rail transportation operations. These regulatory authorities exercise broad powers, governing activities such as the authorization to operate hazardous materials pipelines and engage in motor carrier operations. There are additional regulations specifically relating to the transportation industry, including integrity management of pipelines, testing and specification of equipment, product handling and labeling requirements and personnel qualifications. The transportation industry is subject to possible regulatory and legislative changes that may affect the economics of our business by requiring changes in operating practices or pipeline construction or by changing the demand for common or contract carrier services or the cost of providing trucking services. Possible changes include, among other things, increasingly stringent environmental regulations, increased frequency and stringency for testing and repairing pipelines, replacement of older pipelines, changes in the hours of service regulations that govern the amount of time a driver may drive in any specific period, on-board black box recorder devices or limits on vehicle weight and size and properties of the materials that can be shipped. Required changes to the specifications governing rail cars carrying crude oil will eliminate the most commonly used tank cars or require that such cars be upgraded. In January 2017, PHMSA announced they were considering limits on the volatility of crude oil that could be shipped by rail and other modes of transportation. These rules could limit the availability of tank cars to transport crude to our refineries and increase the cost of crude oil transported by rail or truck. In addition to the substantial remediation costs that could be caused by leaks or spills from our pipelines, regulators could prohibit our use of affected portions of the pipeline for extended periods, thereby interrupting the delivery of crude oil to, or the distribution of refined products from, our refineries.\nIn addition, the DOT has issued guidelines with respect to securing regulated facilities such as our bulk terminals against terrorist attack. We have instituted security measures and procedures in accordance with such guidelines to enhance the protection of certain of our facilities. We cannot provide any assurance that these security measures would fully protect our facilities from an attack.\nOur operations are subject to various laws and regulations relating to occupational health and safety and process safety administered by OSHA, the EPA and various state equivalent agencies. We maintain safety, training, design standards, mechanical integrity and maintenance programs as part of our ongoing efforts to ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations and to protect the safety of our workers and the public. More stringent laws or regulations or adverse changes in the interpretation of existing laws or regulations by government agencies could have an adverse effect on our financial position and the results of our operations and could require substantial expenditures for the installation and operation of systems and equipment.\nHealth and safety legislation and regulations change frequently. We cannot predict what additional health and safety legislation or regulations will be enacted or become effective in the future or how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted with respect to our operations. Compliance with applicable health and safety laws and regulations has required, and continues to require, substantial expenditures. Future process safety rules could also mandate changes to the way we operate, the processes and chemicals we use and the materials from which our process units are constructed. Such regulations could have a significant negative effect on our operations and profitability. For example, in response to Executive Order 13650, Improving Chemical Facility Safety and Security, OSHA announced it intends to propose comprehensive changes to the process safety requirements, although they have not yet formally proposed any revisions. In January 2017, the EPA finalized changes to process safety requirements in its Risk Management Program rules that require evaluation of safer alternatives and technologies, expanded routine audits, independent third-party audits following certain process safety events and increased sharing of information with the public and emergency response organizations. In January 2017, OSHA announced changes to its National Emphasis Program, and specifically identified oil refineries as facilities for increased inspections. The changes also instruct inspectors to use data gathered from EPA Risk Management Plan inspections to identify refiners for additional Process Safety Management inspections.\nEnvironmental regulations are becoming more stringent, and new environmental and safety laws and regulations are continuously being enacted or proposed. Compliance with any future legislation or regulation of our produced fuels, including renewable fuel or carbon content; GHG emissions; sulfur, benzene or other toxic content; vapor pressure; octane; or other fuel characteristics, may result in increased capital and operating costs and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions or results of operations. While it is impractical to predict the impact that potential regulatory and activist activity may have, such future activity may result in increased costs to operate and maintain our facilities, as well as increased capital outlays to improve our facilities. Such future activity could also adversely affect our ability to expand production, result in damaging publicity about us, or reduce demand for our products. Our need to incur costs associated with complying with any resulting new legal or regulatory requirements that are substantial and not adequately provided for, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operating responsibility for bulk product terminals and refined product pipelines includes responsibility to ensure the quality and purity of the products loaded at our loading racks. If our quality control measures were to fail, we may have contaminated or off-specification products in pipelines and storage tanks or off-specification product could be sent to public gasoline stations. These types of incidents could result in product liability claims from our customers, as well as negative publicity. Product liability is a significant commercial risk. Substantial damage awards have been made in certain jurisdictions against manufacturers and resellers based upon claims for injuries caused by the use of or exposure to various products. There can be no assurance that product liability claims against us would not have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations or our ability to maintain existing customers or retain new customers.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the \"Dodd-Frank Act\") is comprehensive financial reform legislation that, among other things, establishes comprehensive federal oversight and regulation of over-the-counter derivatives and many of the entities that participate\n33 |\nRisk Factors\nin that market. Although the Dodd-Frank Act was enacted on July 21, 2010, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (\"CFTC\") and the SEC, along with certain other regulators, must promulgate final rules and regulations to implement many of the Dodd-Frank Act's provisions relating to over-the-counter derivatives. While some of these rules have been finalized, others have not; and, as a result, the final form and timing of the implementation of the new regulatory regime affecting commodity derivatives remains uncertain.\nThe availability and cost of RINs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe RFS-2, issued by the EPA, requires refiners to add annually increasing amounts of \u201crenewable fuels\u201d to their petroleum products or to purchase credits, known as \u201cRINs,\u201d in lieu of such blending. Due to regulatory uncertainty and in part due to the nation\u2019s fuel supply approaching the \u201cblend wall\u201d (the 10% ethanol limit prescribed by most automobile warranties), the price and availability of RINs has been volatile.\nWhile we are able to obtain many of the RINs required for compliance by blending renewable fuels manufactured by third parties or by our own biodiesel plants, we must also purchase RINs on the open market. If we are unable to pass the costs of compliance with RFS-2 on to our customers, our profits will be adversely impacted. If we have to pay a significantly higher price for RINs, if sufficient RINs are unavailable for purchase or if we are otherwise unable to meet the RFS-2 mandates, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe availability and cost of RINs and other required credits could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nPursuant to the 2007 Energy Independence and Security Act, the EPA promulgated the RFS-2 regulations reflecting the increased volume of renewable fuels mandated to be blended into the nation's fuel supply. The regulations, in part, require refiners to add annually increasing amounts of \u201crenewable fuels\u201d to their petroleum products or purchase RINs in lieu of such blending. We currently purchase RINs for some fuel categories on the open market in order to comply with the quantity of renewable fuels we are required to blend under the RFS-2 regulations. Since the EPA first began mandating biofuels in excess of the \u201cblend wall\u201d (the 10% ethanol limit prescribed by most automobile warranties), the price of RINs has been extremely volatile. While we cannot predict the future prices of RINs, the costs to obtain the necessary number of RINs could be material. If we are unable to pass the costs of compliance with the RFS-2 regulations on to our customers, if sufficient RINs are unavailable for purchase, if we have to pay a significantly higher price for RINs or if we are otherwise unable to meet the RFS-2 mandates, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIn the past, we have received small refinery exemptions under the RFS-2 program for certain of our refineries. However, there is no assurance that such an exemption will be obtained for any of our refineries in future years. For example, the EPA has recently indicated it plans to more closely align the agency\u2019s criteria for granting small refinery exemptions with the recommendation of the Department of Energy, which could result in fewer such exemptions being granted. The failure to obtain such exemptions for certain of our refineries could result in the need to purchase more RINs than we currently have estimated and accrued for in our consolidated financial statements. The EPA recently promulgated new Renewable Fuel Standards regulations that could require the agency to increase the volume of renewable fuel or RINs that refiners are required to purchase if the agency anticipates it will grant small refinery exemptions. This could also increase the number of RINs we need to purchase. Additionally, recent decisions by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit have vacated small refinery exemptions granted in past years for other refiners. These decisions have been remanded to the EPA for further proceedings, and it is not clear at this time what steps the EPA will take with respect to those vacated small refinery exemptions, or how the case will impact small refinery exemptions granted to other refineries or future small refinery exemptions.\nIn addition, the RFS-2 regulations are highly complex and evolving, requiring us to periodically update our compliance systems. The RFS-2 regulations require the EPA to determine and publish the applicable annual volume and percentage standards for each compliance year by November 30 for the forthcoming year, and such blending percentages could be higher or lower than amounts estimated and accrued for in our consolidated financial statements. The future cost of RINs is difficult to estimate until such time as the EPA finalizes the applicable standards for the forthcoming compliance year. Moreover, in addition to increased price volatility in the RINs market, there have been multiple instances of RINs fraud occurring in the marketplace over the past several years. The EPA has initiated several enforcement actions against refiners who purchase fraudulent RINs, resulting in substantial costs to the refiner. We cannot predict with certainty our exposure to increased RINs costs in the future, nor can we predict the extent by which costs associated with RFS-2 regulations will impact our future results of operations.\nIncreased supply of and demand for alternative transportation fuels, increased fuel economy standards and increased use of alternative means of transportation could lead to a decrease in transportation fuel prices and/or a reduction in demand for petroleum-based transportation fuels.\nIn addition, as regulatory initiatives have required an increase in the consumption of renewable transportation fuels, such as ethanol and biodiesel, consumer acceptance of electric, hybrid and other alternative vehicles is increasing. Increased use of renewable fuels and alternative vehicles may result in a decrease in demand for petroleum-based transportation fuels. Increased use of renewable fuels may also result in an increase in transportation fuel supply relative to decreased demand and a corresponding decrease in margins. A significant decrease in transportation fuel margins or demand for petroleum-based transportation fuels could have an adverse impact on our financial results. As described above, RFS-2 requires replacement of increasing amounts of petroleum-based transportation fuels with biofuels through 2022. RFS-2 and widespread use of E-15 or E-85 could cause decreased crude runs and materially affect our profitability, unless fuel demand rises at a comparable rate or other outlets are found for the displaced petroleum products.\n34 |\nRisk Factors\nOn October 11, 2018, the White House announced the President has signed a memorandum directing the EPA to conduct a rulemaking that is intended to increase the utilization of E-15 during the summer months. In its regulatory agenda, the EPA projects publication of a proposed rule in February 2019 and a final rule in May 2019. Notwithstanding this timeline, the Office of Management and Budget's Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs has not yet announced that it has received a draft proposal for interagency review.\nIn 2012, the EPA and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration finalized rules raising the required Corporate Average Fuel Economy and GHG standards for passenger vehicles beginning with 2017 model year vehicles and increasing to the equivalent of 54.5 mpg by 2025. These standards were reaffirmed by the EPA in January 2017, but that action was subsequently withdrawn on April 13, 2018. Additional increases in fuel efficiency standards for medium and heavy-duty vehicles were finalized in 2016. Such increases in fuel economy standards and potential electrification of the vehicle fleet, along with mandated increases in use of renewable fuels discussed above, could result in decreasing demand for petroleum fuels, which, in turn, could materially affect profitability at our refineries.\nTo meet higher fuel efficiency and GHG emission standards for passenger vehicles, automobile manufacturers are increasingly using technologies, such as turbocharging, direct injection and higher compression ratios that require high octane gasoline. Many auto manufacturers have expressed a desire that only a high-octane grade of gasoline be allowed in order to maximize fuel efficiency, rather than the three octane grades common now. Regulatory changes allowing only one high-octane grade, or significant increases in market demand for high-octane fuel, could result in a shift to high-octane ethanol blends containing 25% - 30% ethanol, the need for capital expenditures at our refineries to increase octane or reduced demand for petroleum fuels, which could materially affect profitability of our refineries.\nCompetition in the refining and logistics industry is intense, and an increase in competition in the markets in which we sell our products could adversely affect our earnings and profitability.\nWe compete with a broad range of companies in our refining and petroleum product marketing operations. Many of these competitors are integrated, multinational oil companies that are substantially larger than us. Because of their diversity, integration of operations, larger capitalization, larger and more complex refineries and greater resources, these companies may be better able to withstand volatile market conditions relating to crude oil and refined product pricing, to compete on the basis of price and to obtain crude oil in times of shortage.\nWe do not engage in petroleum exploration or production, and therefore do not produce any of our crude oil feedstocks. Certain of our competitors, however, obtain a portion of their feedstocks from company-owned production activities. Competitors that have their own crude oil production are at times able to offset losses from refining operations with profits from producing operations and may be better positioned to withstand periods of depressed refining margins or feedstock shortages. If we are unable to compete effectively with these competitors, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur retail segment is subject to loss of market share or pressure to reduce prices in order to compete effectively with a changing group of competitors in a fragmented retail industry.\nThe markets in which we operate our retail fuel and convenience stores are highly competitive and characterized by ease of entry and constant change in the number and type of retailers offering the products and services found in our stores. We compete with other convenience store chains, gas stations, supermarkets, drug stores, discount stores, dollar stores, club stores, mass merchants, fast food operations, independent owner-operators and other retail outlets. In some of our markets, our competitors have been in existence longer and have greater financial, marketing and other resources than us. In addition, independent owner-operators can generally operate stores with lower overhead costs than ours. As a result, our competitors may be able to respond better to changes in the economy and new opportunities within the industry.\nSeveral non-traditional retailers, such as supermarkets, club stores and mass merchants, have affected the convenience store industry by entering the retail fuel business and/or selling merchandise traditionally found in convenience stores. Many of these competitors are substantially larger than we are. Because of their diversity, integration of operations and greater resources, these companies may be better able to withstand volatile market conditions or levels of low or no profitability. In addition, these retailers may use promotional pricing or discounts, both at the pump and in the store, to encourage in-store merchandise sales. These activities by our competitors could adversely affect our profit margins. Additionally, our convenience stores could lose market share, relating to both gasoline and merchandise, to these and other retailers, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows. Our convenience stores compete in large part based on their ability to offer convenience to customers. Consequently, changes in traffic patterns and the type, number and location of competing stores could result in the loss of customers and reduced sales and profitability at affected stores. These non-traditional gasoline and/or convenience merchandise retailers may obtain a significant share of the retail fuels market, may obtain a significant share of the convenience store merchandise market and their market share in each market is expected to grow.\nWe may seek to diversify and expand our retail fuel and convenience store operations, which may present operational and competitive challenges.\nWe may seek to grow by selectively operating stores in geographic areas other than those in which we currently operate, or in which we currently have a relatively small number of stores. This growth strategy would present numerous operational and competitive challenges to our senior management and employees and would place significant pressure on our operating systems. In addition, we cannot assure that consumers located in the regions in which we may expand our operations would be as receptive to our stores as consumers in our existing markets. The success of any such growth plans will depend in part upon our ability to:\n35 |\nRisk Factors\n\u2022\nselect, and compete successfully in, new markets;\n\u2022\nobtain suitable sites at acceptable costs;\n\u2022\nrealize an acceptable return on the capital invested in new facilities;\n\u2022\nhire, train, and retain qualified personnel;\n\u2022\nintegrate new retail fuel and convenience stores into our existing distribution, inventory control, and information systems;\n\u2022\nexpand relationships with our suppliers or develop relationships with new suppliers; and\n\u2022\nsecure adequate financing, to the extent required.\nWe cannot assure that we will achieve our development goals, manage our growth effectively, or operate our existing and new retail fuel and convenience stores profitability. The failure to achieve any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDecreases in commodity prices may lessen our borrowing capacities, increase collateral requirements for derivative instruments or cause a write-down of inventory.\nThe nature of our business requires us to maintain substantial quantities of crude oil, refined petroleum product and blendstock inventories. Because these inventories are commodities, we have no control over their changing market value. For example, reductions in the value of our inventories or accounts receivable as a result of lower commodity prices could result in a reduction in our borrowing base calculations and a reduction in the amount of financial resources available to meet the refineries' credit requirements. Further, if at any time our availability under certain of our revolving credit facilities falls below certain thresholds, we may be required to take steps to reduce our utilization under those credit facilities. In addition, changes in commodity prices may require us to utilize substantial amounts of cash to settle or cash collateralize some or all of our existing commodity hedges. Finally, because our inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market value, we would record a write-down of inventory and a non-cash charge to cost of sales if the market value of the inventory were to decline to an amount below our cost.\nA terrorist attack on our assets, or threats of war or actual war, may hinder or prevent us from conducting our business.\nTerrorist attacks (including cyber-attacks) in the United States, as well as events occurring in response to or in connection with them, including political instability in significant oil producing regions such as the Middle East, Africa, the former Soviet Union and South America, may harm our business. Energy-related assets (which could include refineries, pipelines and terminals such as ours) may be at greater risk of future terrorist attacks than other possible targets in the United States.\nA direct attack on our assets, or the assets of others used by us, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Uncertainty surrounding continued global hostilities or other sustained military campaigns, and the possibility that infrastructure facilities could be direct targets of, or indirect casualties of, an act of terror, may affect our operations in unpredictable ways, including disruptions of crude oil supplies and markets for refined products. In addition, any terrorist attack or political instability in significant oil producing regions such as the Middle East, Africa, the former Soviet Union and South America could have an adverse impact on energy prices, including prices for crude oil, other feedstocks and refined petroleum products, and an adverse impact on the margins from our refining and petroleum product marketing operations. The long-term impacts of terrorist attacks and the threat of future terrorist on the energy transportation industry in general, and on us in particular, are unknown. Increased security measures taken by us as a precaution against possible terrorist attacks or vandalism could result in increased costs to our business. In addition, disruption or significant increases in energy prices could result in government-imposed price controls. Any one of, or a combination of, these occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLegislative and regulatory measures to address climate change and GHG emissions could increase our operating costs or decrease demand for our refined products.\nVarious legislative and regulatory measures to address climate change and GHG emissions (including carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxides) are in various phases of discussion or implementation and could affect our operations. They include proposed and recently enacted federal regulation and state actions to develop statewide, regional or nationwide programs designed to control and reduce GHG emissions from fixed sources, such as our refineries, coal-fired power plants and oil and gas production operations, as well as mobile transportation sources and fuels. Many states and regions have implemented, or are in the process of implementing, measures to reduce emissions of GHGs, primarily through cap and trade programs or low carbon fuel standards, but other than in California where we have limited operations, we do not currently operate in states that have their own GHG reduction programs.\nIn December 2009, the EPA published its findings that emissions of GHGs present a danger to public health and the environment because emissions of such gases are, according to the EPA, contributing to the warming of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere and other climatic conditions. Based on these findings, the EPA adopted two sets of regulations that restrict emissions of GHGs under existing provisions of the federal CAA, including one that requires a reduction in emissions of GHGs from motor vehicles and another that regulates GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources under the PSD and Title V permitting programs. Congress has also from time to time considered legislation to reduce emissions of GHGs. Efforts have been made, and continue to be made, in the international community toward the adoption of international treaties or protocols that would address global climate change issues. In April 2016, the United States became a signatory to the 2015 United Nations Conference on Climate Change, which led to the creation of the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement, which became effective by its terms on November 4, 2016, will require countries to review and \"represent a progression\" in their intended nationally determined contributions, which set GHG emission reduction\n36 |\nRisk Factors\ngoals, every five years, beginning in 2020. On August 4, 2017, the United States formally communicated to the United Nations its intent to withdraw from participating in the Paris Agreement, which entails a four-year process. In response to the announced withdrawal plan, a number of state and local governments in the United States have expressed intentions to take GHG-related actions.\nAlthough it is not possible to predict the requirements of any GHG legislation that may be enacted, any laws or regulations that have been or may be adopted to restrict or reduce GHG emissions will likely require us to incur increased operating and capital costs and/or increased taxes on GHG emissions and petroleum fuels, and any increase in the prices of refined products resulting from such increased costs, GHG cap and trade programs or taxes on GHGs, could result in reduced demand for our petroleum fuels. If we are unable to maintain sales of our refined products at a price that reflects such increased costs, there could be a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. GHG regulation, including taxes on the GHG content of fuels, could also impact the consumption of refined products, thereby affecting our refinery operations.\nIncreasing attention to environmental, social and governance matters may impact our business, financial results or stock price.\nIn recent years, increasing attention has been given to corporate activities related to environmental, social and governance (\u201cESG\u201d) matters in public discourse and the investment community. A number of advocacy groups, both domestically and internationally, have campaigned for governmental and private action to promote change at public companies related to ESG matters, including through the investment and voting practices of investment advisers, public pension funds, universities and other members of the investing community. These activities include increasing attention and demands for action related to climate change, promoting the use of substitutes to fossil fuel products, and encouraging the divestment of companies in the fossil fuel industry. These activities could reduce demand for our products, reduce our profits, increase the potential for investigations and litigation, impair our brand and have negative impacts on our stock price and access to capital markets.\nIn addition, organizations that provide information to investors on corporate governance and related matters have developed ratings systems for evaluating companies on their approach to ESG matters. These ratings are used by some investors to inform their investment and voting decisions. Unfavorable ESG ratings may lead to increased negative investor sentiment toward us and our industry and to the diversion of investment to other industries, which could have a negative impact on our stock price and our access to and costs of capital.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nWe are particularly vulnerable to disruptions to our refining operations because our refining operations are concentrated in four facilities.\nBecause all of our refining operations are concentrated in the Tyler, El Dorado, Big Spring and Krotz Springs refineries, significant disruptions at one of these facilities could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial results. Refining segment contribution margin comprised approximately 79.4%, 84.2% and 88.3% of our consolidated contribution margin for the 2019, 2018 and 2017 fiscal years, respectively.\nOur refineries consist of many processing units, a number of which have been in operation for many years. These processing units undergo periodic shutdowns, known as turnarounds, during which routine maintenance is performed to restore the operation of the equipment to a higher level of performance. Depending on which units are affected, all or a portion of a refinery's production may be halted or disrupted during a maintenance turnaround. We completed a maintenance turnaround at our El Dorado refinery in 2014 and a shortened turnaround that allowed work to be completed on the majority of the process units in March 2019. In addition, we completed a maintenance turnaround at our Tyler refinery in 2015 and plan for a maintenance turnaround for our Big Spring refinery beginning January of 2020. We are also subject to unscheduled down time for unanticipated maintenance or repairs.\nRefinery operations may also be disrupted by external factors, such as a suspension of feedstock deliveries, cyber-attacks, or an interruption of electricity, natural gas, water treatment or other utilities. Other potentially disruptive factors include natural disasters, severe weather conditions, workplace or environmental accidents, interruptions of supply, work stoppages, losses of permits or authorizations or acts of terrorism.\nOur operations are subject to business interruptions and casualty losses. Failure to manage risks associated with business interruptions could adversely impact our operations, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur refining and logistics operations are subject to significant hazards and risks inherent in transporting, storing and processing crude oil and intermediate and finished petroleum products. These hazards and risks include, but are not limited to, natural or weather-related disasters, fires, explosions, pipeline ruptures and spills, trucking accidents, train derailments, third-party interference, mechanical failure of equipment and other events beyond our control. The occurrence of any of these events could result in production and distribution difficulties and disruptions, personal injury or death, environmental pollution and other damage to our properties and the properties of others.\nIf any facility were to experience an interruption in operations, earnings from the facility could be materially adversely affected (to the extent not recoverable through insurance, if insured) because of lost production and repair costs. A significant interruption in one or more of our facilities could also lead to increased volatility in prices for feedstocks and refined products and could increase instability in the financial and insurance markets, making it more difficult for us to access capital and to obtain insurance coverage that we consider adequate.\nBecause of these inherent dangers, our refining and logistics operations are subject to various laws and regulations relating to occupational health and safety, process and operating safety, environmental protection and transportation safety. Continued efforts to comply with applicable laws and regulations related to health, safety and the environment, or a finding of non-compliance with current regulations, could result in additional capital expenditures or operating expenses, as well as fines and penalties.\n37 |\nRisk Factors\nIn addition, our refineries, pipelines and terminals are located in populated areas and any release of hazardous material, or catastrophic event, could affect our employees and contractors, as well as persons and property outside our property. Our pipelines, trucks and rail cars carry flammable and toxic materials on public railways and roads and across populated and/or environmentally sensitive areas and waterways that could be severely impacted in the event of a release. An accident could result in significant personal injuries and/or cause a release that results in damage to occupied areas, as well as damage to natural resources. It could also affect deliveries of crude oil to our refineries, resulting in a curtailment of operations. The costs to remediate such an accidental release and address other potential liabilities, as well as the costs associated with any interruption of operations, could be substantial. Although we maintain significant insurance coverage for such events, it may not cover all potential losses or liabilities.\nIn the event that personal injuries or deaths result from such events, or there are natural resource damages, we would likely incur substantial legal costs and liabilities. The extent of these costs and liabilities could exceed the limits of our available insurance. As a result, any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe costs, scope, timelines and benefits of our refining projects may deviate significantly from our original plans and estimates.\nWe may experience unanticipated increases in the cost, scope and completion time for our improvement, maintenance and repair projects at our refineries. Refinery projects are generally initiated to increase the yields of higher-value products, increase our ability to process a variety of crude oil, increase production capacity, meet new regulatory requirements or maintain the safe and reliable operations of our existing assets. Equipment that we require to complete these projects may be unavailable to us at expected costs or within expected time periods. Additionally, employee or contractor labor expense may exceed our expectations. Due to these or other factors beyond our control, we may be unable to complete these projects within anticipated cost parameters and timelines.\nIn addition, the benefits we realize from completed projects may take longer to achieve and/or be less than we anticipated. Large-scale capital projects are typically undertaken in anticipation of achieving an acceptable level of return on the capital to be employed in the project. We base these forecasted project economics on our best estimate of future market conditions that are not within our control. Most large-scale projects take many years to complete, and during this multi-year period, market and other business conditions can change from those we forecast. Our inability to complete, and/or realize the benefits of refinery projects in a cost-efficient and timely manner, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend upon our logistics segment for a substantial portion of the crude oil supply and refined product distribution networks that serve our Tyler, Big Spring and El Dorado refineries.\nOur logistics segment consists of Delek Logistics, a publicly-traded master limited partnership, and our consolidated financial statements include its consolidated financial results. As of December 31, 2019, we owned a 61.4% limited partner interest in Delek Logistics, and a 94.6% interest in Logistics GP, which owns the entire 2.0% general partner interest in Delek Logistics. Delek Logistics operates a system of crude oil and refined product pipelines, distribution terminals and tankage in Arkansas, Louisiana, Tennessee and Texas. Delek Logistics generates revenues by charging tariffs for transporting crude oil and refined products through its pipelines, by leasing pipeline capacity to third parties, by charging fees for terminalling refined products and other hydrocarbons and storing and providing other services at its terminals.\nOur Tyler, El Dorado and Big Spring refineries are substantially dependent upon Delek Logistics' assets and services under several long-term pipeline and terminal, tankage and throughput agreements expiring in 2024 through 2033. Delek Logistics is subject to its own operating and regulatory risks, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nits reliance on significant customers, including us;\n\u2022\nmacroeconomic factors, such as commodity price volatility that could affect its customers' utilization of its assets;\n\u2022\nits reliance on us for near-term growth;\n\u2022\nsufficiency of cash flow for required distributions;\n\u2022\ncounterparty risks, such as creditworthiness and force majeure;\n\u2022\ncompetition from third-party pipelines and terminals and other competitors in the transportation and marketing industries;\n\u2022\nenvironmental regulations;\n\u2022\noperational hazards and risks;\n\u2022\npipeline tariff regulations;\n\u2022\nlimitations on additional borrowings and other restrictions in its debt agreements; and\n\u2022\nother financial, operational and legal risks.\nThe occurrence of any of these factors could directly or indirectly affect Delek Logistics' financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Because Delek Logistics is our consolidated subsidiary, the occurrence of any of these risks could also affect our financial condition, results of\n38 |\nRisk Factors\noperations and cash flows. Additionally, if any of these risks affect Delek Logistics' viability, its ability to serve our supply and distribution needs may be jeopardized.\nFor additional information about Delek Logistics, see \"Logistics Segment\" under Item 1 & 2, Business and Properties, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nInterruptions or limitations in the supply and delivery of crude oil, or the supply and distribution of refined products, may negatively affect our refining operations and inhibit the growth of our refining operations.\nWe rely on Delek Logistics and third-party transportation systems for the delivery of crude oil to our refineries. For example, during the year ended December 31, 2019, we relied upon the West Texas Gulf pipeline for the delivery of approximately 73.3% of the crude oil processed by our Tyler and El Dorado refineries. We could experience an interruption or reduction of supply and delivery, or an increased cost of receiving crude oil, if the ability of these systems to transport crude oil is disrupted because of accidents, adverse weather conditions, governmental regulation, terrorism, maintenance or failure of pipelines or other delivery systems, other third-party action or other events beyond our control. The unavailability for our use, for a prolonged period of time, of any system of delivery of crude oil could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Pipeline suspensions like these could require us to operate at reduced throughput rates.\nMoreover, interruptions in delivery or limitations in delivery capacity may not allow our refining operations to draw sufficient crude oil to support current refinery production or increases in refining output. In order to maintain or materially increase refining output, existing crude delivery systems may require upgrades or supplementation, which may require substantial additional capital expenditures.\nIn addition, the El Dorado, Big Spring and Krotz Springs refineries distribute most of their light product production through a third-party pipeline system. An interruption to, or change in, the operation of the third-party pipeline system may result in a material restriction to our distribution channels. Because demand in the local markets is limited, a material restriction to each of the refinery's distribution channels may cause us to reduce production and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe could experience an interruption or reduction of supply or delivery of refined products if our suppliers partially or completely ceased operations, temporarily or permanently. The ability of these refineries and our suppliers to supply refined products to us could be temporarily disrupted by anticipated events, such as scheduled upgrades or maintenance, as well as events beyond their control, such as unscheduled maintenance, fires, floods, storms, explosions, power outages, accidents, acts of terrorism or other catastrophic events, labor difficulties and work stoppages, governmental or private party litigation, or legislation or regulation that adversely impacts refinery operations. In addition, any reduction in capacity of other pipelines that connect with our suppliers' pipelines or our pipelines due to testing, line repair, reduced operating pressures, or other causes could result in reduced volumes of refined product supplied to our logistics segment's West Texas terminals. A reduction in the volume of refined products supplied to our West Texas terminals could adversely affect our sales and earnings.\nWe are subject to risks associated with significant investments in the Permian Basin.\nWe and our joint ventures have made and are continuing to make significant investments in infrastructure to gather crude oil from the Permian Basin in West Texas. Similar investments have been made and additional investments may be made in the future by us, our competitors or by new entrants to the markets we serve. The success of these and similar projects largely relies on the realization of anticipated market demand and growth in production in the Permian Basin. These projects typically require significant development periods, during which time demand for such infrastructure may change, production in the Permian Basin may decrease, or additional investments by competitors may be made. Lower production in the Permian Basin, or further investments by us or others in new pipelines, storage or dock capacity could result in capacity that exceeds demand, which could reduce the utilization of our gathering system and midstream assets and the related services or the prices we are able to charge for those services. There are several projects currently underway that are expected to increase pipeline capacity from the Permian Basin beyond current production. This excess capacity could decrease the differential between the Permian and end markets, resulting in a highly competitive environment for transportation services and reducing the rates for those services. When infrastructure investments in the markets we serve result in capacity that exceeds the demand in those markets, our facilities or investments could be underutilized, and rates could be unfavorably impacted, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial position or cash flows, as well as our ability to pay cash distributions.\nOur retail segment is dependent on fuel sales, which makes us susceptible to increases in the cost of gasoline and interruptions in fuel supply.\nOur dependence on fuel sales makes us susceptible to increases in the cost of gasoline and diesel fuel, and fuel profit margins have a significant impact on our earnings. The volume of fuel sold by us, and our fuel profit margins, are affected by numerous factors beyond our control, including the supply and demand for fuel, volatility in the wholesale fuel market and the pricing policies of competitors in local markets. Although we can rapidly adjust our pump prices to reflect higher fuel costs, a material increase in the price of fuel could adversely affect demand. A material, sudden increase in the cost of fuel that causes our fuel sales to decline could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, credit card interchange fees are typically calculated as a percentage of the transaction amount rather than a percentage of gallons sold. Higher refined product prices often result in negative consequences for our retail operations, such as higher credit card expenses, lower retail fuel gross margin per gallon and reduced demand for gasoline and diesel. These conditions could result in fewer retail gallons sold and fewer retail merchandise transactions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n39 |\nRisk Factors\nOur dependence on fuel sales also makes us susceptible to interruptions in fuel supply. Gasoline sales generate customer traffic to our retail fuel and convenience stores, and any decrease in gasoline sales, whether due to shortage or otherwise, could adversely affect our merchandise sales. A serious interruption in the supply of gasoline to our retail fuel and convenience stores could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGeneral economic conditions may adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nEconomic slowdowns may have serious negative consequences for our business and operating results, because our performance is subject to domestic economic conditions and their impact on levels of consumer spending. Some of the factors affecting consumer spending include general economic conditions, unemployment, consumer debt, reductions in net worth based on declines in equity markets and residential real estate values, adverse developments in mortgage markets, taxation, energy prices, interest rates, consumer confidence and other macroeconomic factors. Political instability and global health crises, such as the recent outbreak of the novel coronavirus, can also impact the global economy and decrease worldwide demand for oil and refined products. During a period of economic weakness or uncertainty, current or potential customers may travel less, reduce or defer purchases, go out of business or have insufficient funds to buy or pay for our products and services. Moreover, a financial market crisis may have a material adverse impact on financial institutions and limit access to capital and credit. This could, among other things, make it more difficult for us to obtain (or increase our cost of obtaining) capital and financing for our operations. Our access to additional capital may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all.\nAlso, because all of our operating refineries are located in the Gulf Coast Region, we primarily market our refined products in a relatively limited geographic area. As a result, we are more susceptible to regional economic conditions compared to our more geographically diversified competitors, and any unforeseen events or circumstances that affect the Gulf Coast Region could also materially and adversely affect our revenues and cash flows. The primary factors include, among other things, changes in the economy, weather conditions, demographics and population, increased supply of refined products from competitors and reductions in the supply of crude oil or other feedstocks. In the event of a shift in the supply/demand balance in the Gulf Coast Region due to changes in the local economy, an increase in aggregate refining capacity or other reasons, resulting in supply exceeding the demand in the region, our refineries may have to deliver refined products to more customers outside of the Gulf Coast Region and thus incur considerably higher transportation costs, resulting in lower refining margins, if any.\nAdditionally, general economic conditions in West Texas are highly dependent upon the price of crude oil. When crude oil prices exceed certain dollar per barrel thresholds, demand for people and equipment to support drilling and completion activities for the production of crude oil is robust, which supports overall economic health of the region. If crude oil prices fall below certain dollar per barrel thresholds, economic activity in the region may slow down, which could have a material adverse impact on the profitability of our business in West Texas.\nThe termination or expiration of our supply and offtake agreements could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity.\nOur supply and offtake agreements with J. Aron & Company (\"J. Aron\") have expiration dates ranging from April 2020 to May 2021. Pursuant to the agreements, J. Aron purchases a substantial portion of the crude oil and refined products in our refineries' inventory at market prices. Upon any termination of the agreements, including at expiration or in connection with a force majeure or default, the parties are required to negotiate with third parties for the assignment to us of certain contracts, commitments and arrangements, including procurement contracts, commitments for the sale of product and pipeline, terminalling, storage and shipping arrangements.\nIf there is negative publicity concerning our brand names or the brand names of our suppliers, fuel and merchandise sales in our retail segment may suffer.\nNegative publicity, regardless of whether the concerns are valid, concerning food, beverage, fuel or other product quality, food, beverage or other product safety or other health concerns, facilities, employee relations or other matters may materially and adversely affect demand for products offered at our stores and could result in a decrease in customer traffic to our stores. We offer food products in our stores that are marketed under our brand names and certain nationally recognized brands. These nationally recognized brands have significant operations at facilities owned and operated by third parties and negative publicity concerning these brands as a result of events that occur at facilities that we do not control could also adversely affect customer traffic to our stores. Additionally, we may be the subject of complaints or litigation arising from food or beverage-related illness or injury in general which could have a negative impact on our business. Health concerns, poor food, beverage, fuel or other product quality or operating issues stemming from one store or a limited number of stores can materially and adversely affect the operating results of some or all of our stores and harm our proprietary brands.\nWholesale cost increases, vendor pricing programs and tax increases applicable to tobacco products, as well as campaigns to discourage their use, could adversely impact our results of operations in our retail segment.\nIncreases in the retail price of tobacco products as a result of increased taxes or wholesale costs could materially impact our cigarette sales volume and/or revenues, merchandise gross profit and overall customer traffic. Cigarettes are subject to substantial and increasing excise taxes at both a state and federal level. In addition, national and local campaigns to discourage the use of tobacco products may have an adverse effect on demand for these products. A reduction in cigarette sales volume and/or revenues, merchandise gross profit from tobacco products or overall customer demand for tobacco products could have a material adverse effect on the business, financial condition and results of operations of our retail segment.\nIn addition, major cigarette manufacturers currently offer substantial rebates to us; however, there can be no assurance that such rebate programs\n40 |\nRisk Factors\nwill continue. We include these rebates as a component of our gross margin from sales of cigarettes. In the event these rebates are decreased or eliminated, or we fail to earn the rebates, our wholesale cigarette costs will increase. For example, certain major cigarette manufacturers have offered rebate programs that provide rebates only if we follow the manufacturer's retail pricing guidelines. If we do not receive the rebates, because we do not participate in the program or if the rebates we receive by participating in the program do not offset or surpass the revenue lost as a result of complying with the manufacturer's pricing guidelines, our cigarette gross margin will be adversely impacted. In general, we attempt to pass wholesale price increases on to our customers. However, competitive pressures in our markets may adversely impact our ability to do so. In addition, reduced retail display allowances on cigarettes offered by cigarette manufacturers negatively impact gross margins. These factors could materially impact our retail price of cigarettes, cigarette sales volume and/or revenues, merchandise gross profit and overall customer traffic, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur insurance policies do not cover all losses, costs or liabilities that we may experience, and insurance companies that currently insure companies in the energy industry may cease to do so or substantially increase premiums.\nWe carry property, business interruption, pollution, casualty and cyber insurance, but we do not maintain insurance coverage against all potential losses, costs or liabilities. We could suffer losses for uninsurable, or uninsured, risks or in amounts in excess of existing insurance coverage. In addition, we purchase insurance programs with large self-insured retentions and large deductibles. For example, we retain a short period of our business interruption losses. Therefore, a significant part, or all, of a business interruption loss or other types of loss could be retained by us. The occurrence of a loss that is retained by us, or not fully covered by insurance, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe energy industry is highly capital intensive, and the entire or partial loss of individual facilities or multiple facilities can result in significant costs to both energy industry companies, such as us, and their insurance carriers. Historically, large energy industry claims have resulted in significant increases in the level of premium costs and deductible periods for participants in the energy industry. For example, hurricanes have caused significant damage to energy companies operating along the Gulf Coast, in addition to numerous oil and gas production facilities and pipelines in that region. Insurance companies that have historically participated in underwriting energy-related risks may discontinue that practice, may reduce the insurance capacity they are willing to offer or demand significantly higher premiums or deductible periods to cover these risks. If significant changes in the number, or financial solvency, of insurance underwriters available to the energy industry occur, or if other adverse conditions over which we have no control prevail in the insurance market, we may be unable to obtain and maintain adequate insurance at reasonable cost.\nIn addition, we cannot assure that our insurers will renew our insurance coverage on acceptable terms, if at all, or that we will be able to arrange for adequate alternative coverage in the event of non-renewal. The unavailability of full insurance coverage to cover events in which we suffer significant losses could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to successfully execute our strategy of growth through acquisitions.\nA significant part of our growth strategy is to acquire assets, such as refineries, pipelines, terminals, and retail fuel and convenience stores that complement our existing assets and/or broaden our geographic presence. If attractive opportunities arise, we may also acquire assets in new lines of business that are complementary to our existing businesses. In the past we have acquired refineries, and we have developed our logistics segment through the acquisition of transportation and marketing assets. We expect to continue to acquire assets that complement our existing assets and/or broaden our geographic presence as a major element of our growth strategy. However, the occurrence of any of the following factors could adversely affect our growth strategy:\n\u2022\nWe may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or acquire additional assets on favorable terms;\n\u2022\nWe usually compete with others to acquire assets, which competition may increase, and any level of competition could result in decreased availability or increased prices for acquisition candidates;\n\u2022\nWe may experience difficulty in anticipating the timing and availability of acquisition candidates;\n\u2022\nWe may not be able to obtain the necessary financing, on favorable terms or at all, to finance any of our potential acquisitions; and\n\u2022\nAs a public company, we are subject to reporting obligations, internal controls and other accounting requirements with respect to any business we acquire, which may prevent or negatively affect the valuation of some acquisitions we might otherwise deem favorable or increase our acquisition costs.\nAcquisitions involve risks that could cause our actual growth or operating results to differ adversely compared with our expectations.\nDue to our emphasis on growth through acquisitions, we are particularly susceptible to transactional risks that could cause our actual growth or operating results to differ adversely compared with our expectations. For example:\n\u2022\nduring the acquisition process, we may fail, or be unable, to discover some of the liabilities of companies or businesses that we acquire;\n\u2022\nwe may assume contracts or other obligations in connection with particular acquisitions on terms that are less favorable or desirable than the terms that we would expect to obtain if we negotiated the contracts or other obligations directly;\n\u2022\nwe may fail to successfully integrate or manage acquired assets;\n41 |\nRisk Factors\n\u2022\nacquired assets may not perform as we expect, or we may not be able to obtain the cost savings and financial improvements we anticipate;\n\u2022\nacquisitions may require us to incur additional debt or issue additional equity;\n\u2022\nacquired assets may suffer a diminishment in fair value as a result of which we may need to record a write-down or impairment;\n\u2022\nwe may fail to grow our existing systems, financial controls, information systems, management resources and human resources in a manner that effectively supports our growth;\n\u2022\nto the extent that we acquire assets in new lines of business, we may become subject to additional regulatory requirements and additional risks that are characteristic or typical of these lines of business; and\n\u2022\nto the extent that we acquire equity interests in entities that control assets (rather than acquiring the assets directly), we may become subject to liabilities that predate our ownership and control of the assets.\nThe occurrence of any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur future results will suffer if we do not effectively manage our expanded operations.\nThe size and scope of operations of our business have increased. In addition, we may continue to expand our size and operations through additional acquisitions or other strategic transactions. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to manage our expanded business, which may pose substantial challenges for management, including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations including, without limitation, integrating new operations with those of our existing business, managing the increased scope or geographic diversity of our expanded business, and associated increased costs and complexity. There can be no assurance that we will be successful, or that we will realize the expected economies of scale, synergies and other benefits anticipated from any additional acquisitions or strategic transactions.\nWe may incur significant costs and liabilities with respect to investigation and remediation of environmental conditions at our facilities.\nPrior to our purchase of our refineries, pipelines, terminals and other facilities, the previous owners had been engaged for many years in the investigation and remediation of hydrocarbons and other materials which contaminated soil and groundwater. Upon purchase of the facilities, we became responsible and liable for certain costs associated with the continued investigation and remediation of known and unknown impacted areas at the facilities. In the future, it may be necessary to conduct further assessments and remediation efforts at impacted areas at our facilities and elsewhere. In addition, we have identified and self-reported certain other environmental matters subsequent to our purchase of our facilities.\nBased upon environmental evaluations performed internally and by third parties, we recorded and periodically update environmental liabilities and accrued amounts we believe are sufficient to complete remediation. We expect remediation at some properties to continue for the foreseeable future. The need to make future expenditures for these purposes that exceed the amounts we estimated and accrued for could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, Alon indemnified certain parties, to which they sold assets, for costs and liabilities that may be incurred as a result of environmental conditions existing at the time of such sales. As a result of our purchase of Alon, if we are forced to incur costs or pay liabilities in connection with these indemnification obligations, such costs and payments could be significant.\nIn the future, we may incur substantial expenditures for investigation or remediation of contamination that has not been discovered at our current or former locations or locations that we may acquire, or at third party sites where hazardous substances from these locations have been treated or disposed. Our handling and storage of petroleum and hazardous substances may lead to additional contamination at our facilities or along our pipelines and at facilities to which we send or have sent wastes or by-products for treatment or disposal. In addition, new legal requirements, new interpretations of existing legal requirements, increased legislative activity and governmental enforcement and other developments could require us to make additional unforeseen expenditures. As a result, we may be subject to additional investigation and remediation costs, governmental penalties and third-party suits alleging personal injury and property damage. Liabilities for future remediation costs are recorded when environmental assessments and/or remedial efforts are probable and costs can be reasonably estimated as material. Other than for assessments, the timing and magnitude of these accruals generally are based on the completion of investigations or other studies or a commitment to a formal plan of action.\nWe could incur substantial costs or disruptions in our business if we cannot obtain or maintain necessary permits and authorizations or otherwise comply with health, safety, environmental and other laws and regulations.\nOur operations require numerous permits and authorizations under various laws and regulations. These authorizations and permits are subject to revocation, renewal or modification, and can require operational changes to limit impacts or potential impacts on the environment and/or health and safety. A violation of authorization or permit conditions or other legal or regulatory requirements could result in substantial fines, criminal sanctions, permit revocations, injunctions and/or facility shutdowns. In addition, major modifications of our operations could require modifications to our existing permits or upgrades to our existing pollution control equipment. Any, or all, of these matters could have a negative effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows.\n42 |\nRisk Factors\nOur Tyler refinery currently primarily distributes refined petroleum products via truck or rail. We do not have the ability to distribute these products into markets outside our local market via pipeline.\nIn recent years, we have expanded our refined product distribution capabilities in northeast Texas with our acquisition of refined product terminals in Big Sandy and Mt. Pleasant, Texas and through the use of transloading facilities enabling the shipment of products by rail to distant markets, including Mexico. However, unlike most refineries, the Tyler refinery currently has limited ability to distribute refined products outside its local market in northeast Texas due to a lack of pipeline assets connecting the facility to other markets. This limited ability may limit the refinery\u2019s ability to increase the production of petroleum products, attract new customers for its refined petroleum products or increase sales of products from the refinery. In addition, if demand for petroleum products diminishes in northeast Texas, the refinery may be required to reduce production levels and our financial results may be adversely affected.\nAn increase in competition, and/or reduction in demand in the markets in which we purchase feedstocks and sell our refined products, could increase our costs and/or lower prices and adversely affect our sales and profitability.\nCertain of our refineries operate in localized or niche markets. If competitors commence operations within these niche markets, we could lose our niche market advantage, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, where feedstocks are purchased in a localized market, disruptions in supply channels could significantly impact our ability to meet production demands in those facilities.\nIn addition, the maintenance, or replacement, of our existing customers depends on a number of factors outside of our control, including increased competition from other suppliers and demand for refined products in the markets we serve. The market for distribution of wholesale motor fuel is highly competitive and fragmented. Some of our competitors have significantly greater resources and name recognition than us. The loss of major customers, or a reduction in amounts purchased by major customers, could have a material adverse effect on us to the extent that we are not able to correspondingly increase sales to other purchasers.\nCompliance with and changes in tax laws could adversely affect our performance.\nWe are subject to extensive tax liabilities, including federal and state income taxes and transactional taxes, such as excise, sales/use, payroll, franchise, withholding and ad valorem taxes. New tax laws and regulations, and changes in existing tax laws and regulations, are continuously being enacted or proposed that could result in increased expenditures for tax liabilities in the future. Certain of these liabilities are subject to periodic audits by the respective taxing authority, which could increase or otherwise alter our tax liabilities. Subsequent changes to our tax liabilities as a result of these audits may also subject us to interest and penalties, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFor example, the tax treatment of our logistics segment depends on its status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. If a change in law, our failure to comply with existing law or other factors were to cause our logistics segment to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, it would become subject to entity-level taxation. As a result, our logistics segment would pay federal income tax on all of its taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates (subject to corporate alternative minimum tax for years ended prior to 2018), would likely pay additional state and local income taxes at varying rates, and distributions to unitholders, including us, would be generally treated as taxable dividends from a corporation. In such case, the logistics segment would likely experience a material reduction in its anticipated cash flow and after-tax return to its unitholders, and we would likely experience a substantial reduction in its value.\nOn December 22, 2017, tax legislation commonly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"Tax Reform Act\") was enacted. In the absence of guidance on various uncertainties and ambiguities in the application of certain provisions of the Tax Reform Act, we will use what we believe are reasonable interpretations and assumptions in applying the Tax Reform Act, but it is possible that the IRS could issue subsequent guidance or take positions on audit that differ from our prior interpretations and assumptions, which could adversely impact our cash tax liabilities, results of operations, and financial condition.\nAdverse weather conditions or other unforeseen developments could damage our facilities, reduce customer traffic and impair our ability to produce and deliver refined petroleum products or receive supplies for our retail fuel and convenience stores.\nThe regions in which we operate are susceptible to severe storms, including hurricanes, thunderstorms, tornadoes, floods, extended periods of rain, ice storms and snow, all of which we have experienced in the past few years. Our facilities located in California and the related pipeline are located in areas with a history of earthquakes, some of which have been quite severe. In addition, for a variety of reasons, many members of the scientific community believe that climate changes are occurring that could have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts and floods and other climatic events. If any such effects were to occur, they could have an adverse effect on our assets and operations.\nInclement weather conditions, earthquakes or other unforeseen developments could damage our facilities, interrupt production, adversely impact consumer behavior, travel and retail fuel and convenience store traffic patterns or interrupt or impede our ability to operate our locations. If such conditions prevail near our refineries, they could interrupt or undermine our ability to produce and transport products from our refineries and receive and distribute products at our terminals. Regional occurrences, such as energy shortages or increases in energy prices, fires and other natural disasters, could also hurt our business. The occurrence of any of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n43 |\nRisk Factors\nOur operating results are seasonal and generally lower in the first and fourth quarters of the year for our refining and logistics segments and in the first quarter of the year for our retail segment. We depend on favorable weather conditions in the spring and summer months.\nDemand for gasoline, convenience merchandise and asphalt products is generally higher during the summer months than during the winter months due to seasonal increases in motor vehicle traffic and road and home construction. Varying vapor pressure requirements between the summer and winter months also tighten summer gasoline supply. As a result, the operating results of our refining segment and logistics segment are generally lower for the first and fourth quarters of each year. Seasonal fluctuations in traffic also affect sales of motor fuels and merchandise in our retail fuel and convenience stores. As a result, the operating results of our retail segment are generally lower for the first quarter of the year.\nWeather conditions in our operating area also have a significant effect on our operating results in our retail segment. Customers are more likely to purchase more gasoline and higher profit margin items such as fast foods, fountain drinks and other beverages during the spring and summer months. Unfavorable weather conditions during these months and a resulting lack of the expected seasonal upswings in traffic and sales could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA substantial portion of the workforce at our refineries is unionized, and we may face labor disruptions that would interfere with our operations.\nAs of December 31, 2019, approximately 14.4% of our employees were represented by unions and/or covered by a collective bargaining agreement. None of our employees in our logistics segment, retail segment or in our corporate office are represented by a union. We consider our relations with our employees to be satisfactory. Although the collective bargaining agreements contain provisions to discourage strikes or work stoppages, we cannot assure that strikes or work stoppages will not occur. A strike or work stoppage could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on information technology in our operations, and any material failure, inadequacy, interruption, cyber-attack or security failure of that technology could harm our business.\nWe rely on information technology across our operations, including the control of our refinery processes, monitoring the movement of petroleum through our pipelines and terminals, the point of sale processing at our retail sites and various other processes and transactions. We utilize information technology systems and controls throughout our operations to capture accounting, technical and regulatory data for subsequent archiving, analysis and reporting. Disruption, failure, or cyber security breaches affecting or targeting our computer and telecommunications, our infrastructure, or the infrastructure of our cloud-based IT service providers may materially impact our business and operations. An undetected failure of these systems, because of power loss, unsuccessful transition to upgraded or replacement systems, unauthorized access or other cyber breach or attack could result in disruption to our business operations, access to or disclosure or loss of data and/or proprietary information, personal injuries and environmental damage, which could have an adverse effect on our business, reputation, and effectiveness. We could also be subject to resulting investigation and remediation costs as well as regulatory enforcement of private litigation and related costs, which could have a material adverse impact on our cash flow and results of operations.\nWe rely on commercially available systems, software, tools and monitoring to provide security for processing, transmission and storage of confidential customer information, such as payment card and personal credit information.\nIn addition, the systems currently used for transmission and approval of payment card transactions, and the technology utilized in payment cards themselves, may put certain payment card data at risk. These standards for determining the required controls applicable to these systems are mandated by credit card issuers and administered by the Payment Card Industry Security Standards Counsel and not by us. The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding, with the frequent imposition of new and constantly changing requirements. We have taken the necessary steps to comply with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards (PCI-DSS) at all of our locations. However, compliance with these requirements may result in cost increases due to necessary systems changes and the development of new administrative processes.\nIn recent years, several retailers have experienced data breaches, resulting in the exposure of sensitive customer data, including payment card information. A breach could also originate from, or compromise, our customers' and vendors' or other third-party networks outside of our control. Any compromise or breach of our information and payment technology systems could cause interruptions in our operations, damage our reputation, reduce our customers' willingness to visit our sites and conduct business with them, or expose us to litigation from customers or sanctions for violations of the PCI-DSS. In addition, a compromise of our internal data network at any of our refining or terminal locations may have disruptive impacts similar to that of our retail operations. These disruptions could range from inconvenience in accessing business information to a disruption in our refining operations.\nDespite our security measures, we experience attempts by external parties to penetrate and attack our networks and systems. Although such attempts to date have not, to our knowledge, resulted in any material breaches, disruptions, or loss of business-critical information, our systems and procedures for protecting against such attacks and mitigating such risks may prove to be insufficient in the future and such attacks could have an adverse impact on our business and operations, including damage to our reputation and competitiveness, remediation costs, litigation or regulatory actions. In addition, as technologies evolve, and cyber-attacks become more sophisticated, we may incur significant costs to upgrade or enhance our security measures to protect against such attacks and we may face difficulties in fully anticipating or implementing adequate preventive measures or mitigating potential harm. We could also be liable under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, subject to\n44 |\nRisk Factors\nregulatory penalties, experience damage to our reputation or a loss of consumer confidence, or incur additional costs for remediation and modification or enhancement of our information systems to prevent future occurrences, all of which could adversely affect our reputation, business, operations or financial results.\nIf we lose any of our key personnel, our ability to manage our business and continue our growth could be negatively impacted.\nOur future performance depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our senior management team and key technical personnel. We do not currently maintain key person life insurance policies for any of our senior management team. The loss or unavailability to us of any member of our senior management team or a key technical employee could significantly harm us. We face competition for these professionals from our competitors, our customers and other companies operating in our industry. To the extent that the services of members of our senior management team and key technical personnel would be unavailable to us for any reason, we would be required to hire other personnel to manage and operate our company and to develop our products and technology. We cannot assure that we would be able to locate or employ such qualified personnel on acceptable terms or at all.\nIf we are, or become, a United States real property holding corporation, special tax rules may apply to a sale, exchange or other disposition of common stock, and non-U.S. holders may be less inclined to invest in our stock, as they may be subject to United States federal income tax in certain situations.\nA non-U.S. holder of our common stock may be subject to United States federal income tax with respect to gain recognized on the sale, exchange or other disposition of our common stock if we are, or were, a \"U.S. real property holding corporation\" (\"USRPHC\") at any time during the shorter of the five-year period ending on the date of the sale or other disposition and the period such non-U.S. holder held our common stock (the shorter period referred to as the \"lookback period\"). In general, we would be a USRPHC if the fair market value of our \"U.S. real property interests,\" as such term is defined for United States federal income tax purposes, equals or exceeds 50% of the sum of the fair market value of our worldwide real property interests and our other assets used or held for use in a trade or business. The test for determining USRPHC status is applied on certain specific determination dates and is dependent upon a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control (including, for example, fluctuations in the value of our assets). If we are or become a USRPHC, so long as our common stock is regularly traded on an established securities market such as the NYSE, only a non-U.S. holder who, actually or constructively, holds or held during the lookback period more than five percent of our common stock will be subject to United States federal income tax on the disposition of our common stock.\nLoss of or reductions to tax incentives for biodiesel production may have a material adverse effect on earnings, profitability and cash flows relating to our renewable fuels facilities.\nThe biodiesel industry has historically been substantially aided by federal and state tax incentives. One tax incentive program that has been significant to our renewable fuels facilities is the federal blender's tax credit. The blender's tax credit (or biodiesel tax credit) provides a $1.00 refundable tax credit per gallon of pure biodiesel, or B100, to the first blender of biodiesel with petroleum-based diesel fuel. The blender's tax credit has expired on several occasions, only to be reinstated on a retroactive basis. The blender's tax credit was re-enacted in December 2019 for the years 2020 through 2022 and was retroactively reinstated for 2018 and 2019. Previously, the blender's tax credit expired on December 31, 2016, but was retroactively reinstated during the first quarter of 2018 to extend through December 31, 2017. See Note 4 of the consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information regarding the extension of this tax credit.\nIt is uncertain what action, if any, Congress may take with respect to reinstating the blender's tax credit beyond 2022 or when such action might be effective. If Congress does not reinstate the credit for future years, it may result in a material adverse effect on the earnings, profitability and cash flows relating to our renewable fuels facilities.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nThe market price of our common stock may be influenced by many factors, some of which may be beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nour quarterly or annual earnings, or those of other companies in our industry;\n\u2022\ninaccuracies in, and changes to, our previously published quarterly or annual earnings;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u2022\neconomic conditions within our industry, as well as general economic and stock market conditions;\n\u2022\nthe failure of securities analysts to cover our common stock, or the cessation of such coverage;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates by securities analysts and the frequency and accuracy of such reports;\n\u2022\nfuture issuance or sales of our common stock;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant contracts or acquisitions;\n\u2022\nsales of common stock by our senior officers or our affiliates; and\n45 |\nRisk Factors\n\u2022\nthe other factors described in these \"Risk Factors.\"\nIn recent years, the stock market in general, and the market for energy companies in particular, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. This volatility has had a significant impact on the market price of securities issued by many companies, including companies in our industry. The trading price of Delek common stock and, prior to the Delek/Alon Merger, Old Delek common stock, has been volatile over the past three years. The changes often occur without any apparent regard to the operating performance of these companies, and these fluctuations could materially reduce our stock price.\nStockholder activism may negatively impact the price of our common stock.\nOur stockholders may from time to time engage in proxy solicitations, advance stockholder proposals or otherwise attempt to effect changes or acquire control over us. Campaigns by stockholders to effect changes at publicly traded companies are sometimes led by investors seeking to increase short-term stockholder value through actions such as financial restructuring, increased debt, special dividends, stock repurchases or sales of assets or the entire company. Responding to proxy contests and other actions by activist stockholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupting our operations and diverting the attention of our Board of Directors and senior management from the pursuit of business strategies. As a result, stockholder campaigns could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nFuture sales of shares of our common stock could depress the price of our common stock, and could result in substantial dilution to our stockholders.\nWe may sell securities in the public or private equity markets, regardless of our need for capital, and even when conditions are not otherwise favorable. The market price of our common stock could decline as a result of the introduction of a large number of shares of our common stock into the market or the perception that these sales could occur. Sales of a large number of shares of our common stock, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate.\nOur stockholders will suffer dilution if we issue currently unissued shares of our stock or sell our treasury holdings in the future. Our stockholders will also suffer dilution as stock, restricted stock units, stock options, stock appreciation rights, warrants or other equity awards, whether currently outstanding or subsequently granted, are exercised.\nWe depend upon our subsidiaries for cash to meet our obligations and pay any dividends.\nWe are a holding company. Our subsidiaries conduct substantially all of our operations and own substantially all of our assets. Consequently, our cash flow and our ability to meet our obligations or pay dividends to our stockholders depend upon the cash flow of our subsidiaries and the payment of funds by our subsidiaries to us in the form of dividends, distributions, tax sharing payments or otherwise. Our subsidiaries' ability to make any payments will depend on many factors, including their earnings, cash flows, the terms of any applicable credit facilities, tax considerations and legal restrictions.\nWe may be unable to pay future regular dividends in the anticipated amounts and frequency set forth herein.\nWe will only be able to pay regular dividends from our available cash on hand and funds received from our subsidiaries. Our ability to receive dividends and other cash payments from our subsidiaries may be restricted under the terms of any applicable credit facilities. For example, under the terms of their credit facilities, Delek Logistics and its subsidiaries are subject to certain customary covenants that limit their ability to, subject to certain exceptions as defined in their respective credit agreements, remit cash to, distribute assets to, or make investments in us as the parent company. Specifically, these covenants limit the payment, in the form of cash or other assets, of dividends or other cash payments to us. The declaration of future regular dividends on our common stock will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon many factors, including our results of operations, financial condition, earnings, capital requirements, restrictions in our debt agreements and legal requirements. Although we currently intend to pay regular quarterly cash dividends on our common stock, we cannot provide any assurances that any regular dividends will be paid in the anticipated amounts and frequency set forth herein, if at all.\nProvisions of Delaware law and our organizational documents may discourage takeovers and business combinations that our stockholders may consider in their best interests, which could negatively affect our stock price.\nProvisions of Delaware law, our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and our Amended and Restated Bylaws may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company or deterring tender offers for our common stock that other stockholders may consider in their best interests. For example, our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation provides that:\n\u2022\nstockholder actions may only be taken at annual or special meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022\nmembers of our Board of Directors can be removed with or without cause by a supermajority vote of stockholders;\n\u2022\nthe Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware is, with certain exceptions, the exclusive forum for certain legal actions;\n\u2022\nour bylaws, as may be in effect from time to time, can be amended only by a supermajority vote of stockholders; and\n\u2022\ncertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation, as may be in effect from time to time, can be amended only by a supermajority vote of stockholders.\n46 |\nRisk Factors\nIn addition, our Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation authorizes us to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more different series, with terms to be fixed by our Board of Directors. Stockholder approval is not necessary to issue preferred stock in this manner. Issuance of these shares of preferred stock could have the effect of making it more difficult and more expensive for a person or group to acquire control of us and could effectively be used as an anti-takeover device. On the date of this report, no shares of our preferred stock are outstanding.\nFinally, our Amended and Restated Bylaws provide for an advance notice procedure for stockholders to nominate director candidates for election or to bring business before an annual meeting of stockholders and require that special meetings of stockholders be called only by our chairman of the Board of Directors, president or secretary after written request of a majority of our Board of Directors. The advance notice provision requires disclosure of derivative positions, hedging transactions, short interests, rights to dividends and other similar positions of any stockholder proposing a director nomination, in order to promote full disclosure of such stockholder's economic interest in us.\nThe anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law and provisions in our organizational documents may prevent our stockholders from receiving the benefit from any premium to the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a takeover context. Even in the absence of a takeover attempt, the existence of these provisions may adversely affect the prevailing market price of our common stock if they are viewed as discouraging takeover attempts in the future.\nFinancial Instrument and Credit Profile Risks\nChanges in our credit profile could affect our relationships with our suppliers, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our ability to operate our refineries at full capacity.\nChanges in our credit profile could affect the way crude oil, feedstock and refined product suppliers view our ability to make payments. As a result, suppliers could shorten the payment terms of their invoices with us, or require us to provide significant collateral to them that we do not currently provide. Due to the large dollar amounts and volume of our crude oil and other petroleum product purchases, as well as the historical volatility of crude oil pricing, any imposition by our suppliers of more burdensome payment terms, or collateral requirements, may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our ability to make payments to our suppliers. This, in turn, could cause us to be unable to operate our refineries at desired capacities. A failure to operate our refineries at desired capacities could adversely affect our profitability and cash flows.\nOur commodity and interest rate derivative activity may limit potential gains, increase potential losses, result in earnings volatility and involve other risks.\nAt times, we enter into commodity derivative contracts to manage our price exposure to our inventory positions, future purchases of crude oil, ethanol and other feedstocks, future sales of refined products, manage our RINs exposure or to secure margins on future production. At times we also enter into interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our market exposure to changes in interest rates related to our floating rate borrowings. We expect to continue to enter into these types of transactions from time to time and have increased our use of commodity risk management activities in recent years.\nWhile these transactions are intended to limit our exposure to the adverse effects of fluctuations in crude oil prices, refined products prices, RIN prices and interest rates, they may also limit our ability to benefit from favorable changes in market conditions, and may subject us to period-by-period earnings volatility in the instances where we do not seek hedge accounting for these transactions. Further, depending on the volume of commodity derivative activity as compared to our actual use of crude oil, production of refined products or total RINs exposure, our risk management activity may only partially limit our exposure to market volatility. Also, in connection with such derivative transactions, we may be required to make cash payments or provide letters of credit to maintain margin accounts and to settle the contracts at their value upon termination. Finally, this activity exposes us to potential risk of counterparties to our derivative contracts failing to perform under the contracts. As a result, the effectiveness of our risk management policies could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and cash flows. For additional information about the nature and volume of these transactions, see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nAdditionally, it continues to be a strategic and operational objective to manage supply risk related to crude oil that is used in refinery production, and to develop strategic sourcing relationships. For that purpose, we often enter into purchase and sale contracts with vendors and customers or take financial commodity positions for crude oil that may not be used immediately in production, but that may be used to manage the overall supply and availability of crude expected to ultimately be needed for production and/or to meet minimum requirements under strategic pipeline arrangements, and also to optimize and hedge availability risks associated with crude that we ultimately expect to use in production. Such transactions are inherently based on certain assumptions and judgments made about the current and possible future availability of crude. Therefore, when we take physical or financial positions for optimization purposes, our intent is generally to take offsetting positions in quantities and at prices that will advance these objectives while minimizing our positional and financial statement risk. However, because of the volatility of the market in terms of pricing and availability, it is possible that we may have material positions with timing differences or, more rarely, that we are unable to cover a position with an offsetting position as intended. Also, in connection with such transactions, we may be required to make cash payments or provide letters of credit to maintain margin accounts and to settle the contracts at their value upon termination. Finally, this activity exposes us to potential risk of counterparties to our derivative contracts failing to perform under the contracts.\n47 |\nRisk Factors\nAs a result of the risks described above, the effectiveness of our risk management policies over these types of transactions and positions could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and cash flows. For additional information about the nature and volume of these transactions, see Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in Note 12 of our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8, Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe are exposed to certain counterparty risks which may adversely impact our results of operations.\nWe evaluate the creditworthiness of each of our various counterparties, but we may not always be able to fully anticipate or detect deterioration in a counterparty's creditworthiness and overall financial condition. The deterioration of creditworthiness or overall financial condition of a material counterparty (or counterparties) could expose us to an increased risk of nonpayment or other default under our contracts with them. If a material counterparty (or counterparties) defaults on their obligations to us, this could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. For example, under the terms of the supply and offtake agreements with J. Aron, we grant J. Aron the exclusive right to store and withdraw crude and certain products in the tanks associated with the El Dorado, Big Spring and Krotz Springs refineries. These agreements also provide that the ownership of substantially all crude oil and certain other refined products in the tanks associated with these refineries will be retained by J. Aron, and that J. Aron will purchase substantially all of the specified refined products processed at these refineries. An adverse change in J. Aron's business, results of operations, liquidity or financial condition could adversely affect its ability to timely discharge its obligations to us, which could consequently have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or liquidity.\nFrom time to time, our cash and credit needs may exceed our internally generated cash flow and available credit, and our business could be materially and adversely affected if we are not able to obtain the necessary cash or credit from financing sources.\nWe have significant short-term cash needs to satisfy working capital requirements, such as crude oil purchases which fluctuate with the pricing and sourcing of crude oil. We rely in part on our access to credit to purchase crude oil for our refineries. If the price of crude oil increases significantly, we may not have sufficient available credit, and may not be able to sufficiently increase such availability, under our existing credit facilities or other arrangements, to purchase enough crude oil to operate our refineries at desired capacities. Our failure to operate our refineries at desired capacities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We also have significant long-term needs for cash, including any capital expenditures for growth projects, sustaining maintenance, as well as projects necessary for regulatory compliance.\nDepending on the conditions in the credit markets, it may become more difficult to obtain cash or credit from third-party sources. If we cannot generate cash flow or otherwise secure sufficient liquidity to support our short-term and long-term capital requirements, we may not be able to comply with regulatory deadlines or pursue our business strategies, in which case our operations may not perform as well as we currently expect.\nOur debt levels may limit our flexibility in obtaining additional financing and in pursuing other business opportunities.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had total debt of $2,067.1 million, including current maturities of $36.4 million. In addition to our outstanding debt, as of December 31, 2019, our letters of credit issued under our various credit facilities were $309.8 million. Our borrowing availability under our various credit facilities as of December 31, 2019 was $921.8 million.\nOur level of debt could have important consequences for us. For example, it could:\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to service our debt and lease obligations, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\nplace us at a disadvantage relative to our competitors that have less indebtedness or better access to capital by, for example, limiting our ability to enter into new markets, upgrade our fixed assets or pursue acquisitions or other business opportunities;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to borrow additional funds in the future; and\n\u2022\nincrease interest costs for our borrowed funds and letters of credit.\nIn addition, a substantial portion of our debt has a variable rate of interest, which increases our exposure to interest rate fluctuations, to the extent we elect not to hedge such exposures.\nIf we are unable to meet our principal and interest obligations under our debt and lease agreements, we could be forced to restructure or refinance our obligations, seek additional equity financing or sell assets, which we may not be able to do on satisfactory terms or at all. Our default on any of those agreements could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if new debt is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face could intensify.\n48 |\nRisk Factors\nOur debt agreements contain operating and financial restrictions that might constrain our business and financing activities.\nThe operating and financial restrictions and covenants in our credit facilities and any future financing agreements could adversely affect our ability to finance future operations or capital needs or to engage in, expand or pursue our business activities. For example, to varying degrees our credit facilities restrict our ability to:\n\u2022\ndeclare dividends and redeem or repurchase capital stock;\n\u2022\nprepay, redeem or repurchase debt;\n\u2022\nmake loans and investments, issue guaranties and pledge assets;\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness or amend our debt and other material agreements;\n\u2022\nmake capital expenditures;\n\u2022\nengage in mergers, acquisitions and asset sales; and\n\u2022\nenter into certain intercompany arrangements or make certain intercompany payments, which in some instances could restrict our ability to use the assets, cash flows or earnings of one operating segment to support another operating segment or Holdings.\nOther restrictive covenants require that we meet certain financial covenants, including leverage coverage, fixed charge coverage and net worth tests, as described in the applicable credit agreements. In addition, the covenant requirements of our various credit agreements require us to make many subjective determinations pertaining to our compliance thereto and exercise good faith judgment in determining our compliance.\nOur ability to comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in our debt instruments may be affected by events beyond our control, including prevailing economic, financial and industry conditions. If market or other economic conditions deteriorate, our ability to comply with these covenants and restrictions may be impaired. If we breach any of the restrictions or covenants in our debt agreements, a significant portion of our indebtedness may become immediately due and payable, and our lenders' commitments to make further loans to us may terminate. We might not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient funds to make these immediate payments. In addition, our obligations under our credit facilities are secured by substantially all of our assets. If we are unable to timely repay our obligations under our credit facilities, the lenders could seek to foreclose on the assets, or we may be required to contribute additional capital to certain of our subsidiaries. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFluctuations in interest rates could materially affect our financial results.\nBecause a significant portion of our debt bears interest at variable rates, increases in interest rates could materially increase our interest expense. The use of interest rate hedges, including of the types we have employed in the past, may not be effective at mitigating this risk.\nFurther, the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) and certain other interest rate \"benchmarks\" are the subject of recent proposals for reform. These reforms may cause such benchmarks to perform differently than in the past or have other consequences which cannot be predicted. The United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, has publicly announced that it intends to discontinue the reporting of LIBOR rates after 2021. Certain of our agreements use LIBOR as a \u201cbenchmark\u201d or \u201creference rate\u201d for various terms. Some agreements contain an existing LIBOR alternative. Where there is not an alternative, we expect to replace the LIBOR benchmark with an alternative reference rate. While we do not expect the transition to an alternative rate to have a significant impact on our business or operations, it is possible that the move away from LIBOR could materially impact our borrowing costs on our variable rate indebtedness.\nWe may refinance a significant amount of indebtedness and otherwise require additional financing; we cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain the necessary funds on favorable terms or at all.\nWe may elect to refinance certain of our indebtedness, even if not required to do so by the terms of such indebtedness. In addition, we may need, or want, to raise additional funds for our operations. We have been, and may continue to be, engaged in discussions with certain potential financing sources, which could provide a source of additional funds and liquidity for our operations. However, our ability to obtain such financing will depend on, among other factors, prevailing market conditions at the time of the proposed financing and other factors beyond our control. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nWe recorded goodwill and other intangible assets that could become impaired and result in material non-cash charges to our results of operations in the future.\nThe Delek/Alon Merger has been accounted for as an acquisition, by us, of Alon in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the assets and liabilities of Alon and its subsidiaries have been recorded, as of the completion of the Delek/Alon Merger, at their respective fair values. Under the acquisition method of accounting, the total purchase price has been allocated to Alon\u2019s tangible assets and liabilities and identifiable intangible assets based on their estimated fair values as of the date of completion of the Delek/Alon Merger. The excess of the purchase price over those estimated fair values has been recorded as goodwill. To the extent the value of goodwill or intangibles becomes impaired, we may be required to incur material non-cash charges relating to such impairment. Our financial condition and operating results may be significantly impacted from both the impairment and the underlying trends in the business that triggered the impairment.\n49 |", "PERMNO": 91215, "SIC": 2911, "TIC": "DK"}
