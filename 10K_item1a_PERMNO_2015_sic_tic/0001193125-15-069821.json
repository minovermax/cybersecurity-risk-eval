{"cik": "1066104", "company": "CORPORATE EXECUTIVE BOARD CO", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThe following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. In addition to the risks discussed below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, other risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial could, in the future, materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results.\nRisks related to our business\nWe may fail to attract new members to our programs, services, and products, obtain renewals from existing members, or sell additional programs, services, and products.\nWe derive the majority of our revenue from annual memberships for our programs, products, and services. Revenue growth depends on our ability to attract prospects to their first membership, sustain a high renewal rate of existing memberships, and sell additional products and services to existing members. This depends on our ability to understand and anticipate market and pricing trends and members\u2019 needs, deliver high-quality and timely products and services to members, and deliver products and services that are more desirable than those of our competition. This also depends on our ability to effectively identify, reach, and engage prospects to promote our offerings. Failure to achieve new member additions, to deliver acceptable member renewal rate levels, or to cross-sell additional memberships and products to existing members at the level we forecast, could materially and adversely affect our operating results.\nWe may have difficulty anticipating member needs and demands, providing relevant support and advice, and developing new, profitable products and services.\nOur best practice and decision support programs, products, and services provide insights, information, advice, and tools to business executives and professionals. Our continuing and future success depends on our ability to anticipate changing market trends and adapt our products and services to the evolving needs of our members, including in new and developing industries, business sectors, government entities, and geographies. The industries, business sectors, government entities, and geographies that we serve undergo frequent changes, which present significant challenges to our ability to provide members and prospective members with current and timely products and services. If the new programs, products, and services we have developed are not timely or relevant, we may experience increased member turnover, lower new business and renewal bookings, and decreased cross-sales of additional products and services to existing members, which could materially and adversely affect our operating results and future growth.\nWe may fail to continue to effectively develop, validate, support, and sell the products, services, and tools in our talent management business or extend our sales of those products, services and tools to new and existing markets and geographies.\nOur talent management business develops, validates, supports, and sells products, services, and tools for employee assessment, development, and performance management; including for talent acquisition, talent development, and talent strategy and analytics. These products, services, and tools are based on the use of science and data to develop an integrated talent management strategy for clients that drives business outcomes. Revenue growth of our talent management products, including those within the SHL Talent Measurement segment as well as those that we have acquired or are developing, depends on our expertise, our ability to continue to acquire and develop predictive assessment intellectual property, our cloud-based SaaS platform, our proprietary database, our ability to measure results, our ability to integrate these tools and services into a unified set of product offerings, and a continuing and growing interest in managing talent through analytics specifically and in human capital management generally. Failure to maintain our expertise, develop additional and validated predictive assessment and measurement tools, extend the adoption of SaaS and SaaS-related efforts as a mechanism for delivering our products, services, and tools, expand our proprietary database, demonstrate success, or a slowing or uneven interest in managing talent through analytics either in our existing or developing markets, could materially and adversely affect our operating results.\nWe may not compete successfully and, as a result, may experience reduced or limited demand for our programs, products, and services.\nThe broad advisory services industry, as well as the human capital management sector, in which we operate is a highly competitive industry with low barriers to entry; numerous substitute products and services; shifting strategies and market positions including consolidation; many differentiators; and large global providers as well as strong local and regional competitors. We generally compete against traditional consulting firms, benchmarking firms, research and data analytics firms, training and development firms, trade associations, nonprofit organizations, and research and database companies, as well as providers of free content over the Internet and through other delivery channels. Many of our competitors are significantly larger than we are, have greater resources, and have the ability to grow and make transformative moves in the marketplace for advisory services and human capital management solutions. We also compete against new entrants from the SaaS or data analytics industries, as well as against developing technologies such as social media, business intelligence software, and workflow software. To compete successfully and achieve our growth targets, we must successfully serve new and existing members with current products and services while developing and investing in new and competitive products and services for US and international members. Our failure to compete effectively with our competitors, both in terms of the quality and scope of our products and services, and in terms of price, could materially and adversely affect our operating results and future growth.\nWe may not compete successfully and, as a result, may experience reduced or limited demand for our talent management products, including our talent acquisition, talent development, and talent strategy and analytics tools and services.\nThe human capital management business, including the talent acquisition, talent development, and talent strategy and analytics business is a highly competitive and developing industry with numerous specialists. Our SHL Talent Measurement segment generally competes against role- or geographic-focused assessment companies, SaaS providers, professional/consulting services, and data analytics firms. To compete successfully and achieve our growth targets for the talent management business, including our SHL Talent Measurement segment, we must continue to support and develop science-based assessment and analytics solutions; maintain and grow our proprietary database; deliver demonstrable return on investment to clients; support our products and services globally; support our cloud-based technology; and continue to provide consulting and training to support our assessment products. Our failure to compete effectively with our competitors could adversely affect our operating results and future growth.\nWe may be unable to protect our intellectual property.\nOur success is dependent on our intellectual property, which is the foundation for our programs, products, services, and tools. We rely on a combination of internal controls, contractual arrangements, and legal protections to protect our proprietary rights in our products and services. We cannot assure that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights will be adequate to deter misappropriation of our intellectual property or confidential information, or that we will be able to detect unauthorized use and take timely and effective steps to enforce our rights, particularly as we expand our business to new geographies, where the legal and regulatory framework related to the protection of intellectual property may be less robust than in the United States and Europe. If substantial and material unauthorized use of our proprietary products and services were to occur, we would be required to engage in costly and time-consuming litigation to enforce our rights, and we might not prevail in such litigation. If others were able to use our intellectual property, our ability to charge our fees for our programs, products, services, or tools could be adversely affected. In addition, we may be subject to infringement claims as we become more well-known to non-practicing entities, sometimes referred to as patent trolls, or to competitors, that assert patents against other entities.\nWe may be exposed to litigation.\nAs a publisher and distributor of original research, analysis, and surveys; a user of third-party content; an on-line content provider through our products and services; a developer and provider of talent acquisition, talent development, and talent strategy and analytics tools; and a global company with offices, operations, employees, and business partners around the world, we face potential liability for trademark and copyright infringement, discriminatory impact, and other claims based on our products and services; as well as potential liability related to our operations, employee relations, and business practices. Any such litigation, regardless of the merits and whether or not resulting in a judgment against us, could subject us to reputational harm and have a materially adverse effect on our operating results. In addition, certain of our talent measurement and assessment products may carry risks of litigation for claims of non-compliance with employment laws related to hiring and promotion. To the extent clients choose not to purchase these products, or to the extent these claims are successful, these obligations could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe may experience confusion about our brand.\nMarket perceptions of our brand affect our reputation in the marketplace and our ability to attract and retain members and clients. In 2012, we rebranded CEB, which involved changing our master brand as well as several of our sub-brands for specific lines of business and offerings across both the parent company and some subsidiaries. In 2013 and 2014, we integrated the brand of the SHL Talent Measurement-related products and services, as well as the products associated with other acquisitions, in order to operate with a unified brand strategy. We are continuing our brand management efforts in 2015. If our members and clients, or prospective members or clients, are confused by our brand strategy, or if we do not effectively transfer brand equity from our legacy or acquired brands, or if our efforts to extend our brand equity from these various brands into existing or target markets are unsuccessful, our operating results and future growth could be adversely affected.\nContinuing uncertainty in the global economy, including in Europe and emerging markets, as well as the current political situation in the United States, including the continuing US Federal government spending restrictions, could adversely impact our business, operating results, financial condition, and liquidity.\nContinuing global economic uncertainty, including in Europe and emerging markets, as well as the current political situation in the United States, could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition, and liquidity. These conditions also could materially and adversely impact our existing and prospective members and clients, vendors, business partners, and growth prospects. If we are unable to successfully anticipate or adapt to uncertain or changing economic, financial, market, and government conditions, we may be unable to effectively plan for and respond to these changes, and our business could be materially and adversely affected. While we market and sell our products and services throughout the year, a significant percentage of our new business and renewal bookings within CEB historically have taken place in the first and fourth quarters of the year. Significant economic uncertainty or political dysfunction during these time periods could have a disproportionately adverse effect on our current and future operating results. In addition, slowing growth in certain markets could reduce the overall demand for professional information services and human capital management resources as global companies and government entities continue to manage purchasing, departmental budgets, company-wide discretionary spending; and reduce or manage their focus on talent management solutions.\nProducts, services, and tools to address talent management considerations account for a significant portion of our revenue, and a shift in demand away from talent management considerations could adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition, and liquidity.\nA significant portion of our revenue results from our products, services, and tools that address a range of talent management considerations. The part of our business that focuses on talent management is affected by the level of business activity of our members as well as the level of economic activity in the industries and markets these members serve. Economic downturns in certain segments or geographic regions may cause reductions in discretionary spending by our members, which may result in reductions in the growth of new business for our products, services, and tools as well as reductions in existing business.\nIf we do not retain CEB members for the duration of their membership terms, we would suffer a loss of future revenue due to our service guarantee.\nWe offer a service guarantee to most CEB research program members under which a member may request a refund of the membership fee. When available, refunds are provided on a proportionate basis relative to the unused period of the membership term. Requests for refunds by a significant number of our members could adversely affect our operating results and future growth. Failure to retain members at the level we forecast could materially and adversely affect our operating results.\nWe are subject to a number of risks as a US government contractor, which could harm our reputation, result in fines or penalties against us and/or adversely impact our financial condition.\nCertain of our products are tailored for the public sector and provide services to US government agencies and therefore expose us to risks and added costs associated with government contracting, as well as risks of doing business with the federal government more generally. Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in contract terminations, suspension or debarment from contracting with the US government, civil fines and damages, and criminal prosecution and penalties, any of which could cause our actual operating results to differ materially from those anticipated. In addition, the ongoing impact of sequestration and the possibility of further sequestration under the Budget Control Act of 2011 or other government dysfunction could continue to result in contract terminations and slowing sales, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nUS government agencies, including the Defense Contract Audit Agency, or DCAA, routinely audit our US government contracts and contractors\u2019 administration processes and systems. An unfavorable outcome to an audit by the DCAA or another agency could cause our operating results to differ materially from those anticipated. If an investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeitures of profits, suspension of payments, fines, and suspension or debarment from doing business with the US government. In addition, we would suffer serious harm to our reputation if allegations of impropriety were made against us. Each of these factors could cause actual operating results to differ materially from those anticipated. In addition, a reduction in overall government spending could adversely affect our operating results.\nRisks related to our operations\nOur acquisitions, involve risks that differ from or are in addition to those faced by our CEB operations, and our acquisitions may not achieve their anticipated results.\nThrough our acquisitions, we expect that we will be able to realize various benefits, including, among other things, new product development and product enhancements, cross-selling and revenue enhancement opportunities, geographic expansion, cost savings, and operating efficiencies.\nOur acquisitions bring us capabilities and intellectual properties that address gaps in member and client needs and workflows. These acquisitions involve financial, operational, human resources, business, legal, and regulatory risks that differ from or are in addition to those faced by our ongoing operations, including difficulties in accurately valuing the businesses; difficulties and costs of integrating and maintaining the operations, personnel, technologies, products, vendors, and information systems of the businesses; difficulties achieving the target synergies, efficiencies, and cost savings; more cyclicality than exists in our best practices and decision support products and services; failure to retain key personnel and members; entry into and ongoing management of new geographical or product markets; exposure under acquisition-related agreements; the diversion of financial and management resources; management distraction; and the integration of a different set of products and services into our existing operations. As a result, we may not be able to achieve the expected benefits of our acquisitions, which could adversely affect our operating results and future growth.\nWe are continuing to integrate the operations of SHL and other acquisitions into our business and we may be unable to do so in the manner expected.\nOur ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of our acquisition of SHL and other acquisitions in the talent management space continue\nto be subject to a number of uncertainties. The integration process, which is continuing in 2015, could result in the loss of valuable employees; brand confusion; reduced employee morale and engagement; the disruption of our businesses, processes, and systems; and inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures, practices, policies, and compensation arrangements; any of which could adversely affect our ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition as and when expected or at all. Failure to achieve these anticipated benefits could result in increased costs or decreases in the amount of expected revenue and efficiencies from the SHL and other smaller acquisitions and could adversely affect our operating results and future growth.\nOur international operations involve special risks.\nWe expect to continue our international growth, and our international revenue is expected to account for an increasing portion of our revenue in the future.\nOur international operations involve risks that differ from or are in addition to those faced by our US operations, including:\n\u2022\ndifficulties in developing products, services, and technology tailored to the needs of members and clients around the world, including in emerging markets;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in serving members and clients around the world, including in emerging markets;\n\u2022\ndifferent employment laws and rules and related social and cultural factors that could result in cyclical fluctuations in use and revenue;\n\u2022\ndependence on distributors and other third parties;\n\u2022\ncultural and language differences;\n\u2022\nlimited recognition of our brand;\n\u2022\ndifferent regulatory and compliance requirements, including in the areas of privacy and data protection, anti-bribery and anti-corruption, trade sanctions, marketing and sales, and other barriers to conducting business;\n\u2022\ngreater difficulties in managing our operations outside of the United States;\n\u2022\ndifferent or less stable political, operating, and economic environments and market fluctuations;\n\u2022\ncivil disturbances or other catastrophic events that reduce business activity;\n\u2022\nhigher operating costs;\n\u2022\nlower operating margins;\n\u2022\ndiffering accounting principles and standards;\n\u2022\ncurrency fluctuations between the US dollar and foreign currencies that could adversely affect financial and operating results; and\n\u2022\nrestrictions on or adverse tax consequences from entity management efforts.\nBecause significant international expansion occurred as a result of a single acquisition that was completed in a relatively short period of time in 2012, we are still in the process of integrating our operating activities, personnel, compliance, entity management, and information technology infrastructure. If we are not able to efficiently adapt to or effectively manage our business in markets outside of the United States, our business prospects and operating results could be adversely affected.\nWe may fail to adequately operate, maintain, develop, and protect our information technology infrastructure.\nWe use our information technology infrastructure to serve our global membership and clients and support our employees and operations. Our failure to make the capital infrastructure expenditures and improvements necessary to remain technologically advanced, to meet our internal operational and business needs, including the integration of newly acquired businesses, and to address information security, privacy, data management, business continuity, and other issues related to our infrastructure as well as with the infrastructure of our vendors, could adversely affect our development of new products and services; marketing, sale, and delivery of existing products and services; operating results; future performance; and reputation. Our failure to optimize or protect our information technology infrastructure could result in interruptions to our business and operations, which could materially affect our operating results, future growth, and reputation.\nWe may fail to adequately protect our member and client data.\nIn the normal course of operations, we collect and maintain confidential and sensitive data, including personal information, from our members and clients. We rely on a complex network of technical safeguards and internal controls to protect this data. Our failure to adequately protect this data, including our failure to continue to improve our internal controls or our failure to prevent the misuse of or misappropriation of member and client data could result in data loss, corruption, or breach. If a data loss, corruption, or breach occurs, we could be exposed to litigation from our members and clients, our reputation could be harmed, and we could lose existing and have difficulty attracting new members and clients, all of which could adversely affect our operating results.\nChanges to privacy and data protection rules and regulations may make compliance more complex and challenging. Such changes could increase the cost of compliance, which could lower the margins or profitability of our business. Our failure to comply with or implement\nprocesses in this area could result in legal liability, damage to our reputation in the global marketplace, or added considerations around commercial activity. Additionally, regulations frequently allow for the imposition of substantial fines and penalties, thereby creating a greater risk of significant financial impact should we fail to comply.\nIncreased IT security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose a risk to our systems and services.\nIncreased global IT security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability, and integrity of data processed and stored on those systems and networks. While we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of administrative, technical, and physical safeguards, including employee training; technical security controls; comprehensive monitoring of our networks and systems; and maintenance of backup and protective systems, our systems, networks, products, solutions and services remain potentially vulnerable to various threats. Depending on their nature and scope, such threats could potentially lead to the compromise of confidential information; improper use of our systems and networks; manipulation and destruction of data; defective products; production downtimes; and operational disruptions, which in turn could adversely affect our reputation, competitiveness, and operating results.\nInterruptions in service at our data centers could adversely affect our business.\nCEB delivers its programs, products, and services to members and clients primarily through online means. We have implemented plans and procedures to address service interruptions in each of our product infrastructures. However, we could experience natural disasters, power loss, cyber-attacks, operator error, or similar events, which could cause an interruption in service or damage to our facilities and/or data. Our disaster recovery and business continuity plans and procedures are designed to address many of the potential service interruptions, but these safeguards may prove to be insufficient or not as effective as anticipated, and may not be adequate to prevent interruptions from certain causes or unforeseen types of events. Such service interruptions could prevent us from providing services to our members and clients or cause us to violate service level agreements with our members, which could adversely affect our ability to retain existing members and clients and attract new members and clients. In addition, such service interruptions or any perceptions of unreliability could adversely affect our ability to retain existing members and clients and harm our ability to attract new members and clients.\nWe make estimates and assumptions in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, and any changes to those estimates and assumptions could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nIn connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements, we use certain estimates and assumptions based on historical experience and other factors. Our most critical accounting estimates are described in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\u201d In addition, as discussed in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements, we make certain estimates, including decisions related to revenue recognition, income taxes, and other contingencies. While we believe that these estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances, they are subject to significant uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. Should any of these estimates and assumptions change or prove to have been incorrect, it could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nIf there are any material weaknesses in disclosure controls and procedures or internal control over financial reporting of SHL Talent Measurement, this could adversely impact our ability to provide timely and accurate financial information and other material public disclosures.\nOur acquisition of SHL significantly expanded our business operations. While we had completed numerous other acquisitions, the SHL acquisition was significantly larger than any other acquisitions. Accordingly, SHL has a more significant impact on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nThe integration of acquisitions includes ensuring that our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting effectively apply to and address the operations of newly acquired businesses. While we have made every effort to thoroughly understand SHL\u2019s processes, our integration and evaluation of those processes is ongoing, and there can be no assurance that we will not encounter operational and financial reporting difficulties impacting our controls and procedures as we continue to integrate the SHL business. As a result, and particularly in light of the broad geographic scope of the SHL business and the fact that SHL was not a public reporting company in the United States subject to the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission or the listing requirements of the New York Stock Exchange, we may be required to modify our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reporting to accommodate the acquired operations, and we may also be required to remediate any material weaknesses or deficiencies that we may discover at SHL. Our review and evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting of SHL will take time and require additional expense. In addition, if they are not effective on a timely basis, this could adversely affect our business, as well as our ability to provide timely and accurate financial information or other material public information. This also could adversely affect investors\u2019 and the market\u2019s perception of our company.\nWe may be subject to future impairment losses due to potential declines in the fair value of our assets.\nAt December 31, 2014, the net carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets was $441.2 million and $260.4 million, respectively, and represented 33% and 19%, respectively, of our total assets of $1.4 billion. We apply a fair value test to evaluate goodwill for impairment annually, in the fourth quarter of each year, and between these periods if events occur or circumstances change which suggest that the goodwill or intangible assets should be evaluated. The testing of goodwill for potential impairment inherently involves management judgments as to the assumptions used to project amounts included in the valuation process and as to anticipated future market conditions and their potential effect on future performance. Changes in assumptions or estimates can materially affect the determination of fair value, and assumptions and estimates are subject to risks and uncertainties, including many over which we have little or no control. The potential for goodwill impairment is increased during a period of economic uncertainty or following a significant acquisition. Changes in our business strategy or changes in market or other conditions could result in declining performance that would require us to examine our goodwill for potential impairment and could lead to a requirement that we record additional impairment charges, which would adversely affect our financial results.\nChanges in, or interpretations of, tax rules and regulations may adversely affect our effective tax rates.\nWe are subject to income and other taxes in the United States, the United Kingdom and numerous other foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our provision for income taxes. We also are subject to tax audits in various jurisdictions, and such jurisdictions may assess additional tax against us. Our global operations subject us to additional tax regimes. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation, or the effects of a change in tax policy in the United States or in any of the numerous international jurisdictions where we do business, could have a material effect on our operating results in the period or periods for which that determination is made.\nWe are subject to foreign currency risk.\nWe serve executives and professionals in more than 100 countries around the world. In 2014, approximately 40% of our total revenue was generated outside of the United States. Such amounts are collected in both local currencies and the US dollar. Prices for CEB segment programs, products, and services primarily are denominated in US dollars; however, we began offering foreign currency billing in 2012 to certain members outside of the United States. Prices for SHL Talent Measurement tools and services are primarily denominated in the local currency. As a result of operating outside the United States, we are at risk for exchange rate fluctuations between such local currencies and the US dollar, which could affect our results of operations.\nWe use forward contracts, primarily cash flow hedging instruments, to mitigate a portion of these risks. The maximum length of time of these hedging contracts is 12 months. Although we believe that our foreign exchange hedging policies are reasonable and prudent under the circumstances, they only partially offset any adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable changes in foreign currency exchange rates, especially if these changes are extreme and occur over a short period of time. Hedging transactions involve certain additional risks such as counterparty risk, the legal enforceability of hedging contracts, the early repayment of hedged transactions, and the risk that unanticipated and significant changes in foreign exchange rates may cause a significant loss of basis in the contract and change in current period expense. We cannot make assurances that we will be able to enter into hedging transactions or that such hedging transactions will adequately protect us against the foregoing risks. In addition, any cash flow hedges not perfectly correlated (and appropriately designated and documented as such) with foreign exchange transactions would impact our reported income as gains and losses on the ineffective portion of such hedges would be recorded in our consolidated statements of operations.\nOur leverage could adversely affect our financial condition or operating flexibility and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities.\nOur total consolidated debt at December 31, 2014 was $505.6 million, consisting of the Term Loan A-1 Facility. In addition, we had $192.2 million of undrawn availability under the Revolving Credit Facility (after reduction of availability to cover $7.8 million of outstanding letters of credit) at December 31, 2014.\nOur level of indebtedness could have important consequences on our future operations, including:\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to satisfy our payment and other obligations under our outstanding debt, which may result in defaults;\n\u2022\nresulting in an event of default if we fail to comply with the financial and other covenants contained in the credit agreement governing the Senior Secured Credit Facilities, which could result in all of our debt becoming immediately due and payable and could permit the lenders under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities to foreclose on our assets securing such debt;\n\u2022\nsubjecting us to the risk of increased sensitivity to interest rate increases in our outstanding indebtedness, which has a variable rate of interest, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly;\n\u2022\nreducing the availability of our cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, and other general corporate purposes, and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, and increasing our vulnerability to, changes in our business, the industry in which we operate and the general economy;\n\u2022\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or are less leveraged; and\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions.\nWe may incur significant additional indebtedness, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our existing indebtedness.\nWe may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. The terms of our Senior Secured Credit Facilities limit, but do not prohibit, us from incurring additional indebtedness. This may include additional indebtedness under certain circumstances that may also be guaranteed by our domestic subsidiaries that guarantee our obligations under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities. Our ability to incur additional indebtedness may have the effect of reducing the amounts available to pay amounts due with respect to our indebtedness. If we incur new debt or other liabilities, the related risks that we and our subsidiaries now face could intensify.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our indebtedness, and we may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our payment obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business and economic conditions, and other factors. We are not be able to control many of these factors, such as economic conditions in the industries in which we operate and competitive pressures. Our cash flows from operations may not be sufficient to allow us to pay principal and interest on our debt and to meet our other obligations. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital, or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations. In addition, the terms of existing or future debt agreements may restrict us from pursuing any of these alternatives.\nWe are subject to interest rate risk.\nBorrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates were to increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, will correspondingly decrease. We have entered into interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce interest rate volatility for a notional amount of $268 million at December 31, 2014. However, we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk. Additionally, hedging transactions involve certain additional risks such as counterparty risk, the legal enforceability of hedging contracts, the early repayment of hedged transactions and the risk that unanticipated and significant changes in interest rates may cause a significant loss of basis in the contract and a change in current period expense.\nIn the event that we need to refinance all or a portion of our outstanding debt before maturity or as it matures, we may not be able to obtain terms as favorable as the terms of our existing debt or refinance our existing debt at all. If interest rates or other factors existing at the time of refinancing result in higher interest rates upon refinancing, then the interest expense relating to the refinanced debt would increase. Furthermore, if any rating agency changes our credit rating or outlook, our debt and equity securities could be adversely affected.\nHedging instruments often are not guaranteed by an exchange or its clearing house and involve risks and costs.\nHedging instruments involve risk since they are often not guaranteed by an exchange or a clearing house. The enforceability of agreements underlying derivative transactions may depend on compliance with applicable regulatory requirements and, depending on the identity of the counterparty, applicable international requirements. The business failure of a hedging counterparty with whom we enter into a hedging transaction will most likely result in a default. Default by a party with whom we enter into a hedging transaction may result in the loss of unrealized gains and force us to cover our resale commitments, if any, at the then current market price. Although we generally seek to reserve the right to terminate our hedging positions, it may not always be possible to dispose of or close out a hedging position without the consent of the hedging counterparty, and we may not be able to enter into and offsetting contract to cover our risk. We cannot assure that a liquid secondary market will exist for hedging instruments purchased or sold, and we may be required to maintain a position until expiration, which could result in losses.\nThe covenants in our Senior Secured Credit Facilities impose restrictions that may limit our operating and financial flexibility.\nThe Senior Secured Credit Facilities include negative covenants that may, subject to exceptions, limit our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to, among other things:\n\u2022\ncreate, incur, assume, or suffer to exist liens;\n\u2022\nmake investments and loans;\n\u2022\ncreate, incur, assume, or suffer to exist additional indebtedness or guarantees;\n\u2022\nengage in mergers, acquisitions, consolidations, sale-leasebacks, and other asset sales and dispositions;\n\u2022\npay dividends or redeem, or repurchase our capital stock, except in certain specified circumstances;\n\u2022\nalter the business that we and our subsidiaries conduct;\n\u2022\nengage in certain transactions with officers, directors, and affiliates;\n\u2022\nprepay, redeem or purchase other indebtedness;\n\u2022\nenter into certain burdensome agreements; and\n\u2022\nmake material changes to accounting and reporting practices.\nIn addition, the Senior Secured Credit Facilities include financial covenants that subject us to a maximum net leverage ratio.\nOperating results below current levels or other adverse factors, including a significant increase in interest rates, could result in us being unable to comply with certain covenants contained in our Senior Secured Credit Facilities. If we violate these covenants and are unable to obtain waivers, our debt under the Senior Secured Credit Facilities would be in default and could be accelerated and could permit the lenders to foreclose on our assets securing the debt thereunder. If the indebtedness is accelerated, we may not be able to repay our debt or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it. Even if we are able to obtain new financing, it may not be on commercially reasonable terms or on terms that are acceptable to us. If our debt is in default for any reason, our cash flows, operating results, or financial condition could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, complying with these covenants may also cause us to take actions that may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete against companies that are not subject to such restrictions.\nRisks related to our people\nWe may be unable to retain key personnel, recruit highly skilled management and employees, or effectively plan for succession.\nOur continued and future success depends on our ability to retain key personnel, including senior leaders, skilled sales and research personnel, and the more than 200 industrial and organizational psychologists who are a critical component of our SHL Talent Measurement business; and to hire, train, and retain highly skilled management and employees, including from our acquisitions. We experience competition for our personnel from competitors and other businesses wherever we do business. We have employer protection agreements with senior staff that restrict them from competing with and soliciting employees from us following their employment. If we fail to retain key personnel, or to attract, train, and retain a sufficient number of highly skilled management and employees in the future, our operating results and future growth could be adversely affected, and the morale and productivity of our workforce in the near term could be disrupted.\nEffective succession planning is also a key factor for our long-term success. Our failure to enable the effective transfer of knowledge and facilitate smooth transitions with regard to key employees could adversely affect our long-term strategic planning and execution and negatively affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and prospects. If we fail to enable the effective transfer of knowledge and facilitate smooth transitions for key personnel, the operating results and future growth for our business could be adversely affected, and the morale and productivity of the workforce could be disrupted.\nWe rely on our executive officers, corporate leadership team, and the leaders of our geographic regions and departments for the success of our business.\nWe rely on our executive officers, our corporate leadership team, and the leaders of our geographic regions and departments to manage our operations. Given the range of our products and services, the scale of our operations, and our geographic scope, these executives and senior managers must have a thorough understanding of our product and service offerings and operations, as well as the skills and experience necessary to manage a large organization in diverse geographic locations. If one or more members of our management team leave and we cannot replace them with suitable candidates quickly, or if members of our management team are not able to demonstrate the skills necessary in a global business, we could experience difficulty in managing our business properly. This could harm our business prospects, client relationships, employee morale, and operating results.\nWe may be unable to extend and maintain our corporate culture, which is a critical part of our success.\nWe believe that a critical contributor to our success to date has been our corporate culture, which we believe fosters product innovation, teamwork, strong member support and service, and employee morale. As we expand, including from the integration of employees from businesses that we acquire, as well as by opening offices in new geographies, we may find it difficult to maintain important aspects of our corporate culture, which could adversely affect our ability to retain and recruit personnel and otherwise adversely affect our future success, business prospects, and client relationships.", "PERMNO": 86720, "SIC": 8742, "TIC": "CEB"}
