{"cik": "874761", "company": "AES CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-28", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nYou should consider carefully the following risks, along with the other information contained in or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K. Additional risks and uncertainties also may adversely affect our business and operations, including those discussed in Item 7.-Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in this Form 10-K. If any of the following events actually occur, our business, financial results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nWe routinely encounter and address risks, some of which may cause our future results to be materially different than we presently anticipate. The categories of risk we have identified in Item 1A.-Risk Factors of this Form 10-K include the following:\n\u2022\nrisks associated with our operations;\n\u2022\nrisks associated with governmental regulation and laws; and\n\u2022\nrisks related to our indebtedness and financial condition.\nThese risk factors should be read in conjunction with Item 7.-Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report.\nRisks Associated with our Operations\nThe operation of power generation, distribution and transmission facilities involves significant risks.\nWe are in the business of generating and distributing electricity, which involves certain risks that can adversely affect financial and operating performance, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in the availability of our generation facilities or distribution systems due to increases in scheduled and unscheduled plant outages, equipment failure, failure of transmission systems, labor disputes, disruptions in fuel supply, poor hydrologic and wind conditions, inability to comply with regulatory or permit\n52 | 2019 Annual Report\nrequirements, or catastrophic events such as fires, floods, storms, hurricanes, earthquakes, dam failures, tsunamis, explosions, terrorist acts, cyber attacks or other similar occurrences; and\n\u2022\nchanges in our operating cost structure, including, but not limited to, increases in costs relating to gas, coal, oil and other fuel; fuel transportation; purchased electricity; operations, maintenance and repair; environmental compliance, including the cost of purchasing emissions offsets and capital expenditures to install environmental emission equipment; transmission access; and insurance.\nOur businesses require reliable transportation sources (including related infrastructure such as roads, ports and rail), power sources and water sources to access and conduct operations. The availability and cost of this infrastructure affects capital and operating costs and levels of production and sales. Limitations, or interruptions in this infrastructure or at the facilities of our subsidiaries, including as a result of third parties intentionally or unintentionally disrupting this infrastructure or the facilities of our subsidiaries, could impede their ability to produce electricity. This could have a material adverse effect on our businesses' results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nIn addition, a portion of our generation facilities were constructed many years ago. Older generating equipment may require significant capital expenditures for maintenance. The equipment at our plants, whether old or new, is also likely to require periodic upgrading, improvement or repair, and replacement equipment or parts may be difficult to obtain in circumstances where we rely on a single supplier or a small number of suppliers. The inability to obtain replacement equipment or parts may impact the ability of our plants to perform and could, therefore, have a material impact on our business and results of operations. Breakdown or failure of one of our operating facilities may prevent the facility from performing under applicable power sales agreements which, in certain situations, could result in termination of a power purchase or other agreement or incurrence of a liability for liquidated damages and/or other penalties.\nPower generation involves hazardous activities, including acquiring, transporting and unloading fuel, operating large pieces of rotating equipment and delivering electricity to transmission and distribution systems. In addition to natural risks, such as earthquakes, floods, lightning, hurricanes and wind, hazards, such as fire, explosion, collapse and machinery failure, are inherent risks in our operations which may occur as a result of inadequate internal processes, technological flaws, human error or actions of third parties or other external events. The control and management of these risks depend upon adequate development and training of personnel and on the existence of operational procedures, preventative maintenance plans and specific programs supported by quality control systems which reduce, but do not eliminate, the possibility of the occurrence and impact of these risks.\nThe hazards described above, along with other safety hazards associated with our operations, can cause significant personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property, plant and equipment, contamination of, or damage to, the environment and suspension of operations. The occurrence of any one of these events may result in our being named as a defendant in lawsuits asserting claims for substantial damages, environmental cleanup costs, personal injury and fines and/or penalties.\nWe do a significant amount of business outside the United States, including in developing countries, which presents significant risks.\nA significant amount of our revenue is generated outside the United States and a significant portion of our international operations is conducted in developing countries. Part of our growth strategy is to expand our business in certain developing countries in which AES has an existing presence. We believe these countries may have higher growth rates and offer greater opportunities, with potentially higher returns than in some more developed countries. International operations, particularly the operation, financing and development of projects in developing countries, entail significant risks and uncertainties, including, without limitation:\n\u2022\neconomic, social and political instability in any particular country or region;\n\u2022\nadverse changes in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022\ngovernment restrictions on converting currencies or repatriating funds;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in foreign laws and regulations or in trade, monetary, fiscal or environmental policies;\n\u2022\nhigh inflation and monetary fluctuations;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on imports of solar panels, wind turbines, coal, oil, gas or other raw materials required by our generation businesses to operate;\n\u2022\nthreatened or consummated expropriation or nationalization of our assets by foreign governments;\n53 | 2019 Annual Report\n\u2022\nunexpected delays in permitting and governmental approvals;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes or instability affecting our strategic partners in developing countries;\n\u2022\nrisks relating to the failure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, UK Bribery Act or other anti-bribery laws applicable to our operations, including, among other things, cost and disruption in responding to allegations or investigations (regardless of ultimate finding), civil and/or criminal fines, criminal prosecution of individuals, revocation or suspension of permits and/or licenses, civil litigation, reputational damage, loss in share price, and loss of business;\n\u2022\nunwillingness of governments and their agencies, similar organizations or other counterparties to honor their contracts;\n\u2022\nunwillingness of governments, government agencies, courts or similar bodies to enforce contracts that are economically advantageous to subsidiaries of the Company and less beneficial to counterparties, against such counterparties, whether such counterparties are governments or private parties;\n\u2022\ninability to obtain access to fair and equitable political, regulatory, administrative and legal systems;\n\u2022\nadverse changes in government tax policy;\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences of operating in multiple jurisdictions; and\n\u2022\ndifficulties in enforcing our contractual rights or enforcing judgments or obtaining a favorable result in local jurisdictions.\nAny of these factors, by itself or in combination with others, could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur operations may experience volatility in revenues and operating margin caused by regulatory and economic difficulties, political instability and currency devaluations. This volatility reduces the predictability and enhances the uncertainty associated with cash flows from these businesses.\nOur businesses may incur substantial costs and liabilities and be exposed to price volatility as a result of risks associated with the wholesale electricity markets.\nSome of our businesses sell or buy electricity in the spot markets when they operate at levels that differ from their power sales agreements or retail load obligations or when they do not have any powers sales agreements. Our businesses may also buy electricity in the wholesale spot markets. As a result, we are exposed to the risks of rising and falling prices in those markets. The open market wholesale prices for electricity can be volatile and generally reflect the variable cost of the source generation which could include renewable sources at near zero pricing or thermal sources subject to fluctuating cost of fuels such as coal, natural gas or oil derivative fuels in addition to other factors described below. Consequently, any changes in the generation supply stack and cost of coal, natural gas, or oil derivative fuels may impact the open market wholesale price of electricity.\nVolatility in market prices for fuel and electricity may result from, among other things:\n\u2022\nplant availability in the markets generally;\n\u2022\navailability and effectiveness of transmission facilities owned and operated by third parties;\n\u2022\ncompetition;\n\u2022\nseasonality;\n\u2022\nhydrology and other weather conditions;\n\u2022\nilliquid markets;\n\u2022\ntransmission, transportation constraints, inefficiencies and/or availability;\n\u2022\nrenewables source contribution to the supply stack;\n\u2022\nnew entrants;\n\u2022\nincreased adoption of distributed generation;\n\u2022\nenergy efficiency and demand side resources;\n\u2022\navailable supplies of coal, natural gas, and crude oil and refined products;\n\u2022\ngenerating unit performance;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters, terrorism, wars, embargoes, and other catastrophic events;\n\u2022\nenergy, market and environmental regulation, legislation and policies;\n54 | 2019 Annual Report\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions globally as well as in areas where we operate that impact demand and energy consumption; and\n\u2022\nbidding behavior and market bidding rules.\nWholesale power prices are declining in many markets and this could have a material adverse effect on our operations and opportunities for future growth.\nThe wholesale prices offered for electricity have declined significantly in recent years in many markets in which the Company has businesses. This price decline is due to a variety of factors, including the increased penetration of renewable generation resources, low-priced natural gas and demand side management. The levelized cost of electricity from new solar and wind generation sources has dropped substantially in recent years as solar panel costs and wind turbine costs have declined, while wind and solar capacity factors have increased. These renewable resources have no fuel costs and very low operational costs. In many instances, energy from these facilities are bid into the wholesale spot market at a price of zero or close to zero during certain times of the day, driving down the clearing price for all generators selling power in the relevant spot market. Also, in many markets, new PPAs have been awarded for renewable generation at prices significantly lower than the prices being awarded just a few years ago.\nThis trend of declining wholesale prices could continue and could have a material adverse impact on the financial performance of our existing generation assets to the extent they currently sell power into the spot market or will seek to sell power into the spot market once their PPAs expire. The trend of declining prices can also make it more difficult for us to obtain attractive prices under new long-term PPAs for any new generation facilities we may seek to develop. As a result, the trend can have an adverse impact on our opportunities for new investments.\nAdverse economic developments in China could have a negative impact on demand for electricity in many of our markets.\nThe Chinese market has been driving global materials demand and pricing for commodities over the past decade. Many of these commodities are produced in areas that are also our key markets for the sale of electricity. After experiencing rapid growth for more than a decade, China\u2019s economy has experienced decreasing foreign and domestic demand, weak investment, factory overcapacity and oversupply in the property market, and has experienced a significant slowdown in recent years. U.S. tariffs are also expected to have a negative impact on China's economic growth. In addition, the outbreak of the Coronavirus is a rapidly developing situation in China that has adversely impacted economic activity and conditions in China. In particular, efforts to control the spread of the Coronavirus have led to shutdowns of manufacturing facilities and disrupted supply chains. The extent of such impact is unknown at this time. Continued slowing in China\u2019s economic growth, demand for commodities and/or material changes in policy could result in lower economic growth and lower demand for electricity in our key markets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\n55 | 2019 Annual Report\nWe may not have adequate risk mitigation and/or insurance coverage for liabilities.\nPower generation, distribution and transmission involves hazardous activities. We may become exposed to significant liabilities for which we may not have adequate risk mitigation and/or insurance coverage. Furthermore, through AGIC, AES\u2019 captive insurance company, we take certain insurance risk on our businesses. We maintain an amount of insurance protection that we believe is customary, but there can be no assurance that our insurance will be sufficient or effective under all circumstances and against all hazards or liabilities to which we may be subject. Our insurance does not cover every potential risk associated with our operations. Adequate coverage at reasonable rates is not always obtainable. In particular, the availability of insurance for coal-fired generation assets has decreased as certain insurers have opted to discontinue or limit offering insurance for such assets. Certain insurers have also withdrawn from insuring hydroelectric assets following significant losses in that business class. For these reasons, as well as the cyclical nature of the insurance markets, we cannot provide assurance that insurance coverage will continue to be available in the amounts or on terms similar to those presently available to us. In addition, insurance may not fully cover the liability or the consequences of any business interruptions such as natural catastrophes, equipment failure or labor dispute. The occurrence of a significant adverse event not fully or partially covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business, results or operations, financial condition, and prospects.\nWe may not be able to enter into long-term contracts that reduce volatility in our results of operations.\nMany of our generation plants conduct business under long-term sales and supply contracts, which helps these businesses to manage risks by reducing the volatility associated with power and input costs and providing a stable revenue and cost structure. In these instances, we rely on power sales contracts with one or a limited number of customers for the majority of, and in some cases all of, the relevant plant's output and revenues over the term of the power sales contract. The remaining terms of the power sales contracts of our generation plants range from one to more than 20 years. In many cases, we also limit our exposure to fluctuations in fuel prices by entering into long-term contracts for fuel with a limited number of suppliers. In these instances, the cash flows and results of operations are dependent on the continued ability of customers and suppliers to meet their obligations under the relevant power sales contract or fuel supply contract, respectively. Some of our long-term power sales agreements are at prices above current spot market prices and some of our long-term fuel supply contracts are at prices below current market prices. The loss of significant power sales contracts or fuel supply contracts, or the failure by any of the parties to such contracts that prevents us from fulfilling our obligations thereunder, could adversely impact our strategy by resulting in costs that exceed revenue, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, depending on market conditions and regulatory regimes, it may be difficult for us to secure long-term contracts, either where our current contracts are expiring or for new development projects. The inability to enter into long-term contracts could require many of our businesses to purchase inputs at market prices and sell electricity into spot markets, which may not be favorable.\nWe have sought to reduce counterparty credit risk under our long-term contracts in part by entering into power sales contracts with utilities or other customers of strong credit quality and by obtaining guarantees from certain sovereign governments of the customer's obligations. However, many of our customers do not have, or have failed to maintain, an investment-grade credit rating, and our generation business cannot always obtain government guarantees and if they do, the government does not always have an investment grade credit rating. We have also sought to reduce our credit risk by locating our plants in different geographic areas in order to mitigate the effects of regional economic downturns; however, there can be no assurance that our efforts to mitigate this risk will be successful.\nCompetition is increasing and could adversely affect us.\nThe power production markets in which we operate are characterized by numerous strong and capable competitors, many of whom may have extensive and diversified developmental or operating experience (including both domestic and international) and financial resources similar to, or greater than, ours. Further, in recent years, the power production industry has been characterized by strong and increasing competition with respect to both obtaining power sales agreements and acquiring existing power generation assets. In certain markets, these factors have caused reductions in prices contained in new power sales agreements and, in many cases, have caused higher acquisition prices for existing assets through competitive bidding practices. The evolution of competitive electricity markets and the development of highly efficient gas-fired power plants and renewables such as wind and solar have also caused, and could continue to cause, price pressure in certain power markets where we sell or\n56 | 2019 Annual Report\nintend to sell power. In addition, the introduction of low-cost disruptive technologies or the entry of non-traditional competitors into our sector and markets could adversely affect our ability to compete, which could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, operating results and financial condition.\nSupplier and/or customer concentration may expose the Company to significant financial credit or performance risks.\nWe often rely on a single contracted supplier or a small number of suppliers for the provision of fuel, transportation of fuel and other services required for the operation of some of our facilities. If these suppliers cannot perform, we would seek to meet our fuel requirements by purchasing fuel at market prices, exposing us to market price volatility and the risk that fuel and transportation may not be available during certain periods at any price, which could adversely impact the profitability of the affected business and our results of operations, and could result in a breach of agreements with other counterparties, including, without limitation, offtakers or lenders. Further, our suppliers may source certain materials from China or other areas impacted by Coronavirus, which may cause delays and/or disruptions to our development projects or operations.\nAt times, we rely on a single customer or a few customers to purchase all or a significant portion of a facility's output, in some cases under long-term agreements that account for a substantial percentage of the anticipated revenue from a given facility. Counterparties to these agreements may breach or may be unable to perform their obligations, due to bankruptcy, insolvency, financial distress or other factors. Furthermore, in the event of a bankruptcy or similar insolvency-type proceeding, our counterparty can seek to reject our existing PPA under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code or similar bankruptcy laws, including those in Puerto Rico. We may not be able to enter into replacement agreements on terms as favorable as our existing agreements, or at all. If we were unable to enter into replacement PPAs, these businesses may have to sell power at market prices. A breach by a counterparty of a PPA or other agreement could also result in the breach of other agreements, including, without limitation, the debt documents of the affected business.\nThe financial performance of our facilities is dependent on the credit quality of, and continued performance by, suppliers and customers. Any failure of a supplier or customer to fulfill its contractual obligations to The AES Corporation or our subsidiaries could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nOur businesses will need to continue to adapt to technological change and we may incur significant expenditures to adapt to these changes.\nEmerging technologies may be superior to, or may not be compatible with, some of our existing technologies, investments and infrastructure, and may require us to make significant expenditures to remain competitive, or may result in the obsolescence of certain of our operating assets. Our future success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and successfully adapt to technological changes, to offer services and products that meet customer demands and evolving industry standards.\nTechnological changes that could impact our businesses include:\n\u2022\ntechnologies that change the utilization of electric generation, transmission and distribution assets, including the expanded cost-effective utilization of distributed generation (e.g., rooftop solar and community solar projects), and energy storage technology;\n\u2022\nadvances in distributed and local power generation and energy storage that reduce the demand for large-scale renewable electricity generation and/or impact our customers\u2019 ability to perform under long-term agreements; and\n\u2022\nmore cost-effective batteries for energy storage, advances in solar or wind technology, and advances in alternative fuels and other alternative energy sources.\nEmerging technologies may also allow new competitors to more effectively compete in our markets or disintermediate the services we provide our customers, including traditional utility and centralized generation services. If we incur significant expenditures in adapting to technological changes, fail to adapt to significant technological changes, fail to obtain access to important new technologies, fail to recover a significant portion of any remaining investment in obsolete assets, or if implemented technology fails to operate as intended, our businesses, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\n57 | 2019 Annual Report\nCyber-attacks and data security breaches could harm our business.\nOur business is heavily reliant on electronic systems and network technologies to operate our generation, transmission and distribution infrastructure. We also use various financial, accounting and other infrastructure systems. Our infrastructure may be targeted by nation states, hacktivists, criminals, insiders or terrorist groups. Such an attack, by hacking, malware or other means, may interrupt our operations, cause property damage, affect our ability to control our infrastructure assets, cause the release of sensitive customer information or limit communications with third parties. Any loss or corruption of confidential or proprietary data through such breach may:\n\u2022\nimpact our operations and strategic objectives;\n\u2022\nimpact our customer and vendor relationships;\n\u2022\nresult in substantial revenue loss;\n\u2022\nexpose us to legal claims and/or regulatory investigations and proceedings;\n\u2022\nrequire extensive repair and restoration costs for additional security measures to avert future cyber-attacks; and\n\u2022\nimpair our reputation and limit our competitiveness for future opportunities.\nIn addition, a breach of our financial and accounting systems could impact our ability to correctly record, process and report financial information.\nWe have implemented measures to help prevent unauthorized access to our systems and facilities, including certain measures to comply with mandatory regulatory reliability standards. To date, cyber-attacks have not had a material impact on our operations or financial results. We continue to assess potential threats and vulnerabilities and make investments to address them, including global monitoring of networks and systems, identifying and implementing new technology, improving user awareness through employee security training, and updating our security policies as well as those for third-party providers.\nWe cannot guarantee the extent to which our security measures will prevent future cyber-attacks and security breaches or that our insurance coverage will adequately cover any losses we may experience. Furthermore, we do not control certain of joint ventures or our equity method investments and cannot guarantee that their efforts will be successful.\nCertain of our businesses are sensitive to variations in weather and hydrology.\nOur businesses are affected by variations in general weather patterns and unusually severe weather. Our businesses forecast electric sales based on best available information and expectations for weather, which represents a long-term historical average. While we also consider possible variations in normal weather patterns and potential impacts on our facilities and our businesses, there can be no assurance that such planning can prevent these impacts, which can adversely affect our business. Generally, demand for electricity peaks in winter and summer. Typically, when winters are warmer than expected and summers are cooler than expected, demand for energy is lower, resulting in less demand for electricity than forecasted. Significant variations from normal weather where our businesses are located could have a material impact on our results of operations.\nChanges in weather can also affect the production of electricity at power generation facilities, including, but not limited to, our wind and solar facilities. For example, the level of wind resource affects the revenue produced by wind generation facilities. Because the levels of wind and solar resources are variable and difficult to predict, our results of operations for individual wind and solar facilities specifically, and our results of operations generally, may vary significantly from period to period, depending on the level of available resources. To the extent that resources are not available at planned levels, the financial results from these facilities may be less than expected. In addition, we are dependent upon hydrological conditions prevailing from time to time in the broad geographic regions in which our hydroelectric generation facilities are located. Changes in temperature, precipitation and snow pack conditions also could affect the amount and timing of hydroelectric generation.\nTo the extent that hydrological conditions result in droughts or other conditions negatively affect our hydroelectric generation business, such as has happened in Panama in 2019, our results of operations can be materially adversely affected. Additionally, our contracts in certain markets where hydroelectric facilities are prevalent may require us to purchase power in the spot markets when our facilities are unable to operate (or operate at lower than anticipated levels) and the price of such spot power may increase substantially in times of low hydrology.\n58 | 2019 Annual Report\nSevere weather and natural disasters may present significant risks to our business.\nWeather conditions directly influence the demand for electricity and natural gas and other fuels and affect the price of energy and energy-related commodities. In addition, severe weather and natural disasters, such as hurricanes, floods, tornadoes, icing events, earthquakes, dam failures and tsunamis can be destructive and could prevent us from operating our business in the normal course by causing power outages and property damage, reducing revenue, affecting the availability of fuel and water, causing injuries and loss of life, and requiring us to incur additional costs, for example, to restore service and repair damaged facilities, to obtain replacement power and to access available financing sources. Our power plants could be placed at greater risk of damage should changes in the global climate produce unusual variations in temperature and weather patterns, resulting in more intense, frequent and extreme weather events, including heatwaves, fewer cold temperature extremes, abnormal levels of precipitation resulting in river and coastal urban floods in North America or reduced water availability and increased flooding across Central and South America, and changes in coast lines due to sea level change.\nDepending on the nature and location of the facilities and infrastructure affected, any such incident also could cause catastrophic fires; releases of natural gas, natural gas odorant, or other greenhouse gases; explosions, spills or other significant damage to natural resources or property belonging to third parties; personal injuries, health impacts or fatalities; or present a nuisance to impacted communities. Such incidents that do not directly affect our facilities may impact our business partners, supply chains and transportation, which could negatively impact construction projects and our ability to provide electricity and natural gas to our customers.\nA disruption or failure of electric generation, transmission or distribution systems or natural gas production, transmission, storage or distribution systems in the event of a hurricane, tornado or other severe weather event, or otherwise, could prevent us from operating our business in the normal course and could result in any of the adverse consequences described above. At our businesses where cost recovery is available, recovery of costs to restore service and repair damaged facilities is or may be subject to regulatory approval, and any determination by the regulator not to permit timely and full recovery of the costs incurred.\nAny of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, reputation and prospects.\nOur development projects are subject to substantial uncertainties.\nCertain of our subsidiaries and affiliates are in various stages of developing and constructing power plants. Some but not all of these power plant projects have signed long-term contracts or made similar arrangements for the sale of electricity. Successful completion of the development of these projects depends upon overcoming substantial risks, including, but not limited to, risks relating to siting, financing, engineering and construction, permitting, governmental approvals, commissioning delays, or the potential for termination of the power sales contract as a result of a failure to meet certain milestones. For additional information regarding our projects under construction see Item 1.-Business-Our Organization and Segments included in this Form 10-K.\nIn certain cases, our subsidiaries may enter into obligations in the development process even though the subsidiaries have not yet secured financing, power purchase arrangements, or other important elements for a successful project. For example, our subsidiaries may instruct contractors to begin the construction process or seek to procure equipment even where they do not have financing, a PPA or critical permits in place (or conversely, to enter into a PPA, procurement agreement or other agreement without financing in place). If the project does not proceed, our subsidiaries may remain obligated for certain liabilities even though the project will not proceed. Development is inherently uncertain and we may forgo certain development opportunities and we may undertake significant development costs before determining that we will not proceed with a particular project. We believe that capitalized costs for projects under development are recoverable; however, there can be no assurance that any individual project will be completed and reach commercial operation. If these development efforts are not successful, we may abandon a project under development and write off the costs incurred in connection with such project. At the time of abandonment, we would expense all capitalized development costs incurred in connection therewith and could incur additional losses associated with any related contingent liabilities.\n59 | 2019 Annual Report\nWe do not control certain aspects of our joint ventures or our equity method investments.\nWe have invested in some joint ventures in which our subsidiaries share operational, management, investment and/or other control rights with our joint venture partners. In many cases, we may exert influence over the joint venture pursuant to a management contract, by holding positions on the board of the joint venture company or on management committees and/or through certain limited governance rights, such as rights to veto significant actions. However, we do not always have this type of influence over the project or business in every instance and we may be dependent on our joint venture partners or the management team of the joint venture to operate, manage, invest or otherwise control such projects or businesses. Our joint venture partners or the management team of our joint ventures may not have the level of experience, technical expertise, human resources, management and other attributes necessary to operate these projects or businesses optimally, and they may not share our business priorities. In some joint venture agreements in which we do have majority control of the voting securities, we have entered into shareholder agreements granting minority rights to the other shareholders.\nThe approval of joint venture partners also may be required for us to receive distributions of funds from jointly owned entities or to transfer our interest in projects or businesses. The control or influence exerted by our joint venture partners may result in operational management and/or investment decisions that are different from the decisions our subsidiaries would make if they operated independently and could impact the profitability and value of these joint ventures. In addition, in the event that a joint venture partner becomes insolvent or bankrupt or is otherwise unable to meet its obligations to the joint venture or its share of liabilities at the joint venture, we may be subject to joint and several liability for these joint ventures, which means that we may be responsible for meeting certain obligations of the joint ventures, should our joint venture partner be unable to do so, if and to the extent provided for in our governing documents or applicable law.\nIn addition, we are generally dependent on the management team of our equity method investments to operate and control such projects or businesses. While we may exert influence pursuant to having positions on the boards of such investments and/or through certain limited governance rights, such as rights to veto significant actions, we do not always have this type of influence in every instance and the scope and impact of such influence may be limited. The management teams of our equity method investments may not have the level of experience, technical expertise, human resources, management and other attributes necessary to operate these projects or businesses optimally, and they may not share our business priorities, which could have a material adverse effect on value of such investments as well as our growth, business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur renewable energy projects and other initiatives face considerable uncertainties, including development, operational, and regulatory challenges.\nWind, solar, and energy storage projects are subject to substantial risks. Some of these business lines are dependent upon favorable regulatory incentives to support continued investment, and there is significant uncertainty about the extent to which such favorable regulatory incentives will be available in the future.\nFurthermore, production levels for our wind and solar projects may be dependent upon adequate wind or sunlight resulting in volatility in production levels and profitability. For example, for our wind projects, wind resource estimates are based on historical experience when available and on wind resource studies conducted by an independent engineer. These wind resource estimates are not expected to reflect actual wind energy production in any given year, but long-term averages of a resource.\nAs a result, these types of renewable energy projects face considerable risk, including the risk that favorable regulatory regimes expire or are adversely modified. In addition, because certain of these projects depend on technology outside of our expertise in generation and utility businesses, there are risks associated with our ability to develop and manage such projects profitably. Furthermore, at the development or acquisition stage, because of our more limited experience with the relevant technologies, our ability to predict actual performance results may be hindered and the projects may not perform as predicted. There are also risks associated with the fact that some of these projects exist in markets where long-term fixed-price contracts for the major cost and revenue components may be unavailable, which in turn may result in these projects having relatively high levels of volatility. These projects can be capital-intensive and generally are designed with a view to obtaining third-party financing, which may be difficult to obtain. As a result, these capital constraints may reduce our ability to develop these projects or obtain third-party financing for these projects.\n60 | 2019 Annual Report\nGovernment incentives and policies that support the development of renewable energy generation projects could change at any time.\nAES\u2019 U.S. renewable energy generation growth strategy depends in part on federal, state and local government policies and incentives that support the development, financing, ownership and operation of renewable energy generation projects. These policies and incentives include investment tax credits, production tax credits, accelerated depreciation, renewable portfolio standards, feed-in-tariffs and similar programs, renewable energy credit mechanisms, and tax exemptions. If these policies and incentives are changed or eliminated, or AES is unable to use them, it could result in a material adverse impact on AES\u2019 U.S. renewable growth opportunities, including fewer future PPAs or lower prices for the sale of power in future PPAs, decreased revenues, reduced economic returns on certain project company investments, increased financing costs, and/or difficulty obtaining financing.\nOur financial position and results of operations may fluctuate significantly due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates experienced at our foreign operations.\nOur exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations results primarily from the translation exposure associated with the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as from transaction exposure associated with transactions in currencies other than an entity's functional currency. While the Consolidated Financial Statements are reported in U.S. dollars, the financial statements of several of our subsidiaries outside the United States are prepared using the local currency as the functional currency and translated into U.S. dollars by applying appropriate exchange rates. As a result, fluctuations in the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar relative to the local currencies where our subsidiaries outside the United States report could cause significant fluctuations in our results. In addition, while our expenses with respect to foreign operations are generally denominated in the same currency as corresponding sales, we have transaction exposure to the extent receipts and expenditures are not denominated in the subsidiary's functional currency. Moreover, the costs of doing business abroad may increase as a result of adverse exchange rate fluctuations. Our financial position and results of operations could be affected by fluctuations in the value of a number of currencies.\nWe may not be adequately hedged against our exposure to changes in commodity prices or interest rates.\nWe routinely enter into contracts to hedge a portion of our purchase and sale commitments for electricity, fuel requirements and other commodities to lower our financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations. As part of this strategy, we routinely utilize fixed price or indexed forward physical purchase and sales contracts, futures, financial swaps, and option contracts traded in the over-the-counter markets or on exchanges. We also enter into contracts which help us manage our interest rate exposure. However, we may not cover the entire exposure of our assets or positions to market price or interest rate volatility, and the coverage will vary over time. Furthermore, the risk management practices we have in place may not always perform as planned. In particular, if prices of commodities or interest rates significantly deviate from historical prices or interest rates or if the price or interest rate volatility or distribution of these changes deviates from historical norms, our risk management practices may not protect us from significant losses. As a result, fluctuating commodity prices or interest rates may negatively impact our financial results to the extent we have unhedged or inadequately hedged positions. In addition, certain types of economic hedging activities may not qualify for hedge accounting under U.S. GAAP, resulting in increased volatility in our net income. The Company may also suffer losses associated with \"basis risk,\" which is the difference in performance between the hedge instrument and the underlying exposure (usually the pricing node of the generation facility). Furthermore, there is a risk that the current counterparties to these arrangements may fail or are unable to perform part or all of their obligations under these arrangements, while we seek to protect against that by utilizing strong credit requirements and exchange trades, these protections may not fully cover the exposure in the event of a counterparty default.\nFor our businesses with PPA pricing that does not completely pass through our fuel costs, the businesses attempt to manage the exposure through flexible fuel purchasing and timing of entry and terms of our fuel supply agreements; however, these risk management efforts may not be successful and the resulting commodity exposure could have a material impact on these businesses and/or our results of operations.\nWe may not be able to attract and retain skilled people.\nOur operating success and ability to carry out growth initiatives depends, in part, on our ability to retain\n61 | 2019 Annual Report\nexecutives and to attract and retain additional qualified personnel who have experience in our industry and in operating a company of our size and complexity, including people in our foreign businesses. The inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business, because of the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacements.\nOur utilities businesses may be negatively affected by a lack of growth or slower growth in the number of customers or in customer usage.\nCustomer growth and customer usage in our utilities businesses are affected by a number of factors outside our control, such as mandated energy efficiency measures, demand side management requirements, and economic and demographic conditions, such as population changes, job and income growth, housing starts, new business formation and the overall level of economic activity. A lack of growth, or a decline, in the number of customers or in customer demand for electricity may cause us to fail to fully realize the anticipated benefits from significant investments and expenditures and could have a material adverse effect on our growth, business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nSome of our subsidiaries participate in defined benefit pension plans and their net pension plan obligations may require additional significant contributions.\nWe have 28 defined benefit plans, five at U.S. subsidiaries and the remaining plans at foreign subsidiaries, which cover substantially all of the employees at these subsidiaries. Pension costs are based upon a number of actuarial assumptions, including an expected long-term rate of return on pension plan assets, the expected life span of pension plan beneficiaries and the discount rate used to determine the present value of future pension obligations. Any of these assumptions could prove to be incorrect, resulting in a shortfall of pension plan assets compared to pension obligations under the pension plan. We periodically evaluate the value of the pension plan assets to ensure that they will be sufficient to fund the respective pension obligations. Our exposure to market volatility is mitigated to some extent due to the fact that the asset allocations in our largest plans include a significant weighting of investments in fixed income securities that are generally less volatile than investments in equity securities. Future downturns in the debt and/or equity markets, or the inaccuracy of any of our significant assumptions underlying the estimates of our subsidiaries' pension plan obligations, could result in an increase in pension expense and future funding requirements, which may be material. Our subsidiaries that participate in these plans are responsible for satisfying the funding requirements required by law in their respective jurisdictions for any shortfall of pension plan assets as compared to pension obligations under the pension plan. Satisfying such funding requirements may necessitate additional cash contributions to the pension plans that could adversely affect the Parent Company and our subsidiaries' liquidity. For additional information regarding the funding position of the Company's pension plans, see Item 7.-Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates-Pension and Other Postretirement Plans and Note 15.-Benefit Plans included in Item 8.-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data included in this Form 10-K.\nImpairment of goodwill or long-lived assets would negatively impact our consolidated results of operations and net worth.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Company had approximately $1.1 billion of goodwill, which represented approximately 3% of the total assets on its Consolidated Balance Sheets. Goodwill is not amortized, but is evaluated for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if impairment indicators are present. We may be required to evaluate the potential impairment of goodwill outside of the required annual evaluation process if we experience situations, including but not limited to: deterioration in general economic conditions, or our operating or regulatory environment; increased competitive environment; lower forecasted revenue; increase in fuel costs, particularly when we are unable to pass through the impact to customers; increase in environmental compliance costs; negative or declining cash flows; loss of a key contract or customer, particularly when we are unable to replace it on equally favorable terms; developments in our strategy; divestiture of a significant component of our business; or adverse actions or assessments by a regulator. For example, during the annual goodwill impairment test performed as of October 1, 2019, the Company determined that the fair value of its Gener reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by 3%. Therefore, Gener's $868 million goodwill balance was considered to be \"at risk\" for impairment as of December 31, 2019, largely due to the Chilean Government's announcement to phase out coal generation by 2040, and a decline in long-term energy prices. See Item 7.-Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Key Trends and Uncertainties-Impairments. These types of events and the resulting analyses could result in goodwill impairment, which could substantially affect our results of\n62 | 2019 Annual Report\noperations for those periods. Additionally, goodwill may be impaired if our acquisitions do not perform as expected. See the risk factor Our acquisitions may not perform as expected for further discussion.\nLong-lived assets are initially recorded at fair value and are amortized or depreciated over their estimated useful lives. Long-lived assets are evaluated for impairment only when impairment indicators, similar to those described above for goodwill, are present, whereas goodwill is also evaluated for impairment on an annual basis.\nAny of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nOur acquisitions may not perform as expected.\nHistorically, acquisitions have been a significant part of our growth strategy. We may continue to grow our business through acquisitions. Although acquired businesses may have significant operating histories, we will have a limited or no history of owning and operating many of these businesses and possibly limited or no experience operating in the country or region where these businesses are located. Some of these businesses may have been government owned and some may be operated as part of a larger integrated utility prior to their acquisition. If we were to acquire any of these types of businesses, there can be no assurance that:\n\u2022\nwe will be successful in transitioning them to private ownership;\n\u2022\nsuch businesses will perform as expected;\n\u2022\nintegration or other one-time costs will not be greater than expected;\n\u2022\nwe will not incur unforeseen obligations or liabilities;\n\u2022\nsuch businesses will generate sufficient cash flow to support the indebtedness incurred to acquire them or the capital expenditures needed to develop them; or\n\u2022\nthe rate of return from such businesses will justify our decision to invest capital to acquire them.\nRisks associated with Governmental Regulation and Laws\nOur operations are subject to significant government regulation and our business and results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in the law or regulatory schemes.\nOur ability to predict, influence or respond appropriately to changes in law or regulatory schemes, including any ability to obtain expected or contracted increases in electricity tariff or contract rates or tariff adjustments for increased expenses, could adversely impact our results of operations or our ability to meet publicly announced projections or analysts' expectations. Furthermore, changes in laws or regulations or changes in the application or interpretation of regulatory provisions in jurisdictions where we operate, particularly at our utilities where electricity tariffs are subject to regulatory review or approval, could adversely affect our business, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nchanges in the determination, definition or classification of costs to be included as reimbursable or pass-through costs to be included in the rates we charge our customers, including but not limited to costs incurred to upgrade our power plants to comply with more stringent environmental regulations;\n\u2022\nchanges in the determination of what is an appropriate rate of return on invested capital or a determination that a utility's operating income or the rates it charges customers are too high, resulting in a reduction of rates or consumer rebates;\n\u2022\nchanges in the definition or determination of controllable or non-controllable costs;\n\u2022\nadverse changes in tax law;\n\u2022\nchanges in law or regulation which limit or otherwise affect the ability of our counterparties (including sovereign or private parties) to fulfill their obligations (including payment obligations) to us or our subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nchanges in environmental law which impose additional costs or limit the dispatch of our generating facilities within our subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nchanges in the definition of events which may or may not qualify as changes in economic equilibrium;\n\u2022\nchanges in the timing of tariff increases;\n\u2022\nother changes in the regulatory determinations under the relevant concessions;\n\u2022\nother changes related to licensing or permitting which affect our ability to conduct business; or\n63 | 2019 Annual Report\n\u2022\nother changes that impact the short- or long-term price-setting mechanism in the markets where we operate.\nAny of the above events may result in lower operating margins for the affected businesses, which can adversely affect our business.\nIn many countries where we conduct business, the regulatory environment is constantly changing and it may be difficult to predict the impact of the regulations on our businesses. The impacts described above could also result from our (or our subsidiaries') efforts to comply with European Market Infrastructure Regulation, which includes regulations related to the trading, reporting and clearing of derivatives. It is also possible that additional similar regulations may be passed in other jurisdictions where we conduct business. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on the Company.\nSeveral of our businesses are subject to potentially significant remediation expenses, enforcement initiatives, private party lawsuits and reputational risk associated with CCR.\nCCR, which consists of bottom ash, fly ash and air pollution control wastes generated at our current and former coal-fired generation plant sites, is currently handled and/or has been handled in the past in the following ways: placement in onsite CCR ponds; disposal and beneficial use in onsite and offsite permitted, engineered landfills; use in various beneficial use applications, including encapsulated uses and structural fill; and used in permitted offsite mine reclamation. CCR currently remains onsite at several of our facilities, including in CCR ponds. The U.S. EPA's final CCR rule, which became effective in October 2015, regulates CCR as nonhazardous solid waste and establishes national minimum criteria for existing and new CCR landfills and existing and new CCR ponds, including location restrictions, design and operating criteria, groundwater monitoring, corrective action and closure requirements and post-closure care. On December 16, 2016, President Obama signed the WIN Act into law, which includes provisions to implement the CCR rule through a state permitting program, or if the state chooses not to participate, a possible federal permit program. The primary enforcement mechanisms under this regulation could be actions commenced by U.S. EPA, states, or territories, and private lawsuits. Compliance with the U.S. federal CCR rule; amendments to the federal CCR rule; or federal, state, territory, or foreign rules or programs addressing CCR may require us to incur substantial costs. In addition, the Company and our businesses may face CCR-related lawsuits in the United States and/or internationally that may expose us to unexpected potential liabilities. Furthermore, CCR-related litigation may also expose us to unexpected costs. In addition, CCR, and its production at several of our facilities, have been the subject of significant interest from environmental non-governmental organizations and have received national and local media attention. The direct and indirect effects of such media attention, and the demands of responding to and addressing it, may divert management time and attention. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, reputation and prospects.\nOur business in the United States is subject to the provisions of various laws and regulations administered in whole or in part by FERC and NERC, including PURPA, the FPA, and the EPAct 2005. Actions by FERC, NERC and by state utility commissions can have a material effect on our operations.\nThe AES Corporation is a registered electric holding company under the U.S. Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 (\"PUHCA 2005\") as enacted as part of the EPAct 2005. PUHCA 2005 eliminated many of the restrictions that had been in place under the U.S. Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, while continuing to provide FERC and state utility commissions with enhanced access to the books and records of certain utility holding companies. PUHCA 2005 also creates additional potential challenges and opportunities. By removing some barriers to mergers and other potential combinations, the creation of large, geographically dispersed utility holding companies is more likely. These entities may have enhanced financial strength and therefore an increased ability to compete with us in the U.S. market.\nOther parts of the EPAct 2005 allow FERC to remove the PURPA purchase/sale obligations from utilities if there are adequate opportunities to sell into competitive markets. FERC has exercised this power with a rebuttable presumption that utilities located within the control areas of MISO, PJM, ISO New England, Inc., the New York Independent System Operator, Inc., and ERCOT are not required to purchase or sell power from or to QFs above a certain size. Additionally, FERC has the power to remove the purchase/sale obligations of individual utilities on a case-by-case basis. While these changes do not affect existing contracts, certain of our QFs that have had sales\n64 | 2019 Annual Report\ncontracts expire are now facing a more difficult market environment and that is likely to continue for other AES QFs with existing contracts that will expire over time.\nIn accordance with Congressional mandates in the EPAct 1992 and the EPAct 2005, FERC has strongly encouraged competition in wholesale electric markets. Increased competition may have the effect of lowering our operating margins. Among other steps, FERC has encouraged RTOs and ISOs to develop demand response bidding programs as a mechanism for responding to peak electric demand. These programs may reduce the value of generation assets. Similarly, FERC is encouraging the construction of new transmission infrastructure in accordance with provisions of EPAct 2005. Although new transmission lines may increase market opportunities, they may also increase the competition in our existing markets.\nFERC has civil penalty authority over violations of any provision of Part II of the FPA, which concerns wholesale generation or transmission, as well as any rule or order issued thereunder. The FPA also provides for the assessment of criminal fines and imprisonment for violations under the FPA. This penalty authority was enhanced in EPAct 2005. As a result, FERC is authorized to assess a maximum penalty authority established by statute and such penalty authority has been and will continue to be adjusted periodically to account for inflation. With this expanded enforcement authority, violations of the FPA and FERC's regulations could potentially have more serious consequences than in the past.\nPursuant to EPAct 2005, the NERC has been certified by FERC as the Electric Reliability Organization (\"ERO\") to develop mandatory and enforceable electric system reliability standards applicable throughout the U.S. to improve the overall reliability of the electric grid. These standards are subject to FERC review and approval. Once approved, the reliability standards may be enforced by FERC independently, or, alternatively, by the ERO and regional reliability organizations with responsibility for auditing, investigating and otherwise ensuring compliance with reliability standards, subject to FERC oversight. Violations of NERC reliability standards are subject to FERC's penalty authority under the FPA and EPAct 2005.\nOur utility businesses in the U.S. face significant regulation by their respective state utility commissions. The regulatory discretion is reasonably broad in both Indiana and Ohio and includes regulation as to services and facilities, the valuation of property, the construction, purchase, or lease of electric generating facilities, the classification of accounts, rates of depreciation, the increase or decrease in retail rates and charges, the issuance of certain securities, the acquisition and sale of some public utility properties or securities and certain other matters. These businesses face the risk of unexpected or adverse regulatory action which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. See Item 1.-Business-US and Utilities SBU for further information on the regulation faced by our U.S. utilities.\nOur businesses are subject to stringent environmental laws, rules and regulations.\nOur businesses are subject to stringent environmental laws and regulations by many federal, regional, state and local authorities, international treaties and foreign governmental authorities. These laws and regulations generally concern emissions into the air, effluents into the water, use of water, wetlands preservation, remediation of contamination, waste disposal, endangered species and noise regulation. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations or to obtain or comply with any associated environmental permits could result in fines or other sanctions. For example, in recent years, the EPA has issued notices of violation (\"NOVs\") to a number of coal-fired generating plants alleging wide-spread violations of the new source review and prevention of significant deterioration provisions of the CAA. The EPA has brought suit against and obtained settlements with many companies for allegedly making major modifications to a coal-fired generating units without proper permit approvals and without installing best available control technology. The primary focus of these NOVs has been emissions of SO2 and NOx and the EPA has imposed fines and required companies to install improved pollution control technologies to reduce such emissions. In addition, state regulatory agencies and non-governmental environmental organizations have pursued civil lawsuits against power plants in situations that have resulted in judgments and/or settlements requiring the installation of expensive pollution controls or the accelerated retirement of certain electric generating units.\nFurthermore, Congress and other domestic and foreign governmental authorities have either considered or implemented various laws and regulations to restrict or tax certain emissions, particularly those involving air emissions and water discharges. These laws and regulations have imposed, and proposed laws and regulations could impose in the future, additional costs on the operation of our power plants. See the various descriptions of these laws and regulations contained in Item 1.-Business-Environmental and Land-Use Regulations of this Form 10-K.\n65 | 2019 Annual Report\nWe have incurred and will continue to incur significant capital and other expenditures to comply with these and other environmental laws and regulations. Changes in, or new development of, environmental restrictions may force us to incur significant expenses or expenses that may exceed our estimates. There can be no assurance that we would be able to recover all or any increased environmental costs from our customers or that our business, financial condition, including recorded asset values or results of operations, would not be materially and adversely affected by such expenditures or any changes in domestic or foreign environmental laws and regulations.\nConcerns about GHG emissions and the potential risks associated with climate change have led to increased regulation and other actions that could impact our businesses.\nInternational, federal and various regional and state authorities regulate GHG emissions and have created financial incentives to reduce them. In 2019, the Company's subsidiaries operated businesses that had total CO2 emissions of approximately 55 million metric tonnes, approximately 23 million of which were emitted by our U.S. businesses (both figures are ownership adjusted). The Company uses CO2 emission estimation methodologies supported by \"The Greenhouse Gas Protocol\" reporting standard on GHG emissions. For existing power generation plants, CO2 emissions data are either obtained directly from plant continuous emission monitoring systems or calculated from actual fuel heat inputs and fuel type CO2 emission factors. The estimated annual CO2 emissions from fossil fuel-fired electric power generation facilities of the Company's subsidiaries that are in construction or development and have received the necessary air permits for commercial operations are approximately 7 million metric tonnes (ownership adjusted). This overall estimate is based on a number of projections and assumptions that may prove to be incorrect, such as the forecasted dispatch, anticipated plant efficiency, fuel type, CO2 emissions rates and our subsidiaries' achieving completion of such construction and development projects. However, it is certain that the projects under construction or development when completed will increase emissions of our portfolio and therefore could increase the risks associated with regulation of GHG emissions. Because there is significant uncertainty regarding these estimates, actual emissions from these projects under construction or development may vary substantially from these estimates.\nThere currently is no U.S. federal legislation imposing mandatory GHG emission reductions (including for CO2) that affects our electric power generation facilities; however, in 2015, the EPA promulgated a rule establishing New Source Performance Standards for CO2 emissions for newly constructed and modified/reconstructed fossil-fueled EUSGUs larger than 25 MW and in 2018 proposed revisions to the rule. In 2019, the EPA promulgated the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) Rule replacing the EPA's 2015 Clean Power Plan (CPP), which was revoked in 2019. The ACE Rule establishes heat rate improvement measures as the best system of emissions reductions for existing coal-fired electric generating units. These actions have been challenged in court and the current Administration has announced plans to significantly amend or rescind the rules. In 2010, the EPA adopted regulations pertaining to GHG emissions that require new and existing sources of GHG emissions to potentially obtain new source review permits from the EPA prior to construction or modification. In 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that such permitting would only be required if such sources also must obtain a new source review permit for increases in other regulated pollutants.\nFor further discussion of the regulation of GHG emissions, including the U.S. Supreme Court's issued order staying implementation of the CPP, and the EPA's proposal to rescind the CPP, see Item 1.-Business-Environmental and Land-Use Regulations-United States Environmental and Land-Use Legislation and Regulations-Greenhouse Gas Emissions above.\nIn December 2015, the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change convened for the 21st Conference of the Parties and the resulting Paris Agreement established a long-term goal of keeping the increase in global average temperature well below 2\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. We anticipate that the Paris Agreement will continue the trend toward efforts to de-carbonize the global economy and to further limit GHG emissions. On November 4, 2019, the U.S. announced that it had officially notified the U.N. that the U.S. will withdraw from the Paris Agreement as soon as November 4, 2020.\nThe impact of GHG regulation on our operations will depend on a number of factors, including among others, the degree and timing of GHG emissions reductions required under any such legislation or regulation, the cost of emissions reduction equipment and the price and availability of offsets, the extent to which market based compliance options are available, the extent to which our subsidiaries would be entitled to receive GHG emissions allowances without having to purchase them in an auction or on the open market and the impact of such legislation or regulation on the ability of our subsidiaries to recover costs incurred through rate increases or otherwise. The costs of compliance could be substantial.\n66 | 2019 Annual Report\nOur non-utility, generation subsidiaries seek to pass on any costs arising from CO2 emissions to contract counterparties. Likewise, our utility subsidiaries seek to pass on any costs arising from CO2 emissions to customers. However, there can be no assurance that we will effectively pass such costs onto the contract counterparties or customers, respectively, or that the cost and burden associated with any dispute over which party bears such costs would not be burdensome and costly.\nIn addition to government regulators, many groups, including politicians, environmentalists, the investor community and other private parties have expressed increasing concern about GHG emissions. New regulation, such as the initiatives in Chile and the Puerto Rico Energy Public Policy Act, may adversely affect our operations. See Item 7.-Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Key Trends and Uncertainties-Decarbonization Initiatives. Responding to these decarbonization initiatives may present challenges to our business. We may be unable to develop our renewables platform as quickly as anticipated. Further, we may be unable to dispose of coal-fired generation assets at anticipated prices, the estimated useful lives of these assets may decrease, and the value of such assets may be impaired. These initiatives could also result in the early retirement of coal-fired generation facilities, which could result in stranded costs if regulators disallow full recovery of investments.\nNegative public perception of our GHG emissions could have an adverse effect on our relationships with third parties, our ability to attract additional customers, our business development opportunities, and our ability to access finance and insurance for our coal-fired generation assets.\nIn addition, plaintiffs previously brought tort lawsuits against the Company because of its subsidiaries' GHG emissions. While these lawsuits were dismissed, future similar lawsuits may prevail or result in damages awards or other relief. We may also be subject to risks associated with the impact on weather conditions. See Certain of our businesses are sensitive to variations in weather and hydrology and Severe weather and natural disasters may present significant risks to our business and adversely affect our financial results within this section for more information. If any of the foregoing risks materialize, costs may increase or revenues may decrease and there could be a material adverse effect on our electric power generation businesses and on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition,cash flows and reputation.\nConcerns about data privacy have led to increased regulation and other actions that could impact our businesses.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we collect and retain sensitive information, including personal identification information about customers and employees, customer energy usage and other information. The theft, damage or improper disclosure of sensitive electronic data collected by us can subject us to penalties for violation of applicable privacy laws, subject us to claims from third parties, require compliance with notification and monitoring regulations, and harm our reputation. The EU GDPR applies to the processing of personal information collected from individuals located in the EU, creates additional compliance obligations and significantly increases fines for noncompliance. Furthermore, the California Consumer Privacy Act (\"CCPA\") has recently introduced new requirements that have broad effect, the impact of which is uncertain at this time. Any actual or perceived failure to comply with the GDPR, the CCPA, the General Data Privacy Law in Brazil or other data privacy laws or regulations, or related contractual or other obligations, or any perceived privacy rights violation, could lead to investigations, claims, and proceedings by governmental entities and private parties, damages for contract breach, and other significant costs, penalties, and other liabilities, as well as harm to our reputation and market position. In addition, any actual or perceived failure on the part of one of our equity affiliates could result in a decrease in the value of our investment as well as harm to our reputation and future business prospects.\nTax legislation initiatives or challenges to our tax positions could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur subsidiaries have operations in the U.S. and various non-U.S. jurisdictions. As such, we are subject to the tax laws and regulations of the U.S. federal, state and local governments and of many non-U.S. jurisdictions. From time to time, legislative measures may be enacted that could adversely affect our overall tax positions regarding income or other taxes. There can be no assurance that our effective tax rate or tax payments will not be adversely affected by these legislative measures.\nThe TCJA enacted December 22, 2017 introduced significant changes to current U.S. federal tax law. These changes are complex and are subject to additional guidance to be issued by the U.S. Treasury and the Internal Revenue Service. In addition, the reaction to the federal tax changes by the individual states is evolving. Our\n67 | 2019 Annual Report\ninterpretations and assumptions around U.S. tax reform may evolve in future periods as further administrative guidance and regulations are issued, which may materially affect our effective tax rate or tax payments. For further details, please see Item 7.-Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Key Trends and Uncertainties in this Form 10-K.\nAdditionally, longstanding international tax norms that determine how and where cross-border international trade is subjected to tax are evolving. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, in coordination with the G8 and G20, through its Base Erosion and Profit Shifting project introduced a series of recommendations that many tax jurisdictions have adopted, or may adopt in the future, as law. As these and other tax laws, related regulations and double-tax conventions change, our financial results could be materially impacted. Given the unpredictability of these possible changes and their potential interdependency, it is very difficult to assess whether the overall effect of such potential tax changes would be cumulatively positive or negative for our earnings and cash flow, but such changes could adversely impact our results of operations.\nU.S. federal, state and local, as well as non-U.S., tax laws and regulations are extremely complex and subject to varying interpretations. There can be no assurance that our tax positions will be sustained if challenged by relevant tax authorities and if not sustained, there could be a material impact on our results of operations.\nWe and our affiliates are subject to material litigation and regulatory proceedings.\nWe and our affiliates are parties to material litigation and regulatory proceedings. See Item 3.- Legal Proceedings below. There can be no assurances that the outcome of such matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position.\nRisks Related to our Indebtedness and Financial Condition\nWe have a significant amount of debt, a large percentage of which is secured, that could adversely affect our business and our ability to fulfill our obligations.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $20 billion of outstanding indebtedness on a consolidated basis. All outstanding borrowings, if any, under The AES Corporation's senior secured credit facility and secured term loan are secured by certain of our assets, including the pledge of capital stock of many of The AES Corporation's directly held subsidiaries. Most of the debt of The AES Corporation's subsidiaries is secured by substantially all of the assets of those subsidiaries. Since we have such a high level of debt, a substantial portion of cash flow from operations must be used to make payments on this debt. Furthermore, since a significant percentage of our assets are used to secure this debt, this reduces the amount of collateral available for future secured debt or credit support and reduces our flexibility in operating these secured assets. This high level of indebtedness and related security could have other important consequences to us and our investors, including:\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult to satisfy debt service and other obligations at the holding company and/or individual subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to general adverse industry and economic conditions, including but not limited to adverse changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices;\n\u2022\nreducing available cash flow to fund other corporate purposes and grow our business;\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry;\n\u2022\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage to our competitors that are not as highly leveraged; and\n\u2022\nlimiting, along with the financial and other restrictive covenants relating to such indebtedness, among other things, our ability to borrow additional funds as needed or take advantage of business opportunities as they arise, pay cash dividends or repurchase common stock.\nThe agreements governing our indebtedness, including the indebtedness of our subsidiaries, limit, but do not prohibit the incurrence of additional indebtedness. If we were to become more leveraged, the risks described above would increase. Further, our actual cash requirements in the future may be greater than expected. Accordingly, our cash flows may not be sufficient to repay at maturity all of the outstanding debt as it becomes due and, in that event, we may not be able to borrow money, sell assets, raise equity or otherwise raise funds on acceptable terms or at all to refinance our debt as it becomes due. In addition, our ability to refinance existing or future indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could come at higher interest rates or may require us to comply with onerous covenants, which could restrict our business\n68 | 2019 Annual Report\noperations. See Note 11.-Debt included in Item 8.-Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this Form 10-K for a schedule of our debt maturities.\nThe AES Corporation is a holding company and its ability to make payments on its outstanding indebtedness is dependent upon the receipt of funds from its subsidiaries by way of dividends, fees, interest, loans or otherwise.\nThe AES Corporation is a holding company with no material assets other than the stock of its subsidiaries. Almost all of The AES Corporation's cash flow is generated by the operating activities of its subsidiaries. Therefore, The AES Corporation's ability to make payments on its indebtedness and to fund its other obligations is dependent not only on the ability of its subsidiaries to generate cash, but also on the ability of the subsidiaries to distribute cash to it in the form of dividends, fees, interest, tax sharing payments, loans or otherwise.\nOur subsidiaries face various restrictions in their ability to distribute cash. Most of the subsidiaries are obligated, pursuant to loan agreements, indentures or non-recourse financing arrangements, to satisfy certain restricted payment covenants or other conditions before they may make distributions to The AES Corporation. Business performance and local accounting and tax rules may also limit dividend distributions. Subsidiaries in foreign countries may also be prevented from distributing funds to The AES Corporation as a result of foreign governments restricting the repatriation of funds or the conversion of currencies.\nThe AES Corporation's subsidiaries are separate and distinct legal entities and, unless they have expressly guaranteed any of The AES Corporation's indebtedness, have no obligation, contingent or otherwise, to pay any amounts due pursuant to such debt or to make any funds available whether by dividends, fees, loans or other payments.\nExisting and potential future defaults by subsidiaries or affiliates could adversely affect The AES Corporation.\nWe attempt to finance our domestic and foreign projects primarily under loan agreements and related documents that, except as noted below, require the loans to be repaid solely from the project's revenues and provide that the repayment of the loans (and interest thereon) is secured solely by the capital stock, physical assets, contracts and cash flow of that project subsidiary or affiliate. This type of financing is usually referred to as non-recourse debt or \"non-recourse financing.\" In some non-recourse financings, The AES Corporation has explicitly agreed to undertake certain limited obligations and contingent liabilities, most of which by their terms will only be effective or will be terminated upon the occurrence of future events. These obligations and liabilities take the form of guarantees, indemnities, letters of credit, letter of credit reimbursement agreements and agreements to pay, in certain circumstances, the project lenders or other parties.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $20 billion of outstanding indebtedness on a consolidated basis, of which approximately $3.4 billion was recourse debt of The AES Corporation and approximately $16.7 billion was non-recourse debt. In addition, we have outstanding guarantees, indemnities, letters of credit, and other credit support commitments which are further described in this Form 10-K in Item 7.-Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Capital Resources and Liquidity-Parent Company Liquidity.\nSome of our subsidiaries are currently in default with respect to all or a portion of their outstanding indebtedness. The total debt classified as current in our Consolidated Balance Sheets related to such defaults was $325 million as of December 31, 2019. While the lenders under our non-recourse financings generally do not have direct recourse to The AES Corporation (other than to the extent of any credit support given by The AES Corporation), defaults thereunder can still have important consequences for The AES Corporation, including, without limitation:\n\u2022\nreducing The AES Corporation's receipt of subsidiary dividends, fees, interest payments, loans and other sources of cash since the project subsidiary will typically be prohibited from distributing cash to The AES Corporation during the pendency of any default;\n\u2022\nunder certain circumstances, triggering The AES Corporation's obligation to make payments under any financial guarantee, letter of credit or other credit support which The AES Corporation may have provided to or on behalf of such subsidiary;\n\u2022\ntriggering defaults in The AES Corporation's outstanding debt. For example, The AES Corporation's senior secured credit facility, secured term loan, and outstanding senior notes include events of default for certain\n69 | 2019 Annual Report\nbankruptcy related events involving material subsidiaries. In addition, The AES Corporation's senior secured credit facility includes certain events of default relating to accelerations of outstanding material debt of material subsidiaries or any subsidiaries that in the aggregate constitute a material subsidiary; or\n\u2022\nforeclosure on the assets that are pledged under the non-recourse loans, resulting in write-downs of assets and eliminating any and all potential future benefits derived from those assets.\nNone of the projects that are currently in default are owned by subsidiaries that individually or in the aggregate meet the applicable standard of materiality in The AES Corporation's senior secured credit facility or other debt agreements in order for such defaults to trigger an event of default or permit acceleration under such indebtedness. However, as a result of future mix of distributions, write-down of assets, dispositions and other matters that affect our financial position and results of operations, it is possible that one or more of these subsidiaries, individually or in the aggregate, could fall within the applicable standard of materiality and thereby upon an acceleration of such subsidiary's debt, trigger an event of default and possible acceleration of the indebtedness under The AES Corporation's senior secured credit facility or other indebtedness of The AES Corporation.\nThe AES Corporation has significant cash requirements and limited sources of liquidity.\nThe AES Corporation requires cash primarily to fund:\n\u2022\nprincipal repayments of debt;\n\u2022\ninterest;\n\u2022\nacquisitions;\n\u2022\nconstruction and other project commitments;\n\u2022\nother equity commitments, including business development investments;\n\u2022\nequity repurchases and/or cash dividends on our common stock;\n\u2022\ntaxes; and\n\u2022\nParent Company overhead costs.\nThe AES Corporation's principal sources of liquidity are:\n\u2022\ndividends and other distributions from its subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nproceeds from debt and equity financings at the Parent Company level; and\n\u2022\nproceeds from asset sales.\nFor a more detailed discussion of The AES Corporation's cash requirements and sources of liquidity, please see Item 7.-Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Capital Resources and Liquidity in this Form 10-K.\nWhile we believe that these sources will be adequate to meet our obligations at the Parent Company level for the foreseeable future, this belief is based on a number of material assumptions, which could prove incorrect, including, without limitation, assumptions about our ability to access the capital or commercial lending markets, the operating and financial performance of our subsidiaries, exchange rates, our ability to sell assets, and the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends and other distributions. There can be no assurance that these sources will be available when needed or that our actual cash requirements will not be greater than expected. In addition, our cash flow may not be sufficient to repay at maturity the entire principal outstanding under our credit facility, term loan, and our debt securities and we may have to refinance such obligations. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining such refinancing on terms acceptable to us or at all and any of these events could have a material effect on us.\nOur ability to grow our business depends on our ability to raise capital on favorable terms.\nFrom time to time, we rely on access to capital markets as a source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by operating cash flows. Our ability to arrange for financing on either a recourse or non-recourse basis and the costs of such capital are dependent on numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and capital market conditions;\n\u2022\nthe availability of bank credit;\n\u2022\nthe financial condition, performance and prospects of The AES Corporation in general and/or that of any subsidiary requiring the financing;\n70 | 2019 Annual Report\n\u2022\nthe financial condition, performance and prospects of other companies in our industry or with similar financial circumstances; and\n\u2022\nchanges in tax and securities laws which are conducive to raising capital.\nShould access to capital not be available to us, we may have to sell assets or decide not to build new plants, or expand or improve existing facilities, either of which would affect our future growth, results of operations or financial condition.\nDifficulty raising sufficient capital to fund development projects in less developed economies could affect our growth strategy.\nPart of our growth strategy is to develop businesses in less developed economies where the return on our investment may be greater than projects in more developed economies. Commercial lending institutions sometimes refuse to provide non-recourse project financing in certain less developed economies, and in these situations we have sought and may continue to seek direct or indirect (through credit support or guarantees) project financing from a limited number of multilateral or bilateral international financial institutions or agencies. As a precondition to making such project financing available, the lending institutions may also require governmental guarantees for certain project and sovereign-related risks. There can be no assurance, however, that project financing from the international financial agencies or that governmental guarantees will be available when needed, and if they are not, we may have to abandon the relevant project or invest more of our own funds, which may not be in line with our investment objectives and would leave less funds for other projects.\nA downgrade in the credit ratings of The AES Corporation or its subsidiaries could adversely affect our access to the capital markets, increase our interest costs and/or adversely affect our liquidity and cash flow.\nIf any of the credit ratings of the The AES Corporation and its subsidiaries were to be downgraded, our ability to raise capital on favorable terms could be impaired and our borrowing costs could increase. In addition, the recent downgrade in the credit ratings of DPL Inc. and DP&L may impact the cost of refinancing their respective debt securities as they come due. Furthermore, depending on The AES Corporation's credit ratings and the trading prices of its equity and debt securities, counterparties may no longer be as willing to accept general unsecured commitments by The AES Corporation to provide credit support. Accordingly, with respect to both new and existing commitments, The AES Corporation may be required to provide some other form of assurance, such as a letter of credit and/or collateral, to backstop or replace any credit support by The AES Corporation. There can be no assurance that such counterparties will accept such guarantees or that AES could arrange such further assurances in the future. In addition, to the extent The AES Corporation is required and able to provide letters of credit or other collateral to such counterparties, it will limit the amount of credit available to The AES Corporation to meet its other liquidity needs.\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile.\nThe market price and trading volumes of our common stock could fluctuate substantially in the future. Factors that could affect the price of our common stock include, among other factors, general conditions in our industry and the power markets in which we participate, environmental and economic developments, and general credit and capital markets conditions, as well as developments specific to us, including risks that could result in revenue and earnings volatility, failing to meet our publicly announced guidance or other risk factors described in Item 1A.-Risk Factors and key trends and other matters described in Item 7.-Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations.", "PERMNO": 76712, "SIC": 4991, "TIC": "AES"}
