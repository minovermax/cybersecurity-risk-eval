Risk Factors\nIn addition to other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating the Company and its business and this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The realization of events pertaining to any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Furthermore, additional risks not presently known to management or that management currently believes to be immaterial may also adversely affect the business.\nCertain statements in \u201cRisk Factors\u201d are forward-looking statements. See \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d described on page 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information.\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nGeneral economic conditions may adversely impact our industry and customers resulting in adverse effects on the Company\u2019s operating results.\nFinancial markets in the United States, Europe and Asia experienced substantial disruption from prior recessions, including, among other things, extreme volatility in security prices, severely diminished liquidity and credit availability, rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others. A slow and extended recovery or a downturn, worsening or broadening of adverse conditions in the worldwide and domestic economies could negatively affect purchases of our products, and create or exacerbate credit issues, cash flow issues and other financial issues for us and for our suppliers and customers. Depending upon their severity and duration, these conditions could have a material adverse impact on our business, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nCurrent and future economic conditions and other factors, including consumer confidence, interest rates, unemployment trends, government regulations, and liquidity in capital markets can impact consumer spending and demand for our products. Such economic developments may affect our business in a number of ways. Reduced demand may drive us and our competitors to offer products at promotional prices, which would have a negative impact on our profitability. Also, credit availability may adversely affect the ability of our customers and suppliers to obtain financing for significant purchases and operations which could result in a decrease in, or cancellation of, orders for our products. If demand for our products slows down or decreases, we will not be able to improve our revenues and we may run the risk of failing to satisfy the financial and other restrictive covenants to which we are subject under our existing indebtedness. Reduced revenues as a result of decreased demand may also hinder our ability to improve our performance in connection with our long-term strategy.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe MRO product distribution industry is highly competitive. We face significant competition from national and regional distributors that market their products through the use of direct sales forces as well as direct marketing, websites and catalogs. In addition, we face competition from traditional channels of distribution such as retail outlets, small wholesalers and large warehouse stores and from buying groups formed by smaller distributors, internet-based procurement service companies, auction businesses and trade exchanges. We expect that new competitors may develop over time as internet-based enterprises become more established and reliable and refine their service capabilities.\nCompetition in our industry is primarily based upon product line breadth, product availability, technology, service capabilities and price. To the extent that existing or future competitors seek to gain or retain market share by reducing price or by increasing support service offerings, we may be required to lower our prices or to make additional expenditures for support services, thereby reducing our profitability.\nIn addition, the MRO product distribution industry is undergoing changes driven by ongoing industry consolidation and increased customer demands. Traditional MRO product distributors are consolidating operations and acquiring or merging with other MRO product distributors to achieve greater economies of scale capabilities and increase efficiency. This consolidation trend could cause the industry to become more competitive and may adversely affect our operating margins and growth prospects. Furthermore, an inability on our part to successfully compete within our target markets could result in lost customers and a corresponding decline in sales, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAdverse changes in industry trends and economic factors specific to the principal markets in which we serve may negatively impact our net sales growth and operating margins.\nWe currently market and sell our products across certain facilities maintenance end-markets, including institutional facilities, multi-family housing facilities, and residential facilities. The demand for our products and services depends to some degree on the capital spending levels of end-users within these markets. The strength of these markets depends on many factors, generally outside of the Company\u2019s control, including general economic conditions, government spending, credit availability and stability of the housing markets, including new residential construction and home improvement activity levels. The success of our business depends in part on our ability to identify and respond promptly to evolving trends in demographics, consumer preferences, expectations and needs, and unexpected weather conditions. Adverse changes in industry trends as well as weaknesses in the industries in which our customers operate may negatively impact the rate of growth of our net sales and operating margins.\nWe are exposed to additional risks as a result of our foreign operations and global product sourcing.\nOur foreign operations expose us to certain risks associated with global economic conditions, political instability, regulatory changes, cultural and legal differences, and currency exchange rate fluctuations. Risks inherent in international operations also include, among others, potential adverse tax consequences, greater credit risk exposure and risks associated with enhanced logistics complexity. Adverse changes to any of these factors may negatively impact our profitability and results of operations.\nBecause the functional currency related to most of our foreign operations is the applicable local currency, we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risks arising from transactions in the normal course of business. Our primary currency exposure risks are with the Canadian dollar and the Chinese Yuan. Fluctuations in the relative strength of foreign economies and volatility in their related currencies could impact our foreign sales and the ability to procure products overseas.\nIn addition, China\u2019s turnover tax system consists of value-added tax (\"VAT\"), consumption tax and business tax. Export sales are exempted under VAT rules and an exporter who incurs input VAT on the manufacture of goods can claim a tax rebate from Chinese tax authorities. Currently, our Chinese suppliers benefit from the tax rebates that China provides them to export their products. If these tax rebates are reduced or eliminated, some of our Chinese-sourced products could become more expensive for us, thereby reducing our profitability.\nFluctuations in the availability or price of raw materials, products, and fuel resources could significantly reduce our revenues and profitability.\nAs a distributor of manufactured products, our profitability is related to the prices we pay to the suppliers from which we purchase our products and to the cost of transporting the products to us and our customers. The price that our suppliers charge us for our products is dependent in part upon the availability and cost of the raw materials used to produce those products. Such raw materials are often subject to price fluctuations, frequently due to factors beyond our control, including changes in supply and demand, U.S. and global economic conditions, labor costs, competition and government regulations. Increases in the cost of raw materials, such as copper, oil, stainless steel, aluminum, zinc, plastic and polyvinyl chloride (\"PVC\") and other commodities and raw materials have occurred in the past and adversely impacted our operating results. In addition, transportation prices are significantly dependent on fuel prices, which generally change due to factors beyond our control, such as changes in worldwide demand, disruptions in supply, changes in the political climate in the Middle East and other regions and changes in government regulations, including existing and pending legislation and regulations relating to climate change. For example, efforts to combat climate change through reduction of greenhouse gases may result in higher fuel costs through taxation or other means.\nFluctuations in raw materials and fuel prices may increase our costs and significantly reduce our revenues and profitability. We deliver a significant volume of products to our customers by truck. Our operating margin may be adversely affected if we are unable to obtain the fuel we require or offset the anticipated impact of higher fuel prices through other means. The nature and extent of such an impact is difficult to predict, quantify and measure. To the extent the costs of products increase or decrease, the prices we charge for our products may correspondingly increase or decrease, potentially affecting our revenues and profitability.\nLoss of supplier agreements, delivery sources or product supplies could decrease our revenues and profitability.\nOur ability to offer a wide variety of products to our customers is dependent upon our ability to obtain adequate product supply from manufacturers or other suppliers. While in many instances we have agreements, including supply chain agreements, with our suppliers, these agreements are generally terminable by either party with limited notice and for any reason. In general, our products are obtainable from various sources and in sufficient quantities; however, the loss of several supplier agreements, or a substantial decrease in the availability of products from our suppliers, could have a short-term material impact on our business.\nDuring the year ended December 26, 2014, we sourced products from approximately 2,600 key suppliers located in various countries around the world. Our two largest suppliers accounted for approximately 6.1% and 5.7% of our total purchases, respectively. No other individual supplier represented more than 5% of our total purchases. Loss of a key supplier could disrupt our supply chain for several months or longer, and loss of key suppliers from an individual country could result in disruptions extending beyond several months. Short and long-term disruptions in our supply chain would result in higher inventory levels as we replace similar products, a higher cost of product and ultimately a decrease in our revenues and profitability. Although we are not substantially dependent on any individual supplier, a disruption in the timely availability of our product by our key suppliers could result in a decrease in our revenues and profitability.\nA change in supplier rebates could adversely affect our income and gross margins.\nThe terms on which we purchase products from many of our suppliers entitle us to receive a rebate based on the volume of our purchases. These rebates effectively reduce our costs for products. If market conditions change, suppliers may adversely change the terms of some or all of these programs. Although these changes would not affect the recorded costs of products already purchased, they may lower our gross margins on products we sell or income we realize in future periods. Further, if we fail to meet specified volume thresholds for certain suppliers, we may not receive the most favorable rebates available, which could increase our expected costs and decrease our gross margins.\nIn some cases, we are dependent on long supply chains, which may subject us to interruptions in the supply of many of the products that we distribute.\nA significant portion of the products that we distribute are imported from foreign countries, including China. Thus, we are dependent on long supply chains for the successful delivery of many of our products. The length and complexity of these supply chains make them vulnerable to numerous risks, many of which are beyond our control, which could cause significant interruptions or delays in delivery of our products, or markedly increase our inventory requirements. Factors such as shortages of raw materials, labor disputes, currency fluctuations, changes in tariff or import policies, natural or man-made disasters, severe weather, security procedures, terrorist attacks or other threats or armed hostilities may disrupt these supply chains. In addition to these factors, loading container cargo in certain ports can be disrupted or delayed by congestion in port terminal facilities, inadequate equipment to load, dock and offload container vessels or energy-related tie-ups. In any such case, our product shipments will be delayed. We expect more of our name brand and exclusive brand products will be imported in the future, which will further increase these risks. A significant interruption in our supply chains caused by any of the above factors could result in increased costs or delivery delays which in turn would result in a decrease in our revenues and profitability.\nThe nature of our business exposes us to potential product quality and liability claims as well as other legal proceedings, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions and operating results.\nWe rely on manufacturers and other suppliers to provide us with the products we sell and distribute. As we do not have direct control over the quality of the products manufactured or supplied by such third-parties, we are exposed to risks related to the quality of the products we distribute. It is possible that inventory from a manufacturer or supplier could be sold to our customers and later be alleged to have quality problems or to have caused personal injury or property damage, subjecting us to potential claims from customers or third parties. We have been subject to such claims in the past, which have been resolved without material financial impact. Product liability claims can be expensive to defend and can divert the attention of management and other personnel for significant time periods, regardless of the ultimate outcome, and could result in settlement payments and adjustments not covered by or in excess of insurance. In addition, we may not be able to obtain insurance on terms acceptable to us or at all. An unsuccessful product liability defense could be very costly and could result in a decline in revenues and profitability. In addition, uncertainties with respect to foreign legal systems may adversely affect us in resolving claims arising from our exclusive brand products manufactured outside of the United States. Finally, even if we are successful in defending any claim relating to the products we distribute, claims of this nature could negatively impact customer confidence in our products and our company which may adversely impact our revenues and profitability.\nWe also operate a large fleet of trucks and other vehicles and therefore face the risk of automobile accidents. While we currently maintain insurance coverage to address a portion of these types of liabilities, we cannot make assurances that we will be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future, if at all, or that any such insurance will provide adequate coverage against potential claims.\nWe are involved from time to time in a number of legal proceedings, including government inquiries and investigations, as well as product liability, employment, tort, intellectual property, commercial, and other litigation. We cannot predict with certainty the outcomes of these legal proceedings and other contingencies. Furthermore, defending against these lawsuits and proceedings may involve significant expense and diversion of management's attention and resources from other matters.\nDisruptions in our distribution centers could significantly lower our revenues and profitability.\nOur distribution centers are essential to the efficient operation of our national distribution network. Any serious disruption to these distribution centers due to man-made or natural disasters including, among others, fire, earthquake, severe weather, acts of terrorism or any other cause, could damage a significant portion of our inventory and could materially impair our ability to distribute products to our customers. Moreover, we could incur significantly higher costs and longer lead times associated with delivering our products to our customers during the time that it takes for us to reopen or replace these centers. As a result, any such disruptions could significantly lower our revenues and profitability.\nWork stoppages and other disruptions at transportation centers or shipping ports may adversely affect our ability to obtain inventory and make deliveries to our customers.\nOur ability to rapidly process customer orders is an integral component of our overall business strategy. Interruptions at our company-operated facilities or disruptions at a major transportation center or shipping port, due to events such as severe weather, labor interruptions, natural disasters, security procedures, acts of terrorism or other events, could affect our ability to maintain core products in inventory, deliver products to our customers on a timely basis or adversely affect demand for our products, which may in turn adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe may not be able to facilitate our growth strategy by identifying or completing transactions with attractive acquisition candidates, which could impede our revenues and profitability.\nOur acquisitions have contributed significantly to our growth. An important element of our growth strategy is to continue to seek additional businesses to acquire in order to add new customers and products within our existing markets or expand our product offerings into new or existing markets in an effort to further leverage our operating infrastructure. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify attractive acquisition candidates or complete the acquisition of any identified candidates at favorable prices and upon advantageous terms and conditions. Furthermore, we believe that our industry is currently undergoing increased consolidation, thereby limiting the number of acquisition candidates, escalating competition for attractive acquisition candidates, and/or increasing the overall costs of making acquisitions. Difficulties we may face in identifying or completing acquisitions may result in the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities, an increase in general operating expenses and significant charges related to integration costs, the occurrence of which could impede our revenue growth and profitability. In addition, we may not be able to obtain the financing necessary to complete acquisitions on terms favorable to us, or at all.\nWe may not be able to effectively integrate acquired businesses, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAcquisitions involve significant risks and uncertainties including, among others:\n\u2022\nthe assumption of liabilities and exposure to unforeseen liabilities of acquired companies;\n\u2022\nuncertainties as to the future performance of the acquired business;\n\u2022\nthe potential loss of key employees, customers or suppliers;\n\u2022\ndifficulties integrating acquired personnel and other corporate cultures into our business;\n\u2022\ndifficulties associated with information technology conversions;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in achieving targeted synergies; and\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management attention and resources from existing operations.\nWe may not be able to fully integrate the operations of JanPak and CleanSource, or any future acquired businesses with our own in an efficient and cost-effective manner or without significant disruption to our existing or acquired operations. Failure to integrate future acquired businesses effectively or to manage other consequences of our acquisitions, including increased indebtedness, could impede our ability to remain competitive and, ultimately, impact our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAn impairment of the carrying value of our goodwill or other intangible assets could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nAs of December 26, 2014, goodwill and other intangible assets represented approximately 56.9% of our total assets. The recoverability of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining if an indication of impairment exists. Factors may include, among others: a significant decline in our expected future cash flows; a significant adverse change in legal factors or the business climate; unanticipated competition; slower growth rates; or a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which the asset is being used. Any adverse change in these factors could have a material impact on the recoverability of these assets, which could negatively affect our financial condition and consolidated results of operations. See \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates - Goodwill, Intangibles and Other Long-Lived Assets\" for additional information related to the recoverability and impairment tests performed for these assets.\nWe cannot accurately predict the amount and timing of any impairment of assets or whether indefinite-lived intangibles will convert to definite-lived and corresponding amortization will be recorded. Should the value of goodwill or other intangible assets become impaired, or should we determine that certain intangible assets have definite lives, there could be an adverse effect on our financial condition and consolidated results of operations.\nWe may be subject to disruptions in our information technology systems including data and security breaches which could adversely impact operations.\nOur operations are dependent upon information technology that encompasses all of our major business functions. We rely upon these information technology systems to manage and replenish inventory, to fill and ship customer orders on a timely basis and to coordinate our sales and marketing activities across all of our brands. As part of our business, we collect, process and retain sensitive and confidential personal information about our customers, employees and suppliers. Furthermore, information technology plays a key role in our ability to achieve operating and financial efficiencies. Despite the implementation of network security measures that we have in place, our facilities and systems, and those of our third-party service providers with which we do business, may be vulnerable to security breaches, cyber-attacks, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors or other similar events. Any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of our confidential information or confidential information of our customers, employees, or suppliers, whether by us or by our third-party service providers with which we do business, could disrupt our business, expose us to risks of litigation and liability, result in a loss of assets or cause reputational damage. Any substantial disruption of our information technology for a prolonged time period could impair our ability to process orders, maintain proper levels of inventories, manage customer billings and collections, prepare and present accurate financial statements and related information, identify business opportunities and otherwise manage our business.\nInformation technology systems maintenance, enhancements, and compliance with regulatory requirements require substantial ongoing capital expenditures and could involve execution and operational risk to our business.\nInformation technology plays an increasingly important role in the distribution industry and is central in maintaining a competitive advantage. We have long recognized the importance of technology and have consistently invested in information technology to differentiate ourselves from our competitors and make us even more relevant to customers. The pace of this investment is expected to continue, and most likely increase, as we continue to improve our business through the deployment of new technology. Future technology enhancements - which may be required to achieve our long-term growth plans - are continually planned in many areas of our business. These enhancements may require substantial capital expenditures, and the implementation of any new technology carries execution and operational risk. Failure to secure and implement sufficient new technologies to deliver business process solutions may adversely impact our business and operations. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that the implementation of such initiatives will provide the intended benefits. In addition, the regulatory environment related to information security, data collection and privacy is increasingly rigorous, with new and constantly changing requirements applicable to our business, and compliance with those requirements could result in additional costs.\nOur ability to both maintain our existing customer base and to attract new customers is dependent in many cases upon our ability to deliver products and fulfill orders in a timely and cost-effective manner.\nTo ensure timely delivery of our products to our customers, we frequently rely on third parties, including carriers such as UPS and other national shippers as well as various local and regional trucking contractors and logistics consulting and management companies. Outsourcing this activity generates a number of risks, including decreased control over the delivery process and service timeliness and quality. Any sustained inability of these third parties to deliver our products to our customers could result in the loss of customers or require us to seek alternative delivery sources, which may result in significantly increased expenses and delivery delays. Furthermore, the need to identify and qualify substitute service providers or increase our internal capacity could result in unforeseen operational problems and additional costs. If demand for our products increases, we may be unable to secure sufficient additional capacity from our current suppliers, or others, on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. An inability to effectively manage our third-party service providers, fulfill customer orders and meet customer demands could result in lost sales and damage to our reputation, which could negatively affect our business and results of operations.\nThe loss of any of our significant customers could significantly reduce our revenues and profitability.\nOur 10 largest customers generated approximately $133.1 million, or approximately 8%, of our sales in the fiscal year ended December 26, 2014, and our largest customer accounted for approximately 1% of our sales during the same period. There can be no assurance that we will maintain or improve our relationships with these customers or that we will continue to supply these customers at historic levels. The loss of one or more of our significant customers or deterioration in our relations with any of them could significantly reduce our revenues and profitability.\nOur allowance for doubtful accounts may prove inadequate to cover actual losses.\nA significant portion of our net sales are facilitated through the extension of credit; therefore, our business depends on the creditworthiness of our customers. We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses on trade receivables resulting from the inability to collect outstanding amounts due from our customers. We continuously review the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts with consideration given to economic conditions and trends, the financial condition of our customers, and credit quality indicators, including the age of accounts receivable as well as historical collection and charge-off experience.\nThe current economic environment is dynamic and the creditworthiness of our customers can change significantly within very short periods of time. Our allowance may not keep pace with changes in the creditworthiness of our customers which is generally dependent upon economic and industry trends specific to the markets in which they operate. We cannot be certain that our allowance for doubtful accounts will be adequate over time to cover losses in our accounts receivable because of adverse changes in the economy or events adversely affecting specific customers, industries or markets.\nAny significant or unforeseen changes to our credit exposure, including a material decrease in the credit quality of our customers, could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe departure of existing senior management and key personnel or a decline in our ability to attract and retain skilled employees or qualified sales professionals could hinder our growth and materially affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to attract, hire, train and retain qualified managerial, operational, sales, marketing and support personnel. We face significant competition for these types of personnel in our industry. As a result, we may be unsuccessful in attracting and retaining the personnel we require to conduct and expand our operations successfully which could adversely affect our revenues and profitability. In addition, key personnel may leave us and compete against us. Our success also depends, to a significant extent, on the continued service of our senior management team. The loss of any member of our senior management team or other qualified employees could impair our ability to execute our business plan and growth strategy, cause us to lose customers and reduce our net sales, or lead to employee morale problems and/or the loss of other key employees. In any such event, our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur ability to compete effectively may be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, particularly trademarks and service marks.\nWe believe that our trademarks (including both trademarks and service marks) are important to the success of our business and our competitive position within the markets we serve. For instance, we market and sell products primarily through thirteen distinct and targeted brands/service marks: Wilmar\u00ae, Barnett\u00ae, AmSan\u00ae, JanPak\u00ae, CleanSource\u00ae, Sexauer\u00ae, Hardware Express\u00ae, Copperfield\u00ae, Maintenance USA\u00ae, U.S. Lock\u00ae, LeranSM, Trayco\u00ae, and AF Lighting\u00ae. We also sell various private label products under registered tradenames, including Premier\u2122, Pro Plus\u2122, and Renown\u2122.\nAccordingly, we devote resources to the establishment and protection of our trademarks and our exclusive brand products. However, the actions we have taken may prove inadequate to prevent imitation and/or infringement of our trademarks by others or to prevent others from claiming violations of their trademarks and proprietary rights by us. Our rights in our trademarks may be subject to change based on the rights of others whose actual or constructive use of such trademark (or a confusingly similar mark) commenced before the date our rights vested. Future actions by third parties may diminish the strength of our trademarks or limit our ability to use our trademarks, thereby undermining our competitive position.\nThe interests of our equity sponsors may differ from the interests of the Company or other company stakeholders.\nAs a result of the Merger, the Company\u2019s common stock became privately-held and substantially owned by certain private equity investment funds affiliated with GS Capital Partners VI Fund, L.P. and its related entities (\u201cGS Capital Partners\u201d) and P2 Capital Partners, LLC and its related entities (\u201cP2 Capital Partners\u201d). These private equity investment funds have the power, subject to certain exceptions, to direct the Company\u2019s affairs and policies and to elect a majority of the members of our Board of Directors. Through such representation on our Board of Directors, they are able to substantially influence the appointment of management and entry into extraordinary transactions, including mergers and sales of assets.\nThe interests of GS Capital Partners and P2 Capital Partners could conflict with the interests of the note holders or our creditors. For example, if we encounter financial difficulties or are unable to pay our debts as they mature, the interests of GS Capital Partners and P2 Capital Partners as equity holders might conflict with the interests of the note holders or creditors. GS Capital Partners and P2 Capital Partners may also have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures, financings or other transactions that, in their judgment, could enhance their equity investments, despite the potential for increased risks for the note holders or creditors. In addition, GS Capital Partners and P2 Capital Partners or their respective affiliates may in the future own businesses that directly or indirectly compete with us, our suppliers, or our customers.\nOur costs of doing business could increase as a result of changes in U.S. federal, state or local regulations.\nOur operations are principally affected by various statutes, regulations and laws in which we operate. We are subject to various laws applicable to businesses generally, including laws affecting products, the environment, health and safety, transportation, labor and employment practices, competition, immigration and other matters Changes in U.S. federal, state or local regulations governing the sale of some of our products could increase our costs of doing business. In addition, changes to U.S. federal, state and local tax regulations could increase our costs of doing business. We cannot provide assurance that we will not incur material costs or liabilities in connection with regulatory requirements.\nWe cannot predict whether future developments in law and regulations concerning us will affect our business, financial condition and results of operations in a negative manner. Similarly, we cannot assess whether we will be successful in meeting future demands of regulatory agencies in a manner which will not materially adversely affected our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Our Indebtedness\nOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations.\nAs of December 26, 2014, our total indebtedness was $796.9 million comprised of $365.0 million in outstanding HoldCo Notes, a $346.6 million Term Loan Facility, and $74.0 million outstanding on the ABL Facility. Other components of our total indebtedness included outstanding letters of credit in the amount of $11.3 million and capital lease obligations of $0.01 million. As of the same date, cash and cash equivalents were $6.1 million and there was $209.7 million in availability under the ABL Facility. Our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to our financial health including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nincreased vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions or a downturn in our business;\n\u2022\nlimited flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022\na competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are not as highly leveraged;\n\u2022\ndifficulties related to satisfying our obligations with respect to the HoldCo Notes, Term Loan Facility, ABL Facility, and our other indebtedness;\n\u2022\nreduced availability of cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes as a result of debt service requirements;\n\u2022\nlimited capacity to borrow additional funds, if needed; and\n\u2022\nan event of default if we fail to satisfy our obligations under the HoldCo Notes, Term Loan Facility, the ABL Facility, or our other indebtedness or if we fail to comply with the financial other restrictive covenants contained in the indenture and agreements governing the ABL Facility, Term Loan Facility and other debt; such event of default could result in all of our debt becoming immediately due and payable and could permit certain of our lenders to foreclose on assets securing our indebtedness.\nIf our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, including timely payment of principal and interest on our outstanding indebtedness, we may be required to reduce or delay capital expenditures, sell assets, seek to obtain additional capital or refinance all or part of our existing debt. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully complete any of these transactions or do so on favorable terms. Any of the above listed factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe agreements and indenture governing our debt include restrictive and financial covenants that may limit our operational flexibility.\nThe indenture governing the HoldCo Notes and the agreements governing the ABL Facility and Term Loan Facility, each contain covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability to take specific actions, even if we believe them to be in our best interest. These include restrictive covenants that limit, among other things, our ability to:\n\u2022\nincur certain liens;\n\u2022\nincur any additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge, or sell assets or enter into other business combination transactions;\n\u2022\nmake certain restricted payments, such as paying dividends, making distributions on, redeeming or repurchasing stock;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments, including acquisitions and capital expenditures;\n\u2022\namend the terms of certain subordinated indebtedness;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022\nenter into sale leaseback transactions;\n\u2022\nuse proceeds from sale of assets;\n\u2022\nlimit the payment of dividends by our subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nprepay, redeem or repurchase certain indebtedness; and\n\u2022\nchange our business.\nIn addition, the ABL Facility requires the Company and its restricted subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, to maintain a fixed charge coverage ratio (defined as the ratio of EBITDA, as defined in the credit agreement, to the sum of cash interest, principal payments on indebtedness and accrued income taxes, dividends or distributions and repurchases, redemptions or retirement of the equity interest of the Company) of at least 1.00:1.00 when the excess availability is less than or equal to the greater of: (i) 10% of the total commitments under the ABL Facility; and (ii) $25.0 million.\nSee \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation - Liquidity and Capital Resources - ABL Credit Facility\u201d \u201c- Term Loan Facility\u201d and \u201c- HoldCo Notes\u201d and Note 10. Debt for additional information related to the Company\u2019s outstanding debt.\nDespite our current indebtedness levels, we may incur substantial additional indebtedness.\nWe may incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future to finance acquisitions, investments, or for other purposes, subject to the restrictions contained in the documents governing our current outstanding indebtedness. For example, based on year-end inventory and trade accounts receivable balances as of December 26, 2014 we were able to incur up to a maximum of $209.7 million in additional indebtedness under the ABL Facility. Although the ABL Facility, the indenture and our other debt agreements contain some limitations on our ability to incur indebtedness, we may still incur substantial indebtedness to refinance existing indebtedness or for other purposes. If new debt is added to our current indebtedness levels, the substantial leverage risks that we now face could intensify.\nMajor disruptions and volatility in the capital and credit markets may impact our ability to secure sufficient financing on favorable terms.\nThe availability of financing is dependent on numerous factors, some of which are beyond our control, including, but not limited to, general economic conditions and the volatility of the capital and credit markets. We may not able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms, or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, including the ability to make acquisitions and execute our growth strategies. Furthermore, if our operating results, cash flow or capital resources prove inadequate, or if interest rates increase significantly, we could face substantial liquidity problems, which may impede our ability to seek additional capital in a timely manner or refinance our existing debt on favorable terms.
