{"cik": "48465", "company": "HORMEL FOODS CORP /DE/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-12-04", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nBUSINESS AND OPERATIONAL RISKS\nDeterioration of economic conditions could harm the Company\u2019s business. The Company's business may be adversely affected by changes in national or global economic conditions, including inflation, interest rates, tax rates, availability of capital, energy availability and costs (including fuel surcharges), political developments, civil unrest, and the effects of governmental initiatives to manage economic conditions. Decreases in consumer spending rates and shifts in consumer product preferences could also negatively impact the Company.\nVolatility in financial markets and the deterioration of national and global economic conditions could impact the Company\u2019s operations as follows:\n\u25aaThe financial stability of our customers and suppliers may be compromised, which could result in additional bad debts for the Company or non-performance by suppliers; and\n\u25aaThe value of our investments in debt and equity securities may decline, including most significantly the Company\u2019s trading securities held as part of a rabbi trust to fund supplemental executive retirement plans and deferred income plans, and the Company\u2019s assets held in pension plans.\nThe Company utilizes hedging programs to manage its exposure to various commodity market risks, which qualify for hedge accounting for financial reporting purposes. Volatile fluctuations in market conditions could cause these instruments to become ineffective, which could require any gains or losses associated with these instruments to be reported in the Company\u2019s earnings each period. These instruments may limit the Company\u2019s ability to benefit from market gains if commodity prices become more favorable than those secured under the Company\u2019s hedging programs.\nThe Company's goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value and are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. Impairment testing requires judgement around estimates and assumptions and is impacted by factors such as revenue growth rates, operating margins, tax rates, royalty rates, and discount rates. An unfavorable change in these factors may lead to the impairment of goodwill and/or intangible assets.\nAdditionally, if a highly pathogenic human disease outbreak developed in the United States, it may negatively impact the national economy, demand for Company products, and/or the Company\u2019s workforce availability, and the Company\u2019s financial results could suffer. The Company has developed contingency plans to address infectious disease scenarios and the potential impact on its operations, and will continue to update these plans as necessary. There can be no assurance given, however, these plans will be effective in eliminating the negative effects of any such diseases on the Company\u2019s operating results.\nThe uncertain and rapidly changing COVID-19 pandemic could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. The ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic has had, and will likely continue to have, negative impacts across many of the Company's business units and facilities. The Company's operations and business have been impacted directly and indirectly by various government actions taken to stop or slow the spread of COVID-19, including travel restrictions, border shutdowns, stay-at-home and shelter-in-place orders, shutdowns of non-essential businesses, and emergency declarations.\nThe near- and long-term impacts of COVID-19 are unknown and impossible to predict with any level of certainty. At this time, the following potential risk factors arising from COVID-19 pandemic have had and/or may continue to cause one or more of the following impacts on the Company's operations:\n\u2022One or more of the Company's manufacturing facilities may be shut down or have their operations significantly impacted due to employee illnesses, increased absenteeism, and/or actions by government agencies. Capital projects may be delayed as additional capacity is no longer currently needed. The Company's co-manufacturers and material suppliers may face similar impacts.\n\u2022Regulatory restrictions and measures taken at the Company's facilities to prevent or slow down the spread of COVID-19 may impact facilities\u2019 efficiency.\n\u2022Operating costs may increase as measures are put in place to prevent or slow down the spread of COVID-19, such as facility improvements, employee testing, short-term disability policies, and manufacturing employee bonus payments.\n\u2022Any new or additional measures required by national, state or local governments to combat COVID-19 may similarly add additional operational costs.\n\u2022Ongoing closure or reduced operations at foodservice establishments may impact results for the Company's foodservice business. Bankruptcy filings and/or delinquent payments from foodservice industry or other customers may negatively impact cash flow.\n\u2022A national and/or global economic downturn may impact consumer purchase behavior, such as reduced foodservice volume, lower volume in premium brands, and potential loss of business to private label.\n\u2022It may become more difficult and/or expensive to obtain debt or equity financing necessary to sustain the Company's operations, make capital expenditures, and/or finance future acquisitions.\n\u2022The Company may face litigation by stockholders, employees, suppliers, customers, consumers, and others relating to COVID-19 and its effects.\n\u2022The Company relies on its dedicated employees, many of whom have a long tenure with the Company. Operations may be negatively impacted if members of the Company's leadership team, or other key employees, become ill with COVID-19 or otherwise terminate their employment as a result of COVID-19. Further, the Company may face challenges hiring, onboarding, and training new employees, including leadership, which may impact results. The Company also may face operational challenges if government quarantine orders restrict movement of employees.\n\u2022It is possible that the COVID-19 pandemic could negatively affect the Company's labor availability, relations, or labor costs.\n\u2022In accordance with recommendations to reduce large gatherings and increase social distancing, many of the Company's office-based employees are working remotely, which may bring additional information technology and data security risks.\n\u2022Supply chain disruptions of various types arising from COVID-19 may impact the Company's ability to make products, the cost for such products, and the ability to deliver products to customers. Closure or reduced operations of material suppliers could result in shortages of key raw materials, as well as impact prices for those materials. The volatility in the market for raw material and supplies could impact the Company's profitability.\n\u2022National, state, and local government orders closing or limiting operation of borders and ports, or imposing quarantine, could impact the Company's ability to obtain raw materials and to deliver finished goods to customers.\n\u2022COVID-19 has wide-reaching impacts to society and the business making all decisions, interactions, and transactions significantly more complex.\n\u2022The Company is committed to being transparent through communications to inform shareholders, employees, customers, consumers, and others about the enhanced safety protocols implemented. The Company must keep pace with a rapidly changing media environment. If the Company's public relations efforts are not effective or if consumers perceive them to be irresponsible, the Company's competitive position, reputation, and market share may suffer.\nThe Company has already seen several of these risks materialize. The extent of the impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations is dependent on the length and severity of the pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic is an unprecedented situation and the Company's understanding of its impacts is changing and evolving. The additional risk factors identified here are based upon information known at this time. The COVID-19 pandemic may adversely impact the Company's operations in one or more ways not identified to date.\nThe Company\u2019s operations are subject to the general risks associated with acquisitions and divestitures. The Company has made several acquisitions and divestitures in recent years, most recently the acquisition of Sadler's Smokehouse, that align with the Company\u2019s strategic initiative of delivering long-term value to shareholders. The Company regularly reviews strategic opportunities to grow through acquisitions and to divest non-strategic assets. Potential risks associated with these transactions include the inability to consummate a transaction on favorable terms, the diversion of management's attention from other business concerns, the potential loss of key employees and customers of current or acquired companies, the inability to integrate or divest operations successfully, the possible assumption of unknown liabilities, potential disputes with buyers or sellers, potential impairment charges if purchase assumptions are not achieved, and the inherent risks in entering markets or lines of business in which the Company has limited or no prior experience. Any or all of these risks could impact the Company\u2019s financial results and business reputation. In addition, acquisitions outside the United States may present unique challenges and increase the Company's exposure to the risks associated with foreign operations.\nThe Company is subject to disruption of operations at co-manufacturers, suppliers, or other third-party service providers. Disruption of operations at co-manufacturers or other suppliers may impact the Company\u2019s product or raw material supply, which could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s financial results. Additionally, actions taken to mitigate the impact of any potential disruption, including increasing inventory in anticipation of a potential production or supply interruption, may adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial results.\nThe Company regularly engages third-party service providers to support various business functions such as benefit plan administration, payroll processing, information technology, and cloud computing services. A disruption in services from these partners could have an adverse effect on the Company's business.\nThe Company is subject to the loss of a material contract. The Company is a party to several supply, distribution, contract packaging and other material contracts. The loss of a material contract could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial results. The Company currently sources approximately 30% of its pork raw materials from Wholestone Farms, LLC (Wholestone) under a supply agreement expiring in December 2021. The Company is in negotiations with Wholestone as well as evaluating alternative procurement options.\nThe Company may be adversely impacted if the Company is unable to protect information technology systems against, or effectively respond to, cyber-attacks or security breaches. Information technology systems are an important part of the Company\u2019s business operations. In addition, the Company increasingly relies upon third-party service providers for a variety of business functions, including cloud-based services. Attempted cyber-attack and other cyber incidents are occurring more frequently and are being made by groups and individuals with a wide range of motives and expertise.\nIn addition, the Company is in the midst of a multi-year transformation project (Project Orion) to achieve better analytics, customer service, and process efficiencies through the use of Oracle Cloud Solutions. This project is expected to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of certain financial and business transaction processes and the underlying systems environment. The initial phase to implement the human resource and payroll process was deployed during the first quarter of fiscal 2020.\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company implemented the finance phase of the project. Additional integrations are expected to take place over the next few years. Such an implementation is a major undertaking from a financial, management, and personnel perspective. The implementation of the enterprise resource planning system may prove to be more difficult, costly, or time consuming than expected, and there can be no assurance that this system will be beneficial to the extent anticipated.\nIn an attempt to mitigate these risks, the Company has implemented and continues to evaluate security initiatives and business continuity plans.\nDeterioration of labor relations or increases in labor costs could harm the Company\u2019s Business. As of October 25, 2020, approximately 3,470 of the Company's employees were represented by labor unions, principally the United Food and Commercial Workers Union. A significant increase in labor costs or a deterioration of labor relations at any of the Company\u2019s facilities or co-manufacturing facilities resulting in work slowdowns or stoppages could harm the Company\u2019s financial results.\nINDUSTRY RISKS\nThe Company\u2019s operations are subject to the general risks of the food industry. The food products manufacturing industry is subject to the risks posed by:\n\u25aafood spoilage;\n\u25aafood contamination caused by disease-producing organisms or pathogens, such as Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella, and pathogenic E coli.;\n\u25aafood allergens;\n\u25aanutritional and health-related concerns;\n\u25aafederal, state, and local food processing controls;\n\u25aaconsumer product liability claims;\n\u25aaproduct tampering; and\n\u25aathe possible unavailability and/or expense of liability insurance.\nThe pathogens that may cause food contamination are found generally in livestock and in the environment and thus may be present in our products. These pathogens can also be introduced to our products as a result of improper handling by customers or consumers. We do not have control over handling procedures once our products have been shipped for distribution. If one or more of these risks were to materialize, the Company\u2019s brand and business reputation could be negatively impacted. In addition, revenues could decrease, costs of doing business could increase, and the Company\u2019s operating results could be adversely affected.\nOutbreaks of disease among livestock and poultry flocks could harm the Company\u2019s revenues and operating margins.\nThe Company is subject to risks associated with the outbreak of disease in pork and beef livestock, and poultry flocks, including African swine fever (ASF), Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE), pneumo-virus, Porcine Circovirus 2 (PCV2), Porcine Reproduction & Respiratory Syndrome (PRRS), Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD), Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea Virus (PEDv), and Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI). The outbreak of such diseases could adversely affect the Company\u2019s supply of raw materials, increase the cost of production, reduce utilization of the Company\u2019s harvest facilities, and reduce operating margins. Additionally, the outbreak of disease may hinder the Company\u2019s ability to market and sell products both domestically and internationally.\nIn recent years, the outbreak of ASF has impacted hog herds in China, Asia, and Europe. If an outbreak of ASF were to occur in the United States, the Company's supply of hogs and pork could be materially impacted.\nThe Company has developed business continuity plans for various disease scenarios and will continue to update these plans as necessary. There can be no assurance given, however, that these plans will be effective in eliminating the negative effects of any such diseases on the Company\u2019s operating results.\nFluctuations in commodity prices and availability of pork, poultry, beef, feed grains, avocados, peanuts, and energy could harm the Company\u2019s earnings. The Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition are largely dependent upon the cost and supply of pork, poultry, beef, feed grains, avocados, and peanuts as well as energy costs and the selling prices for many of our products, which are determined by constantly changing market forces of supply and demand.\nThe live hog industry has evolved to large, vertically-integrated operations using long-term supply agreements. Typically, this results in fewer hogs being available on the cash spot market. Consequently, the Company uses long-term supply contracts priced on market-based formulas or the cost of production to ensure a stable supply of raw materials while minimizing extreme fluctuations in costs over the long-term. This may result, in the short-term, in higher live hog costs compared to the cash spot market, depending on the relationship of the cash spot market to contract prices. Market-based pricing on certain product lines, and lead time required to implement pricing adjustments, may prevent all or part of these cost increases from being recovered, and these higher costs could adversely affect our short-term financial results.\nJennie-O Turkey Store raises turkeys and contracts with turkey growers to meet its raw material requirements for whole birds and processed turkey products. Results in these operations are affected by the cost and supply of feed grains, which fluctuates due to climate conditions, production forecasts, and supply and demand conditions at local, regional, national, and worldwide\nmarkets. The Company attempts to manage some of its short-term exposure to fluctuations in feed prices by forward buying, using futures contracts, and pursuing pricing advances. However, these strategies may not be adequate to overcome sustained increases in market prices due to alternate uses for feed grains or other changes in these market conditions.\nThe supplies of natural and organic proteins may impact the Company\u2019s ability to ensure a continuing supply of these products. To mitigate this risk, the Company partners with multiple long-term suppliers.\nInternational trade barriers and other restrictions could result in decreased foreign demand and increased domestic supply of proteins, thereby potentially lowering prices. The Company occasionally utilizes in-country production to limit this exposure.\nMarket demand for the Company\u2019s products may fluctuate. The Company faces competition from producers of alternative meats and protein sources, including pork, beef, turkey, chicken, fish, nut butters, whey, and plant-based proteins. The factors on which the Company competes include:\n\u25aaprice;\n\u25aaproduct quality and attributes;\n\u25aabrand identification;\n\u25aabreadth of product line; and\n\u25aacustomer service.\nDemand for the Company\u2019s products is also affected by competitors\u2019 promotional spending, the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s advertising and marketing programs, and consumer perceptions. Failure to identify and react to changes in food trends such as sustainability of product sources and animal welfare could lead to, among other things, reduced demand for the Company\u2019s brands and products. The Company may be unable to compete successfully on any or all of these factors in the future.\nLEGAL AND REGULATORY RISKS\nThe Company\u2019s operations are subject to the general risks of litigation. The Company is involved on an ongoing basis in litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. Trends in litigation may include class actions involving employees, consumers, competitors, suppliers, shareholders, or injured persons, and claims relating to product liability, contract disputes, antitrust regulations, intellectual property, advertising, labeling, wage and hour laws, employment practices or environmental matters. Neither litigation trends nor the outcomes of litigation can be predicted with certainty and adverse litigation trends and outcomes could negatively affect the Company\u2019s financial results.\nGovernment regulation, present and future, exposes the Company to potential sanctions and compliance costs that could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business. The Company\u2019s operations are subject to extensive regulation by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, federal and state taxing authorities and other federal, state, and local authorities which oversee workforce immigration, taxation, animal welfare, food safety, and the processing, packaging, storage, distribution, advertising, and labeling of the Company\u2019s products. The Company\u2019s manufacturing facilities and products are subject to ongoing inspection by federal, state and local authorities. Claims or enforcement proceedings could be brought against the Company in the future. The availability of government inspectors due to a government furlough could also cause disruption to the Company\u2019s manufacturing facilities. Additionally, the Company is subject to new or modified laws, regulations, and accounting standards. The Company\u2019s failure or inability to comply with such requirements could subject the Company to civil remedies, including fines, injunctions, recalls or seizures, as well as potential criminal sanctions.\nThe Company is subject to stringent environmental regulation and potentially subject to environmental litigation, proceedings, and investigations. The Company\u2019s past and present business operations and ownership and operation of real property are subject to stringent federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations pertaining to the discharge of materials into the environment and the handling and disposition of wastes (including solid and hazardous wastes) or otherwise relating to protection of the environment. Compliance with these laws and regulations, as well as any modifications, is material to the Company\u2019s business. Some of the Company\u2019s facilities have been in operation for many years and, over time, the Company and other prior operators of these facilities may have generated and disposed of wastes that now may be considered hazardous. Future discovery of contamination of property underlying or in the vicinity of the Company\u2019s present or former properties or manufacturing facilities and/or waste disposal sites could require the Company to incur additional expenses related to additional investigation, assessment or other requirements. The occurrence of any of these events, the implementation of new laws and regulations or stricter interpretation of existing laws or regulations could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial results.\nThe Company\u2019s foreign operations pose additional risks to the Company\u2019s business. The Company operates its business and markets its products internationally. The Company\u2019s foreign operations are subject to the risks described above, as well as risks related to fluctuations in currency values, foreign currency exchange controls, compliance with foreign laws, compliance with applicable U.S. laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and other economic or political uncertainties. International sales are subject to risks related to general economic conditions, imposition of tariffs, quotas, trade barriers and other restrictions, enforcement of remedies in foreign jurisdictions and compliance with applicable foreign laws, and other economic and political uncertainties. All of these risks could result in increased costs or decreased revenues, which could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial results.", "PERMNO": 32870, "SIC": 2011, "TIC": "HRL"}
