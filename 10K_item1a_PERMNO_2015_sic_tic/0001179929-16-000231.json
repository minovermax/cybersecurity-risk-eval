The ACA enacted comprehensive changes to the U.S. health care system, elements of which have been phased in at various stages over the past several years. The most significant changes effected by the ACA were implemented as of January 1, 2014. There are a multitude of risks associated with the scope of change in the health care system represented by the ACA, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nRisks associated with the duals expansion. Nine million low-income elderly and disabled people are covered under both the Medicare and Medicaid programs. These beneficiaries are more likely than other Medicare beneficiaries to be frail, live with multiple chronic conditions, and have functional and cognitive impairments. Medicare is their primary source of health insurance coverage, as it is for the nearly 50 million elderly and under-65 disabled beneficiaries in 2012. Medicaid supplements Medicare by paying for services not covered by Medicare, such as dental care and long-term care services and support, and by helping to cover Medicare\u2019s premiums and cost-sharing requirements. Together, these two programs help to shield very low-income Medicare beneficiaries from potentially unaffordable out-of-pocket medical and long-term care costs. To coordinate care for those who qualify to receive both Medicare and Medicaid services (the \"dual eligible\"), and to deliver services to these individuals in a more financially efficient manner, some states have undertaken demonstration programs to integrate Medicare and Medicaid services for dual eligible individuals. The health plans participating in such demonstrations are referred to as Medicare-Medicaid Plans (MMPs). We operate MMPs in six states. Our MMPs in California, Illinois, and Ohio offered coverage beginning in 2014; our MMPs in South Carolina and Texas offered coverage beginning in the first quarter of 2015; and our MMP in Michigan offered coverage beginning in the second quarter of 2015. At December 31, 2015, our membership included approximately 51,000 integrated MMP members.\nThere are numerous risks associated with the initial implementation of a new program, with a health plan\u2019s expansion into a new service area, and with the provision of medical services to a new population which has not previously been\nin managed care. One such risk is the development of actuarially sound rates. Because there is limited historical information on which to develop rates, certain assumptions are required to be made which may subsequently prove to have been inaccurate. Rates of utilization could be significantly higher than had been projected, or the assumptions of policymakers about the amount of savings that could be achieved through the use of utilization management in managed care could be flawed. Moreover, because of our lack of actuarial experience for that program, region, or population, our reserve levels may be set at an inadequate level. For instance, these problems arose at our Texas health plan in 2012, leading to extremely elevated medical care costs and substantial losses at the health plan. All of these risks are present in the implementation of the duals demonstration programs. In the event these risks materialize at one or more of our health plans, the negative results of the health plan or plans could adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations.\n\u2022\nRisks associated with Medicaid expansion. In the states that have elected to participate, the ACA provides for the expansion of the Medicaid program to offer eligibility to nearly all low-income people under age 65 with incomes at or below 138% of the federal poverty line. Medicaid expansion membership phased in beginning January 1, 2014. Since that date, our health plans in California, Illinois, Michigan, New Mexico, Ohio, and Washington have participated in Medicaid expansion. At December 31, 2015, our membership included approximately 557,000 Medicaid expansion members, or 16% of total membership. The new enrollees in our health plans represent a population that is different from the population of Medicaid enrollees we have historically managed. All of the risk factors described above with regard to the duals demonstration programs apply equally to Medicaid expansion.\n\u2022\nRisks associated with health insurance marketplaces. The ACA authorized the creation of Marketplace insurance exchanges, allowing individuals and small groups to purchase health insurance that is federally subsidized, effective January 1, 2014. We participate in the Marketplace in all of the states in which we operate, except Illinois, Puerto Rico and South Carolina. At December 31, 2015, our membership included approximately 205,000 Marketplace members, with approximately 133,000, or 65%, of those members in Florida. All of the risk factors described above with regard to the duals demonstration programs apply equally to our participation in the insurance marketplaces.\n\u2022\nRisk associated with implementing regulations. There are many parts of the ACA that require further guidance in the form of regulations. Due to the breadth and complexity of the ACA, the lack of implementing regulations and interpretive guidance, and the phased nature of the ACA\u2019s implementation, the overall impact of the ACA on our business and on the health industry in general over the coming years is difficult to predict and not yet fully known, and implementing regulations could contain provisions that have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations.\nChanges to health care regulatory laws under the ACA, including the recently proposed Medicaid managed care rule, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations.\nThe health care regulatory law landscape is constantly changing. For example, on May 26, 2015, CMS posted a new proposed rule to the Federal Register regarding Medicaid programs and CHIP, Medicaid managed care, CHIP delivered in managed care, Medicaid and CHIP comprehensive quality strategies, and revisions related to third party liability that, if implemented, would, among other things, impose a medical loss ratio of 85% for Medicaid and CHIP programs, establish a Medicaid managed care quality rating system like the five-star system for Medicare Advantage plans, and expand health plans\u2019 responsibilities in program integrity efforts. It is difficult to predict what final rules may be adopted and implemented by CMS, and if the final rule would result in any material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations.\nOur profitability depends on our ability to accurately predict and effectively manage our medical care costs.\nOur profitability depends to a significant degree on our ability to accurately predict and effectively manage our medical care costs. Historically, our medical care cost ratio, meaning our medical care costs as a percentage of our premium revenue net of premium tax, has fluctuated substantially, and has also varied across our state health plans. Because the premium payments we receive are generally fixed in advance and we operate with a narrow profit margin, relatively small changes in our medical care cost ratio can create significant changes in our overall financial results. For example, if our overall medical care ratio, continuing operations of 89.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2015 had been one percentage point higher, or 90.1%, our net income from continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2015 would have been approximately $1.08 per diluted share rather than our actual income from continuing operations of $2.58 per diluted share, a decrease of approximately 58%.\nFactors that may affect our medical care costs include the level of utilization of health care services, unexpected patterns in the annual flu season, increases in hospital costs, an increased incidence or acuity of high dollar claims related to catastrophic illnesses or medical conditions for which we do not have adequate reinsurance coverage, increased maternity costs, payment rates that are not actuarially sound, changes in state eligibility certification methodologies, relatively low levels of hospital and specialty provider competition in certain geographic areas, increases in the cost of pharmaceutical products and services, changes in health care regulations and practices, epidemics, new medical technologies, and other various external factors. Many of these factors are beyond our control and could reduce our ability to accurately predict and effectively manage the costs of\nproviding health care services. The inability to forecast and manage our medical care costs or to establish and maintain a satisfactory medical care cost ratio, either with respect to a particular state health plan or across the consolidated entity, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations.\nState and federal budget deficits may result in Medicaid, CHIP, or Medicare funding cuts which could reduce our revenues and profit margins.\nNearly all of our premium revenues come from the joint federal and state funding of the Medicaid and CHIP programs. Due to high unemployment levels, Medicaid enrollment levels and Medicaid costs remain elevated at the same time that state budgets are suffering from significant fiscal strain. Because Medicaid is one of the largest expenditures in every state budget, and one of the fastest-growing, it is a prime target for cost-containment efforts. The states in which we operate our health plans regularly face significant budgetary pressures. These budgetary pressures may result in unexpected Medicaid, CHIP, or Medicare rate cuts which could reduce our revenues and profit margins. Moreover, some federal deficit reduction or entitlement reform proposals would fundamentally change the structure and financing of the Medicaid program. A number of these proposals include both tax increases and spending reductions in discretionary programs and mandatory programs, such as Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid.\nWe are unable to determine how any future congressional spending cuts will affect Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement. There likely will continue to be legislative and regulatory proposals at the federal and state levels directed at containing or lowering the cost of health care that, if adopted, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations.\nThe Commonwealth of Puerto Rico may become unable to pay the premiums of our Puerto Rico health plan.\nThe government of Puerto Rico currently faces major fiscal and liquidity challenges. The government recently warned that it may lack sufficient resources to fund all necessary governmental programs and services as well as meet debt service obligations for fiscal year 2016. The extreme financial difficulties faced by the Commonwealth may make it impossible for ASES, the Puerto Rico Medicaid agency, to pay our Puerto Rico health plan under the terms of the parties\u2019 Medicaid contract. As of December 31, 2015, our Puerto Rico health plan served approximately 348,000 members, and had recognized premium revenue of approximately $192 million in the fourth quarter of 2015, or approximately $64 million per month. It is the practice of the Commonwealth to pay us for eligible members only after those members have been assigned to us, and our plan has sent electronic confirmation of the receipt of eligibility. Particularly in the early stages of our contract with Puerto Rico, the plan's confirmation of eligibility of certain members was not accepted by the Commonwealth as a result of various technical issues. The plan has continued to pay for medical services for all members in question, but the Commonwealth is withholding payment of approximately $12 million of premium revenue related to those members. We believe we have a valid claim to all of the premiums withheld and we are in discussions with the Commonwealth regarding this matter. A default by ASES on its payment obligations under our Medicaid contract, or a determination by ASES to terminate our contract based on insufficient funds available, could result in our having paid, or in our having to pay, provider claims in amounts for which we are not paid reimbursement, and could make it unfeasible for the Puerto Rico health plan to continue to operate. A default by ASES or termination of our Puerto Rico Medicaid contract could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations.\nA failure to accurately estimate incurred but not reported medical care costs may negatively impact our results of operations.\nBecause of the time lag between when medical services are actually rendered by our providers and when we receive, process, and pay a claim for those medical services, we must continually estimate our medical claims liability at particular points in time, and establish claims reserves related to such estimates. Our estimated reserves for such \"incurred but not paid\" (IBNP) medical care costs are based on numerous assumptions. We estimate our medical claims liabilities using actuarial methods based on historical data adjusted for claims receipt and payment experience (and variations in that experience), changes in membership, provider billing practices, health care service utilization trends, cost trends, product mix, seasonality, prior authorization of medical services, benefit changes, known outbreaks of disease or increased incidence of illness such as influenza, provider contract changes, changes to Medicaid fee schedules, and the incidence of high dollar or catastrophic claims. Our ability to accurately estimate claims for our newer lines of business or populations, such as with respect to duals, Medicaid expansion members, or aged, blind or disabled Medicaid members, is impacted by the more limited experience we have had with those populations.\nThe IBNP estimation methods we use and the resulting reserves that we establish are reviewed and updated, and adjustments, if deemed necessary, are reflected in the current period. Given the numerous uncertainties inherent in such estimates, our actual claims liabilities for a particular quarter or other period could differ significantly from the amounts estimated and reserved for that quarter or period. Our actual claims liabilities have varied and will continue to vary from our estimates, particularly in times of significant changes in utilization, medical cost trends, and populations and markets served.\nIf our actual liability for claims payments is higher than estimated, our earnings in any particular quarter or annual period could be negatively affected. Our estimates of IBNP may be inadequate in the future, which would negatively affect our results of operations for the relevant time period. Furthermore, if we are unable to accurately estimate IBNP, our ability to take timely corrective actions may be limited, further exacerbating the extent of the negative impact on our results.\nLarge-scale medical emergencies in one or more states in which we operate our health plans could significantly increase utilization rates and medical costs.\nLarge-scale medical emergencies can take many forms and be associated with widespread illness or medical conditions. For example, natural disasters, such as a major earthquake in Los Angeles or Cascadia, or a major hurricane in Florida or South Carolina, could have a significant impact on the health of a large number of our covered members. Other conditions that could impact our members include an influenza epidemic, or newly emergent mosquito-borne illnesses, such as the Zika virus, the West Nile virus, or the Chikungunya virus, conditions for which vaccines may not exist, are not effective, or have not been widely administered. In addition, federal and state law enforcement officials have issued warnings about potential terrorist activity involving biological or other weapons of mass destruction. All of these conditions, and others, could have a significant impact on the health of the population of wide-spread areas. We seek to set our IBNP reserves appropriately to account for anticipatable spikes in utilization, such as for the flu season. However, if one of our health plan states were to experience a large-scale natural disaster, a viral epidemic or pandemic, a significant terrorism attack, or some other large-scale event affecting the health of a large number of our members, our covered medical expenses in that state would rise, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition, and results of operations, or, in the event of extreme circumstances, could threaten our viability.\nIf the responsive bids of our health plans for new or renewed Medicaid contracts are not successful, or if our government contracts are terminated or are not renewed, our premium revenues could be materially reduced and our operating results could be negatively impacted.\nOur government contracts may be subject to periodic competitive bidding. In such process, our health plans may face competition as other plans, many with greater financial resources and greater name recognition, attempt to enter our markets through the competitive bidding process. In the event the responsive bid of one or more of our health plans is not successful, we will lose our Medicaid contract in the applicable state or states, and our premium revenues could be materially reduced as a result. If we are unable to renew, successfully re-bid, or compete for any of our government contracts, or if any of our contracts are terminated or renewed on less favorable terms, our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations could be adversely affected. Alternatively, even if our responsive bids are successful, the bids may be based upon assumptions regarding enrollment, utilization, medical costs, or other factors which could result in the Medicaid contract being less profitable than we had expected.\nIf we sustain a cyber-attack or suffer privacy or data security breaches that disrupt our operations or result in the dissemination of sensitive personal or confidential information, we could suffer increased costs, exposure to significant liability, reputational harm, loss of business, and other serious negative consequences.\nAs part of our normal operations, we routinely collect, process, store, and transmit large amounts of data in our operations, including sensitive personal information as well as proprietary or confidential information relating to our business or third parties. We may be subject to breaches of the information technology systems we use. Experienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our layered security controls and misappropriate or compromise sensitive personal information or proprietary or confidential information, vandalize our systems, create system disruptions, or cause shutdowns. They also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that attack our systems or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities. Our systems are also susceptible to human error. Because the techniques used to circumvent security systems can be highly sophisticated and change frequently, often are not recognized until launched against a target, and may originate from less regulated and remote areas around the world, we may be unable to proactively address these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures. Our facilities may also be vulnerable to security incidents or security attacks, acts of vandalism or theft, misplaced or lost data, human errors, acts of malicious insiders, or other similar events that could negatively affect our systems and our and our members\u2019 data. The cost to eliminate or address the foregoing security threats and vulnerabilities before or after a cyber-incident could be significant. While we currently expend significant resources and have implemented solutions, processes and procedures to protect against cyber-attacks and security breaches, we may need to expend significant additional resources in the future to continue to protect against potential security breaches or to address problems caused by such attacks or any breach of our systems. Our remediation efforts may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays, or cessation of service, and loss of members, vendors, and state contracts. In addition, breaches of our security measures and the unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information or proprietary information or confidential information about our members could expose our members to the risk of financial or medical identity theft, or expose us or other third parties to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, result in litigation and potential liability for us, damage our reputation, or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations.\nThe exorbitant cost of specialty drugs and new generic drugs could have a material adverse effect on the level of our medical costs and our results of operations.\nIn 2014, Gilead\u2019s pricing of the hepatitis C drug, Sovaldi, at $84,000 per standard course of therapy received major attention as a health care policy and public policy matter. Because of the relatively high incidence of hepatitis C throughout the nation, particularly in the Medicaid population, the pricing of specialty drugs for the treatment of hepatitis C represents a major public health and public financing problem. In the case of Sovaldi, because of its advent on the health care market in early 2014, the cost of the drug was generally not factored into our 2014 capitation rates, thus threatening to undermine the actuarial soundness of those rates. New high priced specialty drugs and generic drugs are expected to enter the health care market in 2015. In addition, evolving regulations and state and federal mandates regarding coverage may impact the ability of our health plans to continue to receive existing price discounts on pharmaceutical products for our members. Other factors affecting our pharmaceutical costs include, but are not limited to, geographic variation in utilization of new and existing pharmaceuticals, and changes in discounts. We will seek to work with state Medicaid agencies to ensure that we receive appropriate and actuarially sound reimbursement for all new drug therapies and pharmaceuticals. In the event we are required to bear the high costs of new specialty drugs or generic drugs without an appropriate rate adjustment or other reimbursement mechanism, or if new regulations or mandates affect our pharmaceutical costs, our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nStates may not adequately compensate us for the value of drug rebates that were previously earned by us but that are now collectible by the states.\nThe ACA includes certain provisions that change the way drug rebates are handled for drug claims filled by Medicaid managed care plans. Retroactive to March 23, 2010, state Medicaid programs are now required to collect federal rebates on all Medicaid-covered outpatient drugs dispensed or administered to Medicaid managed care enrollees (excluding certain drugs that are already discounted), and pharmaceutical manufacturers are required to pay specified rebates directly to the state Medicaid programs for those claims. This has impacted the level of rebates received by managed care plans from the manufacturers for Medicaid managed care enrollees. Many manufacturers have renegotiated or discontinued their rebate contracts with Medicaid managed care plans and pharmacy benefits managers to offset these new rebates paid directly to state Medicaid programs. As a result, the drug rebate amounts paid to managed care plans like ours continue to remain at levels that are much lower than prior to ACA implementation. There are provisions in the ACA that require rates paid to Medicaid managed care plans to be actuarially sound in regard to drug rebates. Although we will be pursuing rate increases with state agencies to make us whole for the rebate amounts lost, there can be no assurances that the premium increases we may receive, if any, will be adequate to offset the amount of the lost rebates. If such premium increases prove to be inadequate, our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe derive our premium revenues from a relatively small number of state health plans.\nWe currently derive our premium revenues from 11 state health plans, and commenced operations with our Puerto Rico health plan in April 2015. If we are unable to continue to operate in any of those jurisdictions, or if our current operations in any portion of the jurisdictions we are in are significantly curtailed, our revenues could decrease materially. Our reliance on operations in a limited number of jurisdictions could cause our revenue and profitability to change suddenly and unexpectedly, depending on an abrupt loss of membership, significant rate reductions, a loss of a material contract, legislative actions, changes in Medicaid eligibility methodologies, catastrophic claims, an epidemic, an unexpected increase in utilization, general economic conditions, and similar factors in those jurisdictions. Our inability to continue to operate in any of the jurisdictions in which we currently operate, or a significant change in the nature of our existing operations, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations.\nA large portion of our premium revenues are subject to risks related to medical cost expenditure floors and corridors, administrative cost and profit ceilings, premium stabilization programs, and cost-plus and performance-based reimbursement programs.\nA substantial portion of our premium revenue is subject to contract provisions pertaining to medical cost floors and corridors, administrative cost and profit ceilings, cost-plus reimbursement, premium stabilization programs, and profit-sharing arrangements. Many of these contract provisions are complex, or are poorly or ambiguously drafted, and thus are potentially subject to differing interpretations by ourselves and the relevant government agency with whom we contract. In the event the applicable government agency disagrees with our interpretation or implementation of a particular contract provisions at issue, we could be required to adjust the amount of our obligations under these provisions and/or make a payment or payments to the government agency. Any interpretation of these contract provisions at variance with our interpretation and implementation of the provision, or that is inconsistent with our revenue recognition accounting treatment, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations.\nIn addition, many of our contracts also contain provisions pertaining to at-risk premiums that require us to meet certain quality performance measures to earn all of our contract revenues. In the event we are unsuccessful in achieving the stated performance\nmeasure, we will be unable to recognize the revenue associated with that measure. Any failure of our health plans to satisfy one of these performance measure provisions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows or results of operations.\nFailure to attain profitability in any new start-up operations, including in our new Puerto Rico health plan, could negatively affect our results of operations.\nStart-up costs associated with a new business can be substantial. For example, to obtain a certificate of authority to operate as a health maintenance organization in most jurisdictions, we must first establish a provider network, have infrastructure and required systems in place, and demonstrate our ability to obtain a state contract and process claims. Often, we are also required to contribute significant capital to fund mandated net worth requirements, performance bonds or escrows, or contingency guaranties. If we are unsuccessful in obtaining the certificate of authority, winning the bid to provide services, or attracting members in sufficient numbers to cover our costs, any new business of ours would fail. We also could be required by the state or commonwealth to continue to provide services for some period of time without sufficient revenue to cover our ongoing costs or to recover our significant start-up costs.\nEven if we are successful in establishing a profitable health plan in a new state or commonwealth, increasing membership, revenues, and medical costs will trigger increased mandated net worth requirements which could substantially exceed the net income generated by the health plan. Rapid growth in an existing state or commonwealth will also result in increased net worth requirements. In such circumstances, we may not be able to fund on a timely basis or at all the increased net worth requirements with our available cash resources. The expenses associated with starting up a health plan in a new state or commonwealth, or expanding a health plan in an existing state or commonwealth could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations.\nReceipt of inadequate or significantly delayed premiums could negatively affect our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations.\nOur premium revenues consist of fixed monthly payments per member, and supplemental payments for other services such as maternity deliveries. These premiums are fixed by contract, and we are obligated during the contract periods to provide health care services as established by the state governments. We use a large portion of our revenues to pay the costs of health care services delivered to our members. If premiums do not increase when expenses related to medical services rise, our medical margins will be compressed, and our earnings will be negatively affected. A state could increase hospital or other provider rates without making a commensurate increase in the rates paid to us, or could lower our rates without making a commensurate reduction in the rates paid to hospitals or other providers. In addition, if the actuarial assumptions made by a state in implementing a rate or benefit change are incorrect or are at variance with the particular utilization patterns of the members of one of our health plans, our medical margins could be reduced. Any of these rate adjustments in one or more of the states in which we operate could have a material adverse effect our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations.\nFurthermore, a state undergoing a budget crisis may significantly delay the premiums paid to one of our health plans. Any significant delay in the monthly payment of premiums to any of our health plans could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations.\nCentene\u2019s acquisition of Health Net could affect the Los Angeles county subcontract of our California health plan.\nOur California health plan operates in Los Angeles County, California as a subcontractor to Health Net, which holds a direct Medi-Cal contract with the state of California. Health Net has entered into a merger agreement with Centene Corporation, with the merger expected to close in early 2016. We currently do not expect there to be any material change to our Los Angeles county subcontract in connection with Centene\u2019s acquisition of Health Net. However, if Centene seeks to modify our subcontract or otherwise refuses to perform under the contract, our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations may be adversely affected.\nReductions in Medicare payments could reduce our earnings potential for our Medicare Advantage plans and our duals demonstration programs.\nThe Sequestration Transparency Act of 2012 included a 2% reduction of payments from CMS to our Medicare Advantage plans beginning April 1, 2013. Medicare Advantage plans will continue to be affected until Congress lifts the sequestration mandated under the Sequestration Transparency Act of 2012. Such reduction in our Medicare payments may have an adverse effect on our earnings potential for our Medicare Advantage plans and our duals demonstration programs. In addition, reductions to provider reimbursement rates associated with sequestration may adversely impact our relations with the impacted providers.\nDifficulties in executing our acquisition strategy could adversely affect our business.\nThe acquisitions of other health plans and the assignment and assumption of Medicaid contract rights of other health plans have accounted for a significant amount of our growth over the last several years. Although we cannot predict with certainty our rate of growth as the result of acquisitions, we believe that additional acquisitions of all sizes will be important to our future growth\nstrategy. Many of the other potential purchasers of these assets-particularly operators of large commercial health plans-have significantly greater financial resources than we do. Also, many of the sellers may insist on selling assets that we do not want, such as commercial lines of business, or may insist on transferring their liabilities to us as part of the sale of their companies or assets. Even if we identify suitable targets, we may be unable to complete acquisitions on terms favorable to us, or at all, or obtain the necessary financing for these acquisitions. For these reasons, among others, we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to complete favorable acquisitions, especially in light of the volatility in the capital markets over the past several years, or that we will not complete acquisitions that turn out to be unfavorable. Further, to the extent we complete an acquisition, we may be unable to realize the anticipated benefits from such acquisition because of operational factors or difficulty in integrating the acquisition with our existing business. This may include problems involving the integration of:\n\u2022\nadditional employees who are not familiar with our operations or our corporate culture,\n\u2022\nnew provider networks which may operate on terms different from our existing networks,\n\u2022\nadditional members who may decide to transfer to other health care providers or health plans,\n\u2022\ndisparate information, claims processing, and record-keeping systems,\n\u2022\ninternal controls and accounting policies, including those which require the exercise of judgment and complex estimation processes, such as estimates of claims incurred but not reported, accounting for goodwill, intangible assets, stock-based compensation, and income tax matters, and\n\u2022\nnew regulatory schemes, relationships, practices, and compliance requirements.\nAlso, we are generally required to obtain regulatory approval from one or more state agencies when making acquisitions of health plans. In the case of an acquisition of a business located in a state in which we do not already operate, we would be required to obtain the necessary licenses to operate in that state. In addition, although we may already operate in a state in which we acquire a new business, we would be required to obtain regulatory approval if, as a result of the acquisition, we will operate in an area of that state in which we did not operate previously. Furthermore, we may be required to renegotiate contracts with the network providers of the acquired business. We may be unable to obtain the necessary governmental approvals, comply with these regulatory requirements or renegotiate the necessary provider contracts in a timely manner, if at all.\nIn addition, we may be unable to successfully identify, consummate, and integrate future acquisitions, including integrating the acquired businesses on our information technology platform, or to implement our operations strategy in order to operate acquired businesses profitably. Furthermore, we may incur significant transaction expenses in connection with a potential acquisition which may or may not be consummated. These expenses could impact our selling, general and administrative expense ratio.\nFor all of the above reasons, we may not be able to consummate our proposed acquisitions as announced from time to time to sustain our pattern of growth or to realize benefits from completed acquisitions.\nWe face periodic routine and non-routine reviews, audits, and investigations by government agencies, and these reviews and audits could have adverse findings, which could negatively impact our business.\nWe are subject to various routine and non-routine governmental reviews, audits, and investigations. Violation of the laws, regulations, or contract provisions governing our operations, or changes in interpretations of those laws and regulations, could result in the imposition of civil or criminal penalties, the cancellation of our contracts to provide managed care services, the suspension or revocation of our licenses, the exclusion from participation in government sponsored health programs, or the revision and recoupment of past payments made based on audit findings. If we are unable to correct any noted deficiencies, or become subject to material fines or other sanctions, we could suffer a substantial reduction in profitability, and could also lose one or more of our government contracts and as a result lose significant numbers of members and amounts of revenue. In addition, government receivables are subject to government audit and negotiation, and government contracts are vulnerable to disagreements with the government. The final amounts we ultimately receive under government contracts may be different from the amounts we initially recognize in our financial statements.\nWe rely on the accuracy of eligibility lists provided by state governments. Inaccuracies in those lists would negatively affect our results of operations.\nPremium payments to our health plan segment are based upon eligibility lists produced by state governments. From time to time, states require us to reimburse them for premiums paid to us based on an eligibility list that a state later discovers contains individuals who are not in fact eligible for a government sponsored program or are eligible for a different premium category or a different program. Alternatively, a state could fail to pay us for members for whom we are entitled to payment. Our results of operations would be adversely affected as a result of such reimbursement to the state if we make or have made related payments to providers and are unable to recoup such payments from the providers.\nWe are subject to extensive fraud and abuse laws that may give rise to lawsuits and claims against us, the outcome of which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations.\nBecause we receive payments from federal and state governmental agencies, we are subject to various laws commonly referred to as \"fraud and abuse\" laws, including federal and state anti-kickback statutes, prohibited referrals, and the federal False Claims Act, which permit agencies and enforcement authorities to institute a suit against us for violations and, in some cases, to seek treble damages, criminal and civil fines, penalties, and assessments. Violations of these laws can also result in exclusion, debarment, temporary or permanent suspension from participation in government health care programs, or the institution of corporate integrity agreements. Liability under such federal and state statutes and regulations may arise if we know, or it is found that we should have known, that information we provide to form the basis for a claim for government payment is false or fraudulent, and some courts have permitted False Claims Act suits to proceed if the claimant was out of compliance with program requirements. Fraud, waste and abuse prohibitions encompass a wide range of operating activities, including kickbacks or other inducements for referral of members or for the coverage of products (such as prescription drugs) by a plan, billing for unnecessary medical services by a provider, improper marketing, and the violation of patient privacy rights. Companies involved in public health care programs such as Medicaid and Medicare are required to maintain compliance programs to detect and deter fraud, waste and abuse, and are often the subject of fraud, waste and abuse investigations and audits. The regulations and contractual requirements applicable to participants in these public-sector programs are complex and subject to change. The federal government has taken the position that claims presented in violation of the federal anti-kickback statute may be considered a violation of the federal False Claims Act. In addition, under the federal civil monetary penalty statute, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), Office of Inspector General has the authority to impose civil penalties against any person who, among other things, knowingly presents, or causes to be presented, certain false or otherwise improper claims. Qui tam actions under federal and state law can be brought by any individual on behalf of the government. Qui tam actions have increased significantly in recent years, causing greater numbers of health care companies to have to defend a false claim action, pay fines, or be excluded from the Medicare, Medicaid, or other state or federal health care programs as a result of an investigation arising out of such action. We are currently defending one qui tam action where the federal government has declined to intervene: United States of America, ex rel., Anita Silingo v. Mobile Medical Examination Services, Inc., et al. Other qui tam actions may have been filed against us of which we are presently unaware, or other qui tam actions may be filed against us in the future. In the event we are subject to liability under these or other qui tam actions, our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur business could be adversely impacted by adoption of the new ICD-10 standardized coding set for diagnoses.\nHHS released rules pursuant to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, or HIPAA, which mandate the use of standard formats in electronic health care transactions. HHS also published rules requiring the use of standardized code sets and unique identifiers for providers. These new standardized code sets, known as ICD-10, require substantial investments from health care organizations, including us. We implemented ICD-10 effective as of October 1, 2015. Use of the ICD-10 code sets require significant administrative changes and may result in errors and otherwise negatively impact our service levels. In addition, we may experience complications related to supporting customers that are not fully compliant with the revised requirements as of the applicable compliance date. Furthermore, if physicians fail to provide appropriate codes for services provided as a result of the new coding set, we may not be reimbursed, or adequately reimbursed, for such services.\nIf we are unable to deliver quality care, maintain good relations with the physicians, hospitals, and other providers with whom we contract, or if we are unable to enter into cost-effective contracts with such providers, our profitability could be adversely affected.\nWe contract with physicians, hospitals, and other providers as a means to ensure access to health care services for our members, to manage health care costs and utilization, and to better monitor the quality of care being delivered. We compete with other health plans to contract with these providers. We believe providers select plans in which they participate based on criteria including reimbursement rates, timeliness and accuracy of claims payment, potential to deliver new patient volume and/or retain existing patients, effectiveness of resolution of calls and complaints, and other factors. We cannot be sure that we will be able to successfully attract and retain providers to maintain a competitive network in the geographic areas we serve. In addition, in any particular market, providers could refuse to contract with us, demand higher payments, or take other actions which could result in higher health care costs, disruption to provider access for current members, a decline in our growth rate, or difficulty in meeting regulatory or accreditation requirements.\nThe Medicaid program generally pays doctors and hospitals at levels well below those of Medicare and private insurance. Large numbers of doctors, therefore, do not accept Medicaid patients. In the face of fiscal pressures, some states may reduce rates paid to providers, which may further discourage participation in the Medicaid program.\nIn some markets, certain providers, particularly hospitals, physician/hospital organizations, and some specialists, may have significant market positions or even monopolies. If these providers refuse to contract with us or utilize their market position to negotiate favorable contracts which are disadvantageous to us, our profitability in those areas could be adversely affected.\nSome providers that render services to our members are not contracted with our health plans. In those cases, there is no pre-established understanding between the provider and our health plan about the amount of compensation that is due to the provider. In some states, the amount of compensation is defined by law or regulation, but in most instances it is either not defined or it is established by a standard that is not clearly translatable into dollar terms. In such instances, providers may believe they are underpaid for their services and may either litigate or arbitrate their dispute with our health plan. The uncertainty of the amount to pay and the possibility of subsequent adjustment of the payment could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nThe insolvency of a delegated provider could obligate us to pay its referral claims, which could have an adverse effect on our business, cash flows, or results of operations.\nCircumstances may arise where providers to whom we have delegated risk, due to insolvency or other circumstances, are unable to pay claims they have incurred with third parties in connection with referral services provided to our members. The inability of delegated providers to pay referral claims presents us with both immediate financial risk and potential disruption to member care. Depending on states\u2019 laws, we may be held liable for such unpaid referral claims even though the delegated provider has contractually assumed such risk. Additionally, competitive pressures may force us to pay such claims even when we have no legal obligation to do so or we have already paid claims to a delegated provider and payments cannot be recouped when the delegated provider becomes insolvent. To reduce the risk that delegated providers are unable to pay referral claims, we monitor the operational and financial performance of such providers. We also maintain contingency plans that include transferring members to other providers in response to potential network instability. In certain instances, we have required providers to place funds on deposit with us as protection against their potential insolvency. These funds are frequently in the form of segregated funds received from the provider and held by us or placed in a third-party financial institution. These funds may be used to pay claims that are the financial responsibility of the provider in the event the provider is unable to meet these obligations. However, there can be no assurances that these precautionary steps will fully protect us against the insolvency of a delegated provider. Liabilities incurred or losses suffered as a result of provider insolvency could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations.\nRegulatory actions and negative publicity regarding Medicaid managed care and Medicare Advantage may lead to programmatic changes and intensified regulatory scrutiny and regulatory burdens.\nSeveral of our health care competitors have recently been involved in governmental investigations and regulatory actions which have resulted in significant volatility in the price of their stock. In addition, there has been negative publicity and proposed programmatic changes regarding Medicare Advantage private fee-for-service plans, a part of the Medicare Advantage program in which we do not participate. These actions and the resulting negative publicity could become associated with or imputed to us, regardless of our actual regulatory compliance or programmatic participation. Such an association, as well as any perception of a recurring pattern of abuse among the health plan participants in government programs and the diminished reputation of the managed care sector as a whole, could result in public distrust, political pressure for changes in the programs in which we do not participate, intensified scrutiny by regulators, additional regulatory requirements and burdens, increased stock volatility due to speculative trading, and heightened barriers to new managed care markets and contracts, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations.\nIf a state fails to renew its federal waiver application for mandated Medicaid enrollment into managed care or such application is denied, our membership in that state will likely decrease.\nStates may only mandate Medicaid enrollment into managed care under federal waivers or demonstrations. Waivers and programs under demonstrations are approved for two- to five-year periods and can be renewed on an ongoing basis if the state applies and the waiver request is approved or renewed by CMS. We have no control over this renewal process. If a state does not renew its mandated program or the federal government denies the state\u2019s application for renewal, our business would suffer as a result of a likely decrease in membership.\nIf state regulators do not approve payments of dividends and distributions by our subsidiaries, it may negatively affect our business strategy.\nWe are a corporate parent holding company and hold most of our assets at, and conduct most of our operations through, direct subsidiaries. As a holding company, our results of operations depend on the results of operations of our subsidiaries. Moreover, we are dependent on dividends or other intercompany transfers of funds from our subsidiaries to meet our debt service and other obligations. The ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or make other payments or advances to us will depend on their operating results and will be subject to applicable laws and restrictions contained in agreements governing the debt of such subsidiaries. In addition, our health plan subsidiaries are subject to laws and regulations that limit the amount of dividends and distributions that they can pay to us without prior approval of, or notification to, state regulators. In California, our health plan may dividend, without notice to or approval of the California Department of Managed Health Care, amounts by which its tangible net equity exceeds 130% of the tangible net equity requirement. Our other health plans must give thirty days\u2019 advance notice and the opportunity to disapprove \"extraordinary\" dividends to the respective state departments of insurance for amounts\nover the lesser of (a) ten percent of surplus or net worth at the prior year end or (b) the net income for the prior year. The discretion of the state regulators, if any, in approving or disapproving a dividend is not clearly defined. Health plans that declare non-extraordinary dividends must usually provide notice to the regulators ten or fifteen days in advance of the intended distribution date of the non-extraordinary dividend. We received $125 million in dividends from our regulated health plan subsidiaries during 2015. We did not receive any dividends from our regulated health plan subsidiaries during 2014, because significant growth across all of our health plans necessitated that the plans retain their cash to meet increasing net worth requirements. The aggregate additional amounts our health plan subsidiaries could have paid us at December 31, 2015 and 2014, without approval of the regulatory authorities, were approximately $121 million and $96 million, respectively. If the regulators were to deny or significantly restrict our subsidiaries\u2019 requests to pay dividends to us, the funds available to our company as a whole would be limited, which could harm our ability to implement our business strategy. For example, we could be hindered in our ability to make debt service payments under the senior notes or the revolving credit facility.\nUnforeseen changes in pharmaceutical regulations or market conditions may impact our revenues and adversely affect our results of operations.\nA significant category of our health care costs relate to pharmaceutical products and services. Evolving regulations and state and federal mandates regarding coverage may impact the ability of our health plans to continue to receive existing price discounts on pharmaceutical products for our members. Other factors affecting our pharmaceutical costs include, but are not limited to, the price of pharmaceuticals, geographic variation in utilization of new and existing pharmaceuticals, and changes in discounts. The unpredictable nature of these factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations.\nOur use and disclosure of individually identifiable information, including health information, is subject to federal and state privacy and security regulations, and our failure to comply with those regulations or to adequately secure the information we hold could result in significant liability or reputational harm.\nState and federal laws and regulations, including HIPAA and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, govern the collection, dissemination, use, privacy, confidentiality, security, availability, and integrity of individually identifiable information, including protected health information, or PHI. HIPAA establishes basic national privacy and security standards for protection of PHI by covered entities, including health plans such as ours. HIPAA requires covered entities like us to develop and maintain policies and procedures for PHI that is used or disclosed, and to adopt administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect PHI. HIPAA also implemented the use of standard transaction code sets and standard identifiers that covered entities must use when submitting or receiving certain electronic health care transactions, including activities associated with the billing and collection of health care claims.\nMandatory penalties for HIPAA violations range from $100 to $50,000 per violation, and up to $1.5 million per violation of the same standard per calendar year. A single breach incident can result in violations of multiple standards, resulting in possible penalties potentially in excess of $1.5 million. If a person knowingly or intentionally obtains or discloses PHI in violation of HIPAA requirements, criminal penalties may also be imposed. HIPAA authorizes state attorneys general to file suit under HIPAA on behalf of state residents. Courts can award damages, costs, and attorneys\u2019 fees related to violations of HIPAA in such cases. While HIPAA does not create a private right of action allowing individuals to sue us in civil court for HIPAA violations, its standards have been used as the basis for a duty of care in state civil suits such as those for negligence or recklessness in the misuse or breach of PHI.\nIn addition, HIPAA mandates that the Secretary of HHS conduct periodic compliance audits of HIPAA covered entities for compliance with the HIPAA Privacy and Security Standards. Investigations of violations that indicate willful neglect, for which penalties are now mandatory, are statutorily required. It also tasks HHS with establishing a methodology whereby harmed individuals who were the victims of breaches of unsecured PHI may receive a percentage of the civil monetary penalty fine paid by the violator.\nHIPAA further requires covered entities to notify affected individuals \u201cwithout unreasonable delay and in no case later than 60 calendar days after discovery of the breach\u201d if their unsecured PHI is subject to an unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. If a breach affects 500 patients or more, it must be reported to HHS and local media without unreasonable delay, and HHS will post the name of the breaching entity on its public website. If a breach affects fewer than 500 individuals, the covered entity must log it and notify HHS at least annually. We have experienced HIPAA breaches in the past, including breaches affecting over 500 individuals.\nNew health information standards, whether implemented pursuant to HIPAA, congressional action, or otherwise, could have a significant effect on the manner in which we must handle health care related data, and the cost of complying with standards could be significant. If we do not comply with existing or new laws and regulations related to PHI, we could be subject to criminal or civil sanctions. Any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss, or other unauthorized disclosure or use of confidential member information, whether by us or a third party, such as our vendors, could subject us to civil and criminal\npenalties, divert management\u2019s time and energy, and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations.\nRisks Related to the Operation of Our Molina Medicaid Solutions Segment\nWe may be unable to retain or renew the state government contracts of the Molina Medicaid Solutions segment on terms consistent with our expectations or at all.\nMolina Medicaid Solutions currently provides business processing and information technology development and administrative services to Medicaid agencies in Idaho, Louisiana, Maine, New Jersey, West Virginia, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and drug rebate administration services in Florida. If we are unable to continue to operate in any of those six jurisdiction, or if our current operations in any of those jurisdictions are significantly curtailed, the revenues and cash flows of Molina Medicaid Solutions could decrease materially, and as a result our profitability would be negatively impacted.\nIf the responsive bids to RFPs of Molina Medicaid Solutions are not successful, our revenues could be materially reduced and our operating results could be negatively impacted.\nThe government contracts of Molina Medicaid Solutions may be subject to periodic competitive bidding. In such process, Molina Medicaid Solutions may face competition as other service providers, some with much greater financial resources and greater name recognition, attempt to enter our markets through the competitive bidding process. Molina Medicaid Solutions also anticipates bidding in other states which have issued RFPs for procurement of a new MMIS. In the event our responsive bids in other states are not successful, we will be unable to grow in a manner consistent with our projections. Even if our responsive bids are successful, the bids may be based upon assumptions or other factors which could result in the contract being less profitable than we had expected or had been the case prior to competitive re-bidding.\nBecause of the complexity and duration of the services and systems required to be delivered under the government contracts of Molina Medicaid Solutions, there are substantial risks associated with full performance under the contracts.\nThe state contracts of Molina Medicaid Solutions typically require significant investment in the early stages that is expected to be recovered through billings over the life of the contracts. These contracts involve the construction of new computer systems and communications networks and the development and deployment of complex technologies. Substantial performance risk exists under each contract. Some or all elements of service delivery under these contracts are dependent upon successful completion of the design, development, construction, and implementation phases. Any increased or unexpected costs or delays in connection with the performance of these contracts, including delays caused by factors outside our control, could make these contracts less profitable or unprofitable, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations.\nIf we fail to comply with our state government contracts or government contracting regulations, our business could be adversely affected.\nMolina Medicaid Solutions\u2019 contracts with state government customers may include unique and specialized performance requirements. In particular, contracts with state government customers are subject to various procurement regulations, contract provisions, and other requirements relating to their formation, administration, and performance. Any failure to comply with the specific provisions in our customer contracts or any violation of government contracting regulations could result in the imposition of various civil and criminal penalties, which may include termination of the contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, imposition of fines, and suspension from future government contracting. Further, any negative publicity related to our state government contracts or any proceedings surrounding them may damage our business by affecting our ability to compete for new contracts. The termination of a state government contract, our suspension from government work, or any negative impact on our ability to compete for new contracts, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations.\nSystem security risks and systems integration issues that disrupt our internal operations or information technology services provided to customers could adversely affect our financial results and damage our reputation.\nComputer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate our confidential information or that of third parties, create system disruptions, or cause shutdowns. Computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that attack our products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our products. In addition, sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture, including \"bugs\" and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system. The costs to us to eliminate or alleviate security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant, and the efforts to address these problems could result in interruptions, delays, cessation of service, and loss of existing or potential government customers.\nMolina Medicaid Solutions routinely processes, stores, and transmits large amounts of data for our clients, including sensitive and personally identifiable information. Breaches of our security measures could expose us, our customers, or the individuals affected to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, resulting in litigation and potential liability for us and damage to our brand and reputation. Accordingly, we could lose existing or potential government customers for outsourcing services or other information technology solutions or incur significant expenses in connection with our customers\u2019 system failures or any actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products. In addition, the cost and operational consequences of implementing further data protection measures could be significant.\nPortions of our information technology infrastructure also may experience interruptions, delays, or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with systems integration or migration work that takes place from time to time. We may not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data, which could cause business disruptions and be more expensive, time consuming, disruptive, and resource-intensive. Such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and interrupt other processes. Delayed sales, lower margins, or lost government customers resulting from these disruptions could adversely affect our financial results, reputation, and stock price.\nIn the course of providing services to customers, Molina Medicaid Solutions may inadvertently infringe on the intellectual property rights of others and be exposed to claims for damages.\nThe solutions we provide to our state government customers may inadvertently infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties resulting in claims for damages against us. The expense and time of defending against these claims may have a material and adverse impact on our profitability. Additionally, the publicity we may receive as a result of infringing intellectual property rights may damage our reputation and adversely impact our ability to develop new MMIS business or retain existing MMIS business.\nInherent in the government contracting process are various risks which may materially and adversely affect our business and profitability.\nWe are subject to the risks inherent in the government contracting process. These risks include government audits of billable contract costs and reimbursable expenses and compliance with government reporting requirements. In the event we are found to be out of compliance with government contracting requirements, our reputation may be adversely impacted and our relationship with the government agencies we work with may be damaged, resulting in a material and adverse effect on our profitability.\nOur performance of contracts, including those with respect to which we have partnered with third parties, may be adversely affected if we or the third parties fail to deliver on commitments.\nIn some instances, our contracts require that we partner with other parties, including software and hardware vendors, to provide the complex solutions required by our state government customers. Our ability to deliver the solutions and provide the services required by our customers is dependent on our and our partners\u2019 ability to meet our customers\u2019 delivery schedules. If we or our partners fail to deliver services or products on time, our ability to complete the contract may be adversely affected, which may have a material and adverse impact on our revenues and profitability.\nOur business may be adversely affected by the transition from traditional fee-for-service to Medicaid managed care.\nIn order to save on costs, a number of state Medicaid programs are expected to pursue the transition from a fee-for-service focus of their Medicaid programs to a Medicaid managed care focus. A shift in Medicaid payment models from fee-for-service to managed care will require a concomitant shift in the focus of MMIS. In connection with such a transition, MMIS must also make a transition from a system built around claims adjudication to one that performs analytics and can be used to manage Medicaid population health outcomes. In the event Molina Medicaid Solutions is unable to accomplish this transition, our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations may be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to our General Business Operations\nIneffective management of our growth may negatively affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWe expect to continue to grow our membership and to expand into other markets through acquisitions and other opportunities. Continued rapid growth could place a significant strain on our management and on our other resources. Our ability to manage our growth may depend on our ability to strengthen our management team and attract, train, and retain skilled employees, and our ability to implement and improve operational, financial, and management information systems on a timely basis. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, due to the initial substantial costs related to acquisitions, rapid growth could adversely affect our short-term profitability and liquidity.\nAny changes to the laws and regulations governing our business, or the interpretation and enforcement of those laws or regulations, could cause us to modify our operations and could negatively impact our operating results.\nOur business is extensively regulated by the federal government and the states in which we operate. The laws and regulations governing our operations are generally intended to benefit and protect health plan members and providers rather than managed care organizations. The government agencies administering these laws and regulations have broad latitude in interpreting and applying them. These laws and regulations, along with the terms of our government contracts, regulate how we do business, what services we offer, and how we interact with members and the public. For instance, some states mandate minimum medical expense levels as a percentage of premium revenues. These laws and regulations, and their interpretations, are subject to frequent change. The interpretation of certain contract provisions by our governmental regulators may also change. Changes in existing laws or regulations, or their interpretations, or the enactment of new laws or regulations, could reduce our profitability by imposing additional capital requirements, increasing our liability, increasing our administrative and other costs, increasing mandated benefits, forcing us to restructure our relationships with providers, or requiring us to implement additional or different programs and systems. Changes in the interpretation of our contracts could also reduce our profitability if we have detrimentally relied on a prior interpretation.\nOur business depends on our information and medical management systems, and our inability to effectively integrate, manage, and keep secure our information and medical management systems could disrupt our operations.\nOur business is dependent on effective and secure information systems that assist us in, among other things, processing provider claims, monitoring utilization and other cost factors, supporting our medical management techniques, and providing data to our regulators. Our providers also depend upon our information systems for membership verifications, claims status, and other information. If we experience a reduction in the performance, reliability, or availability of our information and medical management systems, our operations, ability to pay claims, and ability to produce timely and accurate reports could be adversely affected. In addition, if the licensor or vendor of any software which is integral to our operations were to become insolvent or otherwise fail to support the software sufficiently, our operations could be negatively affected.\nOur information systems and applications require continual maintenance, upgrading, and enhancement to meet our operational needs. Moreover, our acquisition activity requires transitions to or from, and the integration of, various information systems. If we experience difficulties with the transition to or from information systems or are unable to properly implement, maintain, upgrade or expand our system, we could suffer from, among other things, operational disruptions, loss of members, difficulty in attracting new members, regulatory problems, and increases in administrative expenses.\nOur business requires the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography, or other events or developments could result in compromises or breaches of our security systems and member data stored in our information systems. Anyone who circumvents our security measures could misappropriate our confidential information or cause interruptions in services or operations. The internet is a public network, and data is sent over this network from many sources. In the past, computer viruses or software programs that disable or impair computers have been distributed and have rapidly spread over the internet. Computer viruses could be introduced into our systems, or those of our providers or regulators, which could disrupt our operations, or make our systems inaccessible to our members, providers, or regulators. We may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by breaches. Because of the confidential health information we store and transmit, security breaches could expose us to a risk of regulatory action, litigation, possible liability, and loss. Our security measures may be inadequate to prevent security breaches, and our business operations would be negatively impacted by cancellation of contracts and loss of members if security breaches are not prevented.\nBecause our corporate headquarters are located in Southern California, our business operations may be significantly disrupted as a result of a major earthquake.\nOur corporate headquarters is located in Long Beach, California. In addition, the claims of our health plans are also processed in Long Beach. Southern California is exposed to a statistically greater risk of a major earthquake than most other parts of the United States. If a major earthquake were to strike the Los Angeles area, our corporate functions and claims processing could be significantly impaired for a substantial period of time. Although we have established a disaster recovery and business resumption plan with back-up operating sites to be deployed in the case of such a major disruptive event, there can be no assurances that the disaster recovery plan will be successful or that the business operations of all our health plans, including those that are remote from any such event, would not be substantially impacted by a major Southern California earthquake.\nWe face claims related to litigation which could result in substantial monetary damages.\nWe are subject to a variety of legal actions, including medical malpractice actions, provider disputes, employment related disputes, health care regulatory law-based litigation, and breach of contract actions. In the event we incur liability materially in excess of the amount for which we have insurance coverage, our profitability would suffer. In addition, our providers involved in medical care decisions are exposed to the risk of medical malpractice claims. As an employer of physicians and ancillary\nmedical personnel and as an operator of primary care clinics, our plans are subject to liability for negligent acts, omissions, or injuries occurring at one of our clinics or caused by one of our employees. We maintain medical malpractice insurance for our clinics in an amount which we believe to be reasonable in light of our experience to date. However, given the significant amount of some medical malpractice awards and settlements, this insurance may not be sufficient or available at a reasonable cost to protect us from damage awards or other liabilities. Even if any claims brought against us are unsuccessful or without merit, we may have to defend ourselves against such claims. The defense of any such actions may be time-consuming and costly, and may distract our management\u2019s attention. As a result, we may incur significant expenses and may be unable to effectively operate our business.\nFurthermore, claimants often sue managed care organizations for improper denials of or delays in care, and in some instances improper authorizations of care. Claims of this nature could result in substantial damage awards against us and our providers that could exceed the limits of any applicable medical malpractice insurance coverage. Successful malpractice or tort claims asserted against us, our providers, or our employees could adversely affect our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations.\nWe cannot predict the outcome of any lawsuit with certainty. While we currently have insurance coverage for some of the potential liabilities relating to litigation, other such liabilities may not be covered by insurance, the insurers could dispute coverage, or the amount of insurance could be insufficient to cover the damages awarded. In addition, insurance coverage for all or certain types of liability may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future or the deductible on any such insurance coverage could be set at a level which would result in us effectively self-insuring cases against us.\nAlthough we establish reserves for litigation as we believe appropriate, we cannot assure you that our recorded reserves will be adequate to cover such costs. Therefore, the litigation to which we are subject could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, and could prompt us to change our operating procedures.\nWe are subject to competition which negatively impacts our ability to increase penetration in the markets we serve.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment and in an industry that is subject to ongoing changes from business consolidations, new strategic alliances, and aggressive marketing practices by other managed care organizations. We compete for members principally on the basis of size, location, and quality of provider network, benefits supplied, quality of service, and reputation. A number of these competitive elements are partially dependent upon and can be positively affected by the financial resources available to a health plan. Many other organizations with which we compete, including large commercial plans, have substantially greater financial and other resources than we do. For these reasons, we may be unable to grow our membership, or may lose members to other health plans.\nFailure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and stock price.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires, among other things, that we maintain effective internal control over financial reporting. In particular, we must perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal controls over financial reporting to allow management to report on, and our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to, our internal controls over financial reporting as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Our future testing, or the subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm, may reveal deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses. Our compliance with Section 404 will continue to require that we incur substantial accounting expense and expend significant management time and effort. Moreover, if we are not able to continue to comply with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to sanctions or investigations by the New York Stock Exchange, SEC, or other regulatory authorities which would require additional financial and management resources.\nChanges in accounting may affect our results of operations.\nU.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and related implementation guidelines and interpretations can be highly complex and involve subjective judgments. Changes in these rules or their interpretation, or the adoption of new pronouncements could significantly affect our stated results of operations.\nThe value of our investments is influenced by varying economic and market conditions, and a decrease in value could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, and financial condition.\nOur investments consist of investment-grade debt securities. The unrestricted portion of this portfolio is designated as available-for-sale. Our non-current restricted investments are designated as held-to-maturity. Available-for-sale investments are carried at fair value, and the unrealized gains or losses are included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss as a separate component of stockholders\u2019 equity, unless the decline in value is deemed to be other-than-temporary and we do not have the intent and ability to hold such securities until their full cost can be recovered. For our available-for-sale investments\nand held-to-maturity investments, if a decline in value is deemed to be other-than-temporary and we do not have the intent and ability to hold such security until its full cost can be recovered, the security is deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired and it is written down to fair value and the loss is recorded as an expense.\nIn accordance with applicable accounting standards, we review our investment securities to determine if declines in fair value below cost are other-than-temporary. This review is subjective and requires a high degree of judgment. We conduct this review on a quarterly basis, using both quantitative and qualitative factors, to determine whether a decline in value is other-than-temporary. Such factors considered include the length of time and the extent to which market value has been less than cost, the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer, recommendations of investment advisors, and forecasts of economic, market or industry trends. This review process also entails an evaluation of our ability and intent to hold individual securities until they mature or full cost can be recovered.\nThe current economic environment and recent volatility of the securities markets increase the difficulty of assessing investment impairment and the same influences tend to increase the risk of potential impairment of these assets. Over time, the economic and market environment may provide additional insight regarding the fair value of certain securities, which could change our judgment regarding impairment. This could result in realized losses relating to other-than-temporary declines to be recorded as an expense. Given the current market conditions and the significant judgments involved, there is continuing risk that declines in fair value may occur and material other-than-temporary impairments may result in realized losses in future periods which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations.\nUnanticipated changes in our tax rates or exposure to additional income tax liabilities could affect our profitability.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States. Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by changes in the mix of earnings in states with different statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in U.S. tax laws and regulations, and changes in our interpretations of tax laws, including pending tax law changes, such as the health care federal excise tax discussed above. In addition, we are subject to the routine examination of our income tax returns by the Internal Revenue Service and other local and state tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our estimated income tax liabilities. Adverse outcomes from tax examinations could have a material adverse effect on our provision for income taxes, estimated income tax liabilities, or results of operations.\nWe are dependent on our executive officers and other key employees.\nOur operations are highly dependent on the efforts of our executive officers. The loss of their leadership, knowledge, and experience could negatively impact our operations. Replacing many of our executive officers might be difficult or take an extended period of time because a limited number of individuals in the managed care industry have the breadth and depth of skills and experience necessary to operate and expand successfully a business such as ours. Our success is also dependent on our ability to hire and retain qualified management, technical, and medical personnel. It is critical that we recruit, manage, enable, and retain talent to successfully execute our strategic objections which requires aligned policies, a positive work environment, and a robust succession and talent development process. Further, particularly in light of the changing health care environment, we must focus on building employee capabilities to help ensure that we can meet upcoming challenges and opportunities. If we are unsuccessful in recruiting, retaining, managing, and enabling such personnel and are unable to meet upcoming challenges and opportunities, our operations could be negatively impacted.\nWe are subject to risks associated with outsourcing services and functions to third parties.\nWe contract with independent third party vendors and service providers who provide services to us and our subsidiaries or to whom we delegate selected functions. Our arrangements with third party vendors and service providers may make our operations vulnerable if those third parties fail to satisfy their obligations to us, including their obligations to maintain and protect the security and confidentiality of our information and data. In addition, we may have disagreements with third party vendors and service providers regarding relative responsibilities for any such failures under applicable business associate agreements or other applicable outsourcing agreements. Further, we may not be adequately indemnified against all possible losses through the terms and conditions of our contracts with third party vendors and service providers. Our outsourcing arrangements could be adversely impacted by changes in vendors\u2019 or service providers\u2019 operations or financial condition or other matters outside of our control. If we fail to adequately monitor and regulate the performance of our third party vendors and service providers, we could be subject to additional risk. Violations of, or noncompliance with, laws and/or regulations governing our business or noncompliance with contract terms by third party vendors and service providers could increase our exposure to liability to our members, providers, or other third parties, or sanctions and/or fines from the regulators that oversee our business. In turn, this could increase the costs associated with the operation of our business or have an adverse impact on our business and reputation. Moreover, if these vendor and service provider relationships were terminated for any reason, we may not be able to find alternative partners in a timely manner or on acceptable financial terms, and may incur significant costs in connection with any such vendor or service provider transition. As a result, we may not be able to meet the full demands of our customers and, in turn, our business, financial condition, or results of operations may be harmed. In addition, we may not\nfully realize the anticipated economic and other benefits from our outsourcing projects or other relationships we enter into with third party vendors and service providers, as a result of regulatory restrictions on outsourcing, unanticipated delays in transitioning our operations to the third party, vendor or service provider noncompliance with contract terms or violations of laws and/or regulations, or otherwise. This could result in substantial costs or other operational or financial problems that could adversely impact our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations.\nAn impairment charge with respect to our recorded goodwill, or our finite-lived intangible assets, could have a material impact on our financial results.\nAs of December 31, 2015, goodwill was $519 million, and intangible assets, net, were $122 million. Intangible assets are amortized generally on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives.\nGoodwill represents the amount of the purchase price in excess of the fair values assigned to the underlying identifiable net assets of acquired businesses. Goodwill is not amortized, but is subject to an annual impairment test. Tests are performed more frequently if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount. Our intangible assets are subject to impairment tests when events or circumstances indicate that a finite-lived intangible asset\u2019s (or asset group\u2019s) carrying value may not be recoverable.\nThe determination of the value of goodwill, and intangible assets, net, requires us to make estimates and assumptions about estimated asset lives, future business trends, and growth. Such evaluation is significantly impacted by estimates and assumptions of future revenues, costs and expenses, and other factors. If an event or events occur that would cause us to revise our estimates and assumptions used in analyzing the value of our goodwill, and intangible assets, net, such revision could result in a non-cash impairment charge that could have a material impact on our financial results.\nWe are subject to the risks of owning and leasing real property.\nWe are a tenant under numerous leases in multiple states, including a 25-year lease of an approximately 460,000 square foot office building housing our principal executive offices in Long Beach, California. We also own a 186,000 square-foot office building in Troy, Michigan, a 26,700 square-foot data center in Albuquerque, New Mexico, a 24,000 square-foot community clinic in Pomona, California, and 40 properties in Pennsylvania, which are primarily residential housing facilities. Accordingly, we are subject to all of the risks generally associated with leasing and owning real estate, which include, but are not limited to: the possibility of environmental contamination, the costs associated with fixing any environmental problems and the risk of damages resulting from such contamination; adverse changes in the value of the property due to interest rate changes, changes in the neighborhood in which the property is located, or other factors; ongoing maintenance expenses and costs of improvements; the possible need for structural improvements in order to comply with changes in zoning, seismic, disability act, or other requirements; inability to renew or enter into leases for space not utilized by us on commercially acceptable terms or at all; and possible disputes with neighboring owners or other individuals and entities.\nOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of any variable rate debt, and prevent us from meeting our our outstanding indebtedness.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2015, our total indebtedness was approximately $1,609 million, including lease financing obligations. As of December 31, 2015, we also had $244 million available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility. Our substantial indebtedness could have significant consequences, including:\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to adverse economic, industry, or competitive developments;\n\u2022\nrequiring a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, therefore reducing our ability to use our cash flows to fund operations, make capital expenditures, and pursue future business opportunities;\n\u2022\nexposing us to the risk of increased interest rates to the extent of any future borrowings, including borrowings under the revolving credit facility, at variable rates of interest;\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, including the revolving credit facility and our outstanding senior notes, and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of our debt instruments, including restrictive covenants and borrowing conditions, could result in an event of default under the indenture governing our outstanding senior notes and the agreements governing such other indebtedness;\n\u2022\nrestricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, product and service development, debt service requirements, acquisitions, and general corporate or other purposes; and\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who are less highly leveraged and who, therefore, may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our substantial indebtedness may prevent us from exploiting.\nDespite our high indebtedness level, we and our subsidiaries are able to incur substantial additional amounts of debt, including secured debt, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. Although the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes and the credit agreement governing the revolving credit facility contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and under certain circumstances, the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $244 million available for additional borrowing under our revolving credit facility. In addition, the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes and the credit agreement governing our revolving credit facility do not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute prohibited indebtedness thereunder. If new debt is added to our and our subsidiaries\u2019 existing debt levels, the related risks that we now face would increase.\nThe terms of our debt impose, and will impose, restrictions on us that may affect our ability to successfully operate our business and our ability to make payments on our outstanding senior notes.\nThe indentures governing our outstanding senior notes and the credit agreement governing the revolving credit facility contain various covenants that could materially and adversely affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs and to engage in other business activities that may be in our best interest. These covenants limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred equity;\n\u2022\npay dividends on, repurchase, or make distributions in respect of our capital stock, prepay, redeem, or repurchase certain debt or make other restricted payments;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments;\n\u2022\ncreate certain liens;\n\u2022\nsell assets, including capital stock of restricted subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nenter into agreements restricting our restricted subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay dividends to us;\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge, sell, or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022\nenter into certain transactions with our affiliates; and\n\u2022\ndesignate our restricted subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries.\nAll of these covenants may restrict our ability to expand or to pursue our business strategies. Our ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, such as prevailing economic conditions and changes in regulations, and if such events occur, we cannot be sure that we will be able to comply. A breach of these covenants could result in a default under the indentures for our outstanding senior notes and/or the credit agreement governing the revolving credit facility including, as a result of cross default provisions and, in the case of the revolving credit facility permit the lenders to cease making loans to us. If there were an event of default under the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes and/or the credit agreement governing the revolving credit facility, holders of such defaulted debt could cause all amounts borrowed under these instruments to be due and payable immediately. Our assets or cash flow may not be sufficient to repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments in the event of a default thereunder.\nIn addition, the restrictive covenants in the credit agreement governing the revolving credit facility require us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests. Our ability to meet those financial ratios and tests will depend on our ongoing financial and operating performance, which, in turn, will be subject to economic conditions and to financial, market, and competitive factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nIf our operating performance declines, we may be required to obtain waivers from the lenders under the revolving credit facility, from the holders of our outstanding senior notes or from the holders of other obligations, to avoid defaults thereunder. If we are not able to obtain such waivers, our creditors could exercise their rights upon default, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nWe may not have the funds necessary to pay the amounts due upon conversion or required repurchase of our outstanding notes, and our indebtedness may contain limitations on our ability to pay the amounts due upon conversion or required repurchase.\nIn February 2013, we issued $550.0 million aggregate principal amount of 1.125% cash convertible senior notes due January 15, 2020, unless earlier repurchased or converted. We refer to these notes as our 1.125% Notes. In September 2014, we issued $301.6 million aggregate principal amount of 1.625% convertible senior notes due August 14, 2044, unless earlier repurchased, redeemed, or converted. We refer to these notes as our 1.625% Notes. As of December 31, 2015, the aggregate outstanding principal amount of our 1.125% Notes and our 1.625% Notes was $550 million and $302 million, respectively. Both our 1.125% Notes and our 1.625% Notes are convertible into cash prior to their respective maturity dates under certain circumstances, one of which relates to the closing price of our common stock over a specified period. We refer to this conversion trigger as the stock price trigger. The 1.125% Notes met the stock price trigger in the quarter ended December 31, 2015, and are convertible to cash through at least March 31, 2016. Because the 1.125% Notes may be converted into cash within 12 months, the $448 million carrying amount is reported in current portion of long-term debt as of December 31, 2015. In addition, holders of our 1.625% Notes may convert their notes into cash during any calendar quarter (and only during such calendar quarter) if the last reported sales price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to $75.51 per share. The last reported sale price of our common stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange on February 23, 2016 was $62.28 per share. As of December 31, 2015, our 1.625% Notes were not convertible. If conversion requests are received, the settlement of the notes must be paid primarily in cash pursuant to the terms of the relevant indentures.\nFor economic reasons related to the trading market for our 1.125% Notes, we believe that the amount of the notes that may be converted over the next twelve months, if any, will not be significant. However, if the trading market for our 1.125% Notes becomes closed or restricted due to market turmoil or other reasons such that the notes cannot be traded, or if the trading price of our 1.125% Notes, which normally trade at a marginal premium to the underlying composite stock-and-interest economic value, no longer includes that marginal premium, holders of our 1.125% Notes may elect to convert the notes to cash. As of December 31, 2015, we had sufficient available cash, combined with borrowing capacity available under our revolving credit facility, to fund such conversions.\nIn addition, in the event of a change in control or the termination in trading of our stock, each holder of our 1.125% Notes and our 1.625% Notes would have the right to require us to purchase some or all of their notes at a purchase price in cash equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes, plus any accrued and unpaid interest.\nIn the event of conversions or required repurchases, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to comply with our conversion or repurchase obligations. In addition, our ability to comply with these obligations may be limited by law, by regulatory authority, or by agreements governing our future indebtedness. The indentures for the 1.125% Notes and the 1.625% Notes provide that it would be an event of default if we do not make the cash payments due upon conversion or required repurchase of the notes. The occurrence of an event of default under one or both of these indentures may also constitute an event of default under our revolving credit facility and under our other indebtedness we may have outstanding at such time. Any such default could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flows, or results of operations.\nVariable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nOur borrowings under the revolving credit facility are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness could increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income could decrease. The applicable margin with respect to the loan under the revolving credit facility is a percentage per annum equal to a reference rate plus the applicable margin. In order to manage our exposure to interest rate risk, in the future we may enter into derivative financial instruments, typically interest rate swaps and caps, involving the exchange of floating for fixed rate interest payments. If we are unable to enter into interest rate swaps, it may adversely affect our cash flow and may impact our ability to make required principal and interest payments on our indebtedness.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business, and other factors beyond our control. We may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, and interest on our indebtedness.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital, or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. The terms of existing or future debt instruments, including the revolving credit facility, and the indentures governing our outstanding senior notes, may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. In addition, any failure to make payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which would harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations.\nA lowering or withdrawal of the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating agencies may increase our future borrowing costs and reduce our access to capital.\nOur debt currently has a non-investment grade rating, and there can be no assurance that any rating assigned by the rating agencies to our debt or our corporate rating will remain for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in that rating agency\u2019s judgment, future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating, such as adverse changes, so warrant. A lowering or withdrawal of the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating agencies would likely increase our future borrowing costs and reduce our access to capital, which could have a materially adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nDelaware law and our charter documents may impede or discourage a takeover, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nWe are a Delaware corporation, and the anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law impose various impediments to the ability of a third party to acquire control of us, even if a change in control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our board of directors or a committee thereof has the power, without stockholder approval, to designate the terms of one or more series of preferred stock and issue shares of preferred stock. The ability of our board of directors or a committee thereof to create and issue a new series of preferred stock and certain provisions of Delaware law and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could impede a merger, takeover or other business combination involving us or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our common stock, which, under certain circumstances, could reduce the market price of our common stock and the value of our convertible senior notes.\nMembers of the Molina family own a significant amount of our capital stock, decreasing the influence of other stockholders on stockholder decisions.\nMembers of the Molina family, either directly or as trustees or beneficiaries of Molina family trusts, in the aggregate owned or were entitled to receive upon certain events approximately 26% of our capital stock as of December 31, 2015. Our president and chief executive officer, as well as our chief financial officer, are members of the Molina family, and they are also on our board of directors. Because of the amount of their shareholdings, Molina family members, if they were to act as a group with the trustees of their family trusts, have the ability to significantly influence all matters submitted to stockholders for approval, including the election of directors, amendments to our charter, and any merger, consolidation, or sale of our company. A significant concentration of share ownership can also adversely affect the trading price for our common stock because investors often discount the value of stock in companies that have controlling stockholders. Furthermore, the concentration of share ownership in the Molina family could delay or prevent a merger or consolidation, takeover, or other business combination that could be favorable to our stockholders. Finally, the interests and objectives of the Molina family may be different from those of our company or our other stockholders, and they may vote their common stock in a manner that is contrary to the vote of our other stockholders.\nFuture sales of our common stock or equity-linked securities in the public market could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and our ability to raise funds in new stock offerings.\nWe may issue equity securities in the future, or securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, shares of our common stock. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or other equity securities, including sales of shares in connection with any future acquisitions, could be substantially dilutive to our stockholders. These sales may have a harmful effect on prevailing market prices for our common stock and our ability to raise additional capital in the financial markets at a time and price favorable to us. Moreover, to the extent that we issue restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, options, or warrants to purchase our common stock in the future and those stock appreciation rights, options, or warrants are exercised or as the restricted stock units vest, our stockholders may experience further dilution. Holders of our shares of common stock have no preemptive rights that entitle holders to purchase a pro rata share of any offering of shares of any class or series and, therefore, such sales or offerings could result in increased dilution to\nour stockholders. Our certificate of incorporation provides that we have authority to issue 150,000,000 shares of common stock and 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock. As of December 31, 2015, approximately 56,000,000 shares of common stock and no shares of preferred or other capital stock were issued and outstanding.\nIt may be difficult for a third party to acquire us, which could inhibit stockholders from realizing a premium on their stock price.\nWe are subject to the Delaware anti-takeover laws regulating corporate takeovers. These provisions may prohibit stockholders owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us. In addition, any change in control of our state health plans would require the approval of the applicable insurance regulator in each state in which we operate.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws also contain provisions that could have the effect of delaying, deferring, or preventing a change in control of our company that stockholders may consider favorable or beneficial. These provisions could discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. These provisions include:\n\u2022\na staggered board of directors, so that it would take three successive annual meetings to replace all directors,\n\u2022\nprohibition of stockholder action by written consent, and\n\u2022\nadvance notice requirements for the submission by stockholders of nominations for election to the board of directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at a meeting.\nIn addition, changes of control are often subject to state regulatory notification, and in some cases, prior approval.", "PERMNO": 89781, "SIC": 6324, "TIC": "MOH"}
