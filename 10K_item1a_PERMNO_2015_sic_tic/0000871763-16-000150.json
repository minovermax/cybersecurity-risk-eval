Risk Factors\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nStatements made in this report that are not statements of historical fact are forward-looking statements. In addition, from time to time, we and our representatives may make statements that are forward-looking. All forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. This section provides you with cautionary statements identifying, for purposes of the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements made in this report or otherwise made by us or on our behalf.

We undertake no obligation to update any forward-looking statement to reflect events or circumstances after the date on which the statement is made.\nRISK FACTORS\nIn addition to the other information set forth in this report, you should carefully consider the following factors which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations (including revenues and profitability) or stock price. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that may broadly affect companies. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operation or stock price.\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected by volatile or uncertain economic conditions.\nOur business is affected by global macroeconomic conditions, which have recently included considerable uncertainty and volatility. In particular, economic conditions have been unstable and difficult to predict globally, with many regions experiencing volatile growth patterns.\nWe are particularly susceptible to changes in economic conditions in Europe, which represents two of our operating segments and approximately 64% of our revenue. During 2015, the various economies in Europe experienced uneven and choppy growth characteristics, and there is a risk that some or many of the European economies may be hampered by events which emerged in 2015, including the refugee situation or the impact of terrorist activity, or by other political or economic developments, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nIn addition, because we operate globally, an economic slowdown in one or more regions outside Europe, including in emerging markets, could adversely affect our results of operations as well. There are a number of recent global economic developments that could contribute to such a slowdown, including the rapid decline in oil prices as well as a strengthening US dollar.\nEven without uncertainty and volatility, it is difficult for us to forecast future demand for our services due to the inherent difficulty in forecasting the direction and strength of economic cycles, and the short-term nature of many of our staffing assignments. This situation can be exacerbated by uncertain and volatile economic conditions, which may cause clients to reduce or defer projects for which they utilize our services, thereby negatively affecting demand for them. When it is difficult for us to accurately forecast future demand, we may not be able to determine the optimal level of personnel and office investments necessary to profitably operate our business or take advantage of growth opportunities.\nFurthermore, our profitability is sensitive to decreases in demand. When demand drops or remains low, our operating profit is typically impacted unfavorably as we experience a deleveraging of our selling and administrative expense base as expenses may not decline as quickly as revenues. In periods of decline, we may not be able to reduce selling and administrative expenses without negatively impacting the long-term potential of our branch network and brands. Additionally, during periods of decline or uncertainty, companies may slow the rate at which they pay their vendors, or they may become unable to pay their obligations. If our clients become unable to pay amounts owed to us, or pay us more slowly, then our cash flow and profitability may suffer.\nThere is a risk that any economic recovery may be short-lived and uneven, and may not result in increased demand for our services.\nDuring periods of economic contraction or weak economic growth, the demand for our staffing services typically declines, and these declines may be prolonged even if other economic indicators turn positive. Our business declined during the global economic downturn, as clients required fewer of our workforce solutions and services, and there is a risk that even if overall global economic conditions improve, we will continue to experience declines in all, or in portions, of our business. Recoveries are difficult to predict, and may be short-lived, slow or uneven, with some regions, or countries within a region, continuing to experience declines or weakness in economic activity while others improve. Differing economic conditions and patterns of economic growth or contraction in the geographical regions in which we operate may affect demand for our solutions and services. Even if global economic conditions improve, it may not result in uniform, or any, increases in demand for our solutions and services within the markets where our business is concentrated.\nWe may lack the speed and agility to respond to the needs of our clients.\nThere is a risk we may not be able to respond with sufficient speed and agility to the needs of our clients, which may change rapidly as their businesses evolve. The size and breadth of our organization, comprising approximately 27,000 employees based out of over 2,900 offices in 80 countries and territories, may make it difficult for us to effectively manage our resources and provide coordinated solutions to our clients who require our services in multiple locations. For example, client demands for uniform service across borders may be difficult to satisfy because of variation in local laws and customs. We see a trend in more multi-country and enterprise-level relationships and we may have difficulty in profitably managing and delivering projects involving multiple countries. Also, our size and organizational structure may make it difficult to develop and implement new processes and tools across the enterprise in a consistent manner. If we are not effective at meeting the needs of our current and prospective clients, or our competitors are more agile or effective at doing so, our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected.\nThe worldwide employment services industry is highly competitive with limited barriers to entry, which could limit our ability to maintain or increase our market share or profitability.\nThe worldwide employment services industry is highly competitive with limited barriers to entry, and in recent years has undergone significant consolidation. We compete in markets throughout the world with full-service and specialized employment services agencies. Several of our global competitors, including Adecco S.A. and Randstad Holding N.V., have very substantial marketing and financial resources, and may be better positioned in certain markets. Portions of our industry may become increasingly commoditized, with the result that competition in key areas could become more focused on pricing. We expect that we will continue to experience pressure on price from competitors and clients. There is a risk that we will not compete effectively, including on price, which could limit our ability to maintain or increase our market share and could adversely affect our profitability. This may worsen as clients increasingly take advantage of low-cost alternatives including using their own in-house resources rather than engaging a third party.\nWe may be unable to effectively implement our business strategy, and there can be no assurance that we will achieve our objectives.\nOur business strategy focuses on growing revenues while improving our operating profits. An important element of our strategy is our effort to diversify our revenues beyond our core staffing and employment services through the sale of innovative workforce solutions designed to achieve higher operating margins. These workforce solutions are often unique, non-repeatable and tailored to a client\u2019s needs, and present costs, risk and complexity that may be difficult to calculate. These solutions may be\nunprofitable if we are not able to accurately anticipate these costs and risks in our pricing for these solutions. For example, we may fail to structure and price our solutions in a manner that successfully recovers our initial investments, or properly compensates us for regulatory or compliance-related risks. Furthermore, we may not create an adequate delivery model for new workforce solutions, effectively manage our solutions, or obtain adequate insurance coverage in amount or scope to cover potential risks arising from the solutions we provide.\nOur business strategy also includes continuing efforts to optimize our organizational structure, programs, technology and delivery of services to make us a more agile and effective competitor, to reduce the cost of operating our business and to increase our operating profit and operating profit margin. We may not be successful in these efforts and, we may fail to prevent the return of costs previously eliminated as part of our simplification efforts. Additionally, the reductions in personnel and other changes we made in connection with the implementation of our simplification efforts could adversely affect our ability to effectively operate our business. If, for these or other reasons, we are not successful in implementing our business strategy or achieving the anticipated results, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nA loss or reduction in revenues from one or more large client accounts could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur client mix consists of both small- and medium-size businesses, which are based upon a local or regional relationship with our presence in each market, and large national/multinational client relationships, which comprised approximately 58% of our revenues in 2015. These large national and multinational clients will frequently enter into non-exclusive arrangements with several firms, and the client is generally able to terminate our contracts on short notice without penalty. The deterioration of the financial condition or business prospects of these large national and multinational clients, or a change in their strategy around the use of our services, could reduce their need for our services and result in a significant decrease in the revenues and earnings we derive from them. A loss or reduction in revenues from one or more of our large national and multinational clients could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur performance on contracts may be adversely affected if we or third parties fail to deliver on commitments.\nOur contracts are increasingly complex and, in some instances, require that we partner with other parties to provide the workforce solutions required by our clients. Our ability to deliver these solutions and provide the services required by our clients is dependent on our and our partners' ability to meet our clients' delivery requirements and schedules. If we or our partners fail to deliver services on time and in accordance with contractual performance obligations, then our ability to successfully complete our contracts may be adversely affected, which may have a material and adverse impact on our client relations, revenues and profitability.\nOur results of operations and ability to grow could be materially negatively affected if we cannot successfully keep pace with technological changes in the development and implementation of our services and solutions.\nOur success depends on our ability to keep pace with rapid technological changes in the development and implementation of our services and solutions. Our business is reliant on a variety of technologies, including those which support applicant on-boarding and tracking systems, order management, billing, and client data analytics. There is a risk we will not sufficiently invest in technology or industry developments, or evolve our business with the right strategic investments, or at sufficient speed and scale, to adapt to changes in our marketplace. Similarly, from time to time we make strategic commitments to particular technologies to recruit, manage or analyze our workforce or support our business, and there is a risk they will be unsuccessful. These and similar risks could have a negative effect on our services and solutions, our results of operations, and our ability to develop and maintain a competitive advantage in the marketplace.\nIf we lose our key personnel, then our business may suffer.\nOur operations are dependent on the continued efforts of our officers and executive management and the performance and productivity of our local managers and field personnel. Our ability to attract and retain business is significantly affected by local relationships and the quality of service rendered. If we were to lose key personnel who have acquired significant experience in managing our business or managing companies on a global basis, it could have a significant impact on our operations. Additionally, some of our important client relationships may be dependent on the continued performance of individual managers or field personnel, and there is a risk that loss of those individuals could jeopardize key client relationships. Our simplification efforts have included reductions of our workforce, at the staff and officer level, in both our headquarters and throughout our country operations. There is a risk that this simplification and the resultant reductions in personnel could materially adversely affect operational performance, and therefore our business and financial results. In\naddition, it is part of our strategy to maintain a lean corporate structure and small executive team in order to manage our operating margins. There is a risk that we will not have developed sufficient executive talent internally in order to address any key leadership vacancies that might arise.\nIntense competition may limit our ability to attract, train and retain the qualified personnel necessary for us to meet our clients\u2019 staffing needs.\nOur business depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified associates who possess the skills and experience necessary to meet the requirements of our clients. We must continually evaluate and upgrade our base of available qualified personnel through recruiting and training programs to keep pace with changing client needs and emerging technologies. Competition for individuals with proven professional skills is intense, and we expect demand for such individuals to remain very strong for the foreseeable future. Qualified personnel may not be available to us in sufficient numbers and on terms of employment acceptable to us. Additionally, our clients may look to us for assistance in identifying and integrating into their organizations workers from diverse backgrounds, and who may represent different generations, geographical regions, and skillsets. These needs may change due to business requirements, or in response to geopolitical and societal trends. There is a risk that we may not be able to identify workers with the required attributes, or that our training programs may not succeed in developing effective or adequate skills. If we fail to recruit, train and retain qualified associates who meet the needs of our clients, our reputation, business and financial results could be materially adversely affected.\nWe could be harmed by improper disclosure or loss of sensitive or confidential company, employee, associate or client data, including personal data.\nIn connection with the operation of our business, we store, process and transmit a large amount of data, including personnel and payment information, about our employees, clients, associates and candidates, a portion of which is confidential and/or personally sensitive. In doing so, we rely on our own technology and systems, and those of third party vendors we use for a variety of processes, including cloud-based technology and systems. We and our third party vendors have established policies and procedures to help protect the security and privacy of this information. Unauthorized disclosure or loss of sensitive or confidential data may occur through a variety of methods. These include, but are not limited to, systems failure, employee negligence, fraud or misappropriation, or unauthorized access to or through our information systems, whether by our employees or third parties, including a cyberattack by computer programmers, hackers, members of organized crime and/or state-sponsored organizations, who may develop and deploy viruses, worms or other malicious software programs.\nSuch disclosure, loss or breach could harm our reputation and subject us to significant monetary damages, litigation, regulatory enforcement actions, fines, criminal prosecution, or other liability under our contracts and laws that protect sensitive or personal data and confidential information, resulting in increased costs or loss of revenues. It is possible that security controls over sensitive or confidential data and other practices we and our third party vendors follow may not prevent the improper access to, disclosure of, or loss of such information. The potential risk of security breaches and cyberattacks may increase as we continue to introduce new services and offerings, such as mobile technology. Further, data privacy is subject to frequently changing rules and regulations, which sometimes conflict among the various jurisdictions and countries in which we provide services. Any failure or perceived failure to successfully manage the collection, use, disclosure, or security of personal information or other privacy related matters, or any failure to comply with changing regulatory requirements in this area, could result in legal liability or impairment to our reputation in the marketplace. In addition, our liability insurance might not be sufficient in scope or amount to cover us against claims related to security breaches, cyberattacks and other related data disclosure, loss or breach.\nOur global operations subject us to certain risks beyond our control.\nWith operations in 80 countries and territories around the world, we are subject to numerous risks outside of our control, including risks arising from political unrest and other political events, hostilities, and strikes and other worker unrest, natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism, international conflict, severe weather conditions, pandemics and other global health emergencies, disruptions of infrastructure and utilities, cyberattacks, and other events beyond our control. Although it is not possible to predict such events or their consequences, these events could materially adversely affect our reputation, business and financial results.\nGovernment regulations may result in prohibition or restriction of certain types of employment services or the imposition of additional licensing or tax requirements that may reduce our future earnings.\nIn many jurisdictions in which we operate, such as France and Germany, the employment services industry is heavily regulated. For example, governmental regulations in Germany restrict the length of contracts and the industries in which our\nassociates may be used. In some countries, special taxes, fees or costs are imposed in connection with the use of our associates. Additionally, in some countries, trade unions have used the political process to target our industry, in an effort to increase the regulatory burden and expense associated with offering or utilizing contingent workforce solutions.\nThe countries in which we operate may, among other things:\n\u2022 create additional regulations that prohibit or restrict the types of employment services that we currently provide;\n\u2022 require new or additional benefits be paid to our associates;\n\u2022 require us to obtain additional licensing to provide employment services; or\n\u2022 increase taxes, such as sales or value-added taxes.\nAny future regulations may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial results because they may make it more difficult or expensive for us to continue to provide employment services, particularly if we cannot pass along increases in costs to our clients.\nFailure to comply with antibribery and corruption laws could adversely affect our business.\nWe are additionally subject to numerous legal and regulatory requirements that prohibit bribery and corrupt acts. These include the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK Bribery Act 2010, as well as similar legislation in many of the countries in which we operate. We have in place a global anticorruption compliance program designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations. However, there are no assurances our compliance program will be effective. In many countries where we operate, practices in the local business community may not conform to international business standards and could violate anticorruption law or regulations. Furthermore, we remain subject to the risk that a full-time, temporary or contract employee could engage in business practices that are prohibited by our policies and these laws and regulations. Any such violations could adversely affect our business.\nWe may be exposed to employment-related claims and costs from clients or third parties that could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are in the business of employing people and placing them in the workplaces of other businesses. Risks relating to these activities include:\n\u2022 claims arising out of the actions or inactions of our associates, including matters for which we may have indemnified a client;\n\u2022 claims by our associates of discrimination or harassment directed at them, including claims relating to actions of our clients;\n\u2022 claims related to the employment of undocumented or illegal workers;\n\u2022 payment of workers\u2019 compensation claims and other similar claims;\n\u2022 violations of employee pay and benefits requirements such as violations of wage and hour requirements;\n\u2022 retroactive entitlement to employee benefits, including healthcare coverage as may be required under the US Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act passed in 2010;\n\u2022 errors and omissions of our associates and other individuals working on our behalf in performing their jobs, including accountants, IT professionals and other technical workers; and\n\u2022 claims by our clients relating to our associates\u2019 misuse of clients\u2019 proprietary information, misappropriation of funds, other criminal activity or torts or other similar claims.\nWe may incur fines and other losses or negative publicity with respect to these problems. In addition, some or all of these claims may give rise to litigation, which could be time-consuming to our management team and costly and could have a negative impact on our business. In the past several years, we devoted considerable time and expense to resolve several\nCalifornia-based \u201cwage and hour\u201d claims that asserted deficiencies in our payroll practices, and we cannot be certain we will not experience similar claims in the future.\nWe cannot be certain our insurance will be sufficient in amount or scope to cover all claims that may be asserted against us. Should the ultimate judgments or settlements exceed our insurance coverage, they could have a material effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We cannot be certain we will be able to obtain appropriate types or levels of insurance in the future, that adequate replacement policies will be available on acceptable terms, if at all, or that the companies from which we have obtained insurance will be able to pay claims we make under such policies.\nOur business exposes us to competition law risk.\nWe are subject to antitrust and competition law in the United States, the European Union, and many other regions in which we operate. Some of our business models may carry a heightened risk of regulatory inquiry under relevant competition laws. Although we have put in place safeguards designed to maintain compliance with applicable competition laws, there can be no assurance these protections will be adequate, and there is a risk that we will be subject to regulatory investigation by relevant authorities. For example, in 2009, we were fined by the French Competition Council following a 2004 investigation, and in 2013 we were informed that the French competition authority had commenced an investigation, which remains ongoing, into us and a number of our competitors in France.\nThere is no assurance we will successfully defend against such regulatory inquiries, and they may consume substantial amounts of our financial and managerial resources, and result in adverse publicity, even if successfully resolved. An unfavorable outcome with respect to these matters and any future matters could, individually or in the aggregate, result in substantial liabilities that have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur ability to attract and retain business and employees may depend on our reputation in the marketplace.\nWe believe the ManpowerGroup brand name and our reputation are important corporate resources that help distinguish our services from those of competitors and also contribute to our efforts to recruit and retain talented employees. However, our corporate reputation is potentially susceptible to material damage by events such as disputes with clients, information technology security breaches, internal control deficiencies, delivery failures or compliance violations. Similarly, our reputation could be damaged by actions or statements of current or former clients, employees, competitors, vendors, adversaries in legal proceedings, government regulators, as well as members of the investment community or the media. There is a risk that negative information about ManpowerGroup, even if based on rumor or misunderstanding, could adversely affect our business. Damage to our reputation could be difficult, expensive and time-consuming to repair, could make potential or existing clients reluctant to select us for new engagements, resulting in a loss of business, and could adversely affect our recruitment and retention efforts. Damage to our reputation could also reduce the value and effectiveness of the ManpowerGroup brand name and could reduce investor confidence in us, materially adversely affecting our share price.\nChanges in sentiment toward the staffing industry could affect the marketplace for our services.\nFrom time to time, the staffing industry has come under criticism from unions, works councils, regulatory agencies and other constituents that maintain that labor and employment protections, such as wage and benefits regulations, are subverted when clients use contingent staffing services. Our business is dependent on the continued acceptance of contingent staffing arrangements as a source of flexible labor for our clients. If attitudes or business practices in some locations change due to pressure from organized labor, political groups or regulatory agencies, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.\nOur results of operations and share price could be adversely affected if we are unable to maintain effective internal controls.\nThe accuracy of our financial reporting is dependent on the effectiveness of our internal controls. We are required to provide a report from management to our shareholders on our internal control over financial reporting that includes an assessment of the effectiveness of these controls. Internal control over financial reporting has inherent limitations, including human error, the possibility that controls could be circumvented or become inadequate because of changed conditions, and fraud. Because of these inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting might not prevent or detect all misstatements or fraud. If we cannot maintain and execute adequate internal control over financial reporting or implement required new or improved controls that provide reasonable assurance of the reliability of the financial reporting and preparation of our financial statements for external use, we could suffer harm to our reputation, fail to meet our public reporting requirements on a timely basis, be unable to properly report on our business and our results of operations, or be required to\nrestate our financial statements, and our results of operations, the market price of our securities and our ability to obtain new business could be materially adversely affected.\nForeign currency fluctuations may have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nAlthough we report our results of operations in United States dollars, the majority of our revenues and expenses are denominated in currencies other than the United States dollar, and unfavorable fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our reported financial results\nDuring 2015, approximately 84% of our revenues were generated outside of the United States, the majority of which were generated in Europe. Furthermore, $855.1 million of our outstanding indebtedness as of December 31, 2015 was denominated in foreign currencies. Increases or decreases in the value of the United States dollar against other major currencies, or the imposition of limitations on conversion of foreign currencies into United States dollars, could affect our revenues, operating profit and the value of balance sheet items denominated in foreign currencies. Our exposure to foreign currencies, in particular the Euro, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, cash flow and results of operations. Furthermore, the volatility of currencies may make year-over-year comparability difficult.\nOur acquisition strategy may have a material adverse effect on our business due to unexpected or underestimated costs.\nFrom time to time, we make acquisitions of other companies or operating assets or enter into operating joint ventures. These activities involve significant risks, including:\n\u2022 difficulties in the assimilation of the operations, services and corporate culture of acquired companies;\n\u2022 failure of any companies or assets that we acquire, or joint ventures that we form, to meet performance expectations, which could trigger payment obligations;\n\u2022 over-valuation by us of any companies or assets that we acquire, or joint ventures that we form;\n\u2022 failure to effectively monitor compliance with corporate policies as well as regulatory requirements;\n\u2022 insufficient indemnification from the selling parties for liabilities incurred by the acquired companies prior to the acquisitions; and\n\u2022 diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns.\nThese risks could have a material adverse effect on our business because they may result in substantial costs to us and disrupt our business. In addition, future acquisitions could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Possible impairment losses on goodwill and intangible assets with an indefinite life, or restructuring charges could also occur.\nOutsourcing certain aspects of our business could result in disruption and increased costs.\nWe have outsourced certain aspects of our business to third party vendors that subject us to risks, including disruptions in our business and increased costs. For example, we rely on third parties to host and manage certain aspects of our data center information and technology infrastructure, to develop and maintain new technology for attracting, onboarding, managing, and analyzing our workforce, and to provide certain back office support. Accordingly, we are subject to the risks associated with our vendors\u2019 ability to provide these services to meet our needs. Additionally, we replace these vendors from time to time, and there is a risk that we might suffer interruptions in service as we transition from one third party provider to another. Our operations will depend significantly upon their and our ability to make our servers, software applications and websites available and to protect our data from damage or interruption from human error, computer viruses, intentional acts of vandalism, labor disputes, natural disasters and similar events. If the cost of our outsourced services is more than expected, or if the vendor or we are unable to adequately protect our data and information is lost, or our ability to deliver our services is interrupted, then our business and financial results could be materially adversely affected.\nWe have only a limited ability to protect our thought leadership and other intellectual property, which is important to our success.\nOur success depends, in part, upon our ability to protect our proprietary methodologies and other intellectual property including the value of our brands. Existing laws of the various countries in which we provide services or solutions may offer only limited protection. We rely upon a combination of trade secrets, confidentiality and other contractual agreements, and patent, copyright, and trademark laws to protect our intellectual property rights. Our intellectual property rights may not prevent competitors from independently developing products, services and solutions similar to ours. Further, the steps we take might not be adequate to prevent or deter infringement or other misappropriation of our intellectual property by competitors, former employees or other third parties, which could materially adversely affect our business and financial results.\nIn addition, we cannot be sure that our services and solutions do not infringe on the intellectual property rights of third parties, and these third parties could claim that we or our clients are infringing upon their intellectual property rights. These claims could harm our reputation, cause us to incur substantial costs or prevent us from offering some services or solutions in the future.\nWe maintain debt that could adversely affect our operating flexibility and put us at a competitive disadvantage.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had $855.1 million of total debt. Our level of debt and the limitations imposed on us by our credit agreements could have important consequences for investors, including the following:\n\u2022 we may not be able to obtain additional debt financing for future working capital, capital expenditures or other corporate purposes or may have to pay more for such financing;\n\u2022 borrowings under our revolving credit facilities are at a variable interest rate, making us more vulnerable to increases in interest rates; and\n\u2022 we could be less able to take advantage of significant business opportunities, such as acquisition opportunities, and to react to changes in market or industry conditions.\nOur failure to comply with restrictive covenants under our revolving credit facilities and other debt instruments could trigger prepayment obligations.\nOur failure to comply with the restrictive covenants under our revolving credit facilities and other debt instruments could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could result in us being required to repay these borrowings before their due date. If we are forced to refinance these borrowings on less favorable terms, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by increased costs and rates.\nThe lenders under our and our subsidiaries\u2019 credit facilities may be unwilling or unable to extend credit to us on acceptable terms or at all.\nOur liquidity is dependent in part on our revolving credit facility, which is provided by a syndicate of banks. Each bank in the syndicate is responsible on a several, but not joint, basis for providing a portion of the loans under the facility. If any of the participants in the syndicate fails to satisfy its obligations to extend credit under the facility, the other participants refuse or are unable to assume its obligations and we are unable to find an alternative source of funding at comparable rates, our liquidity may be adversely affected or our interest expense may increase substantially.\nFurthermore, a number of our subsidiaries maintain uncommitted lines of credit with various banks. Under the terms of these lines of credit, the bank is not obligated to make loans to the subsidiary or to make loans to the subsidiary at a particular interest rate. If any of these banks cancel these lines of credit or otherwise refuse to extend credit on acceptable terms, we may need to extend credit to those subsidiaries or the liquidity of our subsidiaries may be adversely affected.\nThe performance of our subsidiaries and their ability to distribute cash to our parent company may vary, negatively affecting our ability to service our debt at the parent company level or in other subsidiaries.\nSince we conduct a significant portion of our operations through our subsidiaries, our cash flow and our consequent ability to service our debt depends in part upon the earnings of our subsidiaries and the distribution of those earnings to our parent company, or upon loans or other payments of funds by those subsidiaries to our parent company or to other subsidiaries. The payment of such dividends and the making of such loans and advances by our subsidiaries may be subject to legal or\ncontractual restrictions, depend upon the earnings of those subsidiaries and be subject to various business considerations, including the ability of such subsidiaries to pay such dividends or make such loans and advances in a manner that does not result in substantial tax liability or other costs.\nOur inability to secure guarantees or letters of credit on acceptable terms may substantially increase our cost of doing business in various countries.\nIn a number of countries in which we conduct business we are obligated to provide guarantees or letters of credit to secure licenses, lease space or for insurance coverage. We typically receive these guarantees and letters of credit from a number of financial institutions around the world. In the event that we are unable to secure these arrangements from a bank, lender or other third party on acceptable terms, our liquidity may be adversely affected, there could be a disruption to our business or there could be a substantial increase in cost for our business.\nWe could be subject to changes in tax rates, adoption of new United States or international tax legislation or tax audits that could result in additional income tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and other jurisdictions where we have operations. The tax bases and rates in these respective tax jurisdictions may significantly change due to economic and political conditions. Our future effective tax rate could be affected by changes in earnings in countries with differing tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in the respective tax laws. In addition, tax accounting may involve complex matters and requires our judgment to determine our worldwide provision for income taxes and tax assets and liabilities including matters related to our intercompany transactions. We are routinely subject to income tax examination by the United States Internal Revenue Service and other Tax Authorities, and these audits may result in an additional tax liability. If any of these instances lead to an increase in our effective tax rates, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, which may result in losses for investors.\nThe market price for our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile. For example, during 2015, the price of our common stock as reported on the New York Stock Exchange ranged from a high of $96.56 to a low of $63.79. Our stock price can fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, including factors listed in these \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and others, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include:\n\u2022 actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results;\n\u2022 announcement of new services by us or our competitors;\n\u2022 announcements relating to strategic relationships or acquisitions;\n\u2022 changes in financial estimates or other statements by securities analysts;\n\u2022 changes in general economic conditions; and\n\u2022 changes in investor sentiment regarding the company or the economy in general.\nWisconsin law and our articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make the takeover of our company more difficult.\nCertain provisions of Wisconsin law and our articles of incorporation and bylaws could have the effect of delaying or preventing a third party from acquiring us, even if a change in control would be beneficial to our shareholders. These provisions of our articles of incorporation and bylaws currently include:\n\u2022 permitting removal of directors only for cause;\n\u2022 providing that vacancies on the board of directors will be filled by the remaining directors then in office; and\n\u2022 requiring advance notice for shareholder proposals and director nominees.\nIn addition, the Wisconsin control share acquisition statute and Wisconsin\u2019s \u201cfair price\u201d and \u201cbusiness combination\u201d provisions, in addition to other provisions of Wisconsin law, limit the ability of an acquiring person to engage in certain\ntransactions or to exercise the full voting power of acquired shares under certain circumstances. As a result, offers to acquire us, which may represent a premium over the available market price of our common stock, may be withdrawn or otherwise fail to be realized. The provisions described above could cause our stock price to decline.", "PERMNO": 75285, "SIC": 7363, "TIC": "MAN"}
