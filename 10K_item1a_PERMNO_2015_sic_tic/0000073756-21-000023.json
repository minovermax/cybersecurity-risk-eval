{"cik": "73756", "company": "OCEANEERING INTERNATIONAL INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A.Risk Factors.\nWe are subject to various risks and uncertainties in the course of our business. The following summarizes the risks and uncertainties that we consider to be material and that may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows and the market value of our securities. Investors in our company should consider these matters, in addition to the other information we have provided in this report and the documents we incorporate by reference.\nBusiness and Operational Risks\nWe derive most of our revenue from companies in the offshore oil and gas industry, a historically cyclical industry with levels of activity that are significantly affected by the levels and volatility of oil and gas prices.\nWe derive most of our revenue from customers in the offshore oil and gas exploration, development and production industry. The offshore oil and gas industry is a historically cyclical industry characterized by significant changes in the levels of exploration and development activities. Oil and gas prices, and market expectations of potential changes in those prices, significantly affect the levels of those activities. Worldwide political, economic and military events have contributed to oil and gas price volatility and are likely to continue to do so in the future. Since the general decline in the price of oil from mid-2014, many oil and gas companies made significant reductions in their capital and operating expenditures, which have adversely impacted demand for the services and products provided by our Energy Services and Products business. During this period, exploration expenditures in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, particularly in deepwater sectors, have dropped significantly. This situation was exacerbated in 2020 by further reductions in expenditures by oil and gas companies due to the impact of the coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) pandemic, including the resulting significant reduction in global demand for oil and natural gas, coupled with the sharp decline in oil prices following the announcement of price reductions and production increases in March 2020 by members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, or OPEC, and other foreign, oil-exporting countries, as discussed below. So far in 2021, although oil and gas prices have recovered somewhat, there is new uncertainty regarding the long-term outlook for the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, as a result of a temporary ban on leasing of U.S. federal lands imposed by the new administration. Any prolonged reduction in the overall level of offshore oil and gas exploration and development activities, whether resulting from changes in oil and gas prices, limitations on access to capital for such activities, governmental actions or regulatory developments or otherwise, could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in our operating segments within our Energy Services and Products business. Some factors that have affected and are likely to continue affecting oil and gas prices and the level of demand for our services and products include the following:\n\u2022worldwide demand for oil and gas;\n\u2022general economic and business conditions and industry trends;\n\u2022the ability of OPEC to set and maintain production levels;\n\u2022the level of production by non-OPEC countries, including U.S. shale oil;\n\u2022the ability of oil and gas companies to generate funds for capital expenditures;\n\u2022the cost of exploring for, developing and producing oil and gas;\n\u2022domestic and foreign tax policy;\n\u2022laws and governmental regulations that restrict exploration and development of oil and gas in various offshore jurisdictions;\n\u2022technological changes;\n\u2022the political environment of oil-producing regions;\n\u2022the changing environmental and social landscape; and\n\u2022the price and availability of alternative energy.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 outbreak has adversely affected, and could continue to adversely affect, our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, which the World Health Organization declared a pandemic and the U.S. Government declared a national emergency in March 2020, has resulted in widespread adverse impacts on the global economy and financial markets, and on our employees, customers, suppliers and other parties with whom we have business relations. We have experienced some resulting disruptions to our business operations. For example,\nsince mid-March, we have had to restrict access to our administrative offices around the world and quarantine personnel and assets as required by various governmental authorities, our customers\u2019 and our own safety protocols. There is considerable uncertainty regarding the extent to which COVID-19 and its variants will continue to spread, the widespread availability and efficacy of vaccines and the extent and duration of governmental and other measures implemented to try to slow the spread, such as large-scale travel bans and restrictions, border closures, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and business and government shutdowns. Restrictions of this nature have caused, and may continue to cause, us, our suppliers and other business counterparties to experience operational delays, delays in the delivery of materials and supplies that are sourced from around the globe, and have caused, and may continue to cause, milestones or deadlines relating to various projects to be missed. Further, the impact of the pandemic, including the resulting significant reduction in global demand for oil and natural gas, coupled with the sharp decline in oil prices following the announcement of price reductions and production increases in March 2020 by members of OPEC and other foreign, oil-exporting countries has led to significant global economic contraction generally and in our industry in particular. Despite recent improvements in commodity prices, oil and natural gas prices are expected to continue to be volatile as a result of these events and the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, and as changes in oil and natural gas inventories, industry demand and economic performance are reported. We cannot predict whether and the extent to which prices will continue to improve and stabilize.\nWe have modified certain business and workforce practices (including those related to employee travel, employee work locations, and cancellation of physical participation in meetings, events and conferences) and implemented new protocols to promote social distancing and enhance sanitary measures in our offices and facilities to conform to government restrictions and best practices encouraged by governmental and regulatory authorities. However, the quarantine of personnel or the inability to access our facilities or customer sites could adversely affect our operations. Also, we have a limited number of highly skilled employees for some of our operations. If a large proportion of our employees in those critical positions were to contract COVID-19 or be quarantined as a result of the virus, at the same time, we would rely upon our business continuity plans in an effort to continue operations at our facilities and customer sites and onboard our vessels, but there is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the adverse impact to our operations that could result from shortages of highly skilled employees. Many of our suppliers and other business counterparties have made similar modifications. The resources available to those of our employees who are working remotely may not enable them to maintain the same level of productivity and efficiency, and those and other employees may face additional demands on their time, such as increased responsibilities resulting from school closures or the illness of family members. Although we have experienced only limited absenteeism from employees who are required to be on-site to perform their jobs, absenteeism may increase in the future and may harm our productivity. Further, our increased reliance on remote access to our information systems increases our exposure to potential cybersecurity breaches. We may take further actions as government authorities require or recommend or as we determine to be in the best interests of our employees, customers, suppliers and other business counterparties. There is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus, in which case our employees or other individuals may become sick, our ability to perform critical functions could be harmed, and we may be unable to respond to some of the needs of our global business.\nWe have also received various notices from some of our suppliers and other business counterparties, and provided notices to several customers, regarding performance delays resulting from the pandemic. These actions may result in some disputes and could strain our relations with customers and others. If and to the extent these actions were to result in material modifications or cancellations of the underlying contracts, we could experience reductions in our currently reported backlog and in the anticipated conversion of backlog into revenue in future periods. In addition, worsening economic conditions could result in reductions in backlog over time, which would impact our future financial performance.\nDue to the ongoing impact of COVID-19, certain projects that were in process have been delayed in our Manufacturing Products segment. As of December 31, 2020, we had outstanding accounts receivable and contracts assets of approximately $51 million for these projects. We continue to believe these accounts receivable and contract assets are realizable and the projects will resume.\nAdditionally, to the extent that access to the capital and other financial markets is adversely affected by the effects of COVID-19, we may need to consider alternative sources of funding for some of our operations and for working capital, which may increase our cost of, as well as adversely impact our access to, capital. These uncertain economic conditions may also result in the inability of our customers and other counterparties to make payments to us, on a timely basis or at all, which could adversely affect our business, cash flows, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe cannot predict the full impact that COVID-19 or the significant disruption and volatility currently being experienced in the oil and natural gas markets will have on our business, cash flows, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations at this time, due to numerous uncertainties. The ultimate impacts will depend on future developments beyond our control, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including, among others, the ultimate geographic spread of the virus, the consequences of governmental and other measures designed to prevent the spread of the virus, the ongoing development and distribution of vaccines and therapeutic treatments, the duration of the pandemic, actions taken by members of OPEC and other foreign, oil-exporting countries, actions taken by governmental authorities, customers, suppliers and other third parties, workforce availability, and the timing and extent to which normal economic and operating conditions resume.\nOur international operations involve additional risks not associated with domestic operations.\nA significant portion of our revenue is attributable to operations in foreign countries. These activities accounted for approximately 53% of our consolidated revenue in 2020. Risks associated with our operations in foreign areas include risks of:\n\u2022regional and global economic downturns;\n\u2022public health threats, such as COVID-19, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, severe influenza and other highly communicable viruses or diseases, that could limit access to customers', vendors' or our facilities or offices, impose travel restrictions on our personnel or otherwise adversely affect our operations or demand for our services;\n\u2022disturbances or other risks that may limit or disrupt markets;\n\u2022expropriation, confiscation or nationalization of assets;\n\u2022renegotiation or nullification of existing contracts;\n\u2022foreign exchange restrictions;\n\u2022foreign currency fluctuations, particularly in countries highly dependent on oil revenue;\n\u2022foreign taxation, including the application and interpretation of tax laws;\n\u2022the inability to repatriate earnings or capital;\n\u2022uncertainties relating to the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union, including uncertainties about applicable future laws, regulations and treaties regarding tax and free trade agreements, intellectual property rights and supply chain logistics, as well as environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, immigration laws, employment laws, and other rules that could apply to us and our subsidiaries;\n\u2022changing political conditions;\n\u2022changing foreign and domestic monetary policies; and\n\u2022social, political, military and economic situations in foreign areas where we do business and the possibilities of civil disturbances, war, other armed conflict, terrorist attacks or acts of piracy.\nAdditionally, in some jurisdictions we are subject to foreign governmental regulations favoring or requiring the awarding of contracts to local contractors or requiring foreign contractors to employ citizens of, or purchase supplies from, a particular jurisdiction. These regulations may adversely affect our ability to compete.\nOur exposure to the risks we described above varies from country to country. In recent periods, economic conditions, political instability and civil unrest in Africa and Azerbaijan have been among our greatest concerns. There is a risk that a continuation or worsening of these conditions could materially and adversely impact our future business, operations, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur backlog is subject to unexpected adjustments and cancellations and is, therefore, an uncertain indicator of our future revenue and earnings.\nThere can be no assurance that the revenue included in our backlog will be realized or, if realized, will result in profits. Because of project cancellations or potential changes in the scope or schedule of our customers' projects, we cannot predict with certainty when or if backlog will be realized. Material delays, suspensions, cancellations or payment defaults could materially affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We may be at risk of delays, suspensions and cancellations in the current market environment.\nReductions in our backlog due to cancellation by a customer or for other reasons would adversely affect, potentially to a material extent, the revenue and earnings we actually receive from contracts included in our backlog. Many of our ROV contracts have 30-day notice termination clauses. Some of the contracts in our backlog provide for\ncancellation fees in the event customers cancel projects. These cancellation fees usually provide for reimbursement of our out-of-pocket costs, revenue for work performed prior to cancellation and a varying percentage of the profits we would have realized had the contract been completed. However, under limited circumstances, such as certain bankruptcy events, no cancellation fee would be owed to us. Further, even if a cancellation fee is owed to us, a customer may be unable or may refuse to pay the cancellation fee. We typically have no contractual right upon cancellation to the total contract revenue as reflected in our backlog. If we experience significant project terminations, suspensions or scope adjustments to contracts reflected in our backlog, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely impacted.\nOur offshore oilfield operations involve a variety of operating hazards and risks that could cause losses.\nOur operations are subject to the hazards inherent in the offshore oilfield business. These include blowouts, explosions, fires, collisions, capsizings and severe weather conditions. These hazards could result in personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment, pollution or environmental damage and suspension of operations. We may incur substantial liabilities or losses as a result of these hazards. While we maintain insurance protection against some of these risks, and seek to obtain indemnity agreements from our customers requiring the customers to hold us harmless from some of these risks, our insurance and contractual indemnity protection may not be sufficient or effective to protect us under all circumstances or against all risks. The occurrence of a significant event not fully insured or indemnified against or the failure of a customer to meet its indemnification obligations to us could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nOur operations could be adversely impacted by the effects of new regulations.\nDuring 2010, the U.S. Government established new regulations relating to the design of wells and testing of the integrity of wellbores, the use of drilling fluids, the functionality and testing of well control equipment, including blowout preventers, and other safety and environmental regulations. The U.S. Government requires that operators demonstrate their compliance with those regulations before commencing deepwater drilling operations. In addition, increasing attention to issues concerning climate change as a result of the emission of carbon dioxide and other \u201cgreenhouse gases\u201d may result in the imposition of additional environmental or other legislation or regulations that seek to restrict, or otherwise impose limitations or costs upon, the emission of greenhouse gases. We cannot predict when or whether any of these various legislative and regulatory proposals may be enacted or adopted or what their effects will be on us or our customers, particularly with respect to offshore oil and gas exploration and development projects. These and other legislative or regulatory developments could increase costs for us and our customers or, in some cases, prevent projects from going forward, thereby potentially reducing the need for our products and services.\nEmployee, agent or partner misconduct or our overall failure to comply with laws or regulations could weaken our ability to win contracts, which could result in reduced revenue and profits.\nMisconduct, fraud, non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations, or other improper activities by one or more of our employees, agents or partners could have a significant negative impact on our business and reputation. Such misconduct could include the failure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\"), which prohibits companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials, as well as the failure to comply with government procurement regulations, regulations on lobbying or similar activities, regulations pertaining to the internal controls over financial reporting and various other applicable laws or regulations, including the U.K. Bribery Act. We operate in some countries that international corruption monitoring groups have identified as having high levels of corruption. Our activities create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of our employees or agents that could be in violation of the FCPA or other applicable anti-corruption laws. The precautions we take to prevent and detect misconduct, fraud or non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations may not be effective, and we could face unknown risks or losses. Our failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations or acts of misconduct could subject us to fines, penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nLaws and governmental regulations may add to our costs or adversely affect our operations.\nOur business is affected by changes in public policy and by federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the offshore oil and gas industry. Offshore oil and gas exploration and production operations are affected by tax, environmental, safety and other laws, by changes in those laws, application or interpretation of existing laws,\nand changes in related administrative regulations. It is also possible that these laws and regulations may in the future add significantly to our operating costs or those of our customers or otherwise directly or indirectly affect our operations.\nEnvironmental laws and regulations can increase our costs, and our failure to comply with those laws and regulations can expose us to significant liabilities.\nRisks of substantial costs and liabilities related to environmental compliance issues are inherent in our operations. Our operations are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the generation, storage, handling, emission, transportation and discharge of materials into the environment. Permits are required for the operation of various facilities, and those permits are subject to revocation, modification and renewal. Governmental authorities have the power to enforce compliance with their regulations, and violations are subject to fines, injunctions or both. In some cases, those governmental requirements can impose liability for the entire cost of cleanup on any responsible party without regard to negligence or fault and impose liability on us for the conduct of or conditions others have caused, or for our acts that complied with all applicable requirements when we performed them. It is possible that other developments, such as stricter environmental laws and regulations, and claims for damages to property or persons resulting from our operations, would result in substantial costs and liabilities. In particular, increasing attention to issues concerning climate change as a result of the emission of carbon dioxide and other \u201cgreenhouse gases\u201d may result in the imposition of additional environmental legislation or regulations that seek to restrict, or otherwise impose limitations or costs upon, the emission of greenhouse gases. We cannot predict when or whether any of these various legislative and regulatory proposals may become law or what their effect will be on us or our customers. Such legislation or regulations could increase costs for us and our customers or, in some cases, prevent projects from going forward, thereby potentially reducing the need for our products and services. Our insurance policies and the contractual indemnity protection we seek to obtain from our customers may not be sufficient or effective to protect us under all circumstances or against all risks involving compliance with environmental laws and regulations.\nFinancial Risks\nForeign exchange risks and fluctuations may affect our profitability on certain projects.\nWe operate on a worldwide basis with substantial operations outside the U.S. that subject us to U.S. dollar translation and economic risks. In order to manage some of the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rates, we may enter into foreign currency derivative (hedging) instruments, especially when there is currency risk exposure that is not naturally mitigated via our contracts. However, these actions may not always eliminate all currency risk exposure, in particular for our long-term contracts. A disruption in the foreign currency markets, including the markets with respect to any particular currencies, could adversely affect our hedging instruments and subject us to additional currency risk exposure. Based on fluctuations in currency, the U.S. dollar value of our backlog may from time to time increase or decrease significantly. We do not enter into derivative instruments for trading or other speculative purposes. Our operational cash flows and cash balances, though predominately held in U.S. dollars, may consist of different currencies at various points in time in order to execute our contracts globally. Non-U.S. asset and liability balances are subject to currency fluctuations when measured period to period for financial reporting purposes in U.S. dollars.\nMaintaining adequate letter of credit and bonding capacity is necessary for us to successfully bid on and win various contracts.\nIn line with industry practice, we are often required to post standby letters of credit to customers or enter into surety bond arrangements in favor of customers. Those letters of credit and surety bond arrangements generally protect customers against our failure to perform our obligations under the applicable contracts. However, the terms of those letters of credit, including terms relating to the customer\u2019s ability to draw upon the letter of credit and the amount of the letter of credit required, can vary significantly. If a letter of credit or surety bond is required for a particular project and we are unable to obtain it due to insufficient liquidity or other reasons, we may not be able to pursue that project. We have limited capacity for letters of credit, and we rely substantially on bilateral letters of credit from various issuing banks in a number of markets. Moreover, due to events that affect the credit markets generally, letters of credit may be more difficult to obtain in the future or may only be available at significant additional cost. Letters of credit, including through our bilateral arrangements (which are cancelable in the discretion of the issuing banks), may not continue to be available to us on reasonable terms. Our inability to obtain adequate letters of credit and surety bonds and, as a result, to bid on new work could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in the method of determining the U.S. Dollar London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d), or the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate, may adversely affect interest rates and increase our cost of capital.\nOn July 27, 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom announced that it would phase out LIBOR as a benchmark rate by the end of 2021. On November 30, 2020, the ICE Benchmark Administration, the current administrator of LIBOR, announced that it intends to cease publication of 1-week and 2-month LIBOR at the end of 2021 and, subject to compliance with applicable regulations, including as to representativeness, it does not intend to cease publication of the remaining tenors until June 30, 2023. However, it is possible that LIBOR\u2019s regulator may determine to cease publication as of an earlier date, if the information used to calculate LIBOR degrades to the degree that it is no longer representative of the underlying market. We expect that different benchmark rates used to price indebtedness will continue to be developed over time. Revolving credit borrowings under our principal credit agreement, which is described in Part II of this report in Item 7 - \u201cManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d), bear interest at rates tied to LIBOR. In the future, we may need to renegotiate the Credit Agreement or incur indebtedness under other credit arrangements, and the phase-out of LIBOR may negatively impact the terms of such indebtedness. We have not yet pursued an amendment of the Credit Agreement or other contractual alternative to address this matter and are currently evaluating the impact of the potential replacement of LIBOR. If no such amendment or other contractual alternative is established on or prior to the phase-out of LIBOR, interest on revolving credit borrowings under the Credit Agreement may bear interest at higher rates based on the prime rate, which could increase our cost of capital in the event we borrow against the Credit Agreement. Furthermore, the overall financial market may be disrupted as a result of the phase-out or replacement of LIBOR. Disruption in the financial market could have an adverse effect on our business, cash flows, liquidity, financial condition and results of operations.\nA global financial crisis could impact our business and financial condition in ways that we currently cannot predict.\nA recurrence of the credit crisis and related turmoil in the global financial system that occurred in 2008 and 2009 could have an impact on our business and our financial condition. In particular, the cost of capital increased substantially while the availability of funds from the capital markets diminished significantly. Although the capital markets have recovered, in a recurrence, our ability to access the capital markets in the future could be restricted or be available only on terms we do not consider favorable. Limited access to the capital markets could adversely impact our ability to take advantage of business opportunities or react to changing economic and business conditions and could adversely impact our ability to continue our growth strategy. Ultimately, we could be required to reduce our future capital expenditures substantially. Such a reduction could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. A recurrence of such a global financial crisis could have further impacts on our business that we currently cannot predict or anticipate.\nA global financial crisis or economic recession could have an impact on our suppliers and our customers, causing them to fail to meet their obligations to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our revenue, income from operations and cash flows.\nIf one or more of the lenders under our revolving credit facility were to become unable or unwilling to perform their obligations under that facility, our borrowing capacity could be reduced. Our inability to borrow under our revolving credit facility could limit our ability to fund our future operations and growth.\nIn addition, we maintain our cash balances and short-term investments primarily in accounts held by major banks and financial institutions located principally in North America, Europe, Africa and Asia, and some of those accounts hold deposits that exceed available insurance. It is possible that one or more of the financial institutions in which we hold our cash and investments could become subject to bankruptcy, receivership or similar proceedings. As a result, we could be at risk of not being able to access material amounts of our cash, which could result in a temporary liquidity crisis that could impede our ability to fund operations.\nStrategic Risks Related to our Business\nOur business strategy contemplates future acquisitions. Acquisitions of other businesses or assets present various risks and uncertainties.\nWe may pursue growth through the acquisition of businesses or assets that will enable us to broaden our service and product offerings and expand into new markets. We may be unable to implement this element of our growth\nstrategy if we cannot identify suitable businesses or assets, reach agreement on potential strategic acquisitions on acceptable terms or for other reasons. Moreover, acquisitions involve various risks, including:\n\u2022difficulties relating to the assimilation of personnel, services and systems of an acquired business and the assimilation of marketing and other operational capabilities;\n\u2022challenges resulting from unanticipated changes in customer and other third-party relationships subsequent to acquisition;\n\u2022additional financial and accounting challenges and complexities in areas such as tax planning, treasury management, financial reporting and internal controls;\n\u2022assumption of liabilities of an acquired business, including liabilities that were unknown at the time the acquisition transaction was negotiated;\n\u2022possible liabilities under the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws;\n\u2022diversion of management's attention from day-to-day operations;\n\u2022failure to realize anticipated benefits, such as cost savings and revenue enhancements;\n\u2022potentially substantial transaction costs associated with acquisitions; and\n\u2022potential impairment resulting from the overpayment for an acquisition.\nFuture acquisitions may require us to obtain additional equity or debt financing, which may not be available on attractive terms. Moreover, to the extent an acquisition transaction financed by non-equity consideration results in goodwill, it will reduce our tangible net worth, which might have an adverse effect on credit availability.\nAdditionally, an acquisition may bring us into businesses we have not previously conducted and expose us to additional business risks that are different from those we have previously experienced.\nOur business strategy also includes development and commercialization of new technologies to support our growth. The development and commercialization of new technologies require capital investment and involve various risks and uncertainties.\nOur future growth will depend on our ability to continue to innovate by developing and commercializing new service and product offerings. Investments in new technologies involve varying degrees of uncertainties and risk. Commercial success depends on many factors, including the levels of innovation, the development costs and the availability of capital resources to fund those costs, the levels of competition from others developing similar or other competing technologies, our ability to obtain or maintain government permits or certifications, the effectiveness of production, distribution and marketing efforts, and the costs to customers to deploy and provide support for the new technologies. We may not achieve significant revenue from new service and product investments for a number of years, if at all. Moreover, new services and products may not be profitable, and, even if they are profitable, our operating margins from new services and products may not be as high as the margins we have experienced historically.\nThe loss of the services of one or more of our key personnel, or our failure to attract, assimilate and retain trained personnel in the future, could disrupt our operations and result in loss of revenue.\nOur success depends on the continued active participation of our executive officers and key operating personnel. The unexpected loss of the services of any one of these persons could adversely affect our operations.\nOur operations require the services of employees having the technical training and experience necessary to obtain the proper operational results. As a result, if we should suffer any material loss of personnel to competitors or be unable to employ additional or replacement personnel with the requisite level of training and experience to adequately operate our equipment, our operations could be adversely affected. A significant increase in the wages paid by other employers could result in a reduction in our workforce, increases in wage rates, or both.\nWe may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors.\nOur businesses operate in highly competitive industry segments. Some of our competitors or potential competitors have greater financial or other resources than we have. Our operations may be adversely affected if our current competitors or new market entrants introduce new products or services with better features, performance, prices or other characteristics than those of our services and products. This factor is significant to our segments' operations, particularly in the operating segments within our Energy Services and Products business, where capital investment is critical to our ability to compete.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property, Information Technology and Data Privacy\nWe rely on intellectual property law and confidentiality agreements to protect our intellectual property. We also rely on intellectual property we license from third parties. Our failure to protect our intellectual property rights, or our inability to obtain or renew licenses to use intellectual property of third parties, could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on a variety of intellectual property rights that we use in our services and products, and our success depends, in part, on our ability to protect our proprietary information and other intellectual property. Our intellectual property could be challenged, invalidated, circumvented or rendered unenforceable. In addition, effective intellectual property protection may be limited or unavailable in some foreign countries where we operate.\nOur failure to protect our intellectual property rights may result in the loss of valuable technologies or adversely affect our competitive business position. We rely significantly on proprietary technology, information, processes and know-how that are not subject to patent or copyright protection. We seek to protect this information through trade secret or confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, subcontractors or other parties, as well as through other security measures. These agreements and security measures may be inadequate to deter or prevent misappropriation of our confidential information. In the event of an infringement of our intellectual property rights, a breach of a confidentiality agreement or divulgence of proprietary information, we may not have adequate legal remedies to protect our intellectual property.\nIn some instances, we have augmented our technology base by licensing the proprietary intellectual property of third parties. However, it is possible that the tools, techniques, methodologies, programs and components we use to provide our services or products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of others. In the future, we may not be able to obtain necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms. Royalty payments under licenses from third parties, if available, or developing non-infringing technologies could materially increase our costs. Additionally, if a license or non-infringing technology were not available, we might not be able to continue providing a particular service or product, which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nLitigation to determine the scope of intellectual property rights, even if ultimately successful, could be costly and could divert management's attention away from other aspects of our business. In addition, our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors.\nOur information technology systems are subject to interruption and cybersecurity risks that could adversely impact our operations.\nOur operations (both onshore and offshore) are highly dependent on information technology systems, including systems that collect, organize, store or use personally identifiable data and other sensitive information about our customers, employees, suppliers and others. Threats to information technology systems associated with cybersecurity risks and cyber incidents or attacks continue to grow. In addition, breaches to our systems or third-party systems utilized by us could go unnoticed for some period of time. Risks associated with these threats include disruptions of certain systems on our vessels or utilized to operate our ROVs; other impairments of our ability to conduct our operations; loss of or damage to intellectual property, proprietary information or employee or customer data; disruption of our customers\u2019 operations; loss or damage to our customer data delivery systems; damage to our reputation or customer or other business relationships; regulatory investigations or other actions by governmental authorities and associated costs, fines or penalties; and increased costs to prevent, respond to or mitigate cybersecurity incidents. If such a cyber incident were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWhile we continue to evaluate potential replacements or upgrades of existing key information technology systems, the implementation of new information technology systems or upgrades to existing systems subjects us to inherent costs and risks associated with replacing or changing these systems, including potential disruption of our internal control structure, substantial capital expenditures, demands on management time and other risks. Our possible new information technology systems implementations or upgrades may not result in productivity improvements at the levels anticipated, or at all. In addition, the implementation of new or upgraded information technology systems may cause disruptions in our business operations. Any such disruption, and any other information technology system disruptions, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated, could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nChanges in data privacy laws, regulations and standards may cause our business to suffer.\nPersonal privacy and data security have become significant regulatory issues and the subject of rapidly evolving laws globally and in the United States. For example, Europe\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) went into effect in 2018 and enforcement is still evolving. Furthermore, federal, state and local government bodies or agencies have in the past adopted, and may in the future adopt, more laws and regulations affecting data privacy. For example, the state of California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (\u201cCCPA\u201d) and California voters recently approved the California Privacy Rights Act (\u201cCPRA\u201d). The CCPA, which went into effect on January 1, 2020, creates individual privacy rights for California residents and places increased privacy and security obligations on entities handling certain personal data of consumers or households, including new disclosures and protections to California residents. The CPRA modifies the CCPA and imposes additional data protection obligations on companies doing business in California. GDPR and the CCPA and other data privacy regulations may significantly impact our business activities and require substantial compliance costs that adversely affect business, operating results, prospects and financial condition.\nAny inability to adequately address privacy and security concerns, even if unfounded, or comply with applicable privacy and data security laws, regulations and policies, could result in additional cost and liability to us, damage our reputation, inhibit sales and adversely affect our business. Furthermore, the costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, the laws, regulations, and policies that are applicable to our business may limit the use and adoption of, and reduce the overall demand for, our solutions. If we are not able to adjust to changing laws, regulations and standards related to privacy or security, our business may be harmed.\nIn addition, the regulatory environment surrounding data privacy and protection is evolving and can be subject to significant change. New laws and regulations relating to data privacy and the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, including the European Union General Data Protection Regulation and recent legislation and regulations adopted in various U.S. jurisdictions, pose complex compliance challenges and may result in increased costs, and any failure to comply with those laws and regulations (or contractual provisions requiring similar compliance), including as a result of security and privacy breaches, could result in negative publicity and significant penalties or other liabilities. Additionally, if we acquire an entity that has violated or is not in compliance with applicable data privacy and protection laws or regulations (or contractual provisions), we may experience similar adverse consequences.\nRisks Related to our Organization and Structure\nWe may issue preferred stock whose terms could adversely affect the voting power or value of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue, without the approval of our shareholders, one or more classes or series of preferred stock having such preferences, powers and relative, participating, optional and other rights, including preferences over our common stock respecting dividends and distributions, as our board of directors may determine. The terms of one or more classes or series of preferred stock could adversely impact the voting power or value of our common stock. For example, we might grant holders of preferred stock the right to elect some number of our directors in all events or on the happening of specified events or the right to veto specified transactions. Similarly, the repurchase or redemption rights or liquidation preferences we might assign to holders of preferred stock could affect the residual value of the common stock.\nProvisions in our corporate documents and Delaware law could delay or prevent a change in control of our company, even if that change would be beneficial to our shareholders.\nThe existence of some provisions in our corporate documents and Delaware law could delay or prevent a change in control of our company, even if that change would be beneficial to our shareholders. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may make acquiring control of our company difficult, including:\n\u2022provisions relating to the classification, nomination and removal of our directors;\n\u2022provisions regulating the ability of our shareholders to bring matters for action at annual meetings of our shareholders;\n\u2022provisions requiring the approval of the holders of at least 80% of our voting stock for a broad range of business combination transactions with related persons; and\n\u2022the authorization given to our board of directors to issue and set the terms of preferred stock.\nIn addition, the Delaware General Corporation Law imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15% or more of our outstanding common stock.\nGeneral Risks\nOur internal controls may not be sufficient to achieve all stated goals and objectives.\nOur internal controls and procedures were developed through a process in which our management applied its judgment in assessing the costs and benefits of such controls and procedures, which, by their nature, can provide only reasonable assurance regarding the control objectives. The design of any system of internal controls and procedures is based, in part, on various assumptions about the likelihood of future events. We cannot assure that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions, regardless of how remote.\nThe use of estimates could result in future adjustments to our assets, liabilities and results of operations.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires that our management make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expense during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.", "PERMNO": 58975, "SIC": 1389, "TIC": "OII"}
