{"cik": "771856", "company": "CHAMPIONS ONCOLOGY, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-07-29", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below together with all of the other information included in this report. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not presently known, or those we currently consider insignificant, may also impair our business operations in the future.\nWe historically incurred losses from operating activities, expect losses for the foreseeable future, require significant capital and may never achieve profitability.\nFor the years ended April 30, 2015 and 2014, the Company had a net loss of approximately $13.1 million and $7.4 million, respectively. As of April 30, 2015, the Company has an accumulated deficit of approximately $52 million.\nThe amount of these losses may vary significantly from year-to-year and quarter-to-quarter and will depend on, among other factors:\n\u00b7 the cost of continuing to build out our TumorGraft Technology Platform;\n\u00b7 the cost and rate of progress toward growing our POS and TOS businesses;\n\u00b7 the cost and rate of progress toward building our sales forces;\n\u00b7 the cost of increasing our research and development;\n\u00b7 the cost of renting our laboratory and animal testing facilities and payment for associated services;\n\u00b7 the timing and cost of obtaining and maintaining any necessary regulatory approvals;\n\u00b7 the cost of expanding and building out our infrastructure; and\n\u00b7 the cost incurred in hiring and maintaining qualified personnel.\nCurrently, the Company derives revenue from POS products and TOS products, while pursuing efforts to further develop bioinformatics from its TumorBank and its TumorGraft Technology Platform. In addition, we are building our sales and marketing operations to grow our TOS and POS products. Accordingly, we expect to generate operating losses in the future until such time as we are able to generate significantly more revenue.\nTo become profitable, we will need to generate revenues to offset our operating costs, including our research and development and general and administrative expenses. We may not achieve or, if achieved, sustain our revenue or profit objectives. Our losses may increase in the future, and, ultimately, we may have to cease operations.\nIn order to grow revenues, we must invest capital to implement our sales and marketing efforts and to successfully develop our bioinformatics from our TumorBank and our TumorGraft Technology Platform. Because we do not have sufficient history of commercial efforts, our sales and marketing efforts may never generate significant increases in revenues or achieve profitability and it is likely that we will be required to raise additional capital to continue our operations as currently contemplated. If we must devote a substantial amount of time to raising capital, it will delay our ability to achieve our business goals within the time frames that we now expect, which could increase the amount of capital we need. In addition, the amount of time expended by our management on fundraising distracts them from concentrating on our business affairs. If we require additional capital and are not successful in raising the needed capital, we may have to cease operations.\nWe may not be able to maintain or increase our revenues due to our reduction in POS product prices, the length of time it takes to conduct TumorGrafts, the uncertainty of whether TumorGrafts will successfully implant and the limited information about the correlation between the response to drugs of a tumor in mice with the response to those drugs of the tumor in patients.\nWe may not be able to successfully maintain or increase our POS products on a profitable basis. Our gross margin for this service has fluctuated significantly, and was negative 21% for 2014 and negative 64% for 2015.\nIn addition, it can take more than six months from the time that a tumor is implanted until it has been expanded to a larger colony of mice and treated with the drugs, although we generally cease efforts after six months. As a result, potential POS customers who need information quickly for their treatment may not elect to use our TumorGraft products. Moreover, not all TumorGrafts result in successful tumor growths; if TumorGrafts are not successful, studies of drugs cannot be conducted, which makes the TumorGrafts of limited value to potential POS customers. Finally, our information about the correlation between the response to drugs of a tumor in mice to the response to those drugs of the tumor in a patient is based on a very limited amount of information, and so may not be accurate with respect to oncology patients in general. If we are unable to demonstrate a correlation between the TumorGraft drug study results and patients\u2019 actual treatment results, customers may not be interested in our POS products, which could result in low growth or a decrease in revenues. In addition, the limited data regarding the clinical outcomes associated with the use of our POS products substantially restricts the promotional claims we may make about those products, limiting the effectiveness of our marketing efforts.\nWe may incur greater costs than anticipated, which could result in sustained losses.\nWe use reasonable efforts to assess and predict the expenses necessary to pursue our business strategies. However, implementing our business strategies may require more employees, capital equipment, supplies or other expenditure items than management has predicted. Similarly, the cost of compensating additional management, employees and consultants or other operating costs may be more than we estimate, which could result in ongoing and sustained losses.\nWe may not be able to implement our business strategies which could impair our ability to continue operations.\nImplementation of our business strategies will depend in large part on our ability to (i) attract and maintain a significant number of customers; (ii) effectively provide acceptable services to our customers; (iii) develop and license new products and technologies; (iv) maintain appropriate internal procedures, policies, and systems; (v) hire, train, and retain skilled employees and management; (vi) continue to operate despite increasing competition in our industry; and (vii) establish, develop and maintain our name recognition. Our inability to obtain or maintain any or all these factors could impair our ability to implement our business strategies successfully, which could have material adverse effects on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business could be adversely impacted by changes in FDA\u2019s regulatory oversight of laboratory-developed tests such as our POS services that are currently under consideration or by other changes in the regulatory requirements applicable to our POS services imposed by the FDA or regulatory authorities in other countries in which our services are provided.\nThe FDA has claimed regulatory authority over all laboratory-developed tests, or LDTs, such as our POS services, but has generally not exercised its regulatory authority for most LDTs performed by CLIA-certified laboratories such as our facilities. The FDA has announced several regulatory and guidance initiatives that may impact our business, including by increasing FDA\u2019s regulation of LDTs.\nOn July 31, 2014 the FDA notified Congress of the FDA\u2019s intent to issue a draft oversight framework for LDTs based on risk to patients rather than whether they were made by a conventional manufacturer or a single laboratory. This draft oversight framework includes pre-market review for higher-risk LDTs, like those used to guide treatment decisions, including the many companion diagnostics that have entered the market as LDTs. In addition, under the draft framework, the FDA would continue to exercise enforcement discretion for low-risk LDTs and LDTs for rare diseases, among others. The framework would be phased in over many years. If this framework is implemented, these initiatives may lead to an increased regulatory burden on our Company, which may result in a requirement for FDA review and clearance or approval of our POS services. Any increased regulatory burdens would probably result in an increase in the cost of our POS services and could keep us from selling POS services until such time as any required FDA clearance or approval is obtained. If our POS services become subject to FDA\u2019s approval and oversight as medical devices, the additional regulatory burdens may be significant, and may require the addition of experienced medical device quality, regulatory and compliance personnel to assume these burdens. Any POS services that we provide in other countries may be similarly subject to regulation by foreign regulatory agencies, which would also increase our costs. These matters could hurt our business and our financial results.\nOur laboratories are subject to regulation and licensure requirements, and the healthcare industry is highly regulated; we may face substantial penalties, and our business activities may be impacted, if we fail to comply.\nOur TumorGraft products are performed in laboratories that are subject to state regulation and licensure requirements. Such regulation and requirements are subject to change, and may result in additional costs or delays in providing our products to our customers. In addition, the healthcare industry in general is highly regulated in the United States at both the federal and state levels. We seek to conduct our business in compliance with all applicable laws, but many of the laws and regulations potentially applicable to us are vague or unclear. These laws and regulations may be interpreted or applied by an authority in a way that could require us to make changes in our business. We may not be able to obtain all regulatory approvals needed to operate our business or sell our products. If we fail to do so, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties or fines or lose the authorizations necessary to operate our business, as well as incur additional liabilities from third parties. If any of these events happened, they could hurt our business and financial results.\nIf our laboratory facility is damaged or destroyed, we have a dispute with our landlord, or our mice population has a health crisis, our business would be negatively affected.\nWe currently utilize three laboratories in Baltimore, Maryland, Gaithersburg, Maryland and New York, New York to perform the work of our tumor studies and develop and bank our TumorGraft Technology Platform models. The lab in Baltimore is where a majority of the work is performed. If this facility were to be significantly damaged or destroyed, we could suffer a loss of our ongoing and future drug studies, as well as our TumorGraft bank. In addition, we lease the space for this laboratory from a third party. If we had a dispute with our landlord or otherwise could not utilize this space, it would take time to find and move to a new facility, which could negatively affect our results of operations. Finally, our TumorGraft operations depend on having a colony of live mice available. If this population experienced a health crisis, such as a virus, that would affect the success of both current POS and TOS business and future business as we would have to rebuild the population and repeat current TumorGrafts.\nWe have limited experience marketing and selling our products and may need to rely on third parties to successfully market and sell our products and generate revenues.\nWe need to continue building a marketing and sales function or enter into agreements with consultants to market our products. Our ability to gain market acceptance and generate revenues will be substantially dependent upon our ability to successfully market our products and/or enter into such agreements on favorable terms and to manage the efforts of those employees or service providers, as the case may be. If we are not successful in building market share, profitability, and our future prospects will not be realized.\nWe will continue to be dependent upon key employees.\nOur success, currently, is dependent upon the efforts of several full-time key employees, the loss of the services of one or more of which would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. We intend to continue to develop our management team and attract and retain qualified personnel in all functional areas to expand and grow our business. This may be difficult in the healthcare industry where competition for skilled personnel is intense.\nBecause our industry is very competitive and many of our competitors have substantially greater capital resources and more experience in research and development, we may not succeed in selling or increasing sales of our products and technologies.\nWe are engaged in a rapidly changing and highly competitive field. Potential competitors in the United States and abroad are numerous and include diagnostic companies and providers of clinical research services, most of which have substantially greater capital resources and more experience in research and development capabilities. Furthermore, new companies will likely enter our market from the United States and abroad, as scientific developments surrounding other cancer diagnostic services continue to accelerate in the multibillion dollar oncology marketplace. Our competitors may succeed in selling their products to our potential patient and physician customers more effectively than we sell our products. In addition, academic institutions, hospitals, governmental agencies, and other public and private research organizations also may conduct similar research, seek patent protection, and may develop and commercially introduce competing products or technologies on their own or through joint ventures. If one or more of our competitors succeeds in developing similar technologies and products that are more effective or successful than any of those that we currently sell or will develop, our results of operations will be significantly adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property, we may not be able to compete as effectively.\nIt is important in the healthcare industry to obtain patent and trade secret protection for new technologies, products, and processes. Our success will depend, in part, upon our ability to obtain, enjoy, and enforce protection for any products we have, develop or acquire under United States and foreign patent laws and other intellectual property laws, preserve the confidentiality of our trade secrets, and operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. Where appropriate, we will seek patent protection for certain aspects of our technology. However, while our TumorGraft Technology Platform is proprietary and requires significant know-how to both initiate and operate, it is not patented. It is, therefore, possible for competitors to develop other implantation procedures, or to discover the same procedures utilized by us, that could compete with us in our market.\nIt also is unclear whether efforts to secure our trade secrets will provide useful protection. While we will use reasonable efforts to protect our trade secrets, our employees or consultants may unintentionally or willfully disclose our proprietary information to competitors resulting in a loss of protection. Enforcing a claim that someone else illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets, like patent litigation, is expensive and time consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the United States are sometimes less willing to protect trade secrets. Finally, our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how.\nClaims by others that our products infringe their patents or other intellectual property rights could adversely affect our financial condition.\nThe healthcare industry has been characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. Patent applications are maintained in secrecy in the United States and also are maintained in secrecy outside the United States until the application is published. Accordingly, we can conduct only limited searches to determine whether our technology infringes the patents or patent applications of others. Any claims of patent infringement asserted by third parties would be time-consuming and could likely:\n\u00b7 result in costly litigation;\n\u00b7 divert the time and attention of our technical personnel and management;\n\u00b7 require us to develop non-infringing technology; or\n\u00b7 require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements.\nInvestment in our common stock may be diluted if we issue additional shares in the future.\nWe may issue additional shares of common stock, which will reduce shareholders\u2019 percentage ownership and may dilute per share value. Our Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of 200,000,000 shares of common stock. As of July 15, 2015, we had 107,561,338 shares of common stock issued and 104,425,102 shares outstanding. The future issuance of all or part of the remaining authorized common stock would result in substantial dilution in the percentage of the common stock held by existing shareholders. The issuance of common stock for future services, acquisitions, or other corporate actions may have the effect of diluting the value of the shares held by existing shareholders, and might have an adverse effect on any market for our common stock.\nAlthough we are not currently pursuing additional financing, to the extent that we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities or convertible debt securities, our stockholders may experience significant dilution. Sale of additional equity and/or convertible debt securities at prices below certain levels will trigger anti-dilution provisions with respect to certain securities we have previously sold. If additional funds are raised through a credit facility or the issuance of debt securities or preferred stock, lenders under the credit facility or holders of these debt securities or preferred stock would likely have rights that are senior to the rights of holders of our common stock, and any credit facility or additional securities could contain covenants that would restrict our operation.\nPotential future sales or issuances of our common stock to raise capital, or the perception that such sales could occur, could cause dilution to our current stockholders and the price of our common stock to fall.\nWe have historically supported our operations through the issuance of equity and expect to continue to do so in the future. Although we may not be successful in obtaining financing through equity sales on terms that are favorable to us, if at all, any such sales that do occur could result in substantial dilution to the interests of existing holders of our common stock. Additionally, the sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or other equity securities to any new investors, or the anticipation of such sales, could cause the trading price of our common stock to fall.\nThere is a limited trading market for our common stock, which may make it difficult for you to sell your shares and you may be subject to state securities laws for any resale.\nOur common stock is quoted on the over-the-counter or OTC Bulletin Board. Like many stocks quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board, trading in our common stock is thin and characterized by wide fluctuations in trading prices, due to many factors that may have little to do with our operations or business prospects. This volatility could depress the market price of our common stock for reasons unrelated to operating performance. Moreover, trading on the OTC Bulletin Board is often more sporadic and volatile than the trading on security exchanges like NASDAQ or New York Stock Exchange. Accordingly, you may have difficulty reselling your shares of our common stock in short time periods. In addition, unlike shares of companies listed on NASDAQ or New York Stock Exchange, re-sales of our shares are not exempt from state, or \u201cblue sky,\u201d securities laws. As a result, you may need to comply with or find an exemption from any registration requirements of state securities laws if you resell our shares.\nThe exercise of outstanding options and warrants may dilute current shareholders.\nAs of July 15, 2015, there were 49,366,102 warrants and options outstanding of which 42,429,162 were vested to purchase shares of our common stock. The exercise of a substantial number of these outstanding warrants and options could adversely affect our share price and dilute current shareholders.\nOur stock price is volatile.\nThe stock market in general and the market for biotechnology companies in particular have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. As a result of this volatility, investors may not be able to sell their common stock at or above the price they paid for it. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including:\n\u00b7 regulatory developments in the United States and foreign countries;\n\u00b7 variations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u00b7 changes in the healthcare payment system overseas to the degree we receive revenue from such healthcare systems overseas;\n\u00b7 announcements by us of significant acquisition, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u00b7 sales of significant shares of stock by large investors;\n\u00b7 intellectual property, product liability, or other litigation against us; and\n\u00b7 the other key facts described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nOur common stock may be deemed a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d which would make it more difficult for you to sell your shares.\nOur common stock is subject to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules adopted under Section 15(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. These rules require, among other things, that brokers who trade penny stocks complete certain documentation, make suitability inquiries of investors and provide investors with certain information concerning trading in the security, including a risk disclosure document and quote information under certain circumstances. Many brokers have decided not to trade penny stocks because of the requirements of the penny stock rules and, as a result, the number of broker-dealers willing to act as market makers in such securities is limited. If we remain subject to the penny stock rules for any significant period, it could have an adverse effect on the market, if any, for our common stock. Because our common stock is subject to the penny stock rules, you may find it more difficult to dispose of the shares of our common stock that you have purchased.\nCertain provisions of Delaware law, of our charter and bylaws and of our contractual agreements contain provisions that could delay and discourage takeover attempts and any attempts to replace our current management by shareholders.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, applicable provisions of Delaware corporate law, and our contractual agreements could make it difficult for or prevent a third party from acquiring control of us or changing our Board of Directors and management. These provisions include:\n\u00b7 requirements that our stockholders comply with advance notice procedures in order to nominate candidates for election to our Board of Directors or to place stockholders\u2019 proposals on the agenda for consideration at meetings of stockholders; and\n\u00b7 in connection with private placements of our stock in 2011, 2013 and 2015, we covenanted that we would not merge or consolidate with another company unless either the transaction and the trading volume of our stock met certain thresholds and qualifications or we obtained the consent of certain of the investors who purchased our stock in those private placements.\nInsiders own a significant amount of the outstanding common stock.\nInsiders own a significant amount of our outstanding common stock which could discourage takeover attempts. Our directors, affiliates and executive officers collectively beneficially own approximately 77% of our outstanding stock as of June 30, 2015.", "PERMNO": 12146, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "CSBR"}
