Risk Factors.\nIn addition to the other information contained in this report, you should consider carefully the following risk factors in evaluating us and our business before making an investment decision with respect to any shares of our common stock. This report contains certain statements that constitute \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act and Section 21E of the Exchange Act. These forward-looking statements are based on the beliefs of, as well as assumptions made by and information currently available to, our management. All statements which are not statements of historical fact are intended to be forward-looking statements. The forward-looking statements contained in this report reflect our or our management\u2019s current views and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions, including, but not limited to, those set forth in the following Risk Factors. Should one or more of those risks or uncertainties materialize or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, our actual results, performance or achievements in 2015 and beyond could differ materially from those expressed in, or implied by, those forward-looking statements.\nRisks Related to Recent Developments\nOur management has identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, which could, if not remediated, result in material misstatements in our future financial statements and may adversely affect our business and stock price. Our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (\u201cICFR\u201d), as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Exchange Act. As disclosed in Part II, Item 9A, \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as of December 31, 2014, our management identified material weaknesses in our ICFR related to:\n\u2022\nthe assessment of the completeness and accuracy of the data obtained from third parties related to the private education loans that are owned by variable interest entities that we were required to consolidate;\n\u2022\nthe aggregation of design and operating effectiveness control deficiencies relating to property, plant, and equipment, including logical access controls related to information systems relevant to property, plant, and equipment, the design of controls over the impairment of long-lived assets and the design and operation of review controls over accounting for leasehold improvements, which lead to individually immaterial adjustments; and\n\u2022\nthe aggregation of control deficiencies relating to design and operation of review controls over the financial close and reporting and income tax reporting processes, which lead to individually immaterial adjustments.\nA material weakness is defined as a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in ICFR, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As a result of the material weaknesses discussed above, our management concluded that our ICFR was not effective as of December 31, 2014. This is the second consecutive year that our management has concluded that our ICFR was not effective. As of December 31, 2013, our management concluded that our ICFR was not effective as a result of four material weaknesses, three of which were remediated as of December 31, 2014, but one of which remained unremediated as of December 31, 2014. The unremediated material weakness was the one related to data obtained from third parties related to private education loans, as noted above. Further, we cannot assure you that additional material weaknesses in our ICFR will not be identified in the future.\nAlthough we are implementing remedial measures designed to address the identified material weaknesses, if our remedial measures are insufficient to address the material weaknesses, or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our ICFR are discovered or occur in the future, our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements. These misstatements could result in additional restatements of our consolidated financial statements, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, lead to a default under our financing agreement, reduce our ability to obtain financing, increase the cost of any financing that we obtain or cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could lead to a decline in our stock price. The likelihood of any or all of those risks may be increased as a result of the unremediated material weakness and/or the fact that we have had ineffective ICFR in two consecutive years.\nAlthough we are working to remedy the ineffectiveness of our ICFR, there can be no assurance as to when the remediation plan will be fully implemented or the aggregate cost of implementation. Until our remediation plan is fully implemented and considered complete, our management will continue to devote significant time and attention to these efforts. If we do not complete our remediation in a timely fashion, or at all, or if our remediation plan is inadequate, there will continue to be an increased risk that we will be unable to timely file future periodic reports with the SEC and that our future consolidated financial statements could contain errors that will be undetected. For more information relating to our ICFR (and disclosure controls and procedures) and the remediation plan undertaken by us, see Part II, Item 9A, \u201cControls and Procedures.\u201d\nMatters relating to or arising from our review of accounting matters related to the PEAKS Program and the CUSO Program may adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows. As previously disclosed, a number of factors, including the SEC\u2019s investigation of us related to our actions and accounting associated with, among other things, the PEAKS Program and the CUSO Program, have led to us conducting additional analyses and reviews with respect to accounting matters related to those programs. As a result of such additional analyses and reviews, the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors concluded that the PEAKS Trust should have been consolidated in our consolidated financial statements beginning on February 28, 2013, and that our previously issued unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for each of the fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2013, June 30, 2013 and September 30, 2013 should be restated. Further, our more recent accounting analyses and reviews of the CUSO Program have resulted in our conclusion to consolidate the CUSO in our consolidated financial statements beginning on September 30, 2014. To date, we have incurred significant expenses related to legal, accounting and other professional services in connection with the SEC\u2019s investigation of us, the accounting analyses and the restatement and related matters, and may continue to incur significant additional expenses with regard to those matters and our remediation efforts. In addition, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as well as senior members of our finance and accounting departments, have spent substantial amounts of time and effort with regard to all of those matters. The significant amount of time and effort spent by our management team on those matters has diverted, and is expected to continue to divert, their attention from the operation of our business. The expenses incurred, and expected to be incurred, on those matters, and the diversion of the attention of the management team which has occurred and is expected to continue, have had, and could continue to have, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nThe New York Stock Exchange could commence procedures to delist our common stock. As a result of our failure to timely file this Annual Report on Form 10-K with the SEC, on March 16, 2015, we received a notice from the New York Stock Exchange (\u201cNYSE\u201d) that we were subject to the procedures set forth in the NYSE\u2019s listing standards related to late filings. In accordance with the NYSE\u2019s procedures, we had six months following March 16, 2015 to file this Annual Report on Form 10-K with the SEC. Although we have filed this Annual Report on Form 10-K with the SEC within the applicable period, the listing standards of the NYSE provide the NYSE with broad discretion regarding delisting matters. One of the factors described in the NYSE\u2019s listing standards that could lead to a company\u2019s delisting is the failure of the company to make timely, adequate and accurate disclosures of information to its shareholders and the investing public. We restated our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements as of and for each of the fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2013, June 30, 2013 and September 30, 2013. In addition, our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2014 (\u201c2014 First Quarter Form 10-Q\u201d), June 30, 2014 (\u201c2014 Second Quarter Form 10-Q\u201d) and September 30, 2014 (\u201c2014 Third Quarter Form 10-Q\u201d) were each filed after their respective due dates. Additionally, we will be filing our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2015 (\u201c2015 First Quarter Form 10-Q\u201d) after its due date, and therefore we will continue to be subject to the procedures set forth in the NYSE\u2019s listing standards related to late filings and subject to the risk of delisting. We cannot assure you that the NYSE will not commence delisting procedures with respect to our common stock as a result of those and other factors related to us. If the NYSE were to delist our common stock, the delisting could further:\n\u2022\ndecrease trading in our common stock;\n\u2022\nadversely affect the market liquidity of our common stock;\n\u2022\ndecrease the trading price of our common stock;\n\u2022\nincrease the volatility of our common stock price;\n\u2022\ndecrease analyst coverage of our common stock;\n\u2022\ndecrease investor demand and information available concerning trading prices and volume of our common stock;\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for investors to buy or sell our common stock; and\n\u2022\nharm our ability to obtain financing on acceptable terms.\nOur failure to prepare and timely file our periodic reports with the SEC limits our access to the public markets to raise debt or equity capital, and could have negative consequences related to our financing agreement. We did not file our 2013 Form 10-K, our 2014 First Quarter Form 10-Q, our 2014 Second Quarter Form 10-Q, our 2014 Third Quarter Form 10-Q and this Annual Report on Form 10-K within the timeframes required by the SEC. We also have not yet filed our 2015 First Quarter Form 10-Q, and therefore it is delinquent. As a result of our late filings, we may be limited in our ability to access the public markets to raise debt or equity capital, which could prevent us from pursuing transactions or implementing business strategies that we believe would be beneficial to our business. We are ineligible to use shorter and less costly filings, such as Form S-3, to register our securities for sale for a period of 12 months following the month in which we regain compliance with our SEC reporting obligations. Further, pursuant to the Financing Agreement (as defined below), we must provide to our lenders our annual and quarterly financial information of the type required to be filed with our periodic reports with the SEC within 90 and 45 days, respectively, after the end of the relevant period, or certain monthly financial information within 30 days after the end of each month, subject to the extension described below.\nOn December 4, 2014, we entered into a financing agreement (the \u201cOriginal Financing Agreement\u201d) with Cerberus Business Finance, LLC (\u201cCerberus\u201d), as administrative agent and collateral agent, the lenders party thereto and certain of our subsidiaries. On December 23, 2014, we entered into Amendment No. 1 to Financing Agreement (\u201cAmendment No. 1\u201d), on March 17, 2015, we entered into Amendment No. 2 to Financing Agreement (\u201cAmendment No. 2\u201d) and on May 26, 2015, we entered into a Limited Consent to Financing Agreement (the \u201cFA Consent\u201d). The Original Financing Agreement, as amended by Amendment No. 1 and Amendment No. 2 and including the FA Consent, is referred to herein as the \u201cFinancing Agreement.\u201d The FA Consent provides for an extension to June 15, 2015 of the deadline by which we are required to deliver to the lenders our financial statements and related information for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2015. If we are not able to deliver our financial statements for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2015 by June 15, 2015, or for future periods by the applicable due dates, then we would be in breach of the Financing Agreement, which could give rise to material adverse consequences to us. See \u201c-Restrictive covenants in the Financing Agreement restrict or prohibit our ability to engage in or enter into a variety of transactions, which could adversely restrict our financial and operating flexibility, and any default by us under the Financing Agreement could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and ability to comply with our obligations.\u201d\nAs a result of the PEAKS Consolidation, our consolidated financial statements are materially different from those that we previously issued, which could have negative implications for our Financing Agreement and guarantee obligations and regulatory compliance. Prior to the PEAKS Consolidation, the PEAKS Trust was not included in our consolidated financial statements. As a result of the PEAKS Consolidation, beginning on February 28, 2013, our consolidated financial statements are substantially different from the consolidated financial statements that we would present, if we were not required to consolidate the PEAKS Trust. We cannot assure you that the financial impact of the PEAKS Consolidation on our consolidated financial statements in future periods will not violate the covenants under the Financing Agreement. We may not be able to obtain amendments to, or waivers of, those covenants. The PEAKS Consolidation also negatively impacted our compliance with the ED\u2019s financial responsibility measurements, primarily our institutions\u2019 composite score and our compliance with the financial requirements of certain SAs. The financial impact of the PEAKS Consolidation on our consolidated financial statements in future periods could also negatively impact our compliance with those measurements and requirements in the future. See \u201c-Risks Related to Our Highly Regulated Industry - We may be subject to sanctions, including, without limitation, an increase in the amount of the ED Letter of Credit and other limitations in order to continue our campuses\u2019 participation in Title IV Programs, state authorization and accreditation, if we or our campuses do not meet the financial standards of the ED, SAs or ACs,\u201d for a discussion of the impact of the PEAKS Consolidation on our consolidated financial statements. Further, the PEAKS Consolidation negatively impacted the financial metrics to which we are subject under the private education loan programs under which we have provided guarantees, resulting in materially increased payment amounts. The financial impact of the PEAKS Consolidation on our consolidated financial statements in future periods could negatively impact our compliance with those financial metrics in the future, resulting in materially increased payment amounts and/or the loss of our protective rights under those programs. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nThe CUSO Consolidation could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements and our compliance with covenants and metrics to which we are subject. Prior to September 30, 2014, the CUSO was not included in our consolidated financial statements because we concluded we were not the primary beneficiary of the CUSO prior to that time. The CUSO Consolidation results in a different presentation in our consolidated financial statements of our transactions with the CUSO. We cannot assure you that the CUSO Consolidation, in combination with other factors, will not have a material negative impact in future periods on our ability to comply with our covenants under the Financing Agreement, the ED\u2019s financial responsibility measurements, the financial requirements of the SAs or the financial metrics to which we are subject under the CUSO RSA and the PEAKS Guarantee (as defined below), which could result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows. See \u201c-Risks Related to Our Highly Regulated Industry - We may be subject to sanctions, including, without limitation, an increase in the amount of the ED Letter of Credit and other limitations in order to continue our campuses\u2019 participation in Title IV Programs, state authorization and accreditation, if we or our campuses do not meet the financial standards of the ED, SAs or ACs,\u201d for a discussion of the impact of the CUSO Consolidation on our consolidated financial statements.\nRestrictive covenants in the Financing Agreement restrict or prohibit our ability to engage in or enter into a variety of transactions, which could adversely restrict our financial and operating flexibility, and any default by us under the Financing Agreement could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and ability to comply with our obligations. The Financing Agreement contains a number of covenants that limit our ability to take certain actions. In particular, the Financing Agreement limits the ability of us and certain of our subsidiaries (the \u201cGuarantors\u201d and together with us, the \u201cLoan Parties\u201d) to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\nincur or create liens;\n\u2022\nmake investments;\n\u2022\ndispose of assets;\n\u2022\npay dividends; and\n\u2022\nmake prepayments on existing indebtedness.\nThe Financing Agreement also requires us to maintain compliance with a total leverage ratio and a fixed charge coverage ratio, as well as with certain educational regulatory measurements. In determining our compliance with the leverage ratio covenant, we are required to include the PEAKS Senior Debt and the CUSO Secured Borrowing Obligation (defined below) in the amount of our indebtedness, and therefore the amount of such liabilities could negatively impact our ability to comply with the leverage ratio covenant in the Financing Agreement. In addition, we are required to limit our annual payments with respect to the CUSO Program and the PEAKS Program. Further, pursuant to the Financing Agreement, we must provide the lenders with our quarterly financial statements within 45 days after the end of each fiscal quarter and our annual, audited financial statements within 90 days after the end of each fiscal year, except that, pursuant to Amendment No. 2, the deadline by which we must provide our financial statements related to the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014 was extended to May 31, 2015 and pursuant to the FA Consent, the deadline by which we must provide our financial statements related to the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2015 was extended to June 15, 2015. If we are not able to deliver our financial statements for the fiscal quarter ended March 31, 2015 by June 15, 2015, or for future periods by the applicable due dates, we would have to seek a waiver or an additional amendment to the Financing Agreement, which we may not be able to obtain on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we cannot obtain a waiver or amendment, the failure to timely deliver our financial statements would be an event of default under the Financing Agreement.\nAny or all of the covenants under the Financing Agreement could have a material adverse effect on our business by limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, merger and acquisition or other corporate opportunities. The restrictions could limit our ability to plan for, or react to, changes in market conditions or to finance future operations or capital needs. Further, our ability to comply with the covenants in the Financing Agreement may be affected by events beyond our control, including without limitation worsening economic or business conditions, unfavorable regulatory or judicial determinations, unfavorable legislation, the impact of the Consolidations or other events, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with the covenants.\nOur ability to make required payments on our indebtedness under the Financing Agreement is dependent on our ability to generate cash flows in the future. This, to some extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. We cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flows in amounts sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs. Additionally, there is an excess cash flow mandatory prepayment provision in the Financing Agreement that will also limit our ability to utilize excess cash flows for other purposes in our business or to respond to market opportunities.\nIn addition, based on our current estimates, we believe that we may make guarantee payments of approximately $29.8 million in 2015 under our guarantee under the PEAKS Program. This guarantee consists of our guarantee of the payment of the principal, interest and, prior to February 2013, certain call premiums owed on the senior debt issued by the PEAKS Trust in the aggregate principal amount of $300.0 million (the \u201cPEAKS Senior Debt\u201d) to investors, the administrative fees and expenses of the PEAKS Trust and a minimum required ratio of assets of the PEAKS Trust to outstanding PEAKS Senior Debt (the \u201cPEAKS Guarantee\u201d). The $29.8 million estimated payment amount would have exceeded the annual payment limitation of $20.0 million related to payments under the PEAKS Program contained in the Original Financing Agreement covenant, but the covenant was modified in Amendment No. 2. However, we may be required to make payments under the PEAKS Program and/or the CUSO RSA in 2015 or future years that exceed our current estimates and the modified guarantee payment limitation amount. In such event, we would have to seek a waiver or an additional amendment to the Financing Agreement, which we may not be able to obtain on terms acceptable to us or at all. If we cannot obtain a waiver or amendment, the payment of amounts under the PEAKS Guarantee in excess of the stated limitation would be an event of default under the Financing Agreement.\nThe Financing Agreement provides for a number of potential events of default, including violations of the covenants or other provisions in the Financing Agreement or related loan documents, a failure to pay or a default under the PEAKS Program or the CUSO RSA, certain delays in our receipt of Title IV Program funds, and the occurrence of certain regulatory events. In the case of an event of default, the lenders could declare the senior secured term loans under the Financing Agreement (the \u201cTerm Loans\u201d) then outstanding to be immediately due and payable in full. We may not be able to repay outstanding Term Loans, in which case the lenders would be entitled to recourse against the collateral security that we and the other Loan Parties have provided, to obtain payment of amounts we owe. The collateral security consists of substantially all of the Loan Parties\u2019 assets, including a pledge of the equity of the Guarantors and our other subsidiaries, and a mortgage on the Loan Parties\u2019 owned real estate. In addition, even if we were able to repay the outstanding borrowings under the Financing Agreement, the use of funds to make that repayment would have a material adverse effect on our cash position and would significantly reduce the amount of funds available to us to satisfy our obligations under the PEAKS Guarantee and the CUSO RSA (collectively, the \u201cRSAs\u201d), which could result in a default by us under those arrangements. Any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business, ability to meet our obligations, ability to comply with regulatory requirements, financial condition and cash flows.\nA default by us under the Financing Agreement could also lead to a determination by:\n\u2022\nthe ED that our institutions are not financially responsible;\n\u2022\nthe ACs that our institutions are not financially stable; and/or\n\u2022\none or more of the SAs that our institutions do not satisfy the SAs\u2019 financial requirements.\nIf the ED, ACs and/or SAs determines that our institutions do not satisfy the applicable financial requirements for that reason, and given the sanctions that have already been imposed on our institutions for other reasons, these agencies could:\n\u2022\nimpose monetary fines or penalties on our campuses;\n\u2022\nterminate or limit our campuses\u2019 operations or ability to award credentials;\n\u2022\nrestrict or revoke our campuses\u2019 accreditation;\n\u2022\nlimit, terminate or suspend our campuses\u2019 eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs or state financial aid programs;\n\u2022\nrequire our campuses to repay funds received under Title IV Programs or state financial aid programs;\n\u2022\nrequire us to post new letters of credit or increase the amounts of or extend the duration of existing letters of credit;\n\u2022\nincrease the level of heightened cash monitoring to which our institutions are already subject by the ED;\n\u2022\ntransfer our institutions from the ED\u2019s heightened cash monitoring system of receiving Title IV Program funds to its reimbursement system, which would significantly delay our institutions\u2019 receipt of Title IV Program funds;\n\u2022\nplace a maximum limit on the amount of Title IV funding that our institutions could receive or a maximum limit on the number of students to whom our institutions could award Title IV program funds;\n\u2022\ndeny applications for our institutions to obtain Title IV eligibility for new educational programs or new campuses or educational sites; and\n\u2022\nsubject us or our campuses to other penalties.\nEach of these sanctions could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and impose significant operating restrictions on us. If any of our campuses lost its state authorization, the campus would be unable to offer postsecondary education and we would be forced to close the campus. If all or substantially all of our campuses lost their eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs, we likely would not be able to continue to operate our business.\nThe recent filing of an enforcement action by the SEC against us, our CEO and our CFO could result in the ED or any of the SAs or ACs imposing additional sanctions on our institutions. On May 12, 2015, the SEC filed a civil enforcement action against us, our Chief Executive Officer and our Chief Financial Officer (the \u201cSEC Litigation\u201d). See Note 15 - Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a further discussion of the SEC Litigation. Based on the allegations in the SEC\u2019s complaint, combined with other regulatory matters our institutions are facing by the ED, the SAs, the ACs and other federal and state agencies, it is possible that the ED or any of the SAs or ACs might impose additional sanctions against us. The ED, the SAs and the ACs have a wide range of sanctions and penalties that they can impose on institutions. See \u201c- Risks Related to Our Highly Regulated Industry - Failure of our campuses to comply with the extensive regulatory requirements for school operations could result in financial penalties, restrictions on our operations, loss of federal and state financial aid funding for our students or loss of our authorization to operate our campuses,\u201d for a discussion of sanctions that the ED, the SAs and the ACs could impose on our institutions as a result of the SEC Litigation.\nOn May 20, 2015, the ED informed us that, based on our institutions\u2019 current reporting status to the ED and due to the SEC\u2019s filing of its complaint in the SEC Litigation, the ED was requiring us to comply with additional notification requirements in order for the ED to more closely monitor our institutions\u2019 ongoing participation in the Title IV Programs. The additional requirements are that we must submit to the ED:\n\u2022\nevery two weeks, a thirteen-week projected cash flow statement that includes disclosures concerning significant transactions, important financial transactions, planned school closures, anticipated new program offerings, and other matters; and\n\u2022\nevery month, a roster of students, by campus, that includes information on each student\u2019s program of study, program start date and anticipated graduation date, enrollment status, and individual contact information.\nWe intend to compile the requested information and submit it to the ED according to the schedule specified by the ED. We cannot assure you that the ED will not impose further sanctions on us in light of the SEC Litigation and other matters.\nRisks Related to Our Highly Regulated Industry\nFailure of our campuses to comply with the extensive regulatory requirements for school operations could result in financial penalties, restrictions on our operations, loss of federal and state financial aid funding for our students or loss of our authorization to operate our campuses. To participate in Title IV Programs, an institution must receive and maintain authorization by the appropriate SAs, be accredited by an AC recognized by the ED and be certified as an eligible institution by the ED. As a result, our ITT Technical Institute and DWC campuses are subject to extensive regulation by the ED, SAs and ACs, which cover the vast majority of our operations. The ED, SAs and ACs periodically revise their requirements and modify their interpretations of existing requirements. We cannot predict with certainty how all of the requirements applied by these agencies will be interpreted or implemented or whether all of our campuses will be able to comply with all of the requirements in the future.\nIf our campuses failed to comply with any of these regulatory requirements, these agencies could:\n\u2022\nimpose monetary fines or penalties on our campuses;\n\u2022\nterminate or limit our campuses\u2019 operations or ability to award credentials;\n\u2022\nrestrict or revoke our campuses\u2019 accreditation;\n\u2022\nlimit, terminate or suspend our campuses\u2019 eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs or state financial aid programs;\n\u2022\nrequire our campuses to repay funds received under Title IV Programs or state financial aid programs;\n\u2022\nrequire us to post new letters or credit or increase the amount of or extend the duration of the letter of credit that we have already posted with the ED;\n\u2022\nincrease the level of heightened cash monitoring to which our institutions are already subject by the ED;\n\u2022\ntransfer our institutions from the ED\u2019s heightened cash monitoring system of receiving Title IV Program funds to its reimbursement system, which would significantly delay our institutions\u2019 receipt of Title IV Program funds;\n\u2022\nplace a maximum limit on the amount of Title IV funding that our institutions could receive or a maximum limit on the number of students to whom our institutions could award Title IV program funds;\n\u2022\ndeny applications for our institutions to obtain Title IV eligibility for new educational programs or new campuses; and\n\u2022\nsubject us or our campuses to other civil or criminal penalties.\nSee \u201cBusiness - Highly Regulated Industry,\u201d for a discussion of the sanctions imposed on us by the ED for our failure to submit our 2013 audited consolidated financial statements and Compliance Audits to the ED by the regulatory deadline, and by our Florida SA as a result of its determination that our 13 campuses in Florida are not financially stable. The sanctions imposed by the ED and our Florida SA or any other sanctions described above that could be imposed by any agencies could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and impose significant operating restrictions on us.\nIf any of our campuses lost its state authorization, the campus would be unable to offer postsecondary education and we would be forced to close the campus.\nIf any of our campuses lost its accreditation, it would lose its eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs and, in some states, its ability to operate. If we could not arrange for alternative financing sources for the students attending a campus that lost its eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs, we could be forced to close that campus. Closing multiple campuses could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. If all or substantially all of our campuses lost their eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs, we likely would not be able to continue to operate our business. See \u201cBusiness - Highly Regulated Industry.\u201d\nThe following are some of the specific risk factors related to our highly regulated industry:\nOur institutions\u2019 failure to submit their 2013 audited consolidated financial statements and Compliance Audits to the ED by the due date resulted in sanctions imposed by the ED on our institutions that include, among other things, our institutions having to post a letter of credit, being placed on heightened cash monitoring and being provisionally certified. Our institutions are subject to extensive regulation by the ED. One of the ED\u2019s regulations applicable to our institutions is that each institution must submit to the ED on an annual basis its audited, consolidated financial statements and a Compliance Audit, in each case with respect to a fiscal year within six months of the end of the fiscal year. Our institutions did not submit their 2013 audited consolidated financial statements and Compliance Audits to the ED by the June 30, 2014 due date and, as a result, the ED determined on August 21, 2014 that our institutions were not financially responsible. Based on this determination, the ED, among other things:\n\u2022\nrequired our institutions to submit a letter of credit payable to the ED in the amount of $79.7 million (the \u201cED Letter of Credit\u201d);\n\u2022\nplaced our institutions on heightened cash monitoring by the ED, instead of the ED\u2019s standard advance payment method;\n\u2022\nprovisionally certified our institutions to participate in Title IV Programs;\n\u2022\nrequires our institutions to provide the ED with information about certain oversight and financial events, as described further below;\n\u2022\nrequires us to be able to demonstrate to the ED that, for our two most recent fiscal years, we were current on our debt payments and our institutions have met all of their financial obligations, pursuant to the ED\u2019s standards; and\n\u2022\ncould require our institutions, in future years, to submit their audited financial statements and Compliance Audits to the ED earlier than six months following the end of their fiscal year.\nWe caused the ED Letter of Credit to be issued on October 31, 2014 and submitted to the ED. The term of the ED Letter of Credit is for a period that ends on November 4, 2019. We will be required to adjust the amount of the ED Letter of Credit annually to 10% of the Title IV Program funds received by our institutions in the immediately preceding fiscal year. The ED may terminate our institutions\u2019 eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs, in which case we likely would not be able to continue to operate our business.\nUnder heightened cash monitoring (\u201cHCM\u201d), before any of our institutions can request or draw down Title IV Program funds from the ED, the institution must:\n\u2022\nmake disbursements to students and parents for the amount of Title IV Program funds that those students and parents are eligible to receive; and\n\u2022\ncompile borrower-level records with respect to the disbursement of Title IV Program funds to each student and parent.\nOnce the HCM requirements are satisfied, our institutions may request or draw down Title IV Program funds from the ED in an amount equal to the actual disbursements made by our institutions. Our institutions will be subject to HCM until at least November 4, 2019. Although we have implemented procedures to address the HCM requirements, and believe that compliance with those requirements will not impact the timing of our institutions\u2019 receipt of Title IV Program funds by more than one business day, we cannot assure you that there will not be future delays in our institutions\u2019 receipt of Title IV Program funds or that our institutions will not request or draw down Title IV Program funds from the ED before the HCM requirements are satisfied. If any of our institutions request or draw down Title IV Program funds from the ED before the HCM requirements are satisfied, the ED could impose additional sanctions on our institutions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including, among other things:\n\u2022\nmonetary fines or penalties;\n\u2022\nlimiting, terminating or suspending our institutions\u2019 eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs; and/or\n\u2022\ntransferring our institutions from the HCM method of receiving Title IV Program funds to the ED\u2019s reimbursement system, which would significantly delay our institutions\u2019 receipt of Title IV Program funds.\nAny significant delay in our institutions\u2019 receipt of Title IV Program funds could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and could cause us to be in default of the Financing Agreement. Depending on the length of the delay, we cannot assure you that we would be able to continue to operate our business in such an event. See also \u201c-Restrictive covenants in the Financing Agreement restrict or prohibit our ability to engage in or enter into a variety of transactions, which could adversely restrict our financial and operating flexibility, and any default by us under the Financing Agreement could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and ability to comply with our obligations.\u201d\nOur institutions will remain provisionally certified by the ED to participate in Title IV Programs until at least November 4, 2019. Any institution provisionally certified by the ED must apply for and receive approval by the ED for any substantial change, before the institution can award, disburse or distribute Title IV Program funds based on the substantial change. Substantial changes generally include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe establishment of an additional location;\n\u2022\nan increase in the level of academic offering beyond those listed in the institution\u2019s Eligibility and Certification Approval Report with the ED;\n\u2022\nan addition of any non-degree program or short-term training program; or\n\u2022\nan addition of a degree program by a proprietary institution.\nIf an institution applies for the ED\u2019s approval of a substantial change, the institution must demonstrate that it has the financial and administrative resources necessary to assure the institution\u2019s continued compliance with the ED\u2019s standards of financial responsibility and administrative capability. We may be unable to obtain the required approvals from the ED for any new campuses or any new program offerings, or to obtain those approvals in a timely manner. For example, in December 2014, the ED disapproved our application to offer four new degree programs at the ITT Technical Institutes due to administrative capability issues reported in recent compliance audits and ED program reviews, and in March 2015, the ED disapproved two of eight new degree programs that we applied to offer at DWC also due to administrative capability issues. If we are unable to obtain the required approvals from the ED for any new campuses or any new program offerings, or to obtain those approvals in a timely manner, our ability to operate the new campuses or offer new programs as planned would be impaired, which could have a material adverse effect on our expansion plans. See \u201c- We cannot operate new campuses or offer new programs, if they are not timely authorized by our regulators, and we may have to repay Title IV Program funds disbursed to students enrolled at any of those locations or in any of those programs, if we do not obtain prior authorization,\u201d and \u201c- Failure by one or more of our institutions to satisfy the ED\u2019s administrative capability requirements could result in financial penalties, limitations on the institution\u2019s participation in the Title IV Programs, or loss of the institution\u2019s eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs.\u201d\nWe are required to provide information to the ED about any of the following events within 10 days of its occurrence:\n\u2022\nany adverse action, including probation or similar action, taken against any of our institutions by its AC, any of its SAs or any federal agency;\n\u2022\nany event that causes us to realize any liability that was noted as a contingent liability in our most recent audited financial statements;\n\u2022\nany violation by us of any loan agreement;\n\u2022\nany failure by us to make a payment in accordance with our debt obligations that results in a creditor filing suit to recover funds under those obligations;\n\u2022\nany withdrawal of our shareholders\u2019 equity or net assets by any means, including the declaration of a dividend;\n\u2022\nany extraordinary loss by us, as defined under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 30; or\n\u2022\nany filing of a petition by us for relief in bankruptcy court.\nOur notice to the ED of the occurrence of any of the above events must include the details of the circumstances surrounding the event and, if applicable, the steps we have taken, or plan to take, to resolve the issue. If we fail to notify the ED within the 10 day reporting period, the ED may impose additional sanctions upon us that could negatively impact our provisional certification.\nOn May 20, 2015, the ED informed us that, based on our institutions\u2019 current reporting status to the ED and due to the SEC\u2019s filing of its complaint in the SEC Litigation, the ED was requiring us to comply with additional notification requirements in order for the ED to more closely monitor our institutions\u2019 ongoing participation in the Title IV Programs. The additional requirements are that we must submit to the ED:\n\u2022\nevery two weeks, a thirteen-week projected cash flow statement that includes disclosures concerning significant transactions, important financial transactions, planned school closures, anticipated new program offerings, and other matters; and\n\u2022\nevery month, a roster of students, by campus, that includes information on each student\u2019s program of study, program start date and anticipated graduation date, enrollment status, and individual contact information.\nWe intend to compile the requested information and submit it to the ED according to the schedule specified by the ED. We cannot assure you that the ED will not impose further sanctions on us in light of the SEC Litigation and other matters.\nThe sanctions imposed on us by the ED described above could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to meet our contractual and regulatory obligations. Further, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain any required increases in the amount of the ED Letter of Credit. Our provision of the cash required by the issuing bank to collateralize the ED Letter of Credit and the other outstanding letters of credit has had, and will continue to have, a material adverse effect on our liquidity, and significantly reduced the amount of cash that we will have available for other purposes, including to satisfy our future payment obligations under the RSAs. The fact that a significant amount of our cash is being held in connection with the ED Letter of Credit could also negatively affect our ability to satisfy the financial metrics of the ED, SAs and ACs to which we are subject. See \u201c-We have a significant amount of cash held as collateral for outstanding letters of credit, which has a continuing material adverse effect on our cash flows and liquidity.\u201d\nIf our institutions were to fail to timely submit their 2014 audited consolidated financial statements and Compliance Audits to the ED by the 2015 due date, this could result in more severe sanctions being imposed on our institutions by the ED, SAs and ACs. If our institutions were to fail to timely submit their 2014 audited consolidated financial statements and Compliance Audits to the ED by the June 30, 2015 due date, we could face additional sanctions by the ED and other regulatory agencies. For example, the ED could require that we increase the amount of the ED Letter of Credit, could extend the time period for which the ED Letter of Credit must remain in effect, and could increase the level of our existing HCM for Title IV funds or place our institutions on the reimbursement system, either of which would significantly delay our institutions\u2019 receipt of Title IV Program funds. Any significant delay in our institutions\u2019 receipt of Title IV Program funds could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and could cause us to be in default of the Financing Agreement. Depending on the length of the delay, we cannot assure you that we would be able to continue to operate our business in such an event. See also \u201c-Restrictive covenants in the Financing Agreement restrict or prohibit our ability to engage in or enter into a variety of transactions, which could adversely restrict our financial and operating flexibility, and any default by us under the Financing Agreement could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and ability to comply with our obligations.\u201d Since the ED\u2019s regulations and policies do not envision institutions submitting their audited financial statements and Compliance Audits late two years in a row, they do not prescribe specific penalties if that situation should occur. However, the ED has a wide range of sanctions available to it for institutions that commit what the ED determines are significant violations of the ED regulations, and therefore the ED could attempt to impose additional sanctions on our institutions, including, for example, concluding that our institutions lack \u201cadministrative capability\u201d under the ED\u2019s regulations, which could lead to:\n\u2022\nthe imposition of an administrative fine or penalty;\n\u2022\na requirement to repay Title IV funds;\n\u2022\nplacing a maximum limit on the amount of Title IV funding that our institutions could receive or a maximum limit on the number of students to whom we can award Title IV funds;\n\u2022\ndenying applications for our institutions to obtain Title IV eligibility for new educational programs or new campuses or educational sites;\n\u2022\ntransferring our institutions to a stricter form of HCM or the reimbursement system;\n\u2022\ninitiating additional program reviews or other compliance reviews at our institutions;\n\u2022\nmore closely scrutinizing our 90/10 calculations, including the impact of our private loan programs on those calculations;\n\u2022\nplacing other limits on or terminating our institutions\u2019 eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs; and\n\u2022\nother sanctions.\nIn addition, the ACs and SAs to which we are subject could impose additional penalties on our institutions, which may vary from state to state, but which could include in some states such sanctions as having to post an additional letter of credit or surety bond with the state, limiting our institutions\u2019 ability to add new programs or open new campuses, initiating more frequent reviews of our institutions including on-site visits, requiring our institutions to submit additional information and reports, or suspending or terminating our campuses\u2019 authority to operate. Any of the sanctions by the ED, SAs or ACs could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and impose significant operating restrictions on us.\nAction by the U.S. Congress to revise the laws governing the federal student financial aid programs or reduce funding for those programs could reduce our student population and increase our costs of operation. Political and budgetary concerns significantly affect Title IV Programs. The U.S. Congress (\u201cCongress\u201d) enacted the HEA to be reauthorized on a periodic basis, which most recently occurred in 2008. Congress has begun the legislative process for reauthorizing the HEA, but it is unclear at this time if the reauthorization will be completed in 2015, 2016, or later. Until the reauthorization process is completed, the current provisions of the HEA will remain in effect, unless Congress amends any specific provisions.\nIn addition, Congress can change the laws affecting Title IV Programs in the annual federal appropriations bills and other laws it enacts between the HEA reauthorizations. We cannot predict all of the changes that Congress will ultimately make. Since a significant percentage of our revenue is indirectly derived from Title IV Programs, any action by Congress that significantly reduces Title IV Program funding or the ability of our campuses or students to participate in Title IV Programs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf one or more of our ITT Technical Institute or DWC campuses lost its eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs, or if Congress significantly reduced the amount of available Title IV Program funding, we would try to arrange or provide alternative sources of financial aid for the students at the affected campuses. It is unlikely that private organizations would be willing to provide loans to students attending those campuses or that the interest rate and other terms of those loans would be as favorable as for Title IV Program loans. If all or substantially all of our campuses lost their eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs, we likely would not be able to continue to operate our business.\nLegislative action may also increase our administrative costs and burden and require us to modify our practices in order for our campuses to comply fully with the legislative requirements, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOne or more of our institutions may lose its eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs, if its federal student loan cohort default rates are too high. Under the HEA, an institution may lose its eligibility to participate in some or all Title IV Programs, if the rates at which the institution\u2019s students default on their federal student loans exceed specified percentages. The ED calculates these rates for each institution on an annual basis, based on the number of students who have defaulted, not the dollar amount of such defaults. Each institution that participated in the FFEL program and/or FDL program receives a FFEL/FDL cohort default rate for each federal fiscal year (\u201cFFY\u201d) based on defaulted FFEL and FDL program loans. A FFY is October 1 through September 30. The ED calculates an institution\u2019s annual cohort default rate as the rate at which borrowers scheduled to begin repayment on their loans in one FFY default on those loans by the end of the second succeeding FFY (\u201cThree-Year CDR\u201d).\nThe ED began calculating a Three-Year CDR for each institution for FFY 2009, and the ED issued those FFY 2009 Three-Year CDRs in 2012. If an institution\u2019s Three-Year CDR is:\n\u2022\n30% or greater for three consecutive FFYs, the institution loses eligibility to participate in the FDL program and the Pell program for the remainder of the FFY in which the ED determines that the institution has lost its eligibility and for the two subsequent FFYs; or\n\u2022\ngreater than 40% for one FFY, the institution loses eligibility to participate in the FDL programs for the remainder of the FFY in which the ED determines that the institution has lost its eligibility and for the two subsequent FFYs.\nIn addition, the ED may place an institution on provisional certification status, if the institution\u2019s official Three-Year CDR is 30% or greater for at least two of the three most recent FFYs. The ED may more closely review an institution that is provisionally certified, if it applies for approval to open a new location or offer a new program of study that requires approval, or makes some other significant change affecting its eligibility. See \u201c-Our institutions\u2019 failure to submit their 2013 audited financial statements and Compliance Audits to the ED by the due date resulted in sanctions imposed by the ED on our institutions that include, among other things, our institutions having to post a letter of credit, being placed on heightened cash monitoring and being provisionally certified,\u201d for further information concerning the impact on an institution of being placed on provisional certification by the ED.\nThe following table sets forth the average of our institutions\u2019 Three-Year CDRs for the FFYs indicated, as reported by the ED:\n(a) The most recent year for which the ED has issued preliminary Three-Year CDRs. The ED\u2019s regulations afford institutions the opportunity to challenge or correct their draft Three-Year CDRs before those rates are official.\n(b) The most recent year for which the ED has published official Three-Year CDRs.\n(c) Reduced by the ED from 34.2% as a result of an uncorrected data adjustment.\nWe believe that the higher Three-Year CDR average for FFY 2010 compared to the official Three-Year CDR average for FFY 2011 and the preliminary Three-Year CDR average for FFY 2012 was primarily due to the servicing on the FFEL program loans that were purchased by the ED from the lenders (the \u201cPurchased Loans\u201d) during 2009 and 2010. The Purchased Loans were initially serviced by the FFEL program lenders that made those loans, until the Purchased Loans were sold to the ED. Upon receipt of the Purchased Loans, the ED transferred the servicing of those loans to the servicer of the FDL program loans. Shortly thereafter, the ED replaced the servicer of the FDL program loans with four different servicers, and servicing of the Purchased Loans was distributed among the new servicers of the FDL program loans. We believe that the changes in the servicers of the Purchased Loans had a negative impact on the servicing of those loans, which could have resulted in a higher Three-Year CDR average with respect to those loans. We appealed the ITT Technical Institute institutions\u2019 official Three-Year CDRs for FFY 2009 on the basis that those Purchased Loans were improperly serviced. We have not yet received the ED\u2019s final determination of the ITT Technical Institute institutions\u2019 Three-Year CDRs for FFY 2009 in response to our loan servicing appeal, but we anticipate that the result of this appeal will not significantly change the average Three-Year CDR for FFY 2009 shown above. Further, because none of our institutions had a Three-Year CDR for FFY 2010 of 30% or greater, the fact that the Three-Year CDRs for FFY 2009 was greater than 30% does not impact our institutions\u2019 eligibility to participate in the FDL program or the Pell program. We did not appeal the ITT Technical Institute institutions\u2019 official Three-Year CDRs for FFYs 2010 or 2011, and do not intend to appeal for FFY 2012.\nAn institution can appeal its loss of eligibility that is based on exceeding one of the Three-Year CDR thresholds described above. During the pendency of any such appeal, the institution remains eligible to participate in the FDL and Pell programs. If an institution continues its participation in the FDL programs during the pendency of any such appeal and the appeal is unsuccessful, the institution must pay the ED the amount of interest, special allowance, reinsurance and any related payments paid by the ED (or which the ED is obligated to pay) with respect to the FDL program loans made to the institution\u2019s students or their parents that would not have been made if the institution had not continued its participation (the \u201cDirect Costs\u201d). If a substantial number of our campuses were subject to losing their eligibility to participate in the FDL and Pell programs because of our institutions\u2019 high Three-Year CDRs, the potential amount of the Direct Costs for which we would be liable if our appeals were unsuccessful would prevent us from continuing some or all of the affected campuses\u2019 participation in the FDL program during the pendency of those appeals, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCurrent and future economic conditions in the United States could also adversely affect our institutions\u2019 Three-Year CDRs. Increases in interest rates, declines in individuals\u2019 incomes and job losses for our students and graduates or their parents have contributed to, and could continue to contribute to, higher default rates on student loans.\nThe servicing and collection efforts of student loan servicers help to lower our institutions\u2019 Three-Year CDRs. We supplement their efforts by attempting to contact students to advise them of their responsibilities and any deferment, forbearance or alternative repayment plans for which they may qualify.\nIf any of our institutions lost its eligibility to participate in FDL and Pell programs and we could not arrange for alternative financing sources for the students attending the campuses in that institution, we would probably have to close those campuses, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. If all or substantially all of our campuses lost their eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs, we likely would not be able to continue to operate our business.\nIf the ED\u2019s new gainful employment regulations withstand legal challenges in court, and if any of our programs of study fail to qualify as programs that lead to gainful employment in a recognized occupation under those regulations, students attending those programs of study will be unable to use Title IV Program funds to help pay their education costs.\nOn October 31, 2014, the ED issued final regulations that will become effective on July 1, 2015, specifying requirements related to programs of study that are intended to lead to gainful employment in a recognized occupation (the \u201cNew GE Rule\u201d). Those requirements include two debt-to-earnings rates (\u201cD/E Rates\u201d) to be calculated every year, consisting of a debt-to-annual earnings (\u201caDTE\u201d) rate and a debt-to-discretionary income (\u201cdDTI\u201d) rate.\nThe aDTE rate is calculated by comparing (i) the annual loan payment required on the median student loan debt incurred by students receiving Title IV Program funds who completed a particular program and (ii) the higher of the mean or median of those graduates\u2019 annual earnings approximately two to four years after they graduate, to arrive at a percentage rate. The dDTI rate is calculated by comparing (i) the annual loan payment required on the median student loan debt incurred by students receiving Title IV Program funds who completed a particular program and (ii) the higher of the mean or median of those graduates\u2019 discretionary income approximately two to four years after they graduate to arrive at a percentage rate. The ED receives the earnings data used to calculate the aDTE and dDTI rates from the Social Security Administration (\u201cSSA\u201d). Institutions do not have access to the SSA earnings information.\nA program must achieve an aDTE rate at or below 8%, or a dDTI rate at or below 20%, to be considered \u201cpassing.\u201d A program that does not have a passing rate under either the aDTE or dDTI rates, but has an aDTE rate greater than 8% but less than or equal to 12%, or a dDTI rate greater than 20% but less than or equal to 30%, is considered \u201cin the zone.\u201d A program with an aDTE rate greater than 12% and a dDTI rate greater than 30%, is considered \u201cfailing.\u201d A program will cease to be eligible for students to receive Title IV Program funds, if its aDTE rate and dDTI rate are failing in two out of any three consecutive award years or both of those rates are either failing or in the zone for four consecutive award years for which the ED calculates D/E Rates. An award year under the Title IV Programs begins on July 1st and ends on June 30th of the immediately succeeding calendar year.\nIf a program could become ineligible for students to use Title IV Program funds based on its D/E Rates for the next award year, which could occur based on the program\u2019s D/E Rates for a single year, the institution must:\n\u2022\ndeliver a warning to current and prospective students in that program at the prescribed time and by a prescribed method which, among other things, states that students may not be able to use Title IV Program funds to attend or continue to attend the program (\u201cWarning\u201d); and\n\u2022\nnot enroll, register or enter into a financial commitment with a prospective student in the program, until three business days after (a) a Warning is provided to the prospective student or (b) a subsequent Warning is provided to the prospective student, if more than 30 days have passed since the initial Warning was first provided to the prospective student.\nThe New GE Rule also requires institutions to make additional public disclosures and report additional information to the ED with respect to each program that leads to gainful employment in a recognized occupation. We believe that the additional disclosure and reporting requirements will be administratively burdensome, will increase our compliance costs, and could cause fewer students to enroll in our programs of study.\nIf a program becomes ineligible for students to use Title IV Program funds, or if the institution chooses to discontinue a program after it receives D/E Rates that are failing or in the zone for a single award year, the institution cannot seek to reestablish the eligibility of that program, or establish the eligibility of a similar program, based on having a classification of instructional program (\u201cCIP\u201d) code that has the same first four digits as the CIP code of the ineligible program, until three years following the date on which the program became ineligible or was discontinued.\nWe cannot predict with any certainty which or how many of our programs of study may become ineligible or subject to a Warning under the New GE Rule. While we are evaluating the potential impact of the New GE Rule, we cannot predict what the impact will be on our operations. Compliance with the New GE Rule could reduce our enrollments, increase our cost of doing business and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn response to the predecessor of the New GE Rule that was issued in 2011, we made significant changes to the programs of study that we offer. This prior rule also put downward pressure on our tuition prices, to help prevent students from incurring debt that exceeded the levels required for a program to remain eligible for students to receive Title IV Program funds. This, in turn, increased the percentage of our revenue that is derived from Title IV Programs, which could adversely impact our compliance with other ED regulations. We have also limited enrollment in certain programs of study and substantially increased our efforts to promote student loan repayment. These pressures and other factors are likely to continue under the New GE Rule. Any or all of these factors could reduce our enrollment and/or increase our cost of doing business, perhaps materially, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price.\nIn November 2014, two organizations of schools filed separate lawsuits against the ED in federal courts seeking to have the New GE Rule invalidated. One lawsuit was filed by the Association of Private Sector Colleges and Universities, which represents more than 1,400 for-profit institutions nationwide, and the other lawsuit was filed by the Association of Proprietary Colleges, which\nrepresents more than 20 for-profit colleges in the state of New York. The lawsuits allege, among other things, that the New GE Rule exceeds the ED\u2019s statutory authority, violates institutions\u2019 constitutional rights, and is arbitrary and capricious. We cannot predict when or how the courts will rule on these lawsuits.\nWe may be subject to sanctions, including, without limitation, an increase in the amount of the ED Letter of Credit, and other limitations in order to continue our campuses\u2019 participation in Title IV Programs, state authorization and accreditation, if we or our campuses do not meet the financial standards of the ED, SAs or ACs. The ED, SAs and ACs prescribe specific financial standards that an institution must satisfy to participate in Title IV Programs, operate in a state and be accredited. The ED evaluates institutions for compliance with its financial responsibility standards each year, based on the institution\u2019s annual audited financial statements, as well as following any change of control of the institution and when the institution is reviewed for recertification by the ED. In evaluating an institution\u2019s compliance with the financial responsibility standards, the ED may examine the financial statements of the individual institution, the institution\u2019s parent company or any party related to the institution. Historically, the ED has evaluated the financial condition of our institutions on a consolidated basis, based on our financial statements at the parent company level.\nThe most significant ED financial responsibility measurement is the institution\u2019s composite score, which is calculated by the ED based on three ratios:\n\u2022\nthe equity ratio, which measures the institution\u2019s capital resources, ability to borrow and financial viability;\n\u2022\nthe primary reserve ratio, which measures the institution\u2019s ability to support current operations from expendable resources; and\n\u2022\nthe net income ratio, which measures the institution\u2019s ability to operate at a profit.\nThe ED assigns a strength factor to the results of each of these ratios on a scale from negative 1.0 to positive 3.0, with negative 1.0 reflecting financial weakness and positive 3.0 reflecting financial strength. The ED then assigns a weighting percentage to each ratio and adds the weighted scores for the three ratios together to produce a composite score for the institution (the \u201cComposite Score\u201d). The Composite Score must be at least 1.5 for the institution to be deemed financially responsible by the ED without the need for further oversight. Our institutions\u2019 Composite Score, based on our fiscal year consolidated financial statements at the parent company level, was 1.8 in 2012. In calculating our institutions\u2019 2013 Composite Score, we believe that an exclusion for the effect of a change in accounting estimate related to the CUSO RSA should be available under the ED\u2019s regulations, which would cause our 2013 Composite Score to be higher than if that exclusion was not permitted.\nOn January 28, 2015, we received a letter from the ED stating that it does not agree with our position, resulting in a determination by the ED that our institutions\u2019 2013 Composite Score was 0.9. As a result of this determination, the ED indicated that our institutions failed to comply with the ED\u2019s financial responsibility standards. Due to our failure to submit our 2013 audited consolidated financial statements and compliance audits to the ED by the ED\u2019s June 30, 2014 deadline, the ED had previously determined that we failed to comply with the ED\u2019s financial responsibility standards for that reason and imposed penalties on us including being placed on provisional certification, having to request Title IV funds from the ED under the Heightened Cash Monitoring 1 method of payment, and requiring us to post a letter of credit with the ED in the amount of $79.7 million. We are already subject to the same sanctions and penalties that the ED normally imposes on institutions that fail to have a Composite Score of at least 1.5, and the ED\u2019s determination that our institutions have a 2013 Composite Score of 0.9 did not result in additional sanctions or penalties from the ED against us or our institutions, but we cannot assure you that the ED will not impose additional sanctions or penalties. Based on our fiscal year consolidated financial statements at the parent company level, our institutions\u2019 Composite Score was above 1.5 in 2014.\nWe disagree with the ED\u2019s determination regarding our institutions\u2019 2013 Composite Score, and we believe that our institutions\u2019 2013 Composite Score is above 1.5. We provided a written response to the ED requesting that the ED reconsider the composite score calculation for fiscal year ended December 31, 2013 and offered to meet with the ED to discuss this matter. The ED made a written request for additional information from us, to which we responded on March 25, 2015. On April 15, 2015, the ED reaffirmed its determination that our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013 yield a Composite Score of 0.9 out of a possible 3.0. On April 20, 2015, we provided the ED with a notice of our intent to appeal the April 15, 2015 letter from the ED addressing our institutions\u2019 2013 Composite Score and reiterated our offer to meet with the ED to discuss the calculation. We cannot assure you that the ED will agree with our position on this matter.\nThe letter of credit that the ED has already required us to post might be accepted to satisfy any additional letter of credit requirement, but there can be no assurance that the ED would not require us to increase the amount of any then-existing letter of credit based on our institutions\u2019 2013 Composite Scores. Any significant delay in our institutions\u2019 receipt of Title IV Program funds due to the penalties that the ED has imposed on us could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows, could cause us to be in default of the Financing Agreement and could negatively impact our ability to satisfy our payment obligations under contractual arrangements, including the RSAs and the Financing Agreement. Depending on the length of the delay, we cannot assure you that we would be able to continue to operate our business in such an event. If the ED requires us to increase the amount of our letter of credit payable to the ED, we cannot assure you that we would be able do so, or that we would be able to provide the cash collateral necessary to maintain any letter of credit.\nThe SA\u2019s financial standards include a variety of financial metrics and ratios, including, without limitation, positive net working capital, positive net worth, operating profit, one-to-one ratio of assets to liabilities and/or one-to-one ratio of current assets to\ncurrent liabilities. In addition, some of the ACs and SAs to which we are subject could impose sanctions and penalties against us and our institutions as a result of a 2013 Composite Score below 1.5, including requiring us to post separate letters of credit for their benefit, or suspending or terminating our campuses\u2019 authority to operate. Any sanctions or penalties imposed by the ACs and SAs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. Our institutions violated the financial standards of the SAs in Florida, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Texas and West Virginia, due to:\n\u2022\nthe PEAKS Consolidation;\n\u2022\nour institutions\u2019 failure to submit their 2013 audited consolidated financial statements to the SAs by the applicable due dates; and/or\n\u2022\nother factors.\nAs a result of these violations, our:\n\u2022\nFlorida SA:\n\u2022\nchanged the authorization to operate for each of our 13 campuses in Florida from an annual license to a provisional license, through July 31, 2015;\n\u2022\ntold us that it would conduct an on-site visit of each of our Florida campuses to determine the campus\u2019 compliance with our Florida SA\u2019s regulations;\n\u2022\ntold us that it would require each of our Florida campuses to correct any deficiencies noted during our Florida SA\u2019s on-site visit of the campus;\n\u2022\nrequired us to submit to our Florida SA any correspondence that we or any of our institutions have with the ED or the AC of our Florida campuses, within 15 days of the submission or receipt of that correspondence;\n\u2022\nrequired each of our Florida campuses to submit a train-out plan to our Florida SA on or before September 4, 2014; and\n\u2022\nrequired us to report to our Florida SA, at its September 2014 meeting, on the stability of our Florida campuses and any changes that may further affect our stability or operations;\n\u2022\nPennsylvania SA could:\n\u2022\nplace each of our seven campuses in Pennsylvania on quarterly financial reporting;\n\u2022\nrequire each of our Pennsylvania campuses to submit to our Pennsylvania SA a teach-out plan with respect to all of the campus\u2019 programs;\n\u2022\nrequire each of our Pennsylvania campuses to submit to our Pennsylvania SA a business plan with respect to the campus\u2019 operations;\n\u2022\nraise the required amount of the surety bond that each of our Pennsylvania campuses are required to post for the benefit of our Pennsylvania SA; and/or\n\u2022\nsuspend or revoke each of our Pennsylvania campuses\u2019 authorization to operate as an educational institution in Pennsylvania;\n\u2022\nTennessee SA could:\n\u2022\nassess monetary fines against each of our five campuses in Tennessee;\n\u2022\nrequire each of our Tennessee campuses to submit to our Tennessee SA an audit of the campus\u2019 financial stability that is conducted in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards in the United States;\n\u2022\nrevoke or change each of our Tennessee campuses\u2019 authorization to operate as an educational institution in Tennessee; and/or\n\u2022\nsuspend or terminate all or any portion of our Tennessee campuses\u2019 operations in Tennessee, including, without limitation, new student enrollment, advertising and/or teaching specific programs;\n\u2022\nTexas SA could:\n\u2022\nassess an administrative penalty;\n\u2022\nrevoke our Texas campuses\u2019 certificates of approval;\n\u2022\nplace conditions on our Texas campuses\u2019 certificates of approval;\n\u2022\nsuspend the admission of students to our Texas campuses or programs;\n\u2022\ndeny program approvals for our Texas campuses;\n\u2022\ndeny, suspend or revoke the registration of our Texas campuses\u2019 representatives;\n\u2022\napply for an injunction against our Texas campuses;\n\u2022\nask the attorney general to collect a civil penalty for violation of state law or regulations; and/or\n\u2022\norder a peer review of our Texas campuses; and\n\u2022\nWest Virginia SA could:\n\u2022\nraise the amount of the surety bond that our one campus in West Virginia needs is required to post for the benefit of our West Virginia SA;\n\u2022\ncall the surety bond that our West Virginia campus posted for the benefit of our West Virginia SA;\n\u2022\nsuspend, withdraw or revoke our West Virginia campus\u2019 authorization to operate or solicit students in West Virginia;\n\u2022\nchange our West Virginia campus\u2019 authorization to operate in West Virginia to a probationary authorization;\n\u2022\nrequire our West Virginia campus to refund its students\u2019 tuition and fees; and/or\n\u2022\ntake any other action against our West Virginia campus that our West Virginia SA deems appropriate.\nIf some or all of the sanctions described above were imposed on many of the affected campuses, those sanctions would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and cash flows.\nOne or more of our institutions may have to post a letter of credit or be subject to other sanctions if it does not correctly calculate and return within the required time frame Title IV Program funds for, or refund monies paid by or on behalf of, students who withdraw before completing their program of study. The HEA and its implementing regulations impose limits on the amount of Title IV Program funds withdrawing students can use to pay their education costs (the \u201cReturn Policy\u201d). The Return Policy permits a student to use only a pro rata portion of the Title IV Program funds that the student would otherwise be eligible to use, if the student withdraws during the first 60% of any period of enrollment. For the vast majority of our campuses, a period of enrollment is generally an academic quarter. The institution must calculate and return to the ED any Title IV Program funds that the institution receives on behalf of a withdrawing student in excess of the amount the student can use for such period of enrollment. The institution must return those unearned funds in a timely manner which is generally within 45 days of the date the institution determined that the student had withdrawn. If the unearned funds are not properly calculated and timely returned, we may have to post a letter of credit in favor of the ED or be otherwise sanctioned by the ED. An institution is required to post a letter of credit with the ED in an amount equal to 25% of the total dollar amount of unearned Title IV Program funds that the institution was required to return with respect to withdrawn students during its most recently completed fiscal year, if the institution is found in an audit or program review to have untimely returned unearned Title IV Program funds with respect to 5% or more of the students in the audit or program review sample of withdrawn students, in either of its two most recently completed fiscal years. As of December 31, 2014, no audit or program review had found that any of our institutions violated the ED\u2019s standard on the timely return of unearned Title IV Program funds. The requirement to post a letter of credit or other sanctions by the ED could increase our cost of regulatory compliance and adversely affect our results of operations. Further, we cannot assure you that our institutions would be able to submit a letter of credit payable to the ED in the amount required by the ED, or that we would be able to provide the cash collateral required to maintain any letter of credit.\nThe standards of most of the SAs and the ACs limit a student\u2019s obligation to an institution for tuition and fees, if a student withdraws from the institution (the \u201cRefund Policies\u201d). The specific standards vary among the SAs. Depending on when, during an academic term, a student withdraws and the applicable Refund Policies, in many instances the student remains obligated to the institution for some or all of the student\u2019s education costs that were paid by the Title IV Program funds returned under the Return Policy. In these instances, many withdrawing students are unable to pay all of their education costs, unless the students have access to other sources of financial aid. Our experience has been that many of our affected students do not have access to other sources of financial aid and that we have been unable to collect a significant portion of many withdrawing students\u2019 education costs that would have been paid by Title IV Program funds that were returned, which, in the aggregate, have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nOne or more of our institutions may lose its eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs, if the percentage of its revenue derived from those programs is too high. Under a provision of the HEA commonly referred to as the 90/10 Rule, a proprietary institution may be sanctioned if, on a cash accounting basis, the institution derives more than 90% of its applicable revenue in a fiscal year from Title IV Programs. If an institution exceeds the 90% threshold for any single fiscal year, the ED would place that institution on provisional certification status for the institution\u2019s following two fiscal years, unless the institution\u2019s participation in Title IV Programs ends sooner. In addition, if an institution exceeds the 90% threshold for two consecutive fiscal years, it would be ineligible to participate in Title IV Programs as of the first day of the following fiscal year and would be unable to apply to regain its eligibility until the end of the second subsequent fiscal year. Furthermore, if one of our institutions exceeded the 90% threshold for two consecutive fiscal years and became ineligible to participate in Title IV Programs but continued to disburse Title IV Program funds, the ED can require the institution to repay, with limited exceptions, all Title IV Program funds disbursed by the institution after the effective date of the loss of eligibility.\nFor our 2014 fiscal year, none of our institutions derived more than approximately 81% of its applicable revenue on a cash accounting basis from Title IV Programs under the 90/10 Rule calculation. Any changes in federal law that increase Title IV Program grant or loan limits, or that count funds other than Title IV Program funds toward the 90% limit, may result in an increase in the percentage of revenue that we indirectly derive from Title IV Programs, which could make it more difficult for us to satisfy the 90/10 Rule.\nA significant portion of the veterans\u2019 educational benefits that our students receive from the VA and state agencies administering those funds is included in our non-Title IV revenue for purposes of the 90/10 Rule. If a portion of our veteran students\u2019 educational benefits that are included in our non-Title IV revenue for purposes of the 90/10 Rule is no longer available, the percentage of our revenue from Title IV sources could increase, and if a material amount of such VA funding is no longer available, the percentage of our revenue from Title IV sources could materially increase, which could make it more difficult for us to satisfy the 90/10 Rule. See \u201c-Our campuses\u2019 failure to comply with the requirements for receiving veterans\u2019 educational benefits or Department of Defense tuition assistance program funds could result in their loss of eligibility to receive such benefits and funds, which could materially and adversely affect our business.\u201d\nWe regularly monitor compliance with the 90/10 Rule to minimize the risk that any of our institutions would derive more than the maximum allowable percentage of its applicable revenue from Title IV Programs for any fiscal year. If an institution appeared likely to approach the maximum percentage threshold, we would consider making changes in student financing to comply with the 90/10 Rule, but we cannot assure you that we would be able to do this in a timely manner or at all. If any of our institutions lost its eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs and we could not arrange for alternative financing sources for the students attending the campuses in that institution, we would probably have to close those campuses, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. If all or substantially all of our campuses lost their eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs, we likely would not be able to continue to operate our business.\nFailure by one or more of our institutions to satisfy the ED\u2019s administrative capability requirements could result in financial penalties, limitations on the institution\u2019s participation in Title IV Programs, or loss of the institution\u2019s eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs. To participate in Title IV Programs, an institution must satisfy criteria of administrative capability prescribed by the ED. These criteria include requirements that the institution:\n\u2022\ndemonstrate a reasonable relationship between the length of its programs and the entry-level job requirements of the relevant fields of employment;\n\u2022\ncomply with all of the applicable Title IV Program regulations prescribed by the ED;\n\u2022\nhave capable and sufficient personnel to administer the institution\u2019s participation in Title IV Programs;\n\u2022\ndefine and measure the satisfactory academic progress of its students within parameters specified by the ED;\n\u2022\nprovide adequate financial aid counseling to its students who receive Title IV Program funds; and\n\u2022\ntimely submit all required reports and financial statements to the ED.\nIf the ED determines that an institution is not capable of adequately administering its participation in any of the Title IV Programs, the ED could, among other things:\n\u2022\nimpose monetary fines or penalties on the institution;\n\u2022\nrequire the institution to repay funds received under Title IV Programs;\n\u2022\ntransfer the institution from the advance method of payment of Title IV Program funds to the heightened cash monitoring or reimbursement system of payment; or\n\u2022\nlimit or terminate the institution\u2019s eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs.\nAny of these sanctions could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and impose significant operating restrictions on us. Further, the ED can disapprove new educational program applications for administrative capability reasons. For example, in December 2014, the ED disapproved our application to offer four new degree programs at the ITT Technical Institutes due to administrative capability issues reported in recent compliance audits and ED program reviews, and in March 2015, the ED disapproved two of eight new degree programs that we applied to offer at DWC also due to administrative capability issues.\nIn addition, for 2014 and subsequent years, an institution is deemed by the ED to lack administrative capability if its Three-Year CDR equals or exceeds 30% for at least two of the three most recent federal fiscal years for which such rates have been published. If an institution\u2019s administrative capability is impaired solely because its Three-Year CDRs equal or exceed the applicable percentage, the institution can continue to participate in Title IV Programs, but the ED may place the institution on provisional certification.\nWe are subject to sanctions, if we pay impermissible commissions, bonuses or other incentive payments to individuals or entities involved in certain recruiting, admission or financial aid activities. The ED\u2019s regulations prohibit an institution participating in Title IV Programs from providing any commission, bonus or other incentive payment based directly or indirectly on success in securing enrollments or financial aid to any person or entity engaged in any student recruitment or admission activity or in making decisions regarding the awarding of Title IV Program funds (the \u201cIncentive Compensation Prohibition\u201d). We believe that the Incentive Compensation Prohibition:\n\u2022\ndoes not establish clear criteria for compliance in all circumstances, and the ED will not entertain a request by an institution for the ED to review and assess its individual compensation plan;\n\u2022\nmay subject us to qui tam lawsuits for alleged violations of the False Claims Act, 31 U.S.C. \u00a7 3729 et seq. (\u201cFalse Claims Act\u201d);\n\u2022\nadversely affects our ability to compensate our employees based on their performance of their job responsibilities, which makes it more difficult to attract and retain highly-qualified employees; and\n\u2022\nimpairs our ability to sustain and grow our business.\nWe cannot be sure that the compensation that we have paid our employees will not be determined to violate the Incentive Compensation Prohibition. If the ED determines that our compensation practices violate the Incentive Compensation Prohibition, the ED could subject us to substantial monetary fines or penalties or other sanctions. We could also be subjected to qui tam lawsuits for alleged violations of the False Claims Act related to the Incentive Compensation Prohibition. Those sanctions and lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and future growth.\nWe cannot operate new campuses or offer new programs, if they are not timely authorized by our regulators, and we may have to repay Title IV Program funds disbursed to students enrolled at any of those locations or in any of those programs, if we do not obtain prior authorization. Our expansion plans assume that we will be able to continue to obtain the necessary authorization from the ED, ACs and SAs to establish new campuses and expand or revise program offerings in a timely manner. If we are unable to obtain the required authorizations from the ED, ACs or SAs for any new campuses or any new or revised program offerings, or to obtain such authorizations in a timely manner, our ability to operate the new campuses or offer new or revised programs as planned would be impaired, which could have a material adverse effect on our expansion plans.\nThe process of obtaining any required SA and AC authorizations can also delay our operating new campuses or offering new programs. The status of our institutions and the state laws and regulations in effect in the states where we are located or anticipate establishing a new location or the ACs standards may limit our ability to establish new campuses and expand the programs offered at a campus, which could have a material adverse effect on our expansion plans.\nIn addition, an institution that is eligible to participate in Title IV Programs may add a new location or education program without the ED\u2019s approval only if certain requirements are met. Otherwise, the institution must obtain the ED\u2019s approval before it may disburse Title IV Program funds to students in the new location or education program. If we were to erroneously determine that a new location or education program is eligible for Title IV Program funding, we would likely be liable for repayment of the Title IV Program funds provided to students in that location or program. See \u201cBusiness - Highly Regulated Industry.\u201d\nDue to our institutions\u2019 failure to submit their 2013 audited consolidated financial statements and Compliance Audits to the ED by June 30, 2014, all of our institutions are provisionally certified to participate in Title IV Programs. See \u201c-Our institutions\u2019 failure to submit their 2013 audited consolidated financial statements and Compliance Audits to the ED by the due date resulted in sanctions imposed by the ED on our institutions that include, among other things, our institutions having to post a letter of credit, being placed on heightened cash monitoring and being provisionally certified.\u201d Any institution provisionally certified by the ED must apply for and receive approval by the ED for any substantial change before the institution can award, disburse or distribute Title IV Program funds based on the substantial change. Substantial changes generally include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe establishment of an additional location;\n\u2022\nan increase in the level of academic offering beyond those listed in the institution\u2019s Eligibility and Certification Approval Report with the ED;\n\u2022\nan addition of any non-degree program or short-term training program; or\n\u2022\nan addition of a degree program by a proprietary institution.\nIn December 2014, the ED informed us that it had disapproved our application to offer four new degree programs at the ITT Technical Institutes due to administrative capability issues reported in recent compliance audits and ED program reviews. The ED also told us that we could reapply for these programs when we demonstrated improved performance in those areas. Although we believe that we have made improvements in the areas identified by the ED and we intend to reapply to the ED for approval to offer these programs in the future, we cannot assure you that the ED will approve that re-application or that the ED will permit us to apply for a third time if the re-application is not approved. In addition, in March 2015, the ED approved six and disapproved two new degree programs that we had applied to offer at Daniel Webster College. The basis for disapproval was due to administrative capability issues reported in recent compliance audits and ED program reviews.\nSee \u201cBusiness - Highly Regulated Industry,\u201d for a further discussion of the ED\u2019s provisional certification of an institution to participate in Title IV Programs. See also \u201c-If the ED\u2019s new gainful employment regulations withstand legal challenges in court, and if any of our programs of study fail to qualify as programs that lead to gainful employment in a recognized occupation under those regulations, students attending those programs of study will be unable to use Title IV Program funds to help pay their education costs,\u201d regarding additional program approval requirements that are contained in the New GE Rule.\nFailure by any of our campuses or program offerings to satisfy the ACICS compliance standards with respect to Student Retention Rates, Graduate Placement Rates or Licensure Examination Pass Rates could cause us to close those campuses and reduce the offerings of those programs. Under the standards of the ACICS, if the Student Retention Rate or Graduate Placement Rate:\n\u2022\nof a campus falls below the ACICS benchmark standards, the campus is required to develop and implement a campus improvement plan and periodically report its results to the ACICS;\n\u2022\nof a campus falls below the ACICS compliance standards, the campus is required to develop and implement a campus improvement plan and come into compliance within a specified time period, or the ACICS may withdraw the campus\u2019 inclusion in the institution\u2019s grant of accreditation;\n\u2022\nof a program offering at a campus falls below the ACICS benchmark standards, the campus is required to develop and implement a program improvement plan for that program offering; or\n\u2022\nof a program offering at a campus falls below the ACICS compliance standards, the program offering is required to develop and implement a campus improvement plan and come into compliance within a specified time period, or the ACICS may withdraw its authorization of that program offering.\nThe ACICS has also implemented standards related to Licensure Examination Pass Rates that apply to programs of study that have graduates who, if they seek employment, are required to have a certificate, licensure or registration based on an industry-sponsored examination in the applicable field. Under the ACICS standards, if the Licensure Examination Pass Rate:\n\u2022\nof a program offering at a campus falls below the ACICS benchmark standards, the campus is required to develop and implement a program improvement plan for that program offering; or\n\u2022\nof a program offering at a campus falls below the ACICS compliance standards, the program offering is required to develop and implement a campus improvement plan and come into compliance within a specified time period, or the ACICS may withdraw its authorization of that program offering.\nA campus that falls below the ACICS benchmark standards is not required to obtain permission from the ACICS prior to applying to add a new program offering, but a campus that falls below the ACICS compliance standards is required to obtain permission from the ACICS prior to applying to add a new program offering. See \u201cBusiness -Highly Regulated Industry - Regulation by Accrediting Commissions\u201d for a description of ACICS\u2019 review of and actions related to our campuses and programs.\nIf any of our ITT Technical Institute locations and/or program offerings fall below the Student Retention Rate, Graduate Placement Rate or Licensure Examination Pass Rate compliance standards and we were unable to timely bring those locations and/or program offerings into compliance, we may have to close those locations and reduce the offerings of those programs, which could have a material adverse effect on our expansion plans, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe failure of our programs of study offered in any state to qualify as credit hour programs, as opposed to clock hour programs, under the ED\u2019s regulations would likely result in our students, who attend those programs, receiving less funds from Title IV Programs, may result in fewer students attending those programs and could result in financial penalties. The ED\u2019s regulations related to determining when a program of study is required to measure student progress in clock hours, as opposed to credit hours, are complex. Students attending credit hour programs of study that are required to be measured in clock hours for Title IV purposes may likely receive less funds from Title IV Programs to pay their cost of education with respect to those programs of study. Students interested in those programs of study may have to use more expensive private financing to pay their cost of education or may be unable to enroll in those programs of study. Students may determine that they do not qualify for private financing or that the private financing costs make borrowing too expensive, which may cause students to abandon or delay their education. Any or all of these factors could reduce our enrollment, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and stock price. If we were to erroneously determine that a program of study is not required to measure student progress in clock hours, we would likely be liable for repayment of a portion of the Title IV Program funds provided to students in that program of study based on the difference between the amount of funds those students received and the amount they were eligible to receive.\nGovernment and regulatory agencies and third parties have brought, and may bring additional, investigations, claims or actions against us based on alleged violations of the extensive regulatory requirements applicable to us, which could require us to pay monetary damages, receive other sanctions and expend significant resources to defend those claims or actions. We are subject to investigations and claims of non-compliance with regulatory standards and other actions brought by regulatory agencies, students, shareholders and other parties. Some of the more significant pending investigations, claims and actions are described below. If the results of any investigations, claims and/or actions are unfavorable to us, we may be required to pay money damages or be subject to fines, penalties, injunctions, operational limitations, loss of eligibility to participate in federal or state financial aid programs, debarments, additional oversight and reporting, or other civil and criminal sanctions. Those sanctions could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, we have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, significant legal and other expenses in connection with investigations, claims and actions, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Investigations, claims and actions have caused and will continue to cause a substantial diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources from our ongoing business operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Adverse publicity regarding any investigations, claims and/or actions could also negatively affect our business and the market price of our common stock. Further, the fact that investigations, claims and actions are pending against us has resulted in, and could in the future result in, increased scrutiny, the withholding of authorizations and/or the imposition of other sanctions by SAs, the ACs and other regulatory agencies governing us. See \u201cBusiness - Highly Regulated Industry.\u201d\nSee Note 15 - Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, and the discussions under the sub-headings \u201cGovernment Investigations\u201d and \u201cLitigation,\u201d for information regarding certain lawsuits and investigations affecting us.\nInvestigations, claims and actions against companies in our industry could adversely affect our business and stock price. The operations of a number of other companies in the postsecondary education industry have been subject to intense regulatory scrutiny. In some cases, allegations of wrongdoing have resulted in reviews or investigations by the U.S. Department of Justice, SEC, ED, CFPB, Government Accountability Office, Department of Veterans Affairs, Federal Trade Commission, Department of Defense, state education and professional licensing authorities, states\u2019 attorney general offices or other state agencies. These investigations and actions have alleged, among other things, deceptive trade practices and noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations. These allegations have attracted adverse media coverage that may negatively affect public perceptions of proprietary education institutions, including the ITT Technical Institutes and Daniel Webster College. Adverse media coverage regarding other companies in the proprietary education sector or regarding us directly could damage our reputation, could result in lower enrollments, revenue and profit, and could have a negative impact on our stock price. These allegations, reviews, investigations and enforcement actions and the accompanying adverse publicity could also result in increased scrutiny of, and have a negative impact on, us and our industry.\nOur campuses\u2019 failure to comply with the requirements for receiving veterans\u2019 educational benefits or Department of Defense tuition assistance program funds could result in their loss of eligibility to receive such benefits and funds, which could materially and adversely affect our business. Effective May 11, 2015, CSAAVE, a division of the California Department of Veterans Affairs, gave notice to all of our campuses in California, suspending the approval of their courses for receipt of veterans\u2019 educational program benefits under the GI Bill Programs. The basis for the suspension was CSAAVE\u2019s determination that the campuses did not fully comply with the financial stability standards for accreditation published by the ACICS. The notice of suspension precludes our California campuses from future enrollment or re-enrollment of veterans or their dependents intending to utilize the GI Bill Programs\u2019 education benefits to pay in whole or in part for their enrollment in the campus. We have been in contact with CSAAVE, which requested that we submit additional financial information, including a statement of determination from the ACICS that all of our California campuses fully comply with the ACICS financial stability standards and requirements for accreditation. We have submitted the requested information to CSAAVE. If CSAAVE does not lift the suspension order, CSAAVE says that the approval of our California campuses to train veterans will be withdrawn no later than July 13, 2015. If the suspension order is not lifted on a timely basis or if the approval to train veterans is withdrawn, our enrollments, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nEffective May 18, 2015, NYSAA, a division of the New York Department of Veterans Affairs, gave notice to all of our campuses in the New York, suspending the approval of their courses for receipt of veterans\u2019 educational program benefits under the GI Bill Programs. The basis for the suspension was NYSAA\u2019s determination that the campuses did not fully comply with the financial stability standards for accreditation published by the ACICS. The notice of suspension precludes our New York campuses from future enrollment of veterans or their dependents intending to utilize the GI Bill Programs\u2019 education benefits to pay in whole or in part for their enrollment in the campus. The notice of suspension specifically allows certification of benefits for re-enrollments. NYSAA has directed that we submit, among other things, evidence of current financial stability, consistent with the ACICS standards, as well as documentation that the campuses in New York were not participating in practices claimed by the CFPB. We have submitted the requested information to NYSAA. If NYSAA does not lift the suspension order, NYSAA says that the approval of our New York campuses to train veterans will be withdrawn no later than July 17, 2015. If the suspension order is not lifted on a timely basis or if the approval to train veterans is withdrawn, our enrollments, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur campuses in 36 states in addition to New York and California are approved to receive veterans\u2019 educational program benefits under the GI Bill Programs. Based on the recent actions by the state approving agencies in California and New York, we believe that state approving agencies in other states may take similar actions to suspend the approval of our courses in the campuses of those states for receipt of veterans\u2019 educational program benefits under the GI Bill Programs and require the submission of additional information and reports. Any of these actions by any state approving agency could materially and adversely affect our enrollments, results of operations and financial condition. If a material amount of the veterans\u2019 educational benefits funding that our students have historically received that is included in our non-Title IV revenue for purposes of the 90/10 Rule is no longer available, the percentage of our revenue from Title IV sources could materially increase, which could make it more difficult for us to satisfy the 90/10 Rule. See \u201c-One or more of our institutions may lose its eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs, if the percentage of its revenue derived from those programs is too high.\u201d\nChanges in the amount or availability of veterans\u2019 educational benefits or Department of Defense tuition assistance programs could materially and adversely affect our business. Certain members of Congress and the Obama Administration have increased their focus on Department of Defense tuition assistance and veterans educational benefits that are used for programs of study offered at proprietary education institutions, particularly distance education programs of study. EO 13607 requires an institution to agree to comply with the principles of excellence described in the EO in order for the institution to participate in the Department of Defense tuition assistance and veterans\u2019 education benefits programs, including the Post-9/11 GI Bill and the Tuition Assistance Program for active duty service members. Among other things, the principles of excellence include a requirement that institutions implement an institutional refund policy for veterans and service members that is aligned with the return of unearned student aid rules applicable to Title IV Programs when students withdraw prior to completing their programs. In addition, federal legislation has been introduced that would revise the 90/10 Rule to count Department of Defense tuition assistance and veterans\u2019 educational benefits toward the 90% limit. To the extent that any laws, regulations or other requirements are adopted that limit or condition the amount of educational benefits that veterans and active duty service members can use toward their costs of education at proprietary education institutions or in distance education programs, or that limit or condition the participation of proprietary education institutions or distance education programs in veteran or military tuition assistance programs or in Title IV Programs with respect to veteran or military tuition assistance programs, our enrollments, results of operations and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nIf the graduates of some of our programs are unable to obtain licensure in their chosen professional fields of study, the enrollment in and the revenue derived from those programs could decrease and claims could be made against us that could be costly to defend. Graduates of certain of our programs of study offered through our Breckinridge School of Nursing and Health Sciences seek professional licensure in their chosen field following graduation. Their success in obtaining licensure depends on several factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe merits of the individual student;\n\u2022\nwhether the campus and the program were authorized by the appropriate SAs and/or approved by an accrediting commission and/or professional association; and\n\u2022\nwhether we complied with the requirements of those SAs, the accrediting commission or the professional association.\nCertain SAs refuse to license students who graduate from programs that do not meet specific types of programmatic accreditation, residency or other state requirements. In the event that one or more SAs refuses to recognize our graduates for professional licensure in the future based on factors relating to our campuses or their programs, student enrollment in those programs would be negatively impacted which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. In addition, we could be exposed to claims that would force us to incur legal and other expenses that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nLaws and regulations relating to marketing practices could limit our marketing activities or cause us to discontinue the marketing activities that we currently use or plan to use, and failure to comply with such laws and regulations could result in statutory damages or lawsuits against us. We rely on a variety of direct-to-consumer marketing techniques, including telemarketing, email marketing and postal mailings, and we are subject to various laws and regulations which govern marketing and advertising practices. For example, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991, the Telemarketing Sales Rule, the CAN-SPAM Act of 2003 and various other federal and state laws and regulations impose requirements on the manner and extent to which we can market our programs to prospective students. A recent amendment to the Telephone Consumer Protection Act requires, among other things, that we receive prior express written consent from consumers in order to place telemarketing calls to wireless phones using certain technology. Efforts to comply with the new regulations may negatively affect our ability to contact prospective students and, therefore, our revenue and profitability. Newly-adopted or amended laws and regulations relating to telemarketing, and increased enforcement of such laws and regulations by governmental agencies or by private litigants, could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Our failure to comply with laws and regulations applicable to our marketing activities could also result in statutory damages and class action lawsuits or other lawsuits against us.\nThe Early Career Academy is highly regulated, may require significant expenditures by us and may not be a successful business endeavor. To date, we have become the EMO for only one public charter high school. As such, the Early Career Academy is in the initial stages, and we cannot assure you that it will be a successful endeavor for us in the foreseeable future or at all. The Early Career Academy business is subject to extensive regulation, and we believe that it may require significant expenditures by us. Some of the factors that could have an adverse effect on the business of the Early Career Academy include, among others:\n\u2022\na reduction in government funding for, or a loss of tax-exempt status or funding eligibility by, public charter high schools;\n\u2022\nthe poor performance or misconduct by the Early Career Academy or operators of other public charter high schools;\n\u2022\nlegal claims challenging various aspects of public charter high schools; and\n\u2022\nnon-compliance with applicable regulations.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur guarantee obligations under the private education loan programs have had, and could continue to have, a material adverse effect on us, our consolidated financial statements and our compliance with covenants and metrics to which we are subject. We have entered into risk sharing and guarantee agreements with entities related to private education loans provided to our students to help pay the students\u2019 cost of education that student financial aid from federal, state and other sources does not cover. Our obligations under the PEAKS Guarantee will remain in effect until the PEAKS Senior Debt and the PEAKS Trust\u2019s fees and expenses are paid in full. Our obligations under the CUSO RSA will remain in effect, until all private education loans made under the CUSO Program are paid in full. See Note 15 - Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for information regarding the guarantee payments, the payments on behalf of borrowers and the payments that we made related to the RSAs in 2014.\nThe repayment performance of the private education loans under the RSAs has been significantly worse, and the charge-off rate on those loans has been significantly higher, than we originally projected when we entered into the RSAs and our subsequent projections. Further, under the PEAKS Guarantee, due to the PEAKS Consolidation and other factors, we were not in compliance with certain financial metrics under the PEAKS Program, which resulted in an increase in the required minimum Asset/Liability Ratio and a requirement that we make higher payments under the PEAKS Guarantee. As a result of the higher charge-off rates of the private education loans made under both the CUSO Program and PEAKS Program and the increased Asset/Liability Ratio, we have made payments related to the RSAs that have been significantly higher than we initially anticipated, and we currently estimate that we will be required to make payments in material amounts under the RSAs in 2015 and future years. See Note 15 - Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, for the amount of payments that we currently estimate we will be required to make through the remaining terms of the RSAs.\nAs a consequence of the restatement of our unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements in our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarters ended March 31, 2013, June 30, 2013 and September 30, 2013, certain quarterly reports that we were required to deliver to the indenture trustee of the PEAKS Trust under the PEAKS Guarantee were inaccurate. We delivered corrected quarterly reports to the indenture trustee on October 9, 2014. If we had delivered accurate quarterly reports, or with respect to periods in 2014 through June 30, 2014, delivered quarterly reports, to the indenture trustee of the PEAKS Trust, we believe the indenture trustee would have made payment demands beginning in April 2013, requiring us to make additional payments under the PEAKS Guarantee totaling approximately $60.3 million in the aggregate, in order to maintain an Asset/Liability Ratio of 1.40/1.00. On October 9, 2014, we made a guarantee payment of $50.0 million, which payment, along with other payments that we made to the PEAKS Trust in prior months, included amounts that would have become due between April 2013 and September 2014, had we delivered accurate quarterly reports. The delivery of inaccurate quarterly reports constituted a breach of the PEAKS Guarantee and an event of default under the PEAKS Indenture. In the event of a default under the PEAKS Indenture, the payment of the entire amount of the PEAKS Senior Debt could be accelerated, which would trigger our obligation to pay the full amount of the PEAKS\nSenior Debt pursuant to our obligations under the PEAKS Guarantee, additional remedies could be sought against us and there could be a cross-default under the Financing Agreement, any of which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. We believe that the delivery of the corrected quarterly reports and the payments we made under the PEAKS Guarantee through October 9, 2014 satisfied our obligations under the PEAKS Guarantee with respect to these matters and cured the breach of the PEAKS Guarantee and the event of default under the PEAKS Indenture. We cannot predict, however, whether the holders of the PEAKS Senior Debt will assert other breaches of the PEAKS Guarantee by us or assert that any breach of the PEAKS Guarantee or event of default under the PEAKS Indenture was not properly cured.\nWe have offset approximately $8.5 million against amounts owed to us by the CUSO under a revolving note owed to us by the CUSO (the \u201cRevolving Note\u201d), instead of making additional payments under the CUSO RSA in that amount. We understand the CUSO\u2019s position to be that the offset was improper and, as a result, we are in default under the CUSO RSA. In the event of a default by us under the CUSO RSA related to the offset, we may be required to pay to the CUSO approximately $9.2 million, net of approximately $1.0 million of recoveries from charged-off loans that are owed, but have not been paid, to us. If the CUSO instead were to withdraw cash collateral in that amount from the restricted bank account maintained to hold collateral to secure our obligations under the CUSO RSA, we would be required to deposit that amount of cash in the account to maintain the required level of collateral under the CUSO RSA.\nIn addition, as a result of the Consolidations, the liabilities of the PEAKS Trust and the CUSO are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet. See \u201c-As a result of the PEAKS Consolidation, our consolidated financial statements are materially different from those that we previously issued, which could have negative implications for our Financing Agreement and guarantee obligations and regulatory compliance\u201d and \u201c-The CUSO Consolidation could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements and our compliance with covenants and metrics to which we are subject.\u201d\nEven if the charge-off rates of the private education loans made under the CUSO Program and PEAKS Program remain at levels similar to the charge-off rates that we are currently utilizing in our estimates of future payment amounts under the RSAs, those payment amounts could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, cash flows and financial position, and could cause us to violate the requirements of the ED, SAs and the ACs and/or our compliance with the covenants under the Financing Agreement.\nOur estimates of the future payment amounts under the CUSO RSA and the timing of those payments, assume, among other factors, that we make Discharge Payments (as defined below) to the fullest extent possible in 2018 and later years. If we do not make the Discharge Payments as assumed in 2018 and later years, due to an inability to make payments in those amounts or for any other reason, we estimate that we will have to pay significantly larger amounts under the CUSO RSA over the remaining term of that agreement.\nOur estimates of the future charge-off rates of the private education loans made under the CUSO Program and PEAKS Program and of other factors that we utilize in our projections are based on numerous assumptions which may not prove to be correct and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. We would be required to pay additional material amounts under the RSAs and we could be required to make payments under the RSAs earlier than currently projected in the event that:\n\u2022\nthe charge-off rates on the private education loans are higher than we are currently estimating;\n\u2022\nother factors utilized in our projections are worse than currently estimated; and/or\n\u2022\nother factors negatively impact our compliance with the financial metrics to which we are subject under the RSAs.\nAny of these events could have a material adverse effect on us, including, among others, on our:\n\u2022\nresults of operations, financial condition and cash flows;\n\u2022\nliquidity and ability to pay our obligations as they become due;\n\u2022\nability to comply with the requirements of the ED, SAs and ACs to which we are subject, resulting in significant negative consequences;\n\u2022\nability to comply with our covenants under the Financing Agreement, resulting in a default thereunder, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, liquidity and ability to comply with our other obligations; and\n\u2022\nability to make required payments under the RSAs, resulting in a default thereunder, which, in the case of a default under the PEAKS Guarantee, could result in an acceleration of the entire amount of the PEAKS Senior Debt and our obligations to pay the full amount of the PEAKS Senior Debt pursuant to the terms of the PEAKS Guarantee, additional remedies against us and there could be a cross-default under the Financing Agreement, any of which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nIf we fail to effectively identify, establish and operate new campuses, our growth may be slowed. Part of our business strategy includes operating new campuses at locations throughout the United States. Establishing new campuses poses challenges and requires us to make investments in management and capital expenditures, incur marketing and advertising expenses and devote other resources that are different, and in some cases greater, than those required with respect to the operation of existing campuses. To operate a new campus, we would be required to obtain the appropriate authorizations from the applicable SAs and ACs, which may be conditioned or delayed in a manner that could significantly affect our growth plans. In addition, to be eligible to participate in Title IV Programs, a new campus must be certified by the ED, either before or after it starts disbursing Title IV\nProgram funds to its students. See \u201c-We cannot operate new campuses or offer new programs, if they are not timely authorized by our regulators, and we may have to repay Title IV Program funds disbursed to students enrolled at any of those locations or in any of those programs, if we do not obtain prior authorization.\u201d We cannot be sure that we will be able to identify suitable expansion opportunities or that we will be able to successfully integrate or profitably operate any new campuses. Any failure by us to effectively identify, establish and manage the operations of newly established campuses could slow our growth, make any newly established campuses more costly to operate than we had planned and have a material adverse effect on our expansion plans and results of operations.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to effectively identify, develop, obtain approval to offer and teach new programs at different levels in a cost-effective and timely manner. Part of our business strategy also includes increasing the number, levels, lengths and disciplines of programs offered at our campuses. Developing and offering new programs pose challenges and require us to make investments in research and development, management and capital expenditures, to incur marketing and advertising expenses and to devote other resources that are in addition to, and in some cases greater than, those associated with our current program offerings. In order to offer new programs at different levels at our campuses, we may be required to obtain the appropriate authorizations from the ED, SAs, ACs and, in certain circumstances, specialized programmatic accrediting commissions, which may be conditioned or delayed in a manner that could affect the programs offered at our campuses. We cannot be sure that we will be able to identify new programs, that we will be able to obtain the requisite authorizations to offer new programs at different levels at our campuses or that students will enroll in any new programs that we offer at our campuses. Any failure by us to effectively identify, develop, obtain authorization to offer and teach new programs at our campuses could have a material adverse effect on our expansion plans and results of operations. See \u201cBusiness - Business Strategy - Enhance Results at Each Institution,\u201d \u201c-If the ED\u2019s new gainful employment regulations withstand legal challenges in court, and if any of our programs of study fail to qualify as programs that lead to gainful employment in a recognized occupation under those regulations, students attending those programs of study will be unable to use Title IV Program funds to help pay their education costs\u201d, \u201c-We cannot operate new campuses or offer new programs, if they are not timely authorized by our regulators, and we may have to repay Title IV Program funds disbursed to students enrolled at any of those locations or in any of those programs, if we do not obtain prior authorization\u201d and \u201c-Failure by any of our campuses or program offerings to satisfy the ACICS compliance standards with respect to Student Retention Rates, Graduate Placement Rates or Licensure Examination Pass Rates could cause us to close those campuses and reduce the offerings of those programs.\u201d\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to keep pace with changing market needs and technology. Increasingly, prospective employers of our graduates demand that their entry-level employees possess appropriate technical skills and also appropriate soft skills, such as communication, critical thinking and teamwork skills. The skills that employees need may evolve rapidly in a changing economic and technological environment. Accordingly, it is important for our programs to evolve in response to those economic and technological changes. Any expansion of our existing programs and the development of new programs may not be accepted by prospective students or the employers of our graduates. Even if we are able to develop acceptable new programs, we may not be able to begin offering those new programs as quickly as required by the employers we serve or as quickly as our competitors offer similar programs. If we are unable to adequately respond to changes in market requirements due to regulatory or financial constraints, technological changes or other factors, our ability to attract and retain students could be impaired and the rates at which our graduates obtain jobs involving their fields of study could suffer.\nOur financial performance depends, in part, on our ability to continue to develop awareness and acceptance of our programs among working adults and, to a lesser extent, recent high school graduates. The awareness of our programs among working adults and, to a lesser extent, recent high school graduates is important to the success of our campuses. If we were unable to successfully market or advertise our programs, our ability to attract and enroll prospective students in our programs would be adversely affected and, consequently, our ability to increase revenue or maintain profitability would be impaired. The following are some of the factors that could prevent us from successfully marketing or advertising our programs:\n\u2022\nadverse publicity regarding us, our competitors or proprietary education generally;\n\u2022\nstudent dissatisfaction with our programs and services;\n\u2022\nemployer dissatisfaction with our programs and services;\n\u2022\nhigh costs of certain types of advertising media; and\n\u2022\nour failure to maintain or expand our brands or other factors related to our marketing or advertising practices.\nIncreases in institutional scholarships and internal student financing could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, revenue and student population. During the fourth quarter of 2012, we introduced an institutional scholarship program, called the Opportunity Scholarship, which is intended to help reduce the cost of an ITT Technical Institute education and increase student access to our programs of study. By June 30, 2013, the Opportunity Scholarship was being offered to students at all of the ITT Technical Institute campuses. We believe that the Opportunity Scholarship has, and will continue to, reduce our students\u2019 need and use of private education loans, as well as decrease the internal student financing that we provide to our students. As an institutional scholarship, our revenue is reduced by the amount of the Opportunity Scholarship awarded. In addition, no cash payments are received and students will not be obligated to make payments to us of the amounts awarded under the Opportunity Scholarship. Therefore, the amounts receivable from students to us, as well as our revenue, decreased in 2014 and, we believe, may continue to decrease in 2015.\nThe increased amount of internal student financing that we previously provided to our students has exposed us to greater credit risk. The internal student financing that we provide to our students consists of non-interest bearing, unsecured credit extended to our students. Internal student financing typically provides for payment to us by our\nstudents by the end of the student\u2019s academic year or enrollment, whichever occurs first, compared to payments from private education loan programs, which we typically received at the beginning of a student\u2019s academic year. This change in the timing of payments had a material adverse effect on our cash flows from operations in 2012 and 2013. In addition, we have the risk of collection with respect to our internal student financing, which caused us to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts in 2013 and 2014 and resulted in an increase in our bad debt expense as a percentage of revenue in 2013 and 2014. We plan to continue to offer the Opportunity Scholarship and other scholarships to eligible students which we believe will continue to reduce the amount of internal student financing that we provide to our students. The increased use of institutional scholarships and awards by our students and any additional internal student financing provided to our students could result in a continuation of the adverse factors that are described above, including a material adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flows.\nWe have a significant amount of cash held as collateral for outstanding letters of credit, which has a continuing material adverse effect on our cash flows and liquidity. We were required to deposit $89.3 million to be held as cash collateral for outstanding letters of credit for our account. Our collateralization of the letters of credit had, and continues to have, a material adverse effect on our liquidity, and significantly reduced the amount of cash that we have available for other purposes, including to satisfy our future payment obligations under the RSAs. The funds held as cash collateral are not available for use by us, and could be paid to the issuing bank for the letters of credit if the letters of credit are drawn upon. The fact that a significant amount of our cash is held in connection with the letters of credit could also negatively affect our ability to satisfy the financial metrics of the ED, SAs and ACs to which we are subject. We cannot assure you that we will not have to deposit additional amounts to be held as cash collateral as a result of an increase in required amounts of the letters of credit or a requirement for an additional letter of credit, which deposit could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and liquidity.\nIf we experience losses in excess of the amounts that we have accrued with respect to the significant amount of internal student financing that we have provided to our students, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We offer internal student financing to help students pay the portion of their cost of education that is not covered by financial aid or other funds. These balances are unsecured and not typically guaranteed. These balances have increased significantly in the last few years as a result of the number of our students who did not qualify for private education loans from third parties due to their prior credit history and the limited funding available under private education loan programs for which those students could qualify. The introduction of the Opportunity Scholarship has reduced, and will continue to reduce, our students\u2019 need for internal student financing. Internal student financing adversely affects our cash flows and exposes us to greater credit risk. Although we have accrued for estimated losses related to unpaid student balances, losses in excess of the amount we have accrued for bad debts could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to successfully conclude litigation against us, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. We are subject to various lawsuits, investigations and claims, covering a wide range of matters, including, but not limited to, alleged violations of federal and state laws, claims involving students or graduates and routine employment matters. We cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these matters and have incurred, and expect to incur, significant defense costs and other expenses in connection with these matters. Those costs and expenses have had, and could continue to have, a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and the market price of our common stock. These matters have and will continue to cause substantial diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources from our ongoing business operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We may be required to pay substantial damages or settlement costs in excess of our insurance coverage related to these matters, or may be required to pay substantial fines or penalties, any of which could have a further material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. An adverse outcome in any of these matters could also materially and adversely affect our authorizations, licenses, accreditations and eligibility to participate in Title IV programs. See \u201cLegal Proceedings.\u201d\nHigh interest rates and tightening of the credit markets could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain students and could increase our risk exposure. Since much of the financing our students receive is tied to floating interest rates, higher interest rates cause a corresponding increase in the cost to our existing and prospective students of financing their education, which could result in a reduction in the number of students attending our campuses and, consequently, in our revenue. Higher interest rates could also contribute to higher default rates with respect to our students\u2019 repayment of Title IV Program and private education loans. High default rates may, in turn, adversely impact our eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs, trigger our guarantee obligations with respect to private education loan programs and/or negatively affect the willingness of private lenders to make private education loan programs available to our students, which could result in a reduction in the number of students attending our campuses and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. As a result of those adverse effects on our students\u2019 ability to finance their cost of education, our receivables could increase and/or our student population could decrease, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe ability of the CPD to provide education-related services depends, in large part, on obtaining authorizations from vendors and trade associations to use their content in the CPD\u2019s education-related services. Part of our business strategy includes developing and providing education-related services to students and other constituencies. Through the CPD, we are developing and providing education-related services, including training programs, curricula, assessments and consulting. The majority of the content of the education-related services provided by the CPD is authorized under agreements between the CPD and vendors or trade\nassociations (the \u201cContent Agreements\u201d). We cannot be sure that we will be able to maintain or renew the existing Content Agreements or enter into new Content Agreements. Any failure by us to effectively identify or develop content for education-related services, or maintain, renew or obtain Content Agreements with respect to our education-related services, could have a material adverse effect on our expansion plans and results of operations.\nThe search for, and transition of, a new chief executive officer and a new chief financial officer could adversely affect us, and our inability to attract, hire or retain key personnel could harm our business. Our success to date has depended, and will continue to depend, largely on the skills, efforts and motivation of our executive officers. As previously disclosed, on August 4, 2014, in connection with the notification by Kevin M. Modany, our Chief Executive Officer, to our Board of Directors of his intention to resign as our Chief Executive Officer, we entered into a letter agreement with Mr. Modany (the \u201cModany Letter Agreement\u201d), pursuant to which Mr. Modany agreed to remain our Chief Executive Officer for a period ending on February 4, 2015, which period has been extended to August 31, 2015 (as so extended, the \u201cApplicable Period\u201d), most recently pursuant to a second amendment to the Modany Letter Agreement entered into on May 26, 2015. Also as previously disclosed, on April 27, 2015, Daniel M. Fitzpatrick, our Chief Financial Officer, notified us of his plan to retire, and on April 29, 2015, we entered into a letter agreement with Mr. Fitzpatrick (the \u201cFitzpatrick Letter Agreement\u201d), pursuant to which he will remain our Chief Financial Officer for a period ending on October 29, 2015, as extended by us for up to four months (as so extended or earlier terminated, the \u201cTransition Period\u201d).\nThe planned resignations of Messrs. Modany and Fitzpatrick may cause disruption in our business, strategic and employee relationships, which may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our business objectives, and may cause a loss of key employees or declines in the productivity of existing employees. The search for a permanent Chief Executive Officer and a permanent Chief Financial Officer may take many months or more, further exacerbating these factors. Competition for senior management personnel is intense and we cannot assure you that we will be able to select and employ a new Chief Executive Officer or a new Chief Financial Officer in a timely manner. Identifying and hiring an experienced and qualified Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are typically difficult, and may be even more difficult under the circumstances affecting us at this time. Further, we may not be able to effectively compete with compensation packages offered by other companies that are recruiting senior executive officers, due to the limitations imposed on us by the Incentive Compensation Prohibition. We may be unable to attract a suitably qualified individual for either the Chief Executive Officer position or the Chief Financial Officer position, or we may be required to pay increased base salary compensation in order to do so. Any or all of these risks could adversely affect our business, operating results or financial condition.\nOur search for a new Chief Executive Officer and a new Chief Financial Officer may also adversely affect our business or impose additional risks, such as the following:\n\u2022\ndisruption of our business or distraction of our employees and management;\n\u2022\ndifficulty recruiting, hiring, motivating and retaining other talented and skilled personnel;\n\u2022\nincreased stock price volatility; and\n\u2022\ndifficulty in establishing, maintaining or negotiating business or strategic relationships or transactions.\nWe cannot assure you that the transition to a new Chief Executive Officer or a new Chief Financial Officer will be smooth or successful. Leadership transitions can be inherently difficult to manage and may cause uncertainty or a disruption to our business or may increase the likelihood of turnover in other key officers and employees. Changes to strategic or operating goals with the appointment of new executives may, themselves, prove to be disruptive. Periods of transition in senior management leadership are often difficult as the new executives gain detailed knowledge of the company\u2019s operations and may result in cultural differences and friction due to changes in strategy and style. During the transition periods, there may be uncertainty among investors, employees, creditors and others concerning our future direction and performance. Any disruption or uncertainty could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition and the market price of our common stock.\nDuring our search for, and transition to, a new Chief Executive Officer and a new Chief Financial Officer, it is important that we retain key personnel. All of our officers and other employees are at-will employees, which means they can terminate their employment relationship with us at any time, and their knowledge of our business and industry would be difficult to replace. If we lose the services of key personnel, especially during this period of leadership transition, or do not hire or retain other personnel for key positions, including the Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer positions, our business, results of operations and stock price could be adversely affected.\nOur success also depends in large part on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified faculty, school administrators and corporate management. We face competition in the attraction and retention of personnel who possess the skill sets that we seek. In addition, key personnel may leave us and subsequently compete against us. Furthermore, we do not currently carry \u201ckey man\u201d life insurance. The loss of the services of any of our key personnel, especially during this period of leadership transition, or our failure to attract and retain other qualified and experienced personnel on acceptable terms, could impair our ability to successfully manage our business.\nIn order to support revenue growth, we need to hire, retain, develop and train employees who are responsible for student recruiting, financial aid, registration, teaching and career services. Our ability to develop a strong team of employees with these responsibilities may be affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nour ability to timely and effectively train and motivate our employees in order for them to become productive;\n\u2022\nrestrictions imposed by regulatory bodies on the method of compensating employees, such as the Incentive Compensation Prohibition;\n\u2022\nour ability to attract enough prospective students to our program offerings; and\n\u2022\nour ability to effectively manage a multi-institutional and multi-location educational organization.\nIf we are unable to hire, retain, develop and train employees who are responsible for student recruiting, financial aid, registration, teaching and career services, our operations would be adversely affected.\nRecent and ongoing adverse matters affecting us and our industry, including, without limitation, investigations, claims and lawsuits, and the negative publicity associated with those matters, may make it significantly more difficult for us to attract, motivate and retain employees at all levels of our organization. In addition, volatility or lack of performance in our stock price may also affect our ability to attract and retain key employees, including a new Chief Executive Officer or a new Chief Financial Officer. Our key executives may be more inclined to leave us, because the exercise prices of their stock options are significantly below the market price of our common stock or the perceived value of their restricted stock units continues to decline.\nCompetition could decrease our market share or force us to increase spending. The postsecondary education market in the United States is highly fragmented and competitive, with no single private or public institution enjoying a significant market share. Our campuses compete for students with degree- and non-degree-granting institutions, which include public and private nonprofit colleges and proprietary institutions, as well as with alternatives to higher education, such as military service or immediate employment. Certain public and private colleges offer programs similar to those offered by our campuses at a lower tuition cost due in part to government subsidies, foundation grants, tax deductible contributions or other financial resources not available to proprietary institutions. Other proprietary institutions offer programs that compete with those of our campuses. Certain of our competitors in both the public and private sectors have greater financial and other resources than we do. In addition, recent and ongoing adverse matters affecting us and our industry, including, without limitation, investigations, claims and lawsuits, have resulted in negative publicity related to us and our industry. All of these factors could affect the success of our marketing efforts and enable our competitors to recruit prospective students more effectively.\nWe may be required to increase spending in response to competition in order to retain or attract students or pursue new market opportunities. As a result, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be negatively affected. We cannot be sure that we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors or that competitive pressures faced by us will not adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe may be unable to successfully complete or integrate acquisitions. In August 2013, we acquired Cable Holdings, and in January 2014, we acquired Great Equalizer, Inc. and CompetenC Solutions, Inc. We may consider additional selective acquisitions of schools or education-related businesses in the future. We may not be able to complete acquisitions on favorable terms or, even if we do, we may not be able to successfully integrate the acquired businesses into our business. Acquisition challenges include, among others:\n\u2022\nregulatory approvals;\n\u2022\nsignificant capital expenditures;\n\u2022\nassumption of known and unknown liabilities;\n\u2022\nour ability to control costs; and\n\u2022\nour ability to integrate new personnel.\nThe successful integration of acquisitions may also require substantial attention from our senior management and the senior management of the acquired business, which could decrease the time that they devote to the day-to-day management of our business. If we do not successfully address risks and challenges associated with acquisitions, including integration, acquisitions could harm, rather than enhance, our operating performance.\nIn addition, if we consummate an acquisition, our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly. An acquisition could result in:\n\u2022\nthe incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities;\n\u2022\nan increase in interest expense, amortization expenses, goodwill and other intangible assets;\n\u2022\ncharges relating to integration costs; and\n\u2022\nan increase in the number of shares outstanding.\nThese results could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition or result in dilution to current stockholders.\nTerrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war could have an adverse effect on our operations. Terrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war could disrupt our operations. Attacks or armed conflicts that directly impact our physical facilities or ability to recruit and retain students and employees could adversely affect our ability to deliver our programs of study to our students and, thereby, impair our ability to achieve our financial and operational goals. Furthermore, violent acts and threats of future attacks could adversely affect the U.S. and world economies. Finally, future terrorist acts could cause the United States to enter into a wider armed conflict that could further impact our operations and result in prospective students, as well as our current students and employees, entering military service. These factors could cause significant declines in the number of students who attend our campuses and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nNatural disasters and other acts of God could have an adverse effect on our operations. Hurricanes, earthquakes, floods, tornados and other natural disasters and acts of God could disrupt our operations. Natural disasters and other acts of God that directly impact our physical facilities or ability to recruit and retain students and employees could adversely affect our ability to deliver our programs of study to our students and, thereby, impair our ability to achieve our financial and operational goals. Furthermore, natural disasters could adversely affect the economy and demographics of the affected region, which could cause significant declines in the number of students who attend our campuses in that region and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nA breach of the physical security at any of our locations could harm our business. There have been a number of shooting and other incidents involving violence at post-secondary and other school locations over the last several years. An incident involving violence resulting from a breach of the physical security or otherwise at any of our locations and/or harm to any of our students or employees could expose us to adverse publicity, as well as significant litigation and claims from third parties, which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law, as well as required approvals by the ED, the ACs and most of the SAs, could make an acquisition of us more difficult. Certain provisions of Delaware law, our Restated Certificate of Incorporation and our By-Laws could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire, control of us. Those provisions could:\n\u2022\nlimit the price that certain investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock;\n\u2022\ndiscourage or prevent certain types of transactions involving an actual or threatened change in control of us (including unsolicited takeover attempts), even though such a transaction may offer our stockholders the opportunity to sell their stock at a price above the prevailing market price;\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for stockholders to take certain corporate actions; and\n\u2022\nhave the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us.\nCertain of those provisions authorize us to:\n\u2022\nissue \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock;\n\u2022\ndivide our Board of Directors into three classes expiring in rotation;\n\u2022\nrequire advance notice for stockholder proposals and nominations;\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholders from calling a special meeting; and\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent.\nIn addition, the ED, the ACs and most of the SAs have requirements pertaining to the change in ownership and/or control (collectively \u201cchange in control\u201d) of institutions, but these requirements do not uniformly define what constitutes a change in control and are subject to varying interpretations as to whether a particular transaction constitutes a change in control. If we or any of our campuses experience a change in control under the standards of the ED, the ACs or the SAs, we or the affected campuses must seek the approval of the relevant regulatory agencies. Transactions or events that constitute a change in control for one or more of our regulatory agencies include:\n\u2022\nthe acquisition of a school from another entity;\n\u2022\nsignificant acquisitions or dispositions of our common stock; and\n\u2022\nsignificant changes to the composition of our, or any campus, Board of Directors.\nSome of these transactions or events may be beyond our control. Our failure to obtain, or a delay in obtaining, a required approval of any change in control from the relevant regulatory agencies could impair our ability or the ability of the affected campuses to participate in Title IV Programs, or could require us to suspend our recruitment of students in one or more states until we receive the required approval. A material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows would result if we had a change in control and a material number of our campuses:\n\u2022\nfailed to timely obtain the approvals of the SAs required prior to or following a change in control;\n\u2022\nfailed to timely regain approval by the ACs for inclusion in their institution\u2019s grant of accreditation or have their inclusion in that accreditation temporarily continued or reinstated by the ACs;\n\u2022\nfailed to timely regain eligibility to participate in Title IV Programs from the ED or receive temporary certification to continue to participate in Title IV Programs pending further review by the ED; or\n\u2022\nwere subjected by the ED to restrictions that severely limited for a substantial period of time the number of new additional locations and/or new programs of study that are eligible to participate in Title IV Programs.\nThe fact that a change in control would require approval of the relevant regulatory agencies, and the uncertainty and potential delay related to obtaining such approvals, could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire, control of us.\nThe personal information that we collect may be vulnerable to breach, theft or loss that could adversely affect our reputation and operations. Possession and use of personal information in our operations subjects us to risks and costs that could harm our business. In the ordinary course of our business, we collect, use and retain large amounts of personal information regarding prospective students, students, their families and employees. Some of this personal information is held and managed by certain of our vendors. Although we use security and business controls to limit access and use of personal information, a third party may be able to circumvent those security and business controls, which could result in a breach of student or employee privacy. In addition, errors in the storage, use or transmission of personal information could result in a breach of student or employee privacy. Possession and use of personal information in our operations also subjects us to legislative and regulatory burdens that could require notification of data breaches and restrict our use of personal information. We cannot assure you that a breach, loss or theft of personal information will not occur. A major breach, theft or loss of personal information regarding our students and their families or our employees that is held by us or our vendors could subject us to costly claims or litigation, have a material adverse effect on our reputation and results of operations and result in further regulation and oversight by federal and state authorities and increased costs of compliance. Potential new federal or state laws and regulations also may increase our costs of compliance or limit our ability to use personal information to recruit students.\nSecurity breaches or system interruptions or delays involving our computer networks could disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, limit our ability to attract and retain students and require us to expend significant resources. The performance and reliability of our computer systems are critical to our information management, reputation and ability to attract and retain students. Any system error or failure, or a sudden and significant increase in traffic, could disrupt the provision of education to students attending our campuses. We cannot assure you that we will be able to expand the infrastructure of our computer systems on a timely basis sufficient to meet demand. Our computer systems and operations could be vulnerable to interruption or malfunction due to events beyond our control, including natural disasters and telecommunications failures. Any interruption to our computer systems could have a material adverse effect on our operations and ability to attract and retain students. These factors could affect the number of students who attend our campuses and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur computer systems may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer hackers, computer viruses and other security problems. A user who circumvents security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions or malfunctions in operations. As a result, we may be required to expend significant resources to protect against the threat of those security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by those breaches. These factors could affect the number of students who attend our campuses and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe rely on exclusive proprietary rights and intellectual property that may not be adequately protected under current laws, and we may encounter disputes from time to time relating to our use of intellectual property of third parties. Our success depends in part on our ability to protect our proprietary rights. We rely on a combination of copyrights, trademarks, service marks, trade secrets, domain names and agreements to protect our proprietary rights. We rely on service mark and trademark protection in the United States to protect our rights to distinctive marks associated with our services. We rely on agreements under which we obtain rights to use the \u201cITT\u201d and related marks and course content developed by our faculty, our other employees and third party content experts. We cannot assure you that those measures will be adequate, that we have secured, or will be able to secure, appropriate protections for all of our proprietary rights, or that third parties will not infringe upon or violate our proprietary rights. Despite our efforts to protect those rights, unauthorized third parties may attempt to duplicate or copy the proprietary aspects of our names, curricula and other content. Our management\u2019s attention may be diverted by those attempts and we may need to use funds in litigation to protect our proprietary rights against any infringement or violation.\nWe may encounter disputes from time to time over rights and obligations concerning intellectual property, and we may not prevail in those disputes. In certain instances, we may not have obtained sufficient rights in the content or mode of delivery of a course or a program of study. Third parties may raise a claim against us alleging an infringement or violation of the intellectual property of that third party. Some third party intellectual property rights, such as certain patent rights, may be extremely broad, and it may not be possible for us to conduct our operations in such a way as to avoid infringing upon those intellectual property rights. Any such intellectual property claim could subject us to costly litigation, regardless of whether the claim has merit. Our insurance coverage may not cover potential claims of this type adequately or at all, and we may be required to alter the content or mode of delivery of our courses or programs of study, or pay significant monetary damages, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nRisk Related to Our Common Stock\nThe trading price of our common stock may fluctuate and decline substantially in the future. The trading price of our common stock has fluctuated and declined, and may continue to fluctuate and decline, substantially as a result of a number of factors, some of which are not within our control. Those factors include, among others:\n\u2022\nour ability to meet or exceed our own forecasts or expectations of analysts or investors;\n\u2022\nquarterly variations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nchanges in federal and state laws and regulations and accreditation standards, or changes in the way that laws, regulations and accreditation standards are interpreted and applied;\n\u2022\nthe initiation, pendency or outcome of litigation, regulatory reviews and investigations, and any adverse publicity related thereto;\n\u2022\nthe effects of financial reporting matters, such as material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting, restatements and the Consolidations;\n\u2022\nactions by the NYSE, or uncertainty related to possible actions by the NYSE, related to the continued listing of our common stock;\n\u2022\nnegative media reports with respect to us and/or our industry;\n\u2022\nchanges in our own forecasts or earnings estimates by analysts;\n\u2022\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market, which have affected the market prices of many companies in the proprietary, postsecondary education industry in recent periods;\n\u2022\nthe amount and availability of financing and grant programs for our students;\n\u2022\nthe short interest in our stock at any point in time;\n\u2022\nthe loss of key personnel; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions.\nThose factors could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and could prevent an investor from selling shares of our common stock at or above the price at which those shares were purchased.", "PERMNO": 81128, "SIC": 8200, "TIC": "ESINQ"}
