{"cik": "1133470", "company": "CALAVO GROWERS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-12-21", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the following risks and other information in this Form 10-K. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our results of operations or financial conditions. The following risk factors should be read in conjunction with Part II, Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation\" and the Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Form 10-K.\nBusiness and Operational Risks\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and resulting worldwide economic conditions are adversely affecting, and will likely continue to adversely affect, our business operations, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows and we are unable to predict the extent to which the global COVID-19 pandemic may continue to adversely impact our business operations, financial performance and results of operations.\nManufacturing and Supply Chain Disruption-\nOutbreaks of contagious diseases, including the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak and pandemic, and other adverse public health developments in countries and states where we operate, have had and are expected to continue to have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operational challenges in the manufacturing of our products and the operation of the related supply chains supporting our ability to deliver our products to the consumer. These effects include a potential negative impact on the availability of our key personnel; disruptions of our facilities or facilities of our members, business partners, customers, suppliers, third-party service providers or other vendors; and interruption of domestic and global supply chains, distribution channels, liquidity and capital or financial markets. We are actively monitoring COVID-19 impacts on our supply chain and distribution channels and restrictions on or disruptions of transportation or increased border controls or closures, or other impacts on domestic and global supply chains or distribution channels, could increase our costs for raw materials and commodity costs, increase demand for raw materials and commodities from competing purchasers, limit our ability to meet customer demand or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation or cash flows.\nIn addition, we have taken and will continue to take temporary precautionary measures intended to help minimize the risk of COVID-19 to our employees, including implementation of health and safety measures to protect our employees, supplementing our workforce to compensate for employees disabled or temporarily unable to perform their duties, and temporary disruptions at certain of our manufacturing facilities, which could negatively affect our business. Some of these precautionary measures, and similar precautionary measures that we may take in the future, may result in additional costs. These conditions could lead to more prolonged disruptions and adverse financial impact in the future.\nThe mandated shelter in place and social distancing measures which are we are required to follow create challenges for the successful operation of our facilities. These same measures also impact the ability of our vendors, suppliers, logistics providers, distributors, and customers, to ultimately support the delivery of our products to consumers.\nUncertain Future Consumer Demand -\nWhile we have not experienced a significant loss of demand for our products during the COVID-19 pandemic, continued economic deterioration in the markets in which our products are sold, including unemployment, reductions in disposable income, declining consumer confidence, and perception of our products as non-essential, could result in future declines in the demand for our products. Further, COVID-19 has resulted in a widespread health crisis that has affected and is expected to continue to adversely affect the economies and financial markets of many countries and most areas of the United States, which may affect our ability to obtain additional financing for our businesses and demand for our products and services.\nCosts to confront the COVID-19 Pandemic -\nWe have incurred and may be required to continue to incur for an indeterminable period, increased costs related to overtime and sick pay, government mandated employee leave related to pandemic conditions, incremental pay for working under challenging conditions, temporary employees, temporary facility closures, sanitizing the work environment, and overall increased safety measures. Our operating results may be adversely affected if we fail to adequately manage these costs or if we experience significant unexpected costs in the future.\nThe ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and financial performance depends on many factors that are not within our control. If we are unable to successfully manage our business through the challenges and uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic, our business and operating results could be materially adversely affected.\nIf the COVID-19 pandemic results in a prolonged adverse impact on our operating results, our goodwill and other intangibles assets may be at risk of future impairment.\nWe have significant goodwill and intangibles balances recorded with respect to our RFG reporting unit, which we periodically review for impairment. These assets are sensitive to any significant changes in related results of operations of the underlying businesses. The COVID-19 pandemic has had adverse effects on the RFG, although no impairment of the related goodwill and intangibles balances has occurred during the year ended October 31, 2020. However, we cannot predict the effects that any continued adverse conditions from the pandemic may have on the future impairment of these assets.\nDue to the seasonality of the business, our revenue and operating results may vary from quarter to quarter.\nOur earnings may be affected by seasonal factors, including:\n\u25cf the availability, quality and price of raw materials (including, but not limited to fruit and vegetable inputs);\n\u25cf the timing and effects of ripening and perishability;\n\u25cf the ability to process perishable raw materials in a timely manner;\n\u25cf the leveraging of certain fixed overhead costs during off-season months; and\n\u25cf the slight impacts on consumer demand based on seasonal and holiday timing.\nOur earnings are sensitive to fluctuations in market prices and demand for our products.\nExcess supplies often cause severe price competition in our industry. Growing conditions in various parts of the world, particularly weather conditions such as rainfall, hailstorms, windstorms, floods, droughts, wildfires and freezes, as well as diseases and pests, are primary factors affecting market prices because of their influence on the supply and quality of product.\nFresh produce is highly perishable and generally must be brought to market and sold soon after harvest. The selling price received for each type of produce depends on all of these factors, including the availability and quality of the produce item in the market, and the availability and quality of competing types of produce.\nIn addition, general public perceptions regarding the quality, safety or health risks associated with particular food products could reduce demand and prices for some of our products. Food safety warnings, advisories, notices and recalls such as those administered by the FDA, CDC, other federal/state government agencies and/or suppliers of various agricultural products, could also reduce demand and/or prices for some of our products. To the extent that consumers evolve away from products that we produce for health, food safety or other reasons, and we are unable to modify our products or to develop products that satisfy new consumer preferences, there will be a decreased demand for our products.\nIncreases in commodity or raw product input costs, such as fuel, packaging, and paper, could adversely affect our operating results.\nMany factors may affect the cost and supply of fresh produce, including external conditions, commodity market fluctuations, currency fluctuations, changes in governmental laws and regulations, agricultural programs, severe and prolonged weather conditions and natural disasters. Increased costs for purchased fruit have in the past negatively impacted our operating results, and there can be no assurance that they will not adversely affect our operating results in the future.\nThe price of various commodities can significantly affect our costs. Fuel and transportation cost is a significant component of the price of much of the produce that we purchase from growers, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to pass on to our customers any increased costs we incur in these respects.\nThe cost of paper is also significant to us because most of our products are packed in cardboard boxes. If the price of paper increases and we are not able to effectively pass these price increases along to our customers, then our operating income will decrease.\nWe depend on our infrastructure to have sufficient capacity to handle our annual production needs.\nWe have an infrastructure that has sufficient capacity for our production needs, but if we lose machinery or facilities due to natural disasters or mechanical failure, we may not be able to operate at a sufficient capacity to meet our production needs. This could have a material adverse effect on our business, which could impact our results of operations and our financial condition.\nFailure to optimize our supply chain or disruption of our supply chain could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn coordination with our suppliers, our ability to make, move and sell products is critical to our success. Our inability to maintain sufficient internal production capacity or our inability to enter into co-packing agreements on terms that are beneficial to the Company could have an adverse effect on our business. Failure to adequately handle increasing production costs and complexity, turnover of manufacturing personnel, or production capability and efficiency issues could materially impact our ability to cost effectively produce our products and meet customer demand.\nAdditionally, damage or disruption to our collective manufacturing or distribution capabilities resulting from weather, any potential effects of climate change, natural disaster, disease, crop spoilage, fire or explosion, terrorism, organized crime, pandemics, strikes, repairs or enhancements at our facilities, or other reasons, could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, and may require additional resources to restore our supply chain.\nDisruption of the supply or reliability of low cost transportation services and/or significant increases in the cost of these services could impact our operating income.\nWe use multiple forms of transportation to bring our products to market. They include truck, ocean, and air-cargo. Disruption to the timely supply of these services or dramatic increases in the cost of these services for any reason including availability of fuel for such services, labor disputes, governmental regulation, or governmental restrictions\nlimiting specific forms of transportation could have an adverse effect on our ability to serve our customers and consumers and could have an adverse effect on our financial performance.\nThe acquisition of other businesses could pose risks to our operating income.\nWe intend to review acquisition prospects that would complement our business. While we are not currently a party to any definitive agreement with respect to any acquisitions, we may acquire other businesses in the future. Future acquisitions by us could result in accounting charges, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, and increased debt and contingent liabilities, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and the market price of our common stock. Acquisitions entail numerous risks, including the integration of the acquired operations, diversion of management's attention to other business concerns, risks of entering markets in which we have limited prior experience, and the potential loss of key employees of acquired organizations. We may be unable to successfully integrate businesses or the personnel of any business that might be acquired in the future, and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business and on the market price of our common stock. Management's attention, or other resources, may be diverted if we fail to successfully complete or integrate business combination and investment transactions that further our strategic objectives.\nSystem security risks, data protection breaches, cyber-attacks and systems integration issues could disrupt our internal operations or services provided to customers, and any such disruption could reduce our expected revenue, increase our expenses, damage our reputation and adversely affect our stock price.\nExperienced computer programmers and hackers may be able to penetrate our network security and misappropriate or compromise our confidential information or that of third parties, create system disruptions or cause shutdowns. Computer programmers and hackers also may be able to develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that attack our products or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities of our products. In addition, sophisticated hardware and operating system software and applications that we produce or procure from third parties may contain defects in design or manufacture, including \"bugs\" and other problems that could unexpectedly interfere with the operation of the system. The costs to us to eliminate or alleviate cyber or other security problems, bugs, viruses, worms, malicious software programs and security vulnerabilities could be significant, and our efforts to address these problems may not be successful and could result in interruptions, delays, cessation of service and loss of existing or potential customers that may impede our sales, manufacturing, distribution or other critical functions. Calavo carries insurance, including cyber insurance, commensurate with its size and the nature of its operations, although there is no certainty that such insurance will in all cases be sufficient to fully reimburse us for all losses incurred in connection with the occurrence of any of these system security risks, data protection breaches, cyber-attacks or other events.\nOn Friday, November 29, 2019, certain computer systems at Calavo became encrypted by ransomware, which prevented them from operating. We immediately took steps to isolate those systems and implemented measures to prevent additional systems from being affected, including taking systems offline as a precaution. Third party forensic experts were engaged to assist our IT team to restore those affected systems to operation. We have not experienced, nor do we believe there has been, any material impact to divisional operating activities nor our controls over financial reporting. To date, we have found no evidence of data exfiltration or misappropriation.\nPortions of our IT infrastructure may also experience interruptions, delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with systems integration or migration work that takes place from time to time. We may not be successful in implementing new systems and transitioning data, which could cause business disruptions and be more expensive, time consuming, disruptive and resource-intensive. Such disruptions could adversely impact our ability to fulfill orders and interrupt other processes.\nThe loss of one or more of our largest customers, or a reduction in the level of purchases made by these customers, could negatively impact our sales and profits.\nSales to Kroger and Walmart, our largest customers, amounted to approximately 21% and 13% of our total net sales in 2019. We expect that a significant portion of our revenues will continue to be derived from a relatively small number of customers. We believe these customers make purchase decisions based on a combination of price, product quality,\nconsumer demand, customer service performance, desired inventory levels and other factors that may be important to them at the time the purchase decisions are made. Changes in our customers' strategies or purchasing patterns, including a reduction in the number of brands they carry, may adversely affect our sales. Additionally, our customers may face financial or other difficulties which may impact their operations and cause them to reduce their level of purchases from us, which could adversely affect our results of operations. Customers also may respond to any price increase that we may implement by reducing their purchases from us, resulting in reduced sales of our products. If sales of our products to one or more of our largest customers are reduced, this reduction may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Any bankruptcy or other business disruption involving one of our significant customers also could adversely affect our results of operations.\nHuman Capital Risks\nWe depend on our key personnel and if we lose the services of any of these individuals, or fail to attract and retain additional key personnel, we may not be able to implement our business strategy or operate our business effectively.\nOur future success largely depends on the contributions of our management team. We believe that these individuals\u2019 expertise and knowledge about our industry and their respective fields and their relationships with other individuals in our industry are critical factors to our continued growth and success. We do not carry key person insurance. The loss of the services of any member of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects. Our success also depends upon our ability to attract and retain additional qualified sales, marketing and other personnel.\nWe have recently transitioned new personnel into executive leadership positions and our future success will depend in part on our ability to manage this transition successfully.\nReplacing departing executives can involve organizational disruption and uncertainty. If we fail to manage this transition successfully, we could experience significant delays or difficulty in the achievement of our development and strategic objectives and our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely harmed.\nA portion of our workforce is unionized and labor disruptions could decrease our profitability.\nWhile we believe that our relations with our employees and labor unions are good, we cannot ensure that we will be able to negotiate collective bargaining agreements on favorable terms, or at all, and without production interruptions, including labor stoppages. A prolonged labor dispute, which could include a work stoppage, could have a material adverse effect on the portion of our business affected by the dispute, which could impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe rely on co-packers for a portion of our production needs.\nWe utilize high-quality co-packers to produce a portion of our retail and foodservice products. If we are unable to utilize quality co-packers effectively, we may not be able to meet our production needs for our expected growth. Similar, if an existing co-packer is no longer able or willing to produce products for us, there are no assurances that we will be able to immediately replace them with our own production capacity or that of another co-packer operating in the same region and at the same level of quality. We closely monitor and audit the quality of our co-packers; and furthermore, our co-packers are required to maintain insurance. But we are still subject to risks related to the production of fresh and processed foods.\nIndustry Risks\nWe are subject to increasing competition that may adversely affect our operating results.\nThe fresh produce and prepared food markets in which we operate are highly competitive. Each of our businesses is subject to competitive pressures, including the following:\n\u25cf The market for avocados is impacted by an increasing volume of foreign grown avocados being imported into the United States. Recently, there have been significant plantings of avocados in Mexico, Chile, the Dominican Republic, Peru, Colombia and other parts of the world, which have had, and will continue to have, the effect of increasing the volume of foreign grown avocados entering the United States market.\n\u25cf Avocados are subject to competition from other avocado handlers. If we are unable to consistently pay growers a competitive price for their avocados, these growers may choose to have their avocados marketed by alternate handlers.\n\u25cf Mexican sourced avocados and perishable food products are impacted by competitors operating in Mexico. Generally, handlers of Mexican grown avocados operate facilities that are substantially smaller than our facility in Uruapan, Mexico. If we are unable to pack and market a sufficient volume of Mexican grown avocados, smaller handlers will have a lower per unit cost and be able to offer Mexican avocados at a more competitive price to our customers.\n\u25cf The fresh-cut produce market is highly fragmented and we compete with a variety of national, regional and local manufacturers and distributors of fresh-cut produce in the geographies that we serve. These competitors include both branded and non-branded producers, as well as certain retailers\u2019 own in-house fresh-cut operations. To compete successfully, we must be able to strategically source a wide array of fresh produce and prepared food items of uniformly high quality and sell and distribute it on a timely and regular basis. The overall availability and quality of produce items that we purchase for processing can have a meaningful impact on both RFG\u2019s sales and profitability. Additionally, the short-shelf life nature of these products makes this business highly localized and our success is often related to our ability to manufacture those products within close proximity to our customers\u2019 locations.\nA recall of our products could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, we may be subject to significant liability claims should the consumption of any of our products cause injury, illness or death.\nThe sale of food products for human consumption involves the risk of injury to consumers. Such injuries may result from tampering by unauthorized third parties, product contamination or spoilage, including the presence of foreign objects, substances, chemicals, other agents, or residues introduced during the growing, storage, handling or transportation phases. While we are subject to governmental inspection and regulations and believe our facilities comply in all material respects with all applicable laws and regulations, we cannot be sure that consumption of our products will not cause a health-related illness in the future or that we will not be subject to claims or lawsuits relating to such matters. Even if a product liability claim is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness or injury could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential customers and our corporate and brand image.\nWe and our growers are subject to the risks that are inherent in farming.\nOur results of operations may be adversely affected by numerous factors over which we have little or no control and that are inherent in farming, including reductions in the market prices for our products, adverse weather (including but not limited to drought, high winds, earthquakes and/or wildfire) and growing conditions, pest and disease problems, and new government regulations regarding farming and the marketing of agricultural products.\nDemand for our products is subject to changing consumer preferences.\nConsumer preferences for particular food products are subject to fluctuations over time. Our ability to market and sell our products successfully depends in part on our ability to identify changing consumer preferences and respond to those changes by offering products that appeal broadly to consumers in light of current demands. Shifts in consumer\npreferences that can impact demand for our products at any given time can result from a number of factors, including dietary trends, attention to particular nutritional aspects of our products, concerns regarding the health effects of particular ingredients, attention given to ingredient sourcing practices and general public perception of food safety risks. Consumer demand for our products also may be impacted by any public commentary that consumers or certain regulatory bodies (including federal/state agencies involved in monitoring food safety) may make regarding our products or similar products. Consumer demand for our products also may be impacted by changes in the level of advertising or promotional support that are employed by (i) us, (ii) our retail/foodservice customers, or (iii) relevant industry groups or third parties that provide competing products. If consumer preferences trend negatively with respect to any one or more of our products, our sales volumes may decline as a result.\nRegulatory Risks\nEnvironmental and other regulation of our business, including potential climate change regulation, could adversely impact us by increasing our production cost or restricting our ability to import certain products into the United States.\nClimate change serves as a risk multiplier increasing both the frequency and severity of natural disasters that may affect our business operations. Moreover, there has been a broad range of proposed and promulgated state, national and international regulation aimed at reducing the effects of climate change. Such regulations apply or could apply in countries where we have interests or could have interests in the future. In the United States, there is a significant possibility that some form of regulation will be enacted at the federal level to address the effects of climate change. Such regulation could take several forms that could result in additional costs in the form of taxes, the restriction of output, investments of capital to maintain compliance with laws and regulations, or required acquisition or trading of emission allowances. Climate change regulation continues to evolve, and it is not possible to accurately estimate either a timetable for implementation or our future compliance costs relating to implementation.\nUnanticipated changes in U.S. or international tax provisions, the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our financial performance.\nWe are subject to taxes in the U.S. and Mexico. Due to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. Our effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation.\nWe are also subject to the examination of our tax returns and other tax matters by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the IRS), the Servicio de Administracion Tributaria in Mexico (the SAT) and other tax authorities. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. There can be no assurance that we will accurately predict the outcomes of any audits, and the amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and therefore could have a material impact on our tax provision, net income and cash flows.. If our effective tax rates were to increase, or if the ultimate determination of our taxes owed is for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued, our financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to possible changing USDA and FDA regulations which govern the importation of foreign avocados into the United States and the processing of processed avocado products.\nThe USDA has established, and continues to modify, regulations governing the importation of avocados into the United States. Our permits that allow us to import foreign-sourced avocados into the United States generally are contingent on our compliance with these regulations. Our results of operations may be adversely affected if we are unable to comply with existing and modified regulations and are unable to secure avocado import permits in the future.\nThe FDA establishes, and continues to modify, regulations governing the production of processed avocado products, such as the new Food Safety Modernization Act, which implements mandatory preventive controls for food facilities and compliance with mandatory produce safety standards. Our results of operations may be adversely affected if we are\nunable to comply with these existing and modified regulations. Such failures could also cause reputational damage to our business.\nInternational Risks\nWe work with international third-party suppliers and partners, and our financial results could suffer due to unfavorable international events or regulations.\nWe conduct a substantial amount of business with growers and customers who are located outside the United States. We purchase avocados from foreign growers and packers, sell fresh avocados and processed avocado products to foreign customers, and operate packinghouses and a processing plant in Mexico. In the most recent years, there has been an increase in organized crime in Mexico. This has not had a significant impact on our operations, but this does increase the risk of doing business in Mexico. We are also subject to regulations imposed by the Mexican government, and also to examinations by the Mexican tax authorities. Significant changes to these government regulations and to assessments by the Mexican tax authorities can have a negative impact on our operations and operating results in Mexico. For additional information about our Mexican sourced fruit, see the \"Business\" section included in this Annual Report.\nOur current international operations are subject to a number of inherent risks, including:\n\u25cf Local economic and political conditions, including disruptions in supply, labor, transportation (the transport of consumer goods), trading and capital markets;\n\u25cf Restrictive U.S. and foreign governmental actions, such as restrictions on transfers of funds and trade protection measures, including import/export duties and quotas and customs duties and tariffs; and\n\u25cf Changes in legal or regulatory requirements affecting foreign investment, loans, taxes (including value-added taxes), imports, and exports.\nCurrency exchange fluctuations may impact the results of our operations.\nCurrency exchange rate fluctuations, depending upon the nature of the changes, may make our domestic-sourced products more expensive compared to foreign grown products or may increase our cost of obtaining foreign-sourced products. These foreign currency fluctuations also affect the ultimate realization of foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities in US dollar terms. Because we do not hedge against our foreign currency exposure, our business has increased susceptibility to foreign currency fluctuations.\nFinancial Risks\nOur ability to raise capital in the future may be limited, and our failure to raise capital when needed could prevent us from executing our growth strategy.\nThe timing and amount of our working capital and capital expenditure requirements may vary significantly depending on many factors, including:\n\u25cf Market acceptance of our products; and\n\u25cf The existence of opportunities for expansion.\nIf our capital resources are not sufficient to satisfy our liquidity needs, we may seek to sell additional equity or obtain additional debt financing. The sale of additional equity would result in dilution to our shareholders. Additional debt would result in increased expenses and could result in covenants that would restrict our operations. Although we do not currently foresee the need for significant additional financing, with the exception of our existing credit facility, and we have not made arrangements to obtain additional financing, we may not be able to obtain additional financing, if required, in amounts or on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nOur ownership in unconsolidated subsidiaries, our loans/notes or advances to unconsolidated subsidiaries and other future debt or equity investments that we may make in unconsolidated subsidiaries, present a number of risks and challenges that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nIncome/(loss) from unconsolidated entities includes our allocation of earnings or losses from our investments in FreshRealm and Don Memo. We do not control the operations of these investments, and our allocation of potential income or loss can increase or decrease our overall profitability significantly.\nOn May 20, 2020, the SEC issued a final rule regarding the financial statement requirements for acquisitions and dispositions of a business, which included, among other things, amending (1) certain criteria in the significance tests for equity method investees, such as introducing a revenue component when calculating the income test, (ii) related pro forma financial information requirements including its form and content, and (iii) related disclosure requirements, including the number of acquiree financial statement periods required to be presented in SEC filings. The final rule is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 31, 2020, with early application permitted. The Company determined to adopt this SEC final rule as of October 31, 2020, and as a result, the Company\u2019s investment in FreshRealm was no longer considered a significant subsidiary.\nIn fiscal 2019, we implemented an Accounting Standards Update (ASU) 2016-01, Financial Instruments, Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Liabilities, which requires equity investments (except those accounted for under the equity method of accounting, such as FreshRealm and Don Memo) to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. This adoption impacted our equity investment in Limoneira Company (Limoneira); and as a result, fluctuations in the Limoneira stock price (to be measured, as per the ASU, from quarter-end to quarter-end) are reflected as unrealized gain/(loss) on equity securities in our income statement, and therefore, increase or decrease our overall profitability significantly. Furthermore, from time-to-time we may choose to buy or sell Limoneira shares via methods of execution that are available to us; and to the extent we buy or sell stock in Limoneira, we may also report realized gain/(loss) on equity securities.\nAny loans/notes or advances that we make to unconsolidated entities (such as the existing advances to Don Memo) may at some point in the future be deemed uncollectible and as such may negatively impact, in a material way, our financial results in the period such determination is made. As noted earlier, we do not control the operations of FreshRealm or Don Memo, and their future operating performance and/or their future ability to raise capital from other third parties, could negatively impact our ability to collect on our loans/notes or advances.\nWe have recorded an impairment of 100% of our equity investment in FreshRealm of $2.8 million, and we have recorded a reserve for collectability of 100% of our note receivable balance from FreshRealm of $34.2 million (which includes accrued interest of $4.1 million), and $0.3 million in trade accounts receivable as of October 31, 2020, which resulted in a loss of $37.3 million, which is included in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations under \u201cLoss on reserve for FreshRealm note receivable and impairment of investment\u201d.\nGeneral Risks\nThe value of our common stock may be adversely affected by market volatility and our common stock price has fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate, which may make future prices of our common stock difficult to predict.\nInvestors should not rely on recent or historical trends to predict future stock prices, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Our common stock price, like that of other companies, can be volatile and can be affected by, by many factors, including:\n\u25cf Our operating and financial performance and prospects;\n\u25cf Announcements and public SEC filings we make about our business, financial performance and prospects;\n\u25cf Announcements our customers or competitors make regarding their business, financial performance and prospects;\n\u25cf Short-interest in our common stock, which may be significant from time-to-time;\n\u25cf The depth and liquidity of the market for our common stock;\n\u25cf Investor perception of us and the industry and markets in which we operate;\n\u25cf Our inclusion in, or removal from, any equity market indices;\n\u25cf Changes in earnings estimates or buy/sell recommendations by analysts;\n\u25cf Whether or not we meet earnings estimates of analysts who follow our Company;\n\u25cf Competitors in common markets; and\n\u25cf General financial, domestic, international, economic, industry and other market trends or conditions.\nOur performance may be impacted by general economic conditions or an economic downturn.\nAn overall decline in economic activity could adversely impact our business and financial results. Economic uncertainty may reduce consumer spending as consumers make decisions on what to include in their food budgets. This could also result in a shift in consumer preference. Shifts in consumer spending could result in increased pressure from competitors or customers that may require us to increase promotional spending or reduce the prices of some of our products and/or limit our ability to increase or maintain prices, which could lower our revenue and profitability. Instability in financial markets may impact our ability, or increase the cost, to enter into new credit agreements in the future. Additionally, it may weaken the ability of our customers, suppliers, third-party distributors, banks, insurance companies and other business partners to perform their obligations in the normal course of business, which could expose us to losses or disrupt the supply of inputs we rely upon to conduct our business. If one or more of our key business partners fail to perform as expected or contracted for any reason, our business could be negatively impacted.", "PERMNO": 89447, "SIC": 5140, "TIC": "CVGW"}
