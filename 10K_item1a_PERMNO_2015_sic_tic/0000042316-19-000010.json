{"cik": "42316", "company": "GOLDFIELD CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-12", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nOur business involves various risks associated with the operations of our Company. To provide a framework to understand our operating environment, we are providing a brief explanation of the significant risks associated with our business. Although we have tried to identify and discuss key risk factors, others could emerge in the future. Each of the following risks could affect our performance.\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenue from a small group of customers. The loss of one or more of these customers could negatively impact our revenue and results of operations.\nOur electrical construction customer base is highly concentrated. For the year ended December 31, 2018, our top three customers accounted for approximately 57.2% of our consolidated revenue, as discussed in note 11 to our consolidated\nfinancial statements herein. Our revenue could materially decline if one or more of our significant customers terminated our business relationship. Revenue under our contracts with significant customers may vary substantially from period-to-period. Reduced demand for our services or the loss of one or more of these customers, if not replaced by other business, would result in a decrease in revenue and profits, and could have a material impact on our results of operations.\nThe electrical construction industry is highly competitive.\nThe electrical construction business is highly competitive. We compete with other independent contractors, including larger regional and national firms that may have financial, operational, technical and marketing resources that exceed our own. We also face competition from existing and prospective customers establishing or augmenting in-house service and organizations that employ personnel who perform some of the same types of services as those provided by us. Some of our competitors may have lower cost structures and may, therefore, be able to provide their services at lower rates than we can provide. Many of our current and potential competitors, especially our competitors with national scope, also may have significantly greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. If we fail to compete favorably with new or existing competitors, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOur business is affected by the spending patterns of our customers, exposing us to variable quarterly results.\nOur revenues are primarily driven by the spending patterns of our customers, which can vary significantly from period-to-period, as well as seasonal variations. These variations are influenced by available system outages, bidding seasons, customers\u2019 budgetary constraints, holidays, weather and hours of daylight, which can have a significant impact on our gross margins.\nAn adverse change in economic conditions in the electric utility industry might reduce the demand for our services.\nBecause a substantial portion of our electrical construction work is performed for customers in the electric utility industry, an adverse change in economic conditions in the electric utility industry could impair the financial condition of many of our customers, which may cause them to reduce their capital expenditures and demand for our services.\nSkilled labor shortages and increased labor costs may negatively affect our ability to compete for new projects.\nIn our electrical construction business, we have from time to time experienced shortages of certain types of qualified personnel. The commencement of new, large-scale infrastructure projects, increased demand for infrastructure improvements, departure of workers to storm affected locations and the aging utility workforce reduce the pool of skilled labor available to us, even if we are not awarded such projects. As a result of these factors, the supply of experienced linemen and supervisors may not be sufficient to meet our expected demand and we may not be able to allocate or hire a sufficient number of project managers for new electrical construction projects. We may also spend considerable resources training employees who may then be hired by our competitors, forcing us to spend additional funds to attract personnel to fill those positions. If we were unable to retain sufficient qualified personnel at a reasonable cost, or at all, we would be unable to staff new and existing projects, which would reduce our revenue and profits.\nOur revenue recognition accounting policies may result in a reduction or elimination of previously reported profits.\nAs discussed in Critical Accounting Estimates and in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included herein, a significant portion of our revenue in our electrical construction operations is recognized using the cost-to-cost method, which is standard for fixed-price contracts. Under the cost-to-cost measure of progress, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation. Revenue is recorded proportionally as costs are incurred.\nDue to the nature of the work required to be performed on many of the performance obligations, the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complex, subject to many variables and requires significant judgment. We estimate variable consideration at the most likely amount we expect to receive. We include estimated amounts in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. The estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based largely on an assessment of all information (historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available to us.\nThe earnings or losses recognized on individual contracts are based on these estimates of contract revenue, costs and profitability. The cost of labor and materials, however, may vary from the costs we originally estimated. These variations, along with other risks inherent in performing fixed-price contracts, may cause actual revenue and gross profit for a project to differ from those we originally estimated and may result in reduced profitability or losses on projects. Depending upon the size of a particular project, variations from the estimated contract costs may have a significant impact on our operating results for any quarter or year.\nWe possess a significant amount of accounts receivable and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings assets.\nWe extend credit to our customers as a result of performing work under contract prior to billing our customers for that work. These customers mainly include electric utilities. As of December 31, 2018, we had net accounts receivable of $22.2 million and costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings of $12.0 million. We periodically assess the credit risk of our customers and continuously monitor the timeliness of payments. Slowdowns in the industries we serve may impair the financial condition of one or more of our customers and hinder their ability to pay us on a timely basis or at all. The failure or delay in payment by our customers may reduce our cash flows and adversely impact our liquidity and profitability.\nAmounts included in our backlog may not result in revenue or translate into profits.\nBacklog for our electrical construction operations as of December 31, 2018 was $214.5 million, which represents the estimated amount of revenue that we expect to realize from work to be performed on uncompleted contracts, including new contractual agreements on which work has not begun. Of the total backlog, $170.1 million is attributable to MSAs (other than project-specific firm contracts under MSAs). We determine the estimated amount of backlog for work under MSAs by using recurring historical trends in current MSAs and projected customer needs based upon ongoing communications with the customer. These service agreements do not require our customers to award a minimum amount of contracts and are cancelable on short notice. To the extent that our customers cancel their contracts with us or reduce their requirements during a particular period for any reason, we will not realize revenue or profit from the associated backlog. Furthermore, contracts included in our backlog may not be profitable. We may experience variances in the realization of backlog revenue because of project delays or cancellations, external market factors and economic factors beyond our control. Even if we realize all of the revenue from the projects in our backlog, there is no guarantee of profit from the projects awarded under MSAs. Given these factors and our method of calculating backlog, our backlog at any point in time may not accurately represent the revenue that we expect to realize during any period, and our backlog as of the end of the year may not be indicative of the revenue we expect to earn in the following year and should not be viewed or relied upon as a stand-alone indicator. Consequently, we cannot provide assurance as to our customers\u2019 requirements or our estimates of backlog and should we receive less revenue than expected, our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. For further discussion on how we calculate backlog for our business, please refer to the information set forth in \u201cItem 1. Business\u201d under the caption \u201cBacklog.\u201d\nOur projects are subject to numerous hazards. If we do not maintain an adequate safety record, we may be ineligible to bid on certain projects, may be terminated from existing projects and may have difficulty procuring adequate insurance.\nHazards experienced as a result of our electrical construction operations include electrocutions, fires, mechanical failure and transportation accidents. These hazards can cause and have caused personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment, and other consequential damages, including blackouts, and may result in suspension of our operations on a project, large damage claims, and, in extreme cases, criminal liability. At any given time, we are subject to workers\u2019 compensation claims and claims by employees, customers and third parties for property damage, loss of life and personal injuries resulting from such hazards or other workplace accidents. Further, regulatory changes implemented by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration may impose additional costs on us. Notwithstanding our investment of substantial resources in occupational health and safety programs, our industry involves a high degree of operational risk and we may be unable to avoid accidents resulting from the hazards described above and the associated liability exposure, which may be significant. Furthermore, if serious accidents or fatalities were to occur or if our safety record were to deteriorate, we may become ineligible to bid on certain projects and may be terminated from existing projects, our reputation and our prospects for future projects may be negatively affected, and we may be required to expend additional resources on health and safety programs. In addition, if our safety record were to significantly deteriorate, it would become more difficult and expensive for us to procure adequate insurance.\nAn inability to obtain bonding would have a negative impact on our operations and results.\nOn many of our projects we are required to provide performance bonds to secure our contractual commitments. We have not experienced difficulty in obtaining bonding. However, if we were unable to obtain surety bonds in the future, or were required to post collateral in order to obtain surety bonds, our ability to obtain new contracts would be adversely affected. This may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur capital expenditures may fluctuate as a result of changes in business requirements.\nOur anticipated capital expenditure requirements, primarily for property and equipment for our electrical construction operation, may vary from time to time as a result of the level of our electrical construction operations. Increased capital expenditures will use cash flow and may increase our borrowing costs if cash for capital expenditures is not available from operations.\nWe may be unable to secure sufficient independent subcontractors to fulfill our obligations, or our independent subcontractors may fail to satisfy their obligations.\nWe utilize independent subcontractors to complete work on a portion of our projects. If we are unable to secure independent subcontractors at a reasonable cost or at all, we may be delayed in completing work under a contract or the cost of completing the work may increase. In addition, we may have disputes with these independent subcontractors arising from, among other things, the quality and timeliness of the work they performed. Any of these factors may adversely affect the quality of our service, our ability to perform under certain contracts and the relationship with our customers, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nOur failure to properly manage projects, or project delays, may result in additional costs or claims, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, cash flows and liquidity.\nCertain of our engagements involve large-scale, complex projects. The quality of our performance on such a project depends in large part upon our ability to manage our client relationship and the project itself and to timely deploy appropriate resources, including third-party contractors and our own personnel. Our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity could be adversely affected if we miscalculate the resources or time needed to complete a project with capped or fixed fees, or the resources or time needed to meet contractual milestones. Additionally, delays on a particular project, including permitting, material and weather delays, may cause us to incur costs for standby pay, and may lead to personnel shortages on other projects scheduled to commence at a later date. In addition, some of our agreements require that we share in cost overages or pay liquidated damages if we do not meet project deadlines; therefore, any failure to properly estimate or manage costs, or delays in completion of projects, could subject us to penalties, which could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. Further, any defects or errors, or failures to meet our customers\u2019 expectations could result in large damage claims against us, and because of the substantial cost of, and potentially long lead-times necessary to acquire certain of the materials and equipment used in our more complex projects, damage claims may substantially exceed the amount we can charge for our associated services.\nOur business may be affected by difficult work sites and environments, which could cause delays and increase our costs.\nWe perform work under a variety of conditions, including, but not limited to, difficult and hard to reach terrain and difficult site conditions. Weather changes can materially change work site conditions after initial inspection and bid submittal. Performing work under such conditions can result in project delays or cancellations, potentially causing us to incur additional unanticipated costs, reductions in revenues or the payment of liquidated damages. In addition, most of our contracts require that we assume the risk should actual site conditions vary from those expected.\nOur unionized workforce and related obligations could adversely affect our operations.\nCertain of our employees are represented by labor unions and collective bargaining agreements. Although all such collective bargaining agreements prohibit strikes and work stoppages, we cannot be certain that strikes or work stoppages will not occur despite the terms of these agreements. Strikes or work stoppages would adversely impact relationships with our customers and could cause us to lose business and decrease our revenue. Additionally, as current agreements expire, the labor unions may not be able to negotiate extensions or replacements on terms favorable to their members, or at all, or avoid strikes, lockouts or other labor actions from time to time that may affect their members. Therefore, it cannot be assured that new agreements will be reached with employee labor unions as existing contracts expire, or on terms that we find desirable. Any labor action against us relating to failure to reach an agreement with employee labor unions could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, cash flows and results of operations.\nWe may be required to contribute cash to meet our underfunded obligations in certain multi-employer pension plans.\nOur collective bargaining agreements generally require us to participate with other companies in multi-employer pension plans. To the extent those plans are underfunded, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended by the Multi-Employer Pension Plan Amendments Act of 1980, may subject us to substantial liabilities under those plans if we withdraw from them or they are terminated or experience a mass withdrawal.\nIn addition, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 added special funding and operational rules generally applicable to plan years beginning after 2007 for multi-employer plans that are classified as \u201cendangered,\u201d \u201cseriously endangered,\u201d or \u201ccritical\u201d status. Plans in these classifications must adopt measures to improve their funded status through a funding improvement or rehabilitation plan, which may require additional contributions from employers (which may take the form of a surcharge on benefit contributions) and/or modifications to retiree benefits. A number of multi-employer plans to which we contribute or may contribute in the future could have \u201cendangered,\u201d \u201cseriously endangered\u201d or \u201ccritical\u201d status. The amount of additional funds we may be obligated to contribute to these plans in the future cannot be estimated, as such amounts will likely be based on future work that requires the specific use of union employees covered by these plans, and the amount of that future work and the number of employees that may be affected cannot reasonably be estimated. Our performance of a significant amount of future services in areas that require us to utilize unionized employees covered by these affected plans, or a deterioration in the\nfunding status of any of the plans to which our operating units contribute, could require significant additional contributions, which could detrimentally affect our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows if we are not able to adequately mitigate these costs.\nAdverse weather conditions and climate change risk expose us to variable quarterly results.\nMost of our work is performed outdoors and as a result, our results of operations can be adversely impacted by extended periods of inclement weather. Any weather related delays in the completion of, or which increase the cost of, our projects could adversely affect our revenue and results of operations in any one or more of our reporting periods. We cannot predict with certainty whether climate change is occurring and, if so, at what rate. However, the physical effects of climate change could have a material adverse effect on our properties, operations and business. The potential physical impacts of climate change on our operations are highly uncertain. Climate change may result in, among other things, changing rainfall patterns, changing storm patterns and intensities and changing temperature levels. Because our operating results are significantly influenced by weather, substantial changes in historical weather patterns could significantly impact our future operating results. For example, if climate change results in a greater amount of rainfall, snow, ice, flooding or other less accommodating weather over a greater period of time in a given period, we could experience reduced productivity, which could negatively impact our revenue and gross margins.\nEnvironmental risks.\nWe are subject to numerous federal, state, local and environmental laws and regulations governing our operations, including the handling, transportation and disposal of non-hazardous and hazardous substances and wastes, as well as emissions and discharges into the environment, including discharges to air, surface water and groundwater and soil. We also are subject to laws and regulations that impose liability and cleanup responsibility for releases of hazardous substances into the environment. Under some of these laws and regulations, such liabilities can be imposed for cleanup of previously operated properties regardless of whether we directly caused the contamination or violated any law at the time. The presence of any contamination from substances or wastes could interfere with ongoing operations. In addition, we could be held liable for significant penalties and damages under certain environmental laws and regulations and also could be subject to a revocation of our permits, which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nFrom time to time, we may incur costs and obligations for correcting environmental noncompliance matters and for remediation at or relating to our operations. We believe that we are currently in compliance with our environmental obligations and that any such obligations should not have a material adverse effect on our business or financial performance.\nClimate change issues may result in the adoption of new environmental regulations that may unfavorably impact us, our suppliers, our customers, and subsequently effect how we conduct our businesses. This could also cause us to incur additional direct costs in complying with any new environmental regulations, as well as increased indirect costs resulting from our customers, suppliers, or both, incurring additional compliance costs that are passed on to us. These costs may adversely impact our operations and financial condition. In addition, developments in federal and state legislation and regulation on climate change could result in increased capital expenditures to improve the energy efficiency of our existing properties, equipment and our processes without a corresponding increase in revenue.\nOur operating results may vary significantly from period-to-period.\nOur periodic results may be materially and adversely affected by:\n\u2022the timing and volume of work under contract;\n\u2022changes in national, regional, local and general economic conditions;\n\u2022the budgetary spending patterns of customers;\n\u2022variations in margins of projects performed during any particular quarter;\n\u2022a change in the demand for our services;\n\u2022increased costs of performance of our services caused by severe weather conditions;\n\u2022increases in design and construction costs that we are unable to pass through to our customers;\n\u2022the termination of existing agreements;\n\u2022losses experienced in our operations that are not covered by insurance;\n\u2022a change in the mix of our customers, contracts and business;\n\u2022availability of qualified labor hired for specific projects; and\n\u2022changes in bonding requirements applicable to existing and new agreements.\nOur actual costs may be greater than expected in performing our fixed-price and unit-price contracts.\nWe currently generate, and expect to continue to generate, a significant portion of our revenues and profits under fixed-price and unit-price contracts. We must estimate the costs of completing a particular project when we bid for these types of contracts or when they are awarded under our current MSAs. The actual cost of labor and equipment, however, may vary from the costs we originally estimated and we may not be successful in recouping additional costs from our customers. These variations, along with other risks inherent in performing fixed-price and unit-price contracts, may cause actual revenue and gross profits for a project to differ from those we originally estimated and could result in reduced profitability or losses on projects due to changes in a variety of factors such as:\n\u2022failure to properly estimate costs of engineering, material, equipment or labor;\n\u2022\nunanticipated technical problems with the materials or services being supplied by us, which may require us to incur additional costs to remedy the problem;\n\u2022project modifications that create unanticipated costs;\n\u2022changes in costs of equipment, materials, labor or subcontractors;\n\u2022the failure of our suppliers or subcontractors to perform;\n\u2022difficulties in our customers obtaining required governmental permits or approvals;\n\u2022site conditions that differ from those assumed in the original bid (to the extent contract remedies are unavailable);\n\u2022the availability and skill level of workers in the geographic location of the project;\n\u2022an increase in the cost of fuel or other resources;\n\u2022changes in local laws and regulations;\n\u2022delays caused by local weather conditions, third parties or customers; and\n\u2022quality issues requiring rework.\nWe could be adversely affected by the loss of key management personnel.\nOur future success depends, to a significant degree, on the efforts of our executive officers and senior management, including those of our subsidiaries. Other than with respect to our Chief Executive Officer, we do not have employment agreements with any of our employees. We believe that key members of our senior management possess valuable industry knowledge, relationships and experience that are important to the successful operation of our business. The relationships between our executive officers and senior management and our customers are important to our being retained as a service provider. We are also dependent upon our project managers and field supervisors who are responsible for managing and drawing employees to our projects. There can be no assurance that any individual will continue in his or her capacity for any particular period of time. Industry-wide competition for managerial talent in electrical construction has increased and the loss of one or more of our key employees could negatively impact our ability to manage our business and relationships with our customers. The loss of any of our executive officers or senior management could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe engage in real estate activities which are speculative and involve a high degree of risk.\nThe real estate industry is highly cyclical by nature and future market conditions are uncertain. Factors which adversely affect the real estate and homebuilding industries, many of which are beyond our control, include:\n\u2022the availability and cost of financing;\n\u2022\nunfavorable interest rates and increases in inflation;\n\u2022overbuilding or decreases in demand;\n\u2022changes in national, regional and local economic conditions;\n\u2022cost overruns, inclement weather, and labor and material shortages;\n\u2022the impact of present or future environmental legislation, zoning laws and other regulations;\n\u2022\navailability, delays and costs associated with obtaining permits, approvals or licenses necessary to develop property; and\n\u2022increases in real estate taxes and other local government fees.\nChanges in national and regional economic conditions, as well as local economic conditions where we conduct our real estate development operations and where prospective purchasers of our homes live, can have a negative impact on our business. Adverse changes in employment levels, job growth, consumer confidence, interest rates and population growth may reduce demand and depress prices for our homes. This, in turn, can reduce our earnings.\nThe homebuilding industry is cyclical and is significantly affected by changes in general and local economic conditions, such as employment levels; availability of financing for homebuyers; interest rates; consumer confidence; levels of new and existing homes for sale; demographic trends and housing demand. If any adverse conditions affect our markets, they could have a proportionately greater or lesser impact on us versus other homebuilding companies. An excess supply of housing, including homes held for sale by investors, banks and other lending institutions, can also lower new residential property prices and reduce our gross margins on new home sales.\nAs a result of the foregoing, potential customers may be less willing or able to buy our homes, or we may take longer or incur more costs to build them. We may not be able to recapture increased costs by raising prices in many cases because of market conditions or because we fix our prices in advance of delivery by signing residential property sales contracts. We may be unable to change the affordability of our residential properties to maintain our margins or satisfactorily address changing market conditions in other ways. In addition, cancellations of residential property sales contracts from time to time may increase if homebuyers\u2019 sentiment changes and they may fail to honor their contracts.\nThe residential real estate development industry is highly competitive and, if others are more successful, our business could decline.\nWe operate in a very competitive environment, which is characterized by competition from a number of other real estate developers. We compete with large national and regional development companies and with smaller local firms for land, financing, raw materials and skilled management and labor resources. We also compete with the resale, or \u201cpreviously owned\u201d market. Increased competition could cause us to increase our selling incentives and/or reduce our prices. Increased competition could also result in an oversupply of new homes or other housing alternatives available, which could depress the prices at which we can sell our homes, and increase the length of time it takes us to sell them. If a failure to compete effectively resulted in our selling fewer homes at lower prices, our results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected. Due to various contingencies, like delayed construction and buyer defaults, we may receive less cash than we expected, which could affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf land is not available at reasonable prices, our sales and earnings could decrease.\nOur real estate development operations depend on our ability to obtain land at reasonable prices for our developments. Changes in the general availability of land, competition for available land, availability of financing to acquire land, zoning regulations that limit housing density and other market conditions may hurt our ability to obtain land for new residential developments. If the supply of land appropriate for development becomes more limited because of these factors, or for any other reason, the cost of land could increase, which could reduce the profitability of our real estate development operations if we are unable to recover these costs in the sales prices of our homes, and the number of homes that we build and sell could be reduced, which would reduce our revenue.\nIf the market value of our land and developments drops significantly, our profits could decrease.\nThe market value of our land and home inventories of our real estate development operations depends on market conditions. We acquire land for replacement of land inventory and expansion within our current market. If housing demand decreases below what we anticipated when we acquired our inventory, we may not be able to make profits similar to what we have made in the past, may experience less than anticipated profits and may not be able to recover our costs when we sell our property or finished product. In the face of adverse market conditions, we may have substantial inventory carrying costs or may have to sell land or completed units at a loss, which would have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Also, if there is a decrease in demand for homes such that the market value of a home is less than purchase price reduced by the deposit made by a buyer, the buyer may elect to forfeit their deposit to us and have no further obligation to purchase the home, resulting in a loss of revenue, operating income and a possible write-down of homes in inventory.\nGovernment regulations and legal challenges may delay the start or completion of our developments, increase our expenses or limit our building activities, which could have a negative impact on our operations.\nWe must obtain the approval of numerous governmental authorities in connection with our real estate development operations, and these governmental authorities often have broad discretion in exercising their approval authority. We incur substantial costs related to compliance with legal and regulatory requirements. Any increase in legal and regulatory requirements may cause us to incur substantial additional costs, as discussed below. Various local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning building, zoning, sales and similar matters apply to and/or affect the homebuilding industry. Municipalities may restrict or place moratoriums on the availability of utilities, such as water and sewer taps. In some areas, municipalities may enact growth control initiatives, which will restrict the number of building permits available in a given year.\nThis governmental regulation affects construction activities as well as sales activities, mortgage lending activities and other dealings with consumers. The industry also has experienced an increase in state and local legislation and regulations which limit the availability or use of land. We may be required to apply for additional approvals or modify our existing approvals because of changes in local circumstances or applicable law. Further, we may experience delays and increased expenses as a result of legal challenges to our proposed developments, whether brought by governmental authorities or private parties.\nIncreases in taxes or government fees could increase our costs, and adverse changes in tax laws could reduce customer demand for our homes.\nIncreases in real estate taxes and other local government fees, such as fees imposed on developers to fund schools, open space, road improvements, or to provide low or moderate income housing, could increase our costs and have an adverse effect on our real estate development operations if we are unable to recover these costs in the sales prices of our homes. In addition, increases in local real estate taxes could adversely affect our potential customers who may consider those costs in determining whether to make a new home purchase and decide, as a result, not to purchase one of our homes. In addition, any changes in the income tax laws that would reduce or eliminate tax deductions or incentives to homeowners could make housing less affordable or otherwise reduce the demand for housing, which in turn could reduce our sales and adversely affect our revenues. Specifically, the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d), which was enacted in December 2017, establishes new limits on the federal tax deductions individual taxpayers may take on mortgage loan interest payments and on state and local taxes, including property taxes. These changes could reduce the actual or perceived affordability of homeownership, which could adversely affect demand for and sales prices of new homes.\nOur real estate business is concentrated in Florida, which increases our exposure to local adverse events.\nIn our real estate development operations, we currently develop and sell homes only on the east coast of Central Florida. As a consequence, our exposure to local adverse events, such as natural disasters or changes in economic conditions, is increased. In particular, Florida is affected by tropical storms and hurricanes, which can damage or destroy buildings. The occurrence of such a storm or other natural disaster could result in delays in construction and shortages and increased costs of labor and building materials. Any such delays or additional costs could adversely affect the profitability of our real estate development operations.\nAdditionally, the inability of property owners to obtain cost-effective insurance could have an adverse effect on demand for property in our markets, which could reduce our revenue. Furthermore, there are periods of time during which insurance companies will not write policies because of the presence of a named storm that may pass over the areas in which we sell homes. During these periods, home closings in areas that could be affected by such a storm will be delayed until the risk of the storm has passed and the required insurance can be obtained.\nAdverse weather conditions and conditions in nature beyond our control could significantly impact our revenue and profitability.\nIn our real estate development operations, adverse weather conditions and natural disasters, such as, but not limited to, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods and fires, can have serious effects on our ability to perform work. We also may be affected by unforeseen engineering, environmental or geological problems. Any of these adverse events or circumstances could cause delays in the completion of, or increase the cost of, our projects and, as a result, could adversely affect our sales, earnings and profitability.\nIn addition, approaching storms require that sales, development and construction operations be suspended in favor of storm preparation activities such as securing construction materials and equipment. After a storm has passed, construction-related resources such as sub-contracted labor and building materials are likely to be redeployed to hurricane recovery efforts around the State of Florida.\nGovernmental permitting and inspection activities may similarly be focused primarily on returning displaced residents to homes damaged by the storms, rather than on new construction activity. Depending on the severity of the damage caused by the storms, disruptions such as these could last for several months.\nIf we experience shortages of labor and supplies or other circumstances beyond our control, there could be delays or increased costs in developing our homes, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur ability to develop land and construct homes may be affected by circumstances beyond our control, including: work stoppages, labor disputes and shortages of qualified trades people, such as carpenters, roofers, electricians and plumbers; lack of availability of adequate utility infrastructure and services; our need to rely on local subcontractors who may not be adequately capitalized or insured; and shortages, or delays in availability, or fluctuations in prices of, building materials. Any of these circumstances could give rise to delays in the start or completion of, or increase the cost of, one or more of our developments. If we are not able to recover these increased costs by raising the prices of our homes we might decide to postpone or cancel the development of projects on which we have not yet begun construction. If that happens, our operating\nresults could be harmed. Additionally, we may be limited in the amount we can raise sales prices by our customers\u2019 unwillingness to pay higher prices.\nProduct liability litigation and warranty claims that arise in the ordinary course of business may be costly, which could adversely affect our business.\nAs a real estate developer, we are subject to construction defect and home warranty claims arising in the ordinary course of business. These claims, which can include bodily injury claims and mold-related property damage claims among others, are common in the homebuilding industry and can be costly. In addition, the costs of insuring against construction defect and product liability claims are high, and the amount of coverage offered by insurance companies is currently limited. There can be no assurance that this coverage will not be further restricted and become more costly. If we are not able to obtain adequate insurance against these claims, we may experience losses that could have an adverse affect on our results of operations and financial condition, which could be material.\nIf we are not able to obtain suitable financing, our business may decline.\nOur real estate development operations depend substantially on our ability to obtain financing for the development of our projects. If we are not able to obtain suitable financing, our costs would increase and our revenue would decrease, or we could be precluded from continuing our operations at current levels. Increases in interest rates can make it more difficult and expensive for us to obtain the funds we need to operate our business, which would have an adverse affect on our profitability.\nIf our potential customers are not able to obtain suitable financing, our business may decline.\nOur real estate development operations also depend on the ability of our potential customers to obtain mortgages for the purchase of our homes. An increase in default rates, fewer loan products and stricter loan qualification standards may make it more difficult for some borrowers to finance the purchase of our homes. Increases in the cost of home mortgage financing could prevent our potential customers from purchasing our homes. In addition, where our potential customers must sell their existing homes in order to buy a new home from us, increases in mortgage costs could prevent the buyers of our customers\u2019 existing homes from obtaining the mortgages they need to complete the purchase, which could result in our potential customers\u2019 inability to buy a home from us. Furthermore, changes in government sponsored entities involved in the residential mortgage market such as Fannie Mae and FHA could affect mortgage rates, down payment requirements and our customers\u2019 ability to obtain affordable financing, which could subsequently affect our customers\u2019 ability to purchase our products. If our potential customers or the buyers of our customers\u2019 current homes are not able to obtain suitable financing, our sales and revenue could decline.\nWe depend upon the availability and skill of subcontractors.\nSubstantially all our construction work is done by subcontractors. Accordingly, the timing and quality of our construction depends on the availability and skill of those subcontractors. We do not have long-term contractual commitments with any particular subcontractors or suppliers. Although we believe that our relationships with our subcontractors and suppliers are good, we cannot assure you that skilled subcontractors will continue to be available to us at reasonable rates. The inability to contract with skilled subcontractors at reasonable costs on a timely basis could limit our ability to build and deliver homes and could have a material adverse effect on the operating results of our real estate development operations. Additionally, if there is an impairment, bankruptcy or default by subcontractors or suppliers our production, revenue and operating income may be adversely affected.\nWe rely on outside professionals whose errors could increase our costs.\nWe often collaborate with numerous professionals such as architects and engineers in the development of our real estate projects. In the course of our business, we rely on the work of these professionals to help design and permit the homes that we develop, and errors in their work can create significant increases in cost and delays in construction.\nOur revenue and operating results have fluctuated in the past and may continue to do so in the future.\nOur revenue and operating results from real estate development operations are subject to fluctuations. Because we typically do not have more than one or two projects under development at any time, factors such as the timing of the start of construction of new projects, the timing of receipt of regulatory approvals for development and construction and others can cause our revenue and operating results to vary from period to period and from year to year. Accordingly, the historical financial performance of our real estate development operations is not necessarily a meaningful indicator of future results for any particular period, and quarter-to-quarter comparisons should not be relied upon as an indicator of future performance.\nWe may be subject to environmental liabilities that could adversely affect our results of operations or the value of our properties.\nThe development and sale of real property creates a potential for environmental liability on our part as owner and developer, for our own acts as well as the acts of prior owners, current owners or past owners of adjacent parcels. If hazardous substances are\ndiscovered on or emanating from any of our properties, we may be held liable for costs and liabilities relating to those hazardous substances. Should a substantial environmental hazard be found on any of our properties, our results of operations and the value of the contaminated property could be adversely affected.\nIncreased insurance risk could negatively affect our business.\nInsurance and surety companies may take actions that could negatively affect our business, including increasing insurance premiums, requiring higher self-insured retentions and deductibles, requiring additional collateral or covenants on surety bonds, reducing limits, restricting coverages, imposing exclusions, and refusing to underwrite certain risks and classes of business. Any of these actions may adversely affect our ability to obtain appropriate insurance coverage at reasonable costs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nChanges in tax laws.\nChanges in tax laws or tax rates may have a material impact on our future cash expended for taxes, effective tax rate or deferred tax assets and liabilities. These conditions are beyond our control and may have a significant impact on our business, results of operations, liquidity, and financial position. See \u201cItem 7 Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on the impact of the Tax Act.\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nBorrowings under our credit facility are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness will increase even though the amount borrowed remains the same, and net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, will correspondingly decrease.\nWe could be adversely affected by environmental liabilities associated with our former mining business.\nThe Company was previously engaged in mining activities and disposed of our last mining property over 15 years ago. Although we are not aware of any current environmental investigations relating to previously owned sites, we could still be liable for previous activities at such sites. For example, in 2015 we completed remediation activities at a mining site which we sold over 50 years ago, as discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.\nThe violation of our debt covenants imposed by our credit facility could impact our access to that credit facility and therefore our cash flows.\nOur debt arrangements contain various financial and other covenants including, but not limited to: minimum tangible net worth, outside debt limitation, maximum debt to tangible net worth ratio and fixed charge coverage ratio. Our loans also have cross-default provisions whereby any default under any loans of the Company (or its subsidiaries) with the lender will constitute a default under all of the other loans of the Company (and its subsidiaries) with the lender. Although we are in compliance with all covenants, if we were to experience substantial losses, absent a modification of the loan agreement or a waiver, this could result in a violation of the financial covenants. A violation of our financial covenants will give the right to our lender to accelerate our loans. Under these circumstances, there can be no assurance that we could obtain a modification or waiver. The acceleration of all of our loans would adversely affect our cash flows and consequently our results of operations.\nFailure to protect critical data and technology systems adequately could materially affect our operations.\nWe use our own information technology systems as well as those of business partners to manage our operations and other business processes and to protect sensitive information maintained in the normal course of business. Third-party security breaches, employee error, malfeasance or other irregularities may compromise our measures to protect these systems and may result in persons obtaining unauthorized access to our or our customers\u2019 data or accounts. The occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business.", "PERMNO": 32299, "SIC": 1623, "TIC": "GV"}
