RISK FACTORS.\nRisks Related to our Business and Financial Condition\nOur independent auditors have expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nFor each of the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, our independent auditors issued an explanatory paragraph in their audit report expressing substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern based upon our net loss and negative cash flows from operations for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013 and our levels of working capital as of December 31, 2014 and 2013. The financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of these uncertainties. Management is planning to raise any necessary additional funds through loans and additional sales of its common stock; however, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising any necessary additional capital. If we are not successful in raising additional capital, we may not have enough financial resources to support our business and operations and as a result may not be able to continue as a going concern.\nWe have a history of operating losses and may continue to incur operating losses.\nWe have a history of operating losses and may be unable to generate sufficient revenue to achieve profitability in the future. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2014, our operating losses were $1,873,505. Our accumulated deficit was $38,560,694 at December 31, 2014. Furthermore, we do not anticipate having an operating profit in 2015. Our ability to generate operating profit in the future will depend on our ability to successfully produce and commercialize multiple web series, as no single project is likely to generate sufficient revenue to cover our operating expenses. If we are unable to generate an operating profit at some point, we will not be able to meet our debt service requirements or our working capital requirements. As a result we may need to (i) issue additional equity, which could dilute the value of your share holdings, (ii) sell a portion or all of our assets, including any project rights which might have otherwise generated revenue, or (iii) cease operations.\nThe agreement with our CEO from which we derived the majority of our revenues in 2013 and 2014 expired on December 31, 2014 and was not renewed.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2014 the majority of our revenues were derived from production management and back office services to Dolphin Films, an entity directly owned by Mr. O\u2019Dowd. This agreement ended on December 31, 2014 and was not renewed for 2015 as the specific projects for which our services were engaged were completed. If we are unable to generate sufficient revenues from other sources during 2015, the loss of this related party transaction will have a material negative impact on our cash flows and could result in us significantly reducing our operations, selling additional equity to fund operations or ceasing operations. Our business requires a substantial investment of capital and failure to access sufficient capital while awaiting delayed revenues will have a material adverse effect on our results of operation.\nThe production, acquisition and distribution of a digital production require a significant amount of capital. A significant amount of time may elapse between our expenditure of funds and the receipt of revenues from our productions. We do not have a traditional credit facility with a financial institution on which to depend for our liquidity needs and a time lapse may require us to fund a significant portion of our capital requirements through related party transactions with our CEO or other financing sources. There can be no assurance that any additional financing resources will be available to us as and when required, or on terms that will be acceptable to us. Our inability to raise capital necessary to sustain our operations while awaiting delayed revenues would have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to recoup our investments in digital projects.\nSimilar to others in the entertainment industry, we purchase scripts and project ideas for which we have no current production plans and for which we have not identified a potential distributor. In 2011 and 2012, we purchased scripts for eleven digital projects related to a particular financing structure. We currently have nine projects that have not been developed with a total cost of $468,000. As of December 31, 2014, we have not identified a distributor or sufficient advertisers who are interested in the development and distribution of those digital projects. If we are unable to generate interest in the nine projects, then the costs incurred to purchase those scripts will be written off, which will adversely affect our results of operations.\nDelays, cost overruns, cancellation or abandonment of the completion or release of our digital web series may have an adverse effect on our business.\nThere are substantial financial risks relating to production, completion and release of digital films or series. Actual film costs may exceed their budgets and factors such as labor disputes, unavailability of a star performer, equipment shortages, disputes with production teams or adverse weather conditions may cause cost overruns and delay or hamper film completion. We are typically responsible for paying all production costs in accordance with a budget and received a fixed producer\u2019s fee for our services plus a portion of any project income, however to the extent that delays, failure to complete projects or cost overruns result in us not completing the film or series within budget, there may not be enough funds left to pay us our producer\u2019s fee, to generate any project income or complete the project at all. If this were to occur, it would significantly and adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting and our ability to both timely and accurately report our financial results could be adversely affected.\nIn connection with the preparation of our financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, we identified several material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. As of December 31, 2014, we concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective due to the following material weaknesses:\n\u25cf Design deficiencies related to the entity level control environment, including risk assessment, information and communication and monitoring controls:\n\u25cf The Board of Directors does not maintain minutes of its meetings.\n\u25cf There is no documented fraud risk assessment or risk management oversight function.\n\u25cf\nThere are no documented procedures related to financial reporting matters (both internal and external) to the appropriate parties.\n\u25cf\nThere is no budget prepared and therefore monitoring controls are not designed effectively as current results cannot be compared to expectations.\n\u25cf\nThere is no documented process to monitor and remediate deficiencies in internal controls.\n\u25cf Inadequate documented review and approval of certain aspects of the accounting process including the documented review of accounting reconciliations and journal entries that they considered to be a material weakness in internal control. Specifically:\n\u25cf\nThere is no documented period end closing procedures, specifically the individuals that are responsible for preparation, review and approval of period end close functions.\n\u25cf\nReconciliations are performed on all balance sheet accounts, including noncontrolling interest on at least a quarterly basis; however there is no documented review and approval by a member of management that is segregated from the period end financial reporting process.\n\u25cf There is no review and approval for the posting of journal entries.\n\u25cf Inadequate segregation of duties within the accounting process, including the following:\n\u25cf\nOne individual has the ability to add vendors to the master vendor file. This individual also has access to the Company checkbook that is maintained in a secured location.\n\u25cf\nOne individual has sole access to our information technology system to initiate, process and record financial information. We have not developed any internal controls related to information technology systems including change management, physical security, access or program development.\nWhile we have taken a number of remedial actions to address these material weaknesses, we cannot predict the outcome of our remediation efforts at this time. Each of the material weaknesses described above could result in a misstatement of our accounts or disclosures that would result in a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements that would not be prevented or detected. We cannot assure you that the measures we have taken to date, or any measures we may take in the future, will be sufficient to remediate the material weaknesses described above or avoid potential future material weaknesses. If we are unable to report financial information timely and accurately or to maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures, our stock price could be negatively impacted and we could be subject to, among other things, regulatory or enforcement actions by the SEC.\nWe rely on third party relationships with online digital platforms for our advertising revenue and we may be unable to secure such relationships.\nWe anticipate entering into distribution agreements containing revenue share provisions with online digital platforms to distribute our digital productions. Pursuant to these revenue share provisions, we will earn a portion of advertising revenues once our digital productions are distributed online. If we fail to secure such relationships with online digital platforms, we will not be able to earn advertising revenues from our digital projects, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to attract or retain advertisers, which could negatively impact our results of operation.\nTypically, online digital platforms are responsible for securing advertisers and, as such, our ability to earn advertising revenues would depend on their success in doing so. However, at times we have, and may continue to, proactively secure advertising commitments against anticipated web series. Our ability to retain advertisers is contingent on our ability to successfully complete and deliver online projects which are commercially successful, which we may fail to do. Advertising revenues could also be adversely impacted by factors outside our control such as failure of our digital productions to attract our target viewer audiences, lack of future demand for our digital productions, the inability of third party online digital platforms to deliver ads in an effective manner, competition for advertising revenue from existing competitors or new digital media companies, declines in advertising rates, adverse legal developments relating to online advertising, including legislative and regulatory developments and developments in litigation. The existence of any of these factors could result in a decrease of our anticipated advertising revenues.\nOur kids clubs depend on sponsorship donations to generate revenue.\nWe generate revenues from our online kids clubs through a portion of the sale of memberships to various donors. Donors typically sponsor a school for $10,000 which entitles each child in the school to receive an annual online kids club membership and entitles the school to receive a Reading Oasis. Receipt of sponsorship donations are unpredictable and depend on a number of factors such as our ability to successfully brand, market and implement the online kids clubs as well as local and international business and economic conditions.\nOur CEO owns approximately 54% of our outstanding share capital and his interests may be different from yours.\nAs of December 31, 2014, our CEO, Mr. O\u2019Dowd beneficially owned approximately 54% of our outstanding share capital. Consequently, Mr. O\u2019Dowd has substantial influence over our business, including election of directors, declaration of dividends and decisions regarding whether or not to issue stock and for what consideration, whether or not to sell all or substantially all of our assets and for what consideration and other significant corporate actions. It is possible that Mr. O\u2019Dowd may act in a manner that advances his best interests but may not be aligned with your interests or the best interests of the Company.\nRisks Related to the Industry\nWe have and may in the future be adversely affected by union activity.\nWe retain the services of actors who are covered by collective bargaining agreements with Screen Actors Guild - American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (\u201cSAG-AFTRA\u201d) and we may also become signatories to certain guilds such as Directors Guild of America and Writers Guild of America in order to allow us to hire directors and talent for our productions. Collective bargaining agreements are industry-wide agreements, and we lack practical control over the negotiations and terms of these agreements. In addition, our digital projects fall within SAG-AFTRA\u2019s definition of \u201cnew media\u201d, which is an emerging category covered by its New Media and Interactive Media Agreements for actors. As such, our ability to retain actors is subject to uncertainties that arise from SAG-AFTRA\u2019s administration of this relatively new category of collective bargaining agreements. Such uncertainties have resulted and may continue to result in delays in production of our digital projects.\nIn addition, if negotiations to renew expiring collective bargaining agreements are not successful or become unproductive, the union could take actions such as strikes, work slowdowns or work stoppages. Strikes, work slowdowns or work stoppages or the possibility of such actions could result in delays in production of our digital projects. We could also incur higher costs from such actions, new collective bargaining agreements or the renewal of collective bargaining agreements on less favorable terms. Depending on their duration, union activity or labor disputes could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe popularity and commercial success of our digital productions are subject to numerous factors, over which we may have limited or no control.\nThe popularity and commercial success of our digital productions depends on many factors including, but not limited to, the key talent involved, the timing of release, the promotion and marketing of the digital production, the quality and acceptance of other competing programs released into the marketplace at or near the same time, the availability of alternative forms of entertainment, general economic conditions, the genre and specific subject matter of the digital production, its critical acclaim and the breadth, timing and format of its initial release. We cannot predict the impact of such factors on any digital production, and many are factors that are beyond our control. As a result of these factors and many others, our digital productions may not be as successful as we anticipate, and as a result, our results of operations may suffer.\nWe may be unable to consistently create and distribute filmed entertainment that meets the changing preferences of our consumers.\nChanging consumer tastes affect our ability to predict which digital productions will be popular with web audiences. As we invest in various digital projects, stars and directors, it is highly likely that at least some of the digital projects in which we invest will not appeal to our target audiences. If we are unable to produce web content that appeals to our target audiences the costs of such digital productions could exceed revenues generated and anticipated profits may not be realized. Our failure to realize anticipated profits could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe creation of content for the entertainment industry is highly competitive and we will be competing with companies with much greater resources than we have.\nThe business in which we engage is highly competitive. Our primary business operations are subject to competition from companies which, in many instances, have greater development, production, and distribution and capital resources than us. We compete for the services of writers, producers, directors, actors and other artists to produce our digital content. In addition, larger companies have a broader and more diverse selection of scripts than we do, which translates to a greater probability that they will be able to more closely fit the demands and interests of advertisers than we can. Such competition for the industry\u2019s talent and resources may have an effect on our ability to acquire and produce product.\nOthers may assert intellectual property infringement claims or liability claims for media content against us which may force us to incur substantial legal expenses.\nThere is a possibility that others may claim that our productions and production techniques misappropriate or infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties with respect to their previously developed digital web series, stories, characters, other entertainment or intellectual property. In addition, as a distributor of media content, we may face potential liability for such claims as defamation, invasion of privacy, negligence or other claims based on the nature and content of the materials distributed. If successfully asserted, our insurance may not be adequate to cover any of the foregoing claims. Irrespective of the validity or the successful assertion of such claims, we could incur significant costs and diversion of resources in defending against them, which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nIf we fail to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights adequately, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur ability to compete depends, in part, upon successful protection of our intellectual property. We attempt to protect proprietary and intellectual property rights to our productions through available copyright and trademark laws and distribution arrangements with companies for limited durations. Unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our intellectual property or to obtain and use property that we regard as proprietary. We cannot assure you that our means of protecting our proprietary rights will be adequate. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as the laws of the United States. Intellectual property protections may also be unavailable, limited or difficult to enforce in some countries, which could make it easier for competitors to steal our intellectual property. Our failure to protect adequately our intellectual property and proprietary rights could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur online activities are subject to a variety of laws and regulations relating to privacy and child protection, which, if violated, could subject us to an increased risk of litigation and regulatory actions.\nIn addition to our company websites and applications, we use third-party applications, websites, and social media platforms to promote our projects and engage consumers, as well as monitor and collect certain information about users of our online forums. A variety of laws and regulations have been adopted in recent years aimed at protecting children using the internet such as the Children\u2019s Online Privacy and Protection Act of 1998 (\u201cCOPPA\u201d). COPPA sets forth, among other things, a number of restrictions on what website operators can present to children under the age of 13 and what information can be collected from them. There are also a variety of laws and regulations governing individual privacy and the protection and use of information collected from such individuals, particularly in relation to an individual\u2019s personally identifiable information (e.g., credit card numbers). Many foreign countries have adopted similar laws governing individual privacy, including safeguards which relate to the interaction with children. If our online activities were to violate any applicable current or future laws and regulations, we could be subject to litigation and regulatory actions, including fines and other penalties.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nFuture equity issuances could result in dilution of your investment and a decline in our stock price.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the near term, and may seek to do so by conducting one or more private placements of equity securities, selling additional securities in a registered public offering, or through a combination of one or more of such financing alternatives. Such issuance of additional securities would dilute the equity interests of our existing shareholders, perhaps substantially, and may cause our stock price to decline.\nAs an issuer of \u201cpenny stock,\u201d the protection provided by the federal securities laws relating to forward-looking statements does not apply to us and as a result we could be subject to legal action which may be costly.\nAlthough federal securities laws provide a safe harbor for forward-looking statements made by a public company that files reports under the federal securities laws, this safe harbor is not available to issuers of penny stocks. As a result, for as long as we are a penny stock, we will not have the benefit of this safe harbor protection in the event of any legal action based upon a claim that the material provided by us contained a material misstatement of fact or was misleading in any material respect because of our failure to include any statements necessary to make the statements not misleading.\nOur common stock is quoted only on the OTC Bulletin Board, which has and may continue to have an unfavorable impact on our stock price and liquidity.\nOur common stock is quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board. The OTC Bulletin Board is a significantly more limited market than the New York Stock Exchange or NASDAQ system. Since January 1, 2015, we have recorded only 10 days of trading on our common stock, resulting in an illiquid market available for existing and potential shareholders to trade shares of our common stock. The quotation of our shares on the OTC Bulletin Board may continue to result in an illiquid market available for existing and potential stockholders to trade shares of our common stock and depress the trading price of our common stock, and may have a long-term adverse impact on our ability to raise capital in the future.", "PERMNO": 17140, "SIC": 8700, "TIC": "DLPN"}
