Risk Factors\nIn determining whether to invest in our securities, investors should consider, among other factors, the following:\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe may not realize the anticipated benefits from our proposed acquisition of Delaware Bancshares, Inc.\nOn March 10, 2016, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the \u201cMerger Agreement\u201d) with Delaware Bancshares, Inc. (\u201cDelaware Bancshares\u201d) and its wholly owned subsidiary, The National Bank of Delaware County (\u201cNBDC Bank\u201d), pursuant to which Delaware Bancshares will merge with and into the Company and immediately thereafter, NBDC Bank will merge with and into the Bank. The acquisition of Delaware Bancshares will extend our market reach into the contiguous New York counties of Delaware and Sullivan. The success of this transaction, however, will depend on, among other things, our ability to realize anticipated cost savings and to combine the businesses of the Bank and NBDC Bank in a manner that permits growth opportunities and does not materially disrupt the\n- 23 -\nexisting customer relationships of NBDC Bank nor result in decreased revenues resulting from any loss of customers. If we are not able to successfully achieve these objectives, the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected.\nNorwood Financial Corp. and Delaware Bancshares have operated and, until the completion of the transactions, will continue to operate, independently. Certain Delaware Bancshares employees may not be employed by us after the transaction. In addition, Delaware Bancshares employees that we wish to retain may elect to terminate their employment as a result of the acquisition, which could delay or disrupt the integration process. It is possible that the integration process could result in the disruption of Delaware Bancshare\u2019s ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with customers and employees or to achieve the anticipated benefits of the acquisition.\nWe hold certain intangible assets that could be classified as impaired in the future. If these assets are considered to be either partially or fully impaired in the future, our earnings would decrease.\nAt December 31, 2015, we had approximately $10.0 million in goodwill and identifiable intangible assets on our balance sheet. We are required to test our goodwill and identifiable intangible assets for impairment on a periodic basis. The impairment testing process considers a variety of factors, including the current market price of our common stock, the estimated net present value of our assets and liabilities, and information concerning the terminal valuation of similarly situated insured depository institutions. If an impairment determination is made in a future reporting period, our earnings and the book value of these intangible assets will be reduced by the amount of the impairment. If an impairment loss is recorded, it will have little or no impact on the tangible book value of our common stock or our regulatory capital levels, but such an impairment loss could significantly restrict the Bank\u2019s ability to make dividend payments to us.\nOur success will depend upon our ability to effectively manage our future growth.\nWe believe that we have in place the management and systems, including data processing systems, internal controls and a strong credit culture, to support continued growth. However, our continued growth and profitability depend on the ability of our officers and key employees to manage such growth effectively, to attract and retain skilled employees and to maintain adequate internal controls and a strong credit culture. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in managing our expansion, and the failure to do so would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we experience loan losses in excess of our allowance, our earnings will be adversely affected.\nThe risk of credit losses on loans varies with, among other things, general economic conditions, the type of loan being made, the creditworthiness of the borrower over the term of the loan and, in the case of a collateralized loan, the value and marketability of the collateral for the loan. Management maintains an allowance for loan losses based upon, among other things, historical experience, an evaluation of economic conditions and regular reviews of delinquencies and loan portfolio quality. Based upon such factors, management makes various assumptions and judgments about the ultimate collectability of the loan portfolio and provides an allowance for loan losses based upon a percentage of the outstanding balances and for specific loans when their ultimate collectability is considered questionable. If management\u2019s assumptions and judgments prove to be incorrect and the allowance for loan losses is inadequate to absorb future losses, or if the bank regulatory authorities require us to increase the allowance for loan losses as a part of their examination process, our earnings and capital could be significantly and adversely affected.\n- 24 -\nAs of December 31, 2015, our allowance for loan losses was $7,298,000 which represented 1.30% of outstanding loans. At such date, we had 20 nonperforming loans totaling $7.1 million and 20 impaired loans totaling $9.2 million, most of which are included in the nonperforming loans total. We actively manage our nonperforming loans in an effort to minimize credit losses. Although management believes that its allowance for loan losses is adequate, there can be no assurance that the allowance will prove sufficient to cover future loan losses. Further, although management uses the best information available to make determinations with respect to the allowance for loan losses, future adjustments may be necessary if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used or adverse developments arise with respect to our non-performing or performing loans. Material additions to our allowance for loan losses would result in a decrease in our net income and capital, and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nMost of our loans are to commercial borrowers, which have a higher degree of risk than other types of loans.\nCommercial loans are often larger and may involve greater risks than other types of lending. Because payments on such loans are often dependent on the successful operation of the property or business involved, repayment of such loans may be more sensitive than other types of loans due to adverse conditions in the real estate market or the economy. Unlike residential mortgage loans, which generally are made on the basis of the borrower\u2019s ability to make repayment from his or her employment and other income and which are secured by real property whose value tends to be more easily ascertainable, commercial loans typically are made on the basis of the borrower\u2019s ability to make repayment from the cash flow of the borrower\u2019s business. As a result, the availability of funds for the repayment of commercial loans may be substantially dependent on the success of the business itself and the general economic environment. If the cash flow from business operations is reduced, the borrower\u2019s ability to repay the loan may be impaired.\nMost of our loans are secured, in whole or in part, with real estate collateral which may be subject to declines in value.\nIn addition to the financial strength and cash flow characteristics of the borrower in each case, we often secure our loans with real estate collateral. As of December 31, 2015, approximately 82% of our loans had real estate as a primary, secondary or tertiary component of collateral. In addition, approximately 46% of our securities portfolio consisted of mortgage-backed securities issued by either Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac or Government National Mortgage Association (GNMA). Real estate values and real estate markets are generally affected by, among other things, changes in national, regional or local economic conditions, fluctuations in interest rates and the availability of loans to potential purchasers, changes in tax laws and other governmental statutes, regulations and policies, and acts of nature. The real estate collateral in each case provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of default by the borrower. If real estate prices in our markets decline, the value of the real estate collateral securing our loans could be reduced. If we are required to liquidate the collateral securing a loan during a period of reduced real estate values to satisfy the debt, our earnings and capital could be adversely affected.\nWe may be required to record other-than-temporary impairment charges in respect of our investment securities portfolio and restricted stock.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $77.8 million in investments, including mortgage-backed securities, on which we had unrealized losses of $1.2 million. In addition, we had $3.4 million of regulatory stock in the FHLB of Pittsburgh. We may be required to record impairment charges on our investments and FHLB stock if they suffer a decline in value that is considered other-than-\n- 25 -\ntemporary. Numerous factors, including lack of liquidity for resales of certain investment securities, absence of reliable pricing information for investment securities, adverse changes in the business climate, or adverse actions by regulators could have a negative effect on the value of our investments and mortgage backed securities. If an impairment charge is significant enough to result in a loss for the period, it could affect the ability of our bank subsidiary to upstream dividends to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and our ability to pay dividends to stockholders and could also negatively impact our regulatory capital ratios and result in us not being classified as \u201cwell capitalized\u201d for regulatory purposes.\nThe soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. There is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur business is subject to interest rate risk, and variations in interest rates may materially and adversely affect our financial performance.\nChanges in the interest rate environment may reduce our profits. We realize income primarily from the differential or \"spread\" between the interest earned on loans, securities and other interest-earning assets, and the interest paid on deposits, borrowings and other interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest spreads are affected by the difference between the maturities and repricing characteristics of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Changes in market interest rates generally affect loan volume, loan yields, funding sources and funding costs. Our net interest spread depends on many factors that are partly or completely out of our control, including competition, federal economic monetary and fiscal policies, and general economic conditions.\nIn order to mitigate the risks from increases in interest rates, we emphasize the origination of loans with variable rates of interest so that loan yields increase with the general level of interest rates. Since many of the variable-rate loans in our portfolio specify minimum or floor rates of interest that borrowers must pay, however, the effective rates on these loans will not increase until the index rate exceeds the floor rate, which may initially reduce the sensitivity of these loans to increases in general interest rates. An increase in the general level of interest rates may adversely affect the ability of certain borrowers with variable-rate loans to pay the interest on and principal of their obligations. In addition, an increase in market interest rates on loans is generally associated with a lower volume of loan originations, which may reduce earnings. Following an increase in the general level of interest rates, our ability to maintain a positive net interest spread is dependent on our ability to increase our loan offering rates, replace loan maturities with new originations, minimize increases on our deposit rates, and maintain an acceptable level and mix of funding. We cannot provide assurances that we will be able to increase our loan offering rates and continue to originate loans due to the competitive landscape in which we operate. Additionally, we cannot provide assurances that we can minimize the increases in our deposit rates while maintaining an acceptable level of deposits. Finally, we cannot provide any assurances that we can maintain our current levels of non-interest-bearing deposits as customers may seek higher yielding products when rates increase.\nFollowing a decline in the general level of interest rates, our ability to maintain a positive net interest spread is dependent on our ability to reduce the interest paid on deposits, borrowings, and other interest-bearing liabilities. We cannot provide assurance that we would be able to lower the rates paid on deposit accounts to support our liquidity requirements as lower rates may result in deposit outflows.\n- 26 -\nAccordingly, changes in levels of market interest rates could materially and adversely affect our net interest spread, asset quality, loan origination volume, liquidity, and overall profitability. We cannot assure you that we can minimize our interest rate risk.\nLiquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and jeopardize our financial condition.\nLiquidity is essential to our business. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of loans and investments and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities or on terms which are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or economy in general. Factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity as a result of a downturn in the markets in which our loans are concentrated or adverse regulatory action against us. Our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as a disruption in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry in light of the recent turmoil faced by banking organizations and the continued deterioration in credit markets.\nWe may elect or be compelled to seek additional capital in the future, but that capital may not be available when it is needed.\nWe are required by federal and state regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations. In addition, we may elect to raise additional capital to support our business or to finance acquisitions, if any, or we may otherwise elect or be required to raise additional capital. In that regard, a number of financial institutions have recently raised considerable amounts of capital in response to a deterioration in their results of operations and financial condition arising from the turmoil in the mortgage loan market, deteriorating economic conditions, declines in real estate values and other factors. Should we be required by regulatory authorities to raise additional capital, we may seek to do so through the issuance of, among other things, our common stock or preferred stock.\nOur ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on conditions in the capital markets, economic conditions and a number of other factors, many of which are outside our control, and on our financial performance. Accordingly, we cannot assure you of our ability to raise additional capital if needed or on terms acceptable to us. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, it may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur business is geographically concentrated and is subject to regional economic factors that could have an adverse impact on our business.\nSubstantially all of our business is with customers in our market area of Northeastern Pennsylvania. Most of our customers are consumers and small and medium-sized businesses which are dependent upon the regional economy. Adverse changes in economic and business conditions in our markets could adversely affect our borrowers, their ability to repay their loans and to borrow additional funds, and consequently our financial condition and performance.\nAdditionally, we often secure our loans with real estate collateral, most of which is located in Northeastern Pennsylvania. A decline in local economic conditions could adversely affect the values of such real estate. Consequently, a decline in local economic conditions may have a greater effect on our earnings and capital than on the earnings and capital of larger financial institutions whose real estate loan portfolios are geographically diverse.\n- 27 -\nThe loss of senior executive officers and certain other key personnel could hurt our business.\nOur success depends, to a great extent, upon the services of Lewis J. Critelli, our President and Chief Executive Officer. Although we have an employment agreement with non-compete provisions with Mr. Critelli, the existence of such agreement does not assure that we will retain his services. The unexpected loss of Mr. Critelli could have a material adverse effect on our operations. From time to time, we also need to recruit personnel to fill vacant positions for experienced lending officers and branch managers. Competition for qualified personnel in the banking industry is intense, and there can be no assurance that we will continue to be successful in attracting, recruiting and retaining the necessary skilled managerial, marketing and technical personnel for the successful operation of our existing lending, operations, accounting and administrative functions or to support the expansion of the functions necessary for our future growth. Our inability to hire or retain key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur legal lending limits are relatively low and restrict our ability to compete for larger customers.\nAt December 31, 2015, our lending limit per borrower was approximately $13.9 million, or 15% of our capital plus allowance for loan losses. Accordingly, the size of loans that we can offer to potential borrowers is less than the size of loans that many of our competitors with larger capitalization are able to offer. We may engage in loan participations with other banks for loans in excess of our legal lending limits. However, there can be no assurance that such participations will be available at all or on terms which are favorable to us and our customers.\nThe short-term and long-term impact of the changing regulatory capital requirements and anticipated new capital rules is uncertain.\nThe federal banking agencies have recently adopted proposals that would substantially amend the regulatory risk-based capital rules applicable to the Company and the Bank. The amendments implement the \u201cBasel III\u201d regulatory capital reforms and changes required by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The amended rules include new minimum risk-based capital and leverage ratios, which become effective in January 2015 with certain requirements to be phased in beginning in 2016, and will refine the definition of what constitutes \u201ccapital\u201d for purposes of calculating those ratios.\nThe new minimum capital level requirements applicable to the Company and the Bank include: (i) a new common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 4.5%; (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 6% (increased from 4%); (iii) a total capital ratio of 8% (unchanged from current rules); and (iv) a Tier 1 leverage ratio of 4% for all institutions. The new rules also establish a \u201ccapital conservation buffer\u201d of 2.5% above the new regulatory minimum capital ratios, and would result in the following minimum ratios: (i) a common equity Tier 1 capital ratio of 7.0%, (ii) a Tier 1 capital ratio of 8.5%, and (iii) a total capital ratio of 10.5%. The new capital conservation buffer requirement will be phased in beginning in January 2016 at 0.625% of risk-weighted assets and would increase each year until fully implemented in January 2019. An institution would be subject to limitations on paying dividends, engaging in share repurchases, and paying discretionary bonuses if its capital level falls below the buffer amount. These limitations would establish a maximum percentage of eligible retained income that could be utilized for such actions. While the Basel III changes and other regulatory capital requirements will likely result in generally higher regulatory capital standards, it is difficult at this time to predict when or how any new standards will ultimately be applied to the Company and the Bank.\nThe application of more stringent capital requirements to the Company and the Bank could, among other things, result in lower returns on invested capital, require the raising of additional capital, and result in regulatory actions if we were to be unable to comply with such requirements. Furthermore,\n- 28 -\nthe imposition of liquidity requirements in connection with the implementation of Basel III could result in our having to lengthen the term of our funding, restructure our business models, and/or increase our holdings of liquid assets. Implementation of changes to asset risk weightings for risk based capital calculations, items included or deducted in calculating regulatory capital and/or additional capital conservation buffers could result in management modifying its business strategy and could limit our ability to make distributions, including paying out dividends or buying back shares.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThere is a limited trading market for our common stock, which may adversely impact your ability to sell your shares and the price you receive for your shares.\nAlthough our common stock is quoted on the Nasdaq Global Market, there has been limited trading activity in our stock and an active trading market is not expected to develop. This means that there may be limited liquidity for our common stock, which may make it difficult to buy or sell our common stock, may negatively affect the price of our common stock and may cause volatility in the price of our common stock.\nThere are restrictions on our ability to pay cash dividends.\nAlthough we have paid cash dividends on a quarterly basis since 1996, and the Bank has paid dividends for many previous years, there is no assurance that we will continue to pay cash dividends. Future payment of cash dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will be dependent upon our financial condition, results of operations, capital requirements and such other factors as the Board may deem relevant and will be subject to applicable federal and state laws that impose restrictions on our ability to pay dividends.\nOur common stock is not insured and you could lose the value of your entire investment.\nAn investment in shares of our common stock is not a deposit and is not insured against loss by the government.\nOur management and significant shareholders control a substantial percentage of our stock and therefore have the ability to exercise substantial control over our affairs.\nAs of December 31, 2015, our directors and executive officers beneficially owned approximately 317,479 shares, or approximately 8.2% of our common stock, including options to purchase 100,857 shares, in the aggregate, of our common stock at exercise prices ranging from $24.44 to $29.08 per share. Because of the large percentage of stock held by our directors and executive officers and other significant shareholders, these persons could influence the outcome of any matter submitted to a vote of our shareholders.\nWe may issue additional shares of common or preferred stock, which may dilute the ownership and voting power of our shareholders and the book value of our common stock.\nWe are currently authorized to issue up to 10,000,000 shares of common stock of which 3,701,357 shares are currently outstanding and up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock of which no shares are outstanding. Our Board of Directors has authority, without action or vote of the shareholders, to issue all or part of the authorized but unissued shares and to establish the terms of any series of preferred stock. These authorized but unissued shares could be issued on terms or in circumstances that could dilute the interests of other stockholders. In addition, a total of 525,000 shares of common stock\n- 29 -\nhave been reserved for issuance under the Norwood Financial Corp 2006 Stock Option Plan and the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan, of which 293,970 were issued as of December 31, 2015. As of December 31, 2015, options to purchase a total of 180,021 shares were exercisable and had exercise prices ranging from $24.44 to $29.08. Any such issuance will dilute the percentage ownership interest of shareholders and may further dilute the book value of our common stock.\nProvisions of our Articles of Incorporation and the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law could deter takeovers which are opposed by the Board of Directors.\nOur articles of incorporation require the approval of 80% of our outstanding shares for any merger or consolidation unless the transaction meets certain fair price criteria or the business combination has been approved or authorized by the Board of Directors. In addition, our articles of incorporation may require the disgorgement of profits realized by any person who attempts to acquire control of the Company. As a Pennsylvania corporation with a class of securities registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Company is governed by certain provisions of the Pennsylvania Business Corporation Law that, inter alia, permit the disparate treatment of certain shareholders; prohibit calls of special meetings by shareholders; require unanimous written consent for shareholder action in lieu of a meeting; require shareholder approval for certain transactions in which a shareholder has an interest; and impose additional requirements on business combinations with persons who are the beneficial owners of more than 20% of the Company\u2019s stock.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nWe operate in a competitive market which could constrain our future growth and profitability.\nWe operate in a competitive environment, competing for deposits and loans with commercial banks, savings associations and other financial entities. Competition for deposits comes primarily from other commercial banks, savings associations, credit unions, money market and mutual funds and other investment alternatives. Competition for loans comes primarily from other commercial banks, savings associations, mortgage banking firms, credit unions and other financial intermediaries. Many of the financial intermediaries operating in our market area offer certain services, such as international banking services, which we do not offer. Moreover, banks with a larger capitalization and financial intermediaries not subject to bank regulatory restrictions have larger lending limits and are thereby able to serve the needs of larger customers.\nWe are required to comply with extensive and complex governmental regulation which can adversely affect our business.\nOur operations are and will be affected by current and future legislation and by the policies established from time to time by various federal and state regulatory authorities. We are subject to supervision and periodic examination by the Federal Reserve Board (the \u201cFRB\u201d), FDIC and the Pennsylvania Department of Banking and Securities. Banking regulations, designed primarily for the safety of depositors, may limit a financial institution\u2019s growth and the return to its investors by restricting such activities as the payment of dividends, mergers with or acquisitions by other institutions, investments, loans and interest rates, interest rates paid on deposits, expansion of branch offices, and the offering of securities or trust services. We are also subject to capitalization guidelines established by federal law and could be subject to enforcement actions to the extent that we are found by regulatory examiners to be undercapitalized. It is not possible to predict what changes, if any, will be made to existing federal and state legislation and regulations or the effect that any such changes may have on our future business and earnings prospects. Further, the cost of compliance with regulatory requirements may adversely affect our ability to operate profitability.\n- 30 -\nIn addition, the monetary policies of the FRB have had a significant effect on the operating results of banks in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. Among the instruments of monetary policy used by the FRB to implement its objectives are changes in the discount rate charged on bank borrowings and changes in the reserve requirements on bank deposits. It is not possible to predict what changes, if any, will be made to the monetary policies of the FRB or to existing federal and state legislation or the effect that such change may have on our future business and earnings prospects.\nDuring the past several years, significant legislative attention has been focused on the regulation and deregulation of the financial services industry. Non-bank financial institutions, such as securities brokerage firms, insurance companies and money market funds, have been permitted to engage in activities which compete directly with traditional bank business.\nWe may bear costs associated with the proliferation of computer theft and cybercrime.\nAs part of our banking business, we collect, use and hold sensitive data concerning individuals and businesses with whom we have a banking relationship. Threats to data security, including unauthorized access and cyber-attacks, rapidly emerge and change, exposing us to additional costs for protection or remediation and competing time constraints to secure our data in accordance with customer expectations and statutory and regulatory requirements. The increasing sophistication of cyber-criminals and terrorists makes it extremely difficult to keep up with new threats and could result in a breach of our data security. Patching and other measures to protect existing systems and servers could be inadequate, especially on systems that are being retired. Controls employed by our information technology department and third-party vendors could prove inadequate. We could also experience a breach by intentional or negligent conduct on the part of our employees or other internal sources or by merchants using our customers\u2019 debit and credit cards, software bugs or other technical malfunctions, or other causes. As a result of any of these threats, our customer accounts may become vulnerable to account takeover schemes or cyber-fraud. Our systems and those of our third-party vendors may become vulnerable to damage or disruption due to circumstances beyond our or their control, such as from catastrophic events, power anomalies or outages, natural disasters, network failures, and viruses and malware.\nA breach of our security that results in unauthorized access to our data could expose us to a disruption or challenges relating to our daily operations as well as to data loss, litigation, damages, fines and penalties, customer notification requirements, significant increases in compliance costs, and reputational damage, any of which could individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.", "PERMNO": 85883, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "NWFL"}
