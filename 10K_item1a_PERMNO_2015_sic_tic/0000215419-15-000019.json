{"cik": "215419", "company": "CHECKPOINT SYSTEMS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-05", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThe risks described below are among those that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. These risks could cause actual results to differ materially from historical experience and from results predicted by any forward-looking statements related to conditions or events that may occur in the future.\nCurrent economic conditions could adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nOur operations and results depend significantly on global market worldwide economic conditions, which have experienced deterioration in recent years. Future economic factors may continue to be less favorable than in years past and may continue to result in diminished liquidity and tighter credit conditions, leading to decreased credit availability, as well as declines in economic growth and employment levels. These conditions may increase the difficulty for us to accurately forecast and plan future business. Customer demand could be impacted by decreased spending by businesses and consumers alike, and competitive pricing pressures could increase. We are unable to predict the length or severity of the current economic conditions. A continuation or further deterioration of these economic factors may have a material and adverse effect on the liquidity and financial condition of our customers and on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, including our ability to refinance maturing liabilities, and access the capital markets to meet liquidity needs.\nWe have significant foreign operations, which are subject to political, economic and other risks inherent in operating in foreign countries.\nWe are a multinational manufacturer and marketer of identification, tracking security, and merchandising solutions for the retail industry. We have significant operations outside of the U.S. We currently operate directly in 27 countries, and our international operations generate approximately 71% of our revenue. We expect net revenue generated outside of the U.S. to continue to represent a significant portion of total net revenue. Business operations outside of the U.S. are subject to political, economic and other risks inherent in operating in certain countries, such as:\n\u25aa\nDifficulty in enforcing agreements, collecting receivables and protecting assets through foreign legal systems\n\u25aa\nTrade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements\n\u25aa\nDifficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations and the application of foreign labor regulations\n\u25aa\nCompliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations\n\u25aa\nCompliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the UK Bribery Act and the Office of Foreign Assets Control\n\u25aa\nChanges in the general political and economic conditions in the countries where we operate, particularly in emerging markets\n\u25aa\nThe threat of nationalization and expropriation\n\u25aa\nIncreased costs and risks of doing business in a number of foreign jurisdictions\n\u25aa\nChanges in enacted tax laws\n\u25aa\nLimitations on repatriation of earnings\n\u25aa\nFluctuations in equity and revenues due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates\nChanges in the political or economic environments in the countries in which we operate, as well as the impact of economic conditions on underlying demand for our products could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nAs we continue to explore the expansion of our global reach, an increasing focus of our business may be in emerging markets, including South America and Southern Asia. In many of these emerging markets, we may be faced with risks that are more significant than if we were to do business in developed countries, including undeveloped legal systems, unstable governments and economies, and potential governmental actions affecting the flow of goods and currency.\nOur global operations expose us to risks associated with conducting business internationally, including violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws.\nWe are a multinational manufacturer and marketer of identification, tracking security, and merchandising solutions for the retail industry. We have significant operations outside of the U.S. Due to our global operations, we are subject to many laws governing international relations, including those that prohibit improper payments to government officials and commercial customers, and restrict where we can do business, what information or products we can supply to certain countries and what\ninformation we can provide to a non-U.S. government, including but not limited to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, U.K. Bribery Act and the U.S. Export Administration Act. Our policies mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws. We operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Given the high level of complexity of these laws, there is a risk that some provisions may be inadvertently or intentionally breached, for example through fraudulent or negligent behavior of individual employees, our failure to comply with certain formal documentation requirements or otherwise. Additionally, we may be held liable for actions taken by our local dealers and partners. If we are found to be liable for FCPA or other violations (either due to our own acts or our inadvertence, or due to the acts or inadvertence of others), we could suffer from civil and criminal penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nVolatility in currency exchange rates and interest rates may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nWe are exposed to a variety of market risks, including the effects of changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates. Refer to Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.\nOur net revenue derived from sales in non-U.S. markets is approximately 71% of our total net revenue, and we expect revenue from non-U.S. markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our net revenue. When the U.S. dollar strengthens in relation to the currencies of the foreign countries where we sell our products, our U.S. dollar reported revenue and income will decrease. Changes in the relative values of currencies occur regularly and, in some instances, may have a significant effect on our results of operations. Our financial statements reflect recalculations of items denominated in non-U.S. currencies to U.S. dollars, which is our functional currency.\nWe monitor these exposures as an integral part of our overall risk management program. In some cases, we enter into contracts to reduce the risks of currency fluctuations on short-term inter-company receivables and payables, and on projected future billings in non-functional currencies and use third-party borrowings in foreign currencies to hedge a portion of our net investments in, and cash flows derived from, our foreign subsidiaries. Nevertheless, changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOur business could be materially adversely affected as a result of lower than anticipated demand by retailers and other customers for our products, particularly in the current economic environment.\nOur business is heavily dependent on the retail marketplace. Changes in the economic environment including the liquidity and financial condition of our customers, the impact of online customer spending, or reductions in retailer spending could adversely affect our revenues and results of operations. In a period of decreased consumer spending, retailers could respond by reducing their spending on new store openings and loss prevention budgets. This reduction could directly impact our MAS business, as a reduction in new store openings will lower demand for SMS EAS systems and consumables as well as RFID solutions. Additionally, lower loss prevention budgets could reduce the amount retailers will be willing to spend to upgrade existing store technology. Label demand could also be impacted due to lower loss prevention budgets as retailers may reduce the percentage of items covered. In addition, our label volume increases as more items are sold through the retailer and lower demand decreases the volume related to the items tagged by the retailer. As retail sales volumes decline, label demand may also decline. These factors could also impact our Apparel Labeling Solutions and Retail Merchandising Solutions businesses. A decrease in the demand for our products resulting from reduced spending by retailers due to fewer store openings, reduced loss prevention budgets and slower adoption of our new technology could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations.\nOur business could be materially adversely affected as a result of slower commitments of retail customers to chain-wide installations and/or source tagging adoption or expansion.\nOur revenues are dependent on our ability to maintain and increase our system installation base. The SMS EAS system installation base within MAS leads to additional revenues, which we term as \u201crecurring revenues,\u201d through the sale of maintenance services and SMS EAS consumables, including labels and tags, as well as our Alpha\u00ae high-theft solutions. In addition, we partner with manufacturers to include our sensor tags into the product during manufacturing, an approach known as source tagging.\nThe level of commitments for chain-wide installations may decline due to decreased consumer spending which results in reduced spending on loss prevention by our retail customers, our failure to develop new technology that entices the customer to maintain their commitment to our loss prevention products and services, competing technologies and retailers' decisions to\ndefer the capital investment and expense. A reduction in the commitment for chain-wide installations may also impact our ability to expand utilization of our source tagging program. A reduction in commitments to chain-wide installations and utilization of our source tagging program could have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations.\nThe markets we serve are highly competitive and we may be unable to compete effectively if we are unable to provide and market innovative and cost-effective products at competitive prices.\nWe face competition around the world, including competition from other large, multinational companies and other regional companies. Some of these companies may have substantially greater financial and other resources than us. We face competition in several aspects of our business. In the SMS EAS systems, Alpha\u00ae high-theft solutions and SMS EAS consumables businesses, we compete primarily on the basis of integrated security solutions and diversified, sophisticated, and quality product lines targeted at meeting the loss prevention needs of our retail customers. We also compete on the basis of merchandise visibility (RFID) solutions that meet the item level product identification and inventory management needs of our customers. In the ALS business, we compete primarily on the capability to effectively and quickly deliver retail customer specified tags and labels to manufacturing sites in multiple countries. It is possible that our competitors will be able to offer additional products, services, lower prices, or other incentives that we cannot offer or that will make our products less profitable. It is also possible that our competitors will offer incentive programs or will market and advertise their products in a way that will impact customers' preferences, and we may not be able to compete effectively.\nWe may be unable to anticipate the timing and scale of our competitors' activities and initiatives, or we may be unable to successfully counteract them, which could harm our business. In addition, the cost of responding to our competitors' activities may affect our financial performance in the relevant period. Our ability to compete also depends on our ability to attract and retain key talent, protect patent and trademark rights, and develop innovative and cost-effective products. A failure to compete effectively could adversely affect our growth and profitability.\nOur long term success is largely dependent upon our ability to develop new technologies, and if we are unable to successfully develop those technologies, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nOur growth depends on continued sales of existing products, as well as the successful development and introduction of new products, which face the uncertainty of retail and consumer acceptance and reaction from competitors. In addition, our ability to create new products and to sustain existing products is affected by whether we can:\n\u2022\nDevelop and fund technological innovations, such as those related to our next generation EAS product solutions, evolving RFID technologies, and other innovative security device, software, and systems initiatives\n\u2022\nReceive and maintain necessary patent and trademark protection\n\u2022\nSuccessfully anticipate customer needs and preferences\nThe failure to develop and launch successful new products could hinder the growth of our business. Research and development for each of our operating segments is complex and uncertain and requires innovation and anticipation of market trends. Also, delays in the development or launch of a new product could compromise our competitive position, particularly if our competitors announce or introduce new products and services in advance of us.\nAn inability to acquire, protect or maintain our intellectual property, including patents, could harm our ability to compete or grow.\nBecause our products involve complex technology and chemistry, we rely on protections of our intellectual property and proprietary information to maintain a competitive advantage. The expiration of these patents will reduce the barriers to entry into our existing lines of business and may result in loss of market share and a decrease in our competitive abilities, thus having a potential adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. At this time we do not anticipate any significant impact from the expiration of patents over the next two to three years.\nThere is no assurance that the patents we have obtained will provide adequate protection to ensure any competitive advantages for our products. We also cannot assure investors that those patents will not be successfully challenged, invalidated or circumvented prior to their expiration. In addition, we cannot provide assurance that competitors have not already applied for or obtained, or will not seek to apply for and obtain, patents that will prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to make, use and sell our products either in the U.S. or in international markets.\nWe cannot assure you that we will not become subject to patent infringement claims. The defense and prosecution of intellectual property lawsuits generally are costly and time-consuming. If other parties violate our proprietary rights, further\nlitigation may be necessary to enforce our patents, to protect trade secrets or know-how we own or to determine the enforceability, scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. Any litigation will be costly and cause significant diversion of effort by our technical and management personnel.\nOur business could be materially adversely affected as a result of possible increases in per unit product manufacturing costs as a result of slowing economic conditions or other factors.\nOur manufacturing capacity is designed to meet our current and future anticipated demands. If our product demand decreases as a result of economic conditions and other factors, it could increase our cost per unit. If an increase in our cost per unit is passed on to our customers, it may decrease our competitive position, which may have an adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations. If an increase in cost per unit is not passed on to our customers, it may reduce our gross margins, which may have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Our SMS EAS consumables, RFID consumables, Alpha\u00ae and ALS products have various low price competitors globally. In order for us to maintain and improve our market position, we need to continuously monitor and seek to improve our manufacturing effectiveness, capacity utilization and demand planning while maintaining our high quality standard. If we are unsuccessful in our efforts to improve manufacturing and supply chain effectiveness, then our cost per unit may increase which could have an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nIf we cannot obtain sufficient quantities of raw materials and component parts required for our manufacturing activities at competitive prices and quality and on a timely basis, our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows may suffer.\nWe purchase materials and component parts from third parties for use in our manufacturing operations. Our ability to grow earnings will be affected by inflationary and other increases in the cost of component parts and raw materials, including electronic components, circuit boards, aluminum foil, resins, paper, and ferric chloride, hydrochloric acid solutions and rare earth magnets. Inflationary and other increases in the costs of raw materials, labor, and energy have occurred in the past and are expected to recur, and our performance depends in part on our ability to pass these cost increases on to customers in the prices for our products and to effect improvements in productivity. We may not be able to fully offset the effects of higher component parts and raw material costs through price increases, productivity improvements or cost reduction programs. If we cannot obtain sufficient quantities of these items at competitive prices and quality and on a timely basis, we may not be able to produce sufficient quantities of product to satisfy market demand, product shipments may be delayed, or our material or manufacturing costs may increase. A disruption to our supply chain could adversely affect our sales and profitability. Any of these problems could result in the loss of customers and revenue, provide an opportunity for competing products to gain market acceptance and otherwise adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nPossible increases in the payment time for receivables as a result of economic conditions or other market factors could have a material effect on our results from operations and anticipated cash from operating activities.\nThe majority of our customer base is in the retail marketplace. Although we have a rigorous process to administer credit granted to customers and believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate, we have experienced, and in the future may experience, losses as a result of our inability to collect our accounts receivable. During the past several years, various retailers have experienced significant financial difficulties, which in some cases have resulted in bankruptcies, liquidations and store closings. The financial difficulties of a customer could result in reduced business with that customer. We may also assume higher credit risk relating to receivables of a customer experiencing financial difficulty. If these developments occur, our inability to shift sales to other customers or to collect on our trade accounts receivable from a major customer could substantially reduce our income and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows from operating activities.\nThe effectiveness of our strategic plan is subject to the successful implementation of our plans and actions.\nDuring 2012, we redefined our strategic plan and in 2014 we reiterated our commitment to this plan. Our strategic plan is designed to improve revenues and profitability, reduce costs, and improve working capital management. In addition to our restructuring plans including our Profit Enhancement Plan, we have many plans and actions underway to improve the management of our business. These include the following:\n\u2022\nMargin enhancement initiatives\n\u2022\nImproved financial forecasting abilities\n\u2022\nEnhanced management reporting\n\u2022\nNew sales compensation incentive plans\n\u2022\nRefined product pricing approach\n\u2022\nContinuous cost-improvement process improvement plans\n\u2022\nSystematic talent assessment process\n\u2022\nDeveloping a culture focused on accountability\n\u2022\nImproved supply chain management\nThere is a risk that we may not be successful in our continued execution of these measures to achieve the expected results for a variety of reasons, including market developments, economic conditions, shortcomings in establishing appropriate action plans, or challenges with executing multiple initiatives simultaneously. We may not be able to acquire businesses that fit our strategic plan or divest of those that do not fit our strategic plan on acceptable business terms, and we may not achieve our other strategic priorities.\nOur ability to maintain cost reductions in field services, selling, general and administrative expenses, and our manufacturing and supply chain operations may have a significant impact on our business and future revenues and profits.\nWe have implemented actions to rationalize our field service, improve our sales productivity, reduce our general and administrative expenses, and reconfigure our manufacturing and supply chain operations. Such rationalization actions require management judgment on the development of cost reduction strategies and precision on the execution of those strategies. We may not be able to maintain, in full or in part, the benefits from these initiatives, and other events and circumstances, such as difficulties, delays, or unexpected costs may occur, which could result in our not maintaining realization of all or any of the anticipated benefits. We also cannot predict whether we will maintain our improved operating performance as a result of any cost reduction strategies. Further, in the event the market continues to fluctuate, we may not have the appropriate level of resources and personnel to react to the change. We are also subject to the risk of business disruption in connection with our restructuring initiatives, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and future revenues and profits.\nWe continue to evaluate opportunities to restructure our business and rationalize our operations in an effort to optimize our cost structure and efficiencies consistent with our strategy. As a result of these evaluations, we may take similar rationalization steps in the future. Future actions could result in restructuring and related charges, including but not limited to workforce reduction costs and charges relating to consolidation of excess facilities that could be significant.\nIf we fail to manage our growth effectively, our business could be harmed.\nOur strategy is to maximize value by achieving growth both organically and through acquisitions. Our ability to effectively manage and control any future growth may be limited. To manage any growth, our management must continue to improve our operational, information and financial systems, procedures and controls and expand, train, retain and effectively manage our employees. If our systems, procedures and controls are inadequate to support our operations, any expansion could effectively decrease or stop, and investors may lose confidence in our operations or financial results. If we are unable to manage growth effectively, our business and operating results could be adversely affected, and any failure to develop and maintain adequate internal controls over financial reporting could cause the trading price of our shares to decline substantially.\nOur ability to integrate acquisitions and to achieve our financial and operational goals for acquired businesses could have an impact on future revenues and profits.\nHistorically, we have had difficulties integrating certain of our acquisitions. Various risks, uncertainties and costs are associated with acquisitions. Effective integration of systems, key business processes, controls, objectives, personnel, management practices, product lines, markets, customers, supply chain operations, and production facilities can be difficult to achieve and the results are uncertain, particularly across our internationally diverse organization. We may not be able to retain key personnel of an acquired company and we may not be able to successfully execute integration strategies or achieve projected performance targets set for the business segment into which an acquired company is integrated. Our ability to execute the integration plans could have an impact on future revenues and profits and may adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. There can be no assurance that these acquisitions or others will be successful and contribute to our profitability.\nAny acquisition, strategic relationship, joint venture or investment could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition.\nWe actively pursue acquisitions, strategic relationships, joint ventures, collaborations and investments that we believe may allow us to complement our growth strategy, increase market share in our current markets or expand into adjacent markets, or broaden our technology and intellectual property. Such transactions may be complex, time consuming and expensive, and may present numerous challenges and risks. Lack of control over the actions of our business partners in any strategic relationship, joint venture or collaboration, could significantly delay the introduction of planned products or otherwise make it difficult or impossible to realize the expected benefits of such relationship.\nAn impairment in the carrying value of goodwill or other assets could negatively affect our consolidated results of operations and net worth.\nPursuant to accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, we are required to annually assess our goodwill, intangibles and other long-lived assets to determine if they are impaired. In addition, interim reviews must be performed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred. If the testing performed indicates that impairment has occurred, we are required to record a non-cash impairment charge for the difference between the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible assets and the implied fair value of the goodwill or other intangible assets in the period the determination is made. Disruptions to our business, end market conditions and protracted economic weakness, unexpected significant declines in operating results of reporting units, divestitures and market capitalization declines may result in additional charges for goodwill and other asset impairments. We have significant intangible assets, including goodwill with an indefinite life, which are susceptible to valuation adjustments as a result of changes in such factors and conditions. We assess the potential impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets on an annual basis, as well as when interim events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. We assess definite lived intangible assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.\nThe basis of the fair value for our impairment assessments is determined by projecting future cash flows using assumptions concerning future operating performance and economic conditions that may differ from actual cash flows. Estimated future cash flows are adjusted by an appropriate discount rate derived from our market capitalization plus a suitable control premium at the date of the evaluation. The financial and credit market volatility directly impacts our fair value measurement through our weighted average cost of capital that we use to determine our discount rate and through our stock price that we use to determine our market capitalization. Although our last analysis regarding the fair values of the goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for our reporting units indicates that they exceed their respective carrying values, materially different assumptions regarding the future performance of our businesses or significant declines in our stock price could result in additional goodwill and intangible impairment losses. Specifically, an unanticipated deterioration in revenues and gross margins generated by our Merchandise Availability Solutions, Apparel Labeling Solutions and Retail Merchandising Solutions segments could trigger future impairment in those segments. While we currently believe that our projected results will not result in future impairment, a deterioration in results could trigger a future impairment.\nOur senior secured credit facility agreement restricts certain activities, and failure to comply with this agreement may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe maintain a senior secured credit facility that contains restrictive financial covenants, including financial covenants that require us to comply with specified financial ratios. We may have to curtail some of our operations to comply with these covenants. In addition, our senior secured credit facility contains other affirmative and negative covenants that could restrict our operating and financing activities. These provisions may limit our ability to, among other things, incur future indebtedness, contingent obligations or liens, guarantee indebtedness, make certain investments, sell stock or assets and pay dividends, and consummate certain mergers or acquisitions. Because of the restrictions on our ability to create or assume liens, we may find it difficult to secure additional indebtedness if required. Furthermore, if we fail to comply with the requirements of the senior secured credit facility, we may be in default, and we may not be able to obtain the necessary amendments to the agreement or waivers of an event of default. Upon an event of default, if the agreement is not amended or the event of default is not waived, the lenders could declare all amounts outstanding, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. If this happens, we may not be able to make those payments or borrow sufficient funds from alternative sources to make those payments. Even if we were to obtain additional financing, that financing may be on unfavorable terms.\nChanges in legislation or governmental regulations, policies or standards applicable to our products may have a significant impact on our ability to compete in our target markets.\nWe operate in regulated industries. Our U.S. operations are subject to regulation by federal, state, and local governmental agencies with respect to safety of operations and equipment, labor and employment matters, and financial responsibility. Our SMS EAS products are subject to FCC regulation, and our international operations are regulated by the countries in which they operate, including regulation of the Conformit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9ene (CE) in Europe. Failure to comply with laws or regulations could result in substantial fines or revocation of our operating permits or licenses. If laws and regulations change and we fail to comply, our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur future results may be affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings.\nWe cannot predict with certainty the outcome of litigation matters, government proceedings and investigations, and other contingencies and uncertainties that may arise out of the conduct of our business, including matters relating to intellectual\nproperty, employment, commercial and other matters. Resolution of such matters can be prolonged and costly, and the ultimate results or judgments are uncertain due to the inherent uncertainty in litigation and other proceedings. Moreover, our potential liabilities are subject to change over time due to new developments, changes in settlement strategy or the impact of evidentiary requirements, and we may be required to pay fines, damage awards or settlements, or become subject to fines, damage awards or settlements, that could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nThe failure to effectively maintain and upgrade our information systems could adversely affect our business.\nOur business depends significantly on effective information systems, and we have many different information systems for our various businesses. Our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain and enhance existing systems and develop new systems in order to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, evolving industry and regulatory standards, and changing customer preferences. In addition, we may from time to time obtain significant portions of our systems-related or other services or facilities from independent third parties, which may make our operations vulnerable to such third parties' failure to perform adequately. Our failure to maintain effective and efficient information systems, or our failure to efficiently and effectively consolidate our information systems to eliminate redundant or obsolete applications, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, any disruption or failure of such networks, systems, or other technology may disrupt our operations, cause customer dissatisfaction, and loss of customer revenues.\nRisks generally associated with a company-wide implementation of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system may adversely affect our business and results of operations or the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\nWe have been implementing a company-wide ERP system to handle the business and financial processes within our operations and corporate functions. Our implementations for Europe and Asia have been postponed. We plan to implement our South China ALS ERP system by the end of 2016. ERP implementations are complex and time-consuming projects that involve substantial expenditures on system software and implementation activities that can continue for several years. ERP implementations also require transformation of business and financial processes in order to reap the benefits of the ERP system. Our business and results of operations may be adversely affected if we experience operating problems and/or cost overruns during the ERP implementation process, decide to forgo a company-wide implementation, or if the ERP system and the associated process changes do not give rise to the benefits that we expect. Additionally, if we do not effectively implement the ERP system as planned or if the system does not operate as intended, it could adversely affect the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\nInformation technology failures and cyber-attacks on our networks could harm our business and results of operations.\nWe use information technology and other computer resources to carry out important operational and marketing activities and to maintain our business records. These information technology systems are dependent upon global communications providers, web browsers, telephone systems and other aspects of the Internet infrastructure that have experienced security breaches, cyber-attacks, significant systems failures and electrical outages in the past. Thus, maintaining the security of computers, computer networks and data storage resources is a critical issue for us and our customers and suppliers, because security breaches could result in reduced or lost ability to carry on our business and loss of and unauthorized access to confidential information. We have designed our information technology systems to protect against failures in security and service disruption. Despite the precautions we take, we may be subject to computer viruses, worms or other malicious codes, unauthorized access attempts, and cyber- or phishing-attacks, which, if successful, could compromise our confidential information, including identifiable personal information, disrupt our operations and expose us to customer, supplier, and other third party liabilities.\nAs a global business, we have a relatively complex tax structure, and there is a risk that tax authorities will disagree with our tax positions.\nSince we conduct operations worldwide through our foreign subsidiaries, we are subject to complex transfer pricing regulations in the countries in which we operate. Transfer pricing regulations generally require that, for tax purposes, transactions between us and our foreign affiliates be priced on a basis that would be comparable to an arm's length transaction and that contemporaneous documentation be maintained to support the tax allocation. Although uniform transfer pricing standards are emerging in many of the countries in which we operate, there is still a relatively high degree of uncertainty and inherent subjectivity in complying with these rules. To the extent that any foreign tax authorities disagree with our transfer pricing policies, we could become subject to significant tax liabilities and penalties. Our tax returns are subject to review by taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Although we believe that we have provided for all tax exposures, the ultimate outcome of a tax review could differ materially from our provisions.\nWe record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that it is more likely than not to be realized. Our assessments about the realizability of our deferred tax assets are based on estimates of our future taxable income by tax jurisdiction, the prudence and feasibility of possible tax planning strategies, and the economic environments in which we do business. Any changes in these assessments could have a material impact on our results of operations.\nRegulations that impose disclosure requirements regarding the use of \u201cconflict\u201d minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries in our products will result in additional cost and expense and could result in other significant adverse effects.\nRules adopted by the SEC implementing the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act impose diligence and disclosure requirements regarding the use of \u201cconflict\u201d minerals mined from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries in our products. Compliance with these rules may result in additional cost and expense, including for due diligence to determine and verify the sources of any conflict minerals used in our products, in addition to the cost of remediation and other changes to products, processes, or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. These rules may also affect the sourcing and availability of minerals used in the manufacture of our products to the extent that there may be only a limited number of suppliers offering \u201cconflict free\u201d metals that can be used in our products. There can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such metals in sufficient quantities or at competitive prices. Also, since our supply chain is complex, we may face reputational challenges with our customers, stockholders and other stakeholders if we are unable to sufficiently verify the origins of the metals used in our products. We may also encounter customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict free. If we are not able to meet customer requirements, such customers may choose to disqualify us as a supplier, which could impact our sales and the value of portions of our inventory.", "PERMNO": 22921, "SIC": 3669, "TIC": "CKP"}
