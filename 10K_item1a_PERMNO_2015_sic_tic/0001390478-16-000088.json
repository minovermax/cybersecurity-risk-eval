{"cik": "1390478", "company": "Galena Biopharma, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-10", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur business is subject to numerous risks. We caution you that the following important factors, among others, could cause our actual results to differ materially from those expressed in statements made by us or on our behalf in filings with the SEC, press releases or communications with investors and others. Any or all of our statements in this annual report and in any other public statements we make may turn out to be wrong. They can be affected by inaccurate assumptions or by known or unknown risks and uncertainties. The factors mentioned in the discussion below will be important in determining future results. Consequently, actual future results may vary materially from those anticipated in this annual report or our other public statements.\nRisks Relating to Our Former Commercial Operations\nWe are subject to U.S. federal and state health care fraud and abuse and false claims laws and regulations, and we recently have been subpoenaed in connection with marketing and promotional practices related to Abstral. Prosecutions under such laws have increased in recent years and we may become subject to such prosecutions or related litigation under these laws. If we have not fully complied with such laws, we could face substantial penalties.\nOur former commercial operations and development programs are subject to various U.S. federal and state fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the federal False Claims Act, federal Anti-Kickback Statute, and the federal Sunshine Act.\nA federal investigation of two of the high-prescribing physicians for Abstral has resulted in the criminal prosecution of the two physicians for alleged violations of the federal False Claims Act and other federal statutes. The criminal trial is set for some time in 2016. We have received a trial subpoena for documents in connection with that investigation and we have been in contact with the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of Alabama, which is handling the criminal trial, and are cooperating in the production of documents. We are a target or subject of that investigation. There also have been federal and state investigations of a company that has a product that competes with Abstral in the same therapeutic class, and we have learned that the FDA and other governmental agencies may be investigating our Abstral promotion practices. On December 16, 2015, we received a subpoena issued by the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office in District of New Jersey requesting the production of a broad range of documents pertaining to our marketing and promotional practices for Abstral. We have been in contact with the U.S. Attorney\u2019s Office for the District of New Jersey and are cooperating in the production of the requested documents. We are unable to predict whether we could become subject to legal or administrative actions as a result of these matters, or the impact of such matters. If we are found to be in violation of the False Claims Act, Anti-Kickback Statute, Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or any other applicable state or any federal fraud and abuse laws, we may be subject to penalties, such as civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, or an administrative action of exclusion from government health care reimbursement programs. We can make no assurances as to the time or resources that will need to be devoted to these matters or their outcome, or the impact, if any, that these matters or any resulting legal or administrative proceedings may have on our business or financial condition.\nThe federal False Claims Act prohibits persons from knowingly filing, or causing to be filed, a false claim to, or the knowing use of false statements to obtain payment from, the federal government. Qui tam suits filed under the False Claims Act can be brought by any individual on behalf of the government and such individuals, commonly known as \u201crelators\u201d or \u201cwhistleblowers,\u201d may share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. The frequency of filing qui tam actions has increased significantly in recent years, causing greater numbers of health care companies to have to defend such qui tam actions and pay substantial sums to settle such actions.\nThe federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving, or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual, or the furnishing or arranging for a good or service, for which payment may be made under a federal health care program such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Several courts have interpreted the statute\u2019s intent requirement to mean that if any one purpose of an arrangement involving remuneration is to induce referrals of federal health care covered business, the statute has been violated. The Anti-Kickback Statute is broad, and despite a series of narrow safe harbors, prohibits many arrangements and practices that are lawful in businesses outside of the health care industry. Penalties for violations of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute include criminal penalties and civil and administrative sanctions such as fines, imprisonment and possible exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal health care programs. An alleged violation of the Anti- Kickback Statute may be used as a predicate offense to establish liability pursuant to other federal laws and regulations such as the federal False Claims Act. Many states have also adopted laws similar to the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, some of which apply to the referral of patients for health care items or services reimbursed by any source, not only Medicare and Medicaid programs.\nThe federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act includes provisions expanding the ability of certain relators to bring actions that would have been dismissed under prior law. When an entity is determined to have violated the federal False Claims Act, it may be required to pay up to three times the actual damages sustained by the government, plus civil penalties for each separate false claim. The Deficit Reduction Act of 2005 encouraged states to enact or modify their state false claims acts to be at least as effective as the federal False Claims Act by granting states a portion of any federal Medicaid funds recovered through Medicaid-related actions. Most states have enacted state false claims laws, and many of those states included laws including qui tam provisions. The federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act includes provisions known as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires manufacturers of drugs, biologics, devices and medical supplies covered under Medicare and Medicaid to record any transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals and to report this data beginning in 2013 to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for subsequent public disclosures. Manufacturers must also disclose investment interests held by physicians and their family members. Failure to submit the required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to $1 million per year for knowing violations and may result in liability under other federal laws or regulations. Similar reporting requirements have also been enacted on the state level in the U.S., and an increasing number of countries worldwide either have adopted or are considering similar laws requiring transparency of interactions with health care professionals. In addition, some states such as Massachusetts and Vermont imposed an outright ban on certain gifts to physicians. These laws could affect our product promotional activities by limiting the kinds of interactions we could have with hospitals, physicians or other potential purchasers or users of our system. Both the disclosure laws and gift bans also will impose administrative, cost and compliance burdens on us.\nWe face product liability exposure and, if successful claims are brought against us, we may incur substantial liability if our insurance coverage for those claims is inadequate.\nThe commercial sale of our products exposes us to possible product liability claims. This risk exists even if a product is approved for commercial sale by the FDA and manufactured in facilities licensed and regulated by the FDA. Our products are designed to affect important bodily functions and processes. Any side effects, manufacturing defects, misuse or abuse associated with our products could result in injury to a patient or even death. For example, because Abstral is designed to be self-administered by patients, it is possible that a patient could fail to follow instructions and as a result apply a dose in a manner that results in injury. In addition, Abstral is an opioid pain reliever that contains fentanyl, which is regulated as a \u201ccontrolled substance\u201d under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 (the \u201cCSA\u201d) and could result in harm to patients relating to its potential for abuse. Product liability claims may be brought against us by consumers, health care providers, pharmaceutical companies or others selling or otherwise coming into contact with our products or generic versions of our products. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against product liability claims we could incur substantial liabilities. Because we have sold Abstral and Zuplenz, regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in:\n\u2022impairment of our business reputation;\n\u2022costs of related litigation;\n\u2022distraction of management\u2019s attention from our primary business; or\n\u2022substantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants.\nWe have obtained product liability insurance coverage for commercial product sales with a $10 million per occurrence and a $10 million annual aggregate coverage limit. Our insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all of our product liability related expenses or losses and may not cover us for any expenses or losses we may suffer. Moreover, insurance coverage is becoming increasingly expensive and, in the future, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost, in sufficient amounts or upon adequate terms to protect us against losses due to product liability. If we determine that it is prudent to increase our product liability coverage based on sales of our products, we may be unable to obtain this increased product liability insurance on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Large judgments have been awarded in class action or individual lawsuits based on drugs that had unanticipated side effects, including side effects that may be less severe than those of our products. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could cause our stock price to decline and, if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could decrease our cash and have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nOur business involves the use of hazardous materials and we and our third-party manufacturers and suppliers must comply with environmental laws and regulations, which can be expensive and restrict how we do business.\nOur third-party manufacturers and suppliers activities involve the controlled storage, use and disposal of hazardous materials. We and our manufacturers and suppliers are subject to laws and regulations governing the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these hazardous materials even after we sell or otherwise dispose of the products. In some cases, these hazardous materials and various wastes resulting from their use were stored at our contractors or manufacturers\u2019 facilities pending use and disposal. We cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination, which could cause injury to our employees and others, environmental damage resulting in costly clean-up and liabilities under applicable laws and regulations governing the use, storage, handling and disposal of these materials and specified waste products. Although we expect that the safety procedures utilized by our third-party contractors and manufacturers for handling and disposing of these materials will generally comply with the standards prescribed by these laws and regulations, we cannot guarantee that this will be the case or eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. In such an event, we may be held liable for any resulting damages and such liability could exceed our resources. We do not currently carry biological or hazardous waste insurance coverage and our property and casualty and general liability insurance policies specifically exclude coverage for damages and fines arising from biological or hazardous waste exposure or contamination.\nWe will continue to be responsible for certain liabilities and obligations related to Abstral and Zuplenz, and if unknown liabilities were to arise it could have a material adverse effect on us.\nUnder our respective asset purchase agreements with Sentynl Therapeutics, Inc. and Midatech Pharma PLC, our future obligations under our former agreements with Orexo AB and MonoSol have been assumed by Sentynl and Midatech, respectively, except that we will continue to be responsible for chargebacks, rebates, patient assistance and certain other product distribution channel liabilities related to Abstral and Zuplenz for a specified period of time post-closing. We also will be responsible for any pre-closing liabilities and obligations related to Abstral and Zuplenz, including unknown liabilities, and have agreed in the respective asset purchase agreements to indemnify Sentynl and Midatech for any breach of our representations, warranties and covenants in the respective asset purchase agreements up to a certain agreed to amount. We cannot quantify these responsibilities to Sentanyl and Midatech, but if substantial unknown liabilities were to arise, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nRisks Relating to Our Development Programs\nOur drug candidates may not receive regulatory approval or be successfully commercialized.\nBefore they can be marketed, our products in development must be approved by the FDA or similar foreign governmental agencies. The process for obtaining FDA approval is both time-consuming and costly, with no certainty of a successful outcome. Before obtaining regulatory approval for the sale of any drug candidate, we must conduct preclinical tests and clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy in humans of our product candidates. Although our drug candidates have exhibited no serious adverse events (\u201cSAEs\u201d) in the Phase 1 and 1/2 clinical trials, SAEs or other unexpected side effects may arise during further testing and development. A failure of any preclinical study or clinical trial can occur at any stage of testing. The results of preclinical and initial clinical testing of these products may not necessarily indicate the results that will be obtained from later or more extensive testing. It also is possible to suffer significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials, even after obtaining promising results in earlier trials.\nClinical trial designs that were discussed with the authorities prior to their commencement may not result in the success of the trials or subsequently may not be considered sufficient for approval. Thus, our special protocol assessment with the FDA for our PRESENT trial does not ensure success of the trial or guarantee regulatory approval of NeuVax for the treatment of breast cancer.\nIn 2009, we reached agreement with the FDA regarding the special protocol assessment, or SPA, for the design of our NeuVax Phase 3 PRESENT trial as an adjuvant treatment for patients with node positive, HER2 1+/2+ breast cancer. An SPA certifies the agreement with the FDA regarding the study endpoints, study design and statistical assumptions of the clinical trial. The SPA is documented as part of the administrative record, and is binding on the FDA and may not be changed unless we fail to follow the agreed upon protocol, data supporting the test are found to be false or incomplete, or the FDA determines that a substantial scientific issue essential to determining the safety or effectiveness of the drug was identified after the testing began. In June 2013, the FDA agreed to an amendment to the SPA to account for the use of a companion diagnostic. Even with an SPA, approval of an NDA or BLA is not guaranteed because a final determination that an agreed upon protocol satisfies a specific objective, such as the demonstration of efficacy, or supports an approval decision, will be based on a complete review of all the data submitted to the FDA. There is no assurance, therefore, that the NeuVax Phase 3 PRESENT trial will be successful or that NeuVax for the treatment of patients with node positive, HER2 1+ and/or 2+ breast cancer will be approved by the FDA.\nA number of different factors could prevent us from obtaining regulatory approval or commercializing our product candidates on a timely basis, or at all.\nWe, the FDA or other applicable regulatory authorities, an Independent Data Monitoring Committee or \u201cIDMC\u201d governing our clinical trials, or an institutional review board, or \u201cIRB,\u201d which is an independent committee registered with and overseen by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or \u201cHHS,\u201d that functions to approve, monitor and review biomedical and behavioral research involving humans, may suspend clinical trials of a drug candidate at any time for various reasons, including if we, or it, believe the subjects or patients participating in such trials are being exposed to unacceptable health risks. Among other reasons, adverse side effects of a drug candidate on subjects or patients in a clinical trial could result in the FDA or other regulatory authorities suspending or terminating the trial and refusing to approve a particular drug candidate for any or all indications of use.\nClinical trials of a new drug candidate require the enrollment of a sufficient number of patients, including patients who are suffering from the disease the drug candidate is intended to treat and who meet other eligibility criteria. Rates of patient enrollment are affected by many factors, and delays in patient enrollment can result in increased costs and longer development times than we expect at present. Patients who are enrolled at the outset of this standard of care also may eventually choose for personal reasons not to participate in the study. We also compete for eligible patients with other oncology trials underway from time to time, and we may experience delays in patient enrollment due to the dependency of other large trials underway in the same patient population.\nClinical trials also require the review and oversight of IRBs, which approve and continually review clinical investigations to protect the rights and welfare of human subjects. An inability or delay in obtaining IRB approval could prevent or delay the initiation and completion of clinical trials, and the FDA may decide not to consider any data or information derived from a clinical investigation not subject to initial and continuing IRB review and approval.\nIn addition, cancer vaccines are a relatively new form of therapeutic treatment and a very limited number of such products have received regulatory approval. Therefore, the FDA or other regulatory authority may apply standards for approval of a new cancer vaccine that are different from past experience.\nNumerous factors could affect the timing, cost or outcome of our drug development efforts, including the following:\n\u2022\ndifficulties or delays in enrolling patients in our Phase 1/2 clinical trials of GALE-301 and GALE-302 folate binding protein, or other clinical trials in conformity with required protocols or projected timeline or in our other NeuVax clinical trials;\n\u2022\nconditions imposed on us by the FDA, including the possibility that the FDA would require an additional Phase 3 trial of NeuVax, or comparable foreign authorities regarding the scope or design of our clinical trials;\n\u2022\ndifficulties or delays in arranging for third parties to conduct clinical trials of our product candidates;\n\u2022\nproblems in engaging IRBs to oversee trials or problems in obtaining or maintaining IRB approval of studies;\n\u2022\nthird-party contractors failing to comply with regulatory requirements or meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner;\n\u2022\nour drug candidates having very different chemical and pharmacological properties in humans than in laboratory testing and interacting with human biological systems in unforeseen, ineffective or harmful ways, and the possibility that our previous Phase 2 trials will not be indicative of our drug candidates\u2019 performance in larger patient populations;\n\u2022\nthe need to suspend or terminate our clinical trials if the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;\n\u2022\ninsufficient or inadequate supply or quality of our drug candidates or other necessary materials necessary to conduct our clinical trials;\n\u2022\ndisruption at our foreign clinical trial sites resulting from local social or political unrest or other geopolitical factors;\n\u2022\neffects of our drug candidates not being the desired effects or including undesirable side effects or the drug candidates having other unexpected characteristics;\n\u2022\nnegative or inconclusive results from our clinical trials or the clinical trials of others for drug candidates similar to our own or inability to generate statistically significant data confirming the efficacy of the product being tested;\n\u2022\nadverse results obtained by other companies developing similar drugs;\n\u2022\nmodification of the drug during testing; and\n\u2022\nreallocation of our financial and other resources to other clinical programs.\nIt is possible that none of the product candidates that we develop will obtain the appropriate regulatory approvals necessary for us to begin selling them or that any regulatory approval to market a product may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which we may market the product. The time required to obtain FDA and other approvals is unpredictable but often can take years following the commencement of clinical trials, depending upon the complexity of the drug candidate. Any analysis we perform of data from clinical activities is subject to confirmation and interpretation by regulatory authorities, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. Any delay or failure in obtaining required approvals could have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenue from the particular drug candidate.\nIn addition, the length of time to develop the product candidates as well as any regulatory delays in the development and regulatory approval process could cause the patent exclusivity to be unavailable or greatly reduced for each product candidate. The lack of patent exclusivity could have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenue from the particular drug candidate.\nWe are also subject to numerous foreign regulatory requirements governing the conduct of clinical trials, manufacturing and marketing authorization, pricing and third-party reimbursement. The foreign regulatory approval process includes all of the risks associated with the FDA approval described above as well as risks attributable to the satisfaction of local regulations in foreign jurisdictions. Approval by the FDA does not assure approval by regulatory authorities outside of the U.S.\nWe are dependent upon contract manufacturers for clinical supplies of our product candidates, including our sole source of supply of a key component of our Phase 3 PRESENT study of NeuVax.\nWe do not have the facilities or expertise to manufacture supplies of any of our product candidates for clinical trials. Accordingly, we are dependent upon contract manufacturers for these supplies. There can be no assurance that we will be able to secure needed supply arrangements on reasonable terms, or at all. Our failure to secure these arrangements as needed could have a materially adverse effect on our ability to complete the development of our product candidates or, if we obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, to commercialize them.\nOur current plans call for the manufacture of our products by contract manufacturers offering research grade, Good Laboratory Practices grade and Good Manufacturing Practices grade materials for preclinical studies (e.g., toxicology studies) and for clinical use. Certain of our product candidates are complex molecules requiring many synthesis steps, which may lead to challenges with purification and scale-up. These challenges could result in increased costs and delays in manufacturing.\nNeuVax is administered in combination with Leukine, \u201cGM-CSF\u201d is available in both liquid and lyophilized forms exclusively from Genzyme Corporation, or \u201cGenzyme,\u201d a subsidiary of Sanofi-Aventis. We will continue to be dependent on Genzyme for the manufacture of Leukine in connection with the ongoing NeuVax and GALE-301/GALE-302 trials and the potential commercialization activities of these products. Any temporary interruptions or discontinuation of the availability of Leukine, or any determination by us to change the GM-CSF used with NeuVax or GALE-301/GALE-302, may have a material adverse effect on our clinical trials and any commercialization of the thsese products.\nWe may not be able to establish or maintain the third-party relationships that are necessary to develop or potentially commercialize some or all of our product candidates.\nWe expect to depend on collaborators, partners, licensees, clinical research organizations and other third parties to support our discovery efforts, to formulate product candidates, to manufacture our product candidates, and to conduct clinical trials for some or all of our product candidates. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to successfully negotiate agreements for or maintain relationships with collaborators, partners, licensees, clinical investigators, vendors and other third parties on favorable terms, if at all. Our ability to successfully negotiate such agreements will depend on, among other things, potential partners\u2019 evaluation of the superiority of our technology over competing technologies and the quality of the preclinical and clinical data that we have generated, and the perceived risks specific to developing our product candidates. If we are unable to obtain or maintain these agreements, we may not be able to clinically develop, formulate, manufacture, obtain regulatory approvals for or commercialize our product candidates. Under certain license agreements that we have already entered into, we have minimum dollar amounts per year that we are obligated to spend on the development of the technology we have licensed from our contract partners and other obligations to maintain certain licenses. If we fail to meet this requirement under any of our licenses that contain such requirements or any other obligations under these licenses, we may be in breach of our obligations under such agreement, which may result in the loss of the technology licensed. We cannot necessarily control the amount or timing of resources that our contract partners will devote to our research and development programs, product candidates or potential product candidates, and we cannot guarantee that these parties will fulfill its obligations to us under these arrangements in a timely fashion. We may not be able to readily terminate any such agreements with contract partners even if such contract partners do not fulfill its obligations to us.\nIn addition, we may receive notices from third parties from time to time alleging that our technology or product candidates infringe upon the intellectual property rights of those third parties. Any assertion by third parties that our activities or product candidates infringe upon its intellectual property rights may adversely affect our ability to secure strategic partners or licensees for our technology or product candidates or our ability to secure or maintain manufacturers for our compounds.\nWe are subject to competition and may not be able to compete successfully.\nThe biotechnology industry, including the cancer immunotherapy market, is intensely competitive and involves a high degree of risk. Potential competitors in the U.S. and worldwide are numerous and include pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, educational institutions and research foundations. We compete with many of these companies that have far greater experience, capital resources, research and technical resources, marketing experience, research and development staffs and facilities than us. Some of our competitors may develop and commercialize products that compete directly with those incorporating our technology, and they may introduce products to market earlier than our products or on a more cost effective basis. In addition, our technology may be subject to competition from other technology or methods developed using techniques other than those developed by traditional biotechnology methods. Our competitors compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to our technology. We, and our collaborators, may face competition with respect to product efficacy and safety, ease of use and adaptability to various modes of administration, acceptance by physicians, the timing and scope of regulatory approvals, availability of resources, reimbursement coverage, price, and patent position including potentially dominant patent positions of others.\nFor patients with early stage breast cancer, adjuvant therapy is often given to prevent recurrence and increase the chance of long-term disease free survival. Adjuvant therapy for breast cancer can include chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, radiation therapy, or combinations thereof. In addition, the HER2 targeted drug trastuzumab (Herceptin\u00ae) may be given to patients with tumors with high expression of HER2 (IHC 3+), in the adjuvant setting which may be useful in treating breast cancer.\nThere are a number of cancer vaccines in development for breast cancer, including but not limited to Lapuleucel-T (Dendreon), and AE-37 (Antigen Express), and Stimuvax (Merck KgA). While these development candidates are aimed at a number of different targets, and AE-37 has published data in the HER2 breast cancer patient population, there is no guarantee that any of the these compounds will not in the future be indicated for treatment of low to intermediate HER2 breast cancer patients and become directly competitive with NeuVax.\nWe are dependent on technologies we license, and if we lose the right to license such technologies or we fail to license new technologies in the future, our ability to develop new products would be harmed.\nWe currently are dependent on licenses from third parties for technologies relating to our product candidates. Our current licenses impose, and any future licenses we enter into are likely to impose, various development, funding, royalty, diligence, sublicensing, insurance and other obligations on us. If our license with respect to any of these technologies is terminated for any reason, the development of the products contemplated by the licenses would be delayed, or suspended altogether, while we seek to license similar technology or develop new non-infringing technology. The costs of obtaining new licenses are high.\nRisks associated with operating in foreign countries could materially adversely affect our product development.\nWe conduct our Phase 3 PRESENT study of NeuVax in countries outside of the U.S. Consequently, we are, and will continue to be, subject to risks related to operating in foreign countries. Risks associated with conducting operations in foreign countries include:\n\u2022\ndiffering regulatory requirements for drug approvals and regulation of approved drugs in foreign countries;\n\u2022\nunexpected changes in tariffs, trade barriers and regulatory requirements; economic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular foreign economies and markets; compliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad; foreign taxes, including withholding of payroll taxes;\n\u2022\nforeign currency fluctuations, which could result in increased operating expenses or reduced revenues, and other obligations related to doing business or operating in another country;\n\u2022\nworkforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the U.S.;\n\u2022\nproduction shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad; and\n\u2022\nbusiness interruptions resulting from geopolitical actions, including war and terrorism.\nIn addition, there may be political instability, including war, terrorism, riots, civil insurrection or social unrest, and natural or man-made disasters, including famine, flood, fire, earthquake, storm or disease, which could seriously harm the progress of our clinical trials at sites in particular foreign countries or regions. For example, approximately 39 percent of our Phase 3 PRESENT trial sites and approximately 44% of patients who have been randomized in the trial are in Russia and The Ukraine. The occupation of certain portions of Ukrainian territory by Russian-backed separatists and ongoing political and civil unrest there could disrupt activities at these trial sites. It is also possible that Russia could retaliate against the imposition of sanctions by the U.S. and the European Union by banning or restricting business activities in Russia by U.S. companies, including the conduct of clinical trials, which could have a material, adverse effect on patient enrollment or ongoing activities at our Phase 3 PRESENT sites in Russia.\nRisks Relating to Our Financial Position and Capital Requirements\nWe may not be able to obtain sufficient financing, and may not be able to develop our product candidates.\nWe had cash and cash equivalents of approximately $29.7 million as of December 31, 2015. We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents together with the net proceeds from the January 2016 underwritten public offering and use of an amended purchase agreement with LPC and the ATM facilities should be sufficient to fund our operations for at least one year. This projection is based on our current planned operations, anticipated payments for defense costs and settlements or judgments from the securities and derivative actions and opt-out cases, as well as the SEC investigation and other governmental investigations. This projection is subject to change based on potential changes in our plans and uncertainties inherent in our business, and we may need to seek to replenish our existing cash and cash equivalents sooner than we project. We also have funding available under our purchase agreement with LPC (subject to the lock-up restrictions described below as well as certain terms and conditions which may need to be amended) and ATM facilities with MLV & Co. and Maxim Group LLC, but there is no guarantee that such funding will be available to us on favorable terms or will be sufficient to meet all of our future funding needs. In connection with our January offering, we have agreed that, without the prior written consent of Raymond James & Associates, Inc., for a period of 120 days following the date of the prospectus supplement for the January offering, we will not sell any shares of common stock pursuant to our purchase agreement with LPC. If we fail to obtain additional future funding when needed, we could be forced to scale back or terminate our operations, or to seek to merge with or to be acquired by another company.\nWe expect to continue to incur significant research and development expenses, which may make it difficult for us to attain profitability, and may lead to uncertainty about our ability to continue as a going concern.\nSubstantial funds were expended to develop our technologies and product candidates, and additional substantial funds will be required for further preclinical testing and clinical trials of our product candidates, and to manufacture and market any products that are approved for commercial sale. Because the successful development of our products is uncertain, we are unable to precisely estimate the actual funds we will require to develop and potentially commercialize them. In addition, we may not be able to generate enough revenue, even if we are able to commercialize any of our product candidates, to become profitable.\nIn the event that we are unable to achieve or sustain profitability or to secure additional financing, we may not be able to meet our obligations as they come due, raising substantial doubts as to our ability to continue as a going concern. Any such inability to continue as a going concern may result in our common stock holders losing their entire investment. There is no guaranty that we will become profitable or secure additional financing. Our financial statements contemplate that we will continue as a going concern and do not contain any adjustments that might result if we were unable to continue as a going concern. Changes in our operating plans, our existing and anticipated working capital needs, the acceleration or modification of our expansion plans, increased expenses, potential acquisitions or other events will all affect our ability to continue as a going concern. Future financing may be obtained through, and future development efforts may be paid for by, the issuance of debt or equity, which may have an adverse effect on our security holders or may otherwise adversely affect our business.\nIf we raise funds through the issuance of debt or equity, any debt securities or preferred stock issued will have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock in the event of a liquidation. In such event, there is a possibility that once all senior claims are settled, there may be no assets remaining to pay out to the holders of common stock. In addition, if we raise funds through the issuance of additional equity, whether through private placements or additional public offerings, such an issuance would dilute your ownership in us.\nThe terms of debt securities may also impose restrictions on our operations, which may include limiting our ability to incur additional indebtedness, to pay dividends on or repurchase our capital stock, or to make certain acquisitions or investments. In addition, we may be subject to covenants requiring us to satisfy certain financial tests and ratios, and our ability to satisfy such covenants may be affected by events outside of our control.\nYou may have difficulty evaluating our business, and our historical financial information may not be representative of our future results.\nWe recently sold our Abstral and Zuplenz products and related assets and discontinued our commercial operations as of December 31, 2015 in order to focus our resources on our pipeline of product development candidates. As a result, we will have no recurring revenues unless and until we are able to obtain marketing approval of NeuVax or one or more of our other product candidates and our historical financial information may not be representative of our future results.\nWe may be unable to comply with our reporting and other requirements under federal securities laws.\nAs a publicly traded company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the \u201cExchange Act,\u201d and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act.\u201d In addition, the Exchange Act requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports. Our failure to prepare and disclose this information in a timely manner could subject us to penalties under federal securities laws, expose us to lawsuits and restrict our ability to access financing. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we, among other things, establish and maintain effective internal controls and procedures for financial reporting. From time to time we evaluate our existing internal controls in light of the standards adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. It is possible that we or our independent registered public accounting firm may identify significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the future. Any failure or difficulties in implementing and maintaining these controls could cause us to fail to meet the periodic reporting obligations or result in material misstatements in our financial statements.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires annual management and independent auditor assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Our failure to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 on a timely basis could result in the loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business and our common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nWe may not be able to obtain and enforce patent rights or other intellectual property rights that cover our product candidates and that are of sufficient breadth to prevent third parties from competing against us.\nOur success with respect to our product candidates will depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patent protection in the U.S. and abroad, to preserve our trade secrets, and to prevent third parties from infringing upon our proprietary rights. Our patents and patent applications, however, may not be sufficient to provide protection for NeuVax or our other products and product candidates against commercial competition.\nThe active peptide found in NeuVax, the E75 peptide, has been known and studied for many years. We have one issued U.S. patent, US 6,514,942, covering the composition of matter of the E75 peptide, which expired in mid-2015, prior to any potential commercialization of NeuVax. We do not have and will not be able to obtain any composition of matter patent protection for E75, the active peptide in NeuVax. We also have a license from The Henry M. Jackson Foundation to an issued U.S. European, Japanese and Australian method of use patents, which expire in 2028, that are directed to a method of inducing immunity against breast cancer recurrence by administering a composition comprising the E75 peptide to patients who have both an immunohistochemistry (IHC) rating of 1+ or 2+ for HER2/neu protein expression and a fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) rating of less than about 2.0 for HER2/neu gene expression. The license further includes an issued U.S. method of use patent, and pending applications in a number of foreign jurisdictions, which expires in 2028, that are directed to a method of inducing immunity against recurrence of any HER2/neu expressing tumors by administering the E75 peptide to patients with tumors having a FISH rating of less than about 2.0 for HER2/neu gene expression. Also included in the license is a method of use patent, which expires in 2026, that is directed to the use of NeuVax in combination with Herceptin \u00ae to treat any HER2/neu expressing cancer. Thus, our method of use patent may not prevent competitors from seeking to develop and market NeuVax for use in cancer patients who do not meet these criteria. If any such alternative uses were approved, this could lead to off-label use and price erosion for our NeuVax product. We may seek FDA approval for use of NeuVax to treat cancer patients who fall outside the claimed IHC and FISH ranges and for other cancers as well. Although we are pursuing additional patent protection for NeuVax through pending patent applications, we may not be able to obtain additional patent protection that would provide us with a significant commercial advantage.\nThe active peptides found in GALE-301 and GALE-302 are derived from Folate Binding Protein. One of the active peptides, E39, has been known and studied for many years. The other active peptide, GALE-302, is a derivative of E39. We have a license from The Henry M. Jackson Foundation to issued and granted patents in the U.S., Europe, Canada, and Japan, covering composition of matter for the E39 derivative peptides, including GALE-302, alone and in combination with E39, as well as the use of these compositions for the treatment of cancer. These patents are expected to expire in 2022, prior to any potential commercialization of GALE-301. We do not have and will not be able to obtain any composition of matter patent protection for the E39 peptide in any territory and our patents may not prevent competitors from seeking to develop and market the E39 peptide alone. The license we have from The Henry M. Jackson Foundation grants us the right to develop and market GALE-301 for any use, including methods of treating cancer. If any such alternative uses of compositions containing the E39 peptide were approved, this could lead to off-label use and price erosion for GALE-301. We may seek FDA approval for use of GALE-301 alone or in combination with GALE-302, to treat cancer patients with ovarian and endometrial cancers and for other cancers, as well. Although we are pursuing additional patent protection for GALE-301 and the combination of GALE-301 and GALE-302 through pending patent applications, we may not be able to obtain additional patent protection that would provide us with a significant commercial advantage.\nAnagrelide hydrochloride, the sole active pharmaceutical ingredient, or \u201cAPI,\u201d in GALE-401, has been approved for many years and, thus, it is not possible to obtain composition of matter patents that cover anagrelide hydrochloride. As a result, competitors who obtain the requisite regulatory approval can offer products with the same API as GALE-401, so long as the competitors do not infringe any formulation patents that we may have or may obtain or license, if any. The only patent protection that we have or are likely to obtain covering GALE-401 are patents relating to very specific formulations, methods using these formulations, and methods of manufacturing and packaging. We have an issued U.S. Patent, which expires in 2020, covering methods of anagrelide to reduce platelet count in patients subject to veno-occlusive events. We have granted patents in the U.S., United Kingdom and Japan, which expire in 2029, covering controlled release formulations of anagrelide and methods of use. We are also prosecuting pending patent applications in other territories including but not limited to the U.S. Europe, and Japan, which may not issue prior to any potential commercialization of GALE-401. We may seek FDA approval for use of GALE-401 to treat patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms that include several hematological disorders. Although we are pursuing additional patent protection for GALE-401 through pending patent applications, we may not be able to obtain additional patent protection that would provide us with a significant commercial advantage.\nOur ability to obtain, maintain and enforce patents is uncertain and involves complex legal and factual questions. Accordingly, rights under any patents we have or may obtain or license may not provide us with sufficient protection for our commercial product and product candidates to afford a commercial advantage against competitive products or processes, including those from branded and generic pharmaceutical companies selling branded or generic products. In addition, we cannot guarantee that any patents will issue from any pending or future patent applications owned by or licensed to us. Nor can we guarantee that the claims of these patents will be held valid or enforceable by the courts or will provide us with any significant protection against competitive products or otherwise be commercially valuable to us.\nChanges in either the patent laws or in the interpretations of patent laws in the U.S. or abroad may diminish the value of our intellectual property. In addition, on September 16, 2011, the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act, or the Leahy-Smith Act, was signed into law. The Leahy-Smith Act includes a number of significant changes to the U.S. patent law. These include provisions that affect the way patent applications will be prosecuted and may also affect patent litigation. The U.S. Patent Office is currently developing regulations and procedures to govern administration of the Leahy-Smith Act, and many substantive changes to patent law associated with the Leahy-Smith Act have not yet become effective. Accordingly, it is not clear what, if any, impact the Leahy-Smith Act will have on the operation of our business. However, the Leahy-Smith Act, in particular the first-to-file provision and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement of or defense of our issued patents, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents or in third-party patents.\nWhile we intend to take actions reasonably necessary to enforce our patent rights, we may not be able to detect infringement of our own or in-licensed patents, which may be especially difficult for methods of manufacturing or formulation products, and we depend, in part, on our licensors and collaborators to protect a substantial portion of our proprietary rights. In addition, third parties may challenge our in-licensed patents and any of our own patents that we may obtain, which could result in the invalidation or unenforceability of some or all of the relevant patent claims. Litigation or other proceedings to enforce or defend intellectual property rights is very complex, expensive, and may divert our management\u2019s attention from our core business and may result in unfavorable results that could adversely affect our ability to prevent third parties from competing with us.\nIf another party has reason to assert a substantial new question of patentability against any of our claims in our own and in-licensed patents, the third party can request that the patent claims be reexamined, which may result in a loss of scope of some claims or a loss of the entire patent. In addition to potential infringement suits and, interference and reexamination proceedings, we may become a party to patent opposition proceedings where either the patentability of the inventions subject of our patents are challenged, or we are challenging the patents of others. The costs of these proceedings could be substantial, and it is possible that such efforts would be unsuccessful.\nAs the medical device, biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are issued, the risk increases that others may assert our commercial product and/or product candidates infringe their patent rights. If a third-party\u2019s patents were found to cover our commercial product and product candidates, proprietary technologies or its uses, we or our collaborators could be enjoined by a court and required to pay damages and could be unable to continue to commercialize our products or use our proprietary technologies unless we or it obtained a license to the patent. A license may not be available to us or our collaborators on acceptable terms, if at all. In addition, during litigation, the patent holder could obtain a preliminary injunction or other equitable relief, which could prohibit us from making, using or selling our commercial product and product candidates pending a trial on the merits, which could be years away.\nProprietary trade secrets and unpatented know-how are also very important to our business. Although we have taken steps to protect our trade secrets and unpatented know-how, by entering into confidentiality agreements with third parties, and proprietary information and invention agreements with certain employees, consultants and advisors, third parties may still obtain this information or we may be unable to protect our rights. We also have limited control over the protection of trade secrets used by our licensors, collaborators and suppliers. There can be no assurance that binding agreements will not be breached, that we would have adequate remedies for any breach, or that our trade secrets and unpatented know-how will not otherwise become known or be independently discovered by our competitors. If trade secrets are independently discovered, we would not be able to prevent their use. Enforcing a claim that a third party illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets or unpatented know-how is expensive and time consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees, consultants or independent contractors have wrongfully used or disclosed to us alleged trade secrets of their other clients or former employers. As is common in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry, certain of our employees were formerly employed by other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Moreover, we engage the services of consultants to assist us in the development of our commercial product and product candidates, many of whom were previously employed at or may have previously been or are currently providing consulting services to, other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. We may be subject to claims that these employees and consultants or we have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers or their former or current customers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these types of claims. Even if we are successful in defending against any such claims, any such litigation would likely be protracted, expensive, a distraction to our management team, not viewed favorably by investors and other third parties, and may potentially result in an unfavorable outcome.\nOur product candidates may face competition sooner than expected after the expiration of our composition of matter patent protection for such products.\nOur composition of matter patents for many of our product candidates have expired or will expire prior to any product approval. We intend to seek data exclusivity or market exclusivity for our NeuVax, GALE-301 and GALE-302 product candidates provided under the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, and similar laws in other countries. We believe that these product candidates will qualify for 12 years of data exclusivity under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009, or BPCIA, which was enacted as part of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Affordability Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the Affordable Care Act or ACA) enacted in March 2010. Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar product or biologics license application (BLA) cannot be submitted to the FDA until four years, or if approved by the FDA, until 12 years, after the original brand product identified as the reference product is approved under a BLA. The BPCIA provides an abbreviated pathway for the approval of biosimilar and interchangeable biological products. The new abbreviated regulatory pathway establishes legal authority for the FDA to review and approve biosimilar biologics, including the possible designation of a biosimilar as \u201cinterchangeable\u201d based on its similarity to an existing brand product. The new law is complex and is only beginning to be interpreted and implemented by the FDA. While it is uncertain when any such processes may be fully adopted by the FDA, any such processes could have a material adverse effect on the future commercial prospects for our biological product candidates. There is also a risk that the U.S. Congress could amend the BPCIA to shorten this exclusivity period, potentially creating the opportunity for biosimilar competition sooner than anticipated after the expiration of our patent protection. Moreover, the extent to which a biosimilar, once approved, will be substituted for any reference product in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for non-biological products is not yet clear, and will depend on a number of marketplace and regulatory factors that are still developing.\nIf our product candidates are not considered biologics that would qualify for exclusivity under the BPCIA, they may be eligible for market exclusivity as drugs under the FDCA. The FDCA provides a five-year period of non-patent marketing exclusivity within the U.S. to the first applicant to gain approval of a new drug application (NDA) for a new chemical entity. A drug is a new chemical entity if the FDA has not previously approved any other new drug containing the same active moiety, which is the molecule or ion responsible for the action of the drug substance. During the exclusivity period, the FDA may not accept for review an abbreviated new drug application, or ANDA, or a 505(b)(2) NDA, submitted by another company for another version of such drug where the applicant does not own or have a legal right of reference to all the data required for approval. However, an application may be submitted after four years if it contains a certification of patent invalidity or non-infringement. The FDCA also provides three years of marketing exclusivity for an NDA, 505(b)(2) NDA or supplement to an existing NDA if new clinical investigations, other than bioavailability studies, that were conducted or sponsored by the applicant are deemed by the FDA to be essential to the approval of the application, for example, for new indications, dosages, or strengths of an existing drug. This three-year exclusivity covers only the conditions associated with the new clinical investigations and does not prohibit the FDA from approving ANDAs for drugs containing the original active agent.\nEven if, as we expect, NeuVax, GALE-301 and GALE-302 are considered to be reference products eligible for 12 years of exclusivity under the BPCIA or five years of exclusivity under the FDCA, another company could market competing products if the FDA approves a full BLA or full NDA for such product containing the sponsor\u2019s own preclinical data and data from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials to demonstrate the safety, purity and potency of the products.\nIn some countries outside of the U.S., peptide vaccines, such as NeuVax and GALE-301 and GALE-302, are regulated as chemical drugs rather than as biologics and may or may not be eligible for non-patent exclusivity.\nRisks Relating to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe market price and trading volume of our common stock may be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock has exhibited substantial volatility recently. Between January 1, 2015 and February 29, 2016, the sale price of our common stock as reported on The NASDAQ Capital Market ranged from a low of $0.59 to a high of $2.39. The market price of our common stock could continue to fluctuate significantly for many reasons, including the following factors:\n\u2022\nreports of the results of our clinical trials regarding the safety or efficacy of our product candidates and surrogate markers;\n\u2022\nannouncements of regulatory developments or technological innovations by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nannouncements of business or strategic transactions;\n\u2022\nannouncements of legal or regulatory actions against us or any adverse outcome of any such actions;\n\u2022\nchanges in our relationship with our licensors, licensees and other strategic partners;\n\u2022\nour quarterly operating results;\n\u2022\ndevelopments in patent or other technology ownership rights;\n\u2022\npublic concern regarding the safety of our product candidates;\n\u2022\nadditional funds may not be available on terms that are favorable to us and, in the case of equity financings, may result in dilution to our stockholders;\n\u2022\ngeneral changes in the economy, the financial markets or the pharmaceutical or biotechnology industries.\nFactors beyond our control may also have an impact on the price of our stock. For example, to the extent that other companies within our industry experience declines in their stock prices, our stock price may decline as well.\nBecause our stock price has remained below $1.00 for more than thirty (30) consecutive trading days, the Company is therefore not in compliance with the requirements for continued inclusion on the Nasdaq Capital Market under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2). In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company has 180 calendar days, or until August 22, 2016, to regain compliance with this minimum bid price requirement. The Notice has no immediate effect on the Nasdaq listing or trading of the Company\u2019s common stock. The Company can regain compliance with the $1 minimum bid listing requirements of the Nasdaq Capital Market if the closing bid price of the Company\u2019s common stock is $1.00 per share or higher for a minimum of ten consecutive business days during this initial 180-day compliance period. If compliance is not achieved by August 22, 2016, the Company expects that Nasdaq would provide written notification to the Company that its securities are subject to delisting. The Company will continue to monitor the closing bid price for its common stock and consider its available options to regain compliance with the Nasdaq minimum bid requirements, which may include applying for an extension of the compliance period or appealing to a Nasdaq Hearings Panel.\nIn the event that we fail to regain compliance with Nasdaq continued listing standards by the expiration of the applicable cure period or any extension period, Nasdaq will commence suspension and delisting procedures with respect to our common stock, which could impair the value of your investment. If our common stock is delisted from Nasdaq Capital Market in the future, such securities may be traded over-the-counter on the \u201cpink sheets.\u201d The alternative market, however, is generally considered to be less efficient than, and not as broad as, Nasdaq. Accordingly, delisting of our common stock from Nasdaq could have a significant negative effect on the trading volume, liquidity and market price of our common stock. In addition, the delisting of our common stock could adversely affect our ability to raise capital on terms acceptable to us or at all and could reduce the number of investors willing to hold or acquire our common stock.\nWe are, and in the future may be, subject to legal or administrative actions that could adversely affect our financial condition and our business.\nOn February 4, 2016, the United States District Court for the District of Oregon granted preliminary approval of the settlement we had reached in In re Galena Biopharma, Inc. Derivative Litigation, Civil Action No. 3:14-cv-00382-SI. The Court has set the final approval hearing for April 21, 2016. We have agreed to resolve and settle In re Galena Biopharma, Inc. Derivative Litigation, Civil Action No. 3:14-cv-00382-SI, currently pending in the United States District Court for the District of Oregon against us and certain of our current and former officers and directors. The settlement will not become effective until approved by the Court. The settlement includes a payment of $15 million in cash by our insurance carriers, which we will use to fund a portion of the class action settlement, and cancellation of 1,200,000 outstanding director stock options. The settlement also will require that we adopt and implement certain corporate governance measures and will provide that the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel may apply to the court for an award of attorneys\u2019 fees and expenses up to $5 million. Any fees and expenses awarded by the court to the plaintiffs\u2019 counsel will be paid by our insurance carriers. The settlement will not include any admission of wrongdoing or liability on the part of us or the individual defendants and will include a full release of us and the individual defendants in connection with the allegations made in the consolidated federal derivative actions and state court derivative actions.\nOn February16, 2016, the United States District Court for the District of Oregon granted preliminary approval of the settlement we had reached in In re Galena Biopharma, Inc. Securities Litigation, Civil Action No. 3:14-cv-00367-SI. The Court has set the final approval hearing for June 23, 2016. We have agreed to resolve and settle In re Galena Biopharma, Inc. Securities Litigation pending against us, certain of our current and former officers and directors and other defendants in the United States District Court for the District of Oregon. The agreement, which is subject to shareholder notice and Court approval, provides for a settlement payment of $20 million to the class and the dismissal of all claims against us and tour current and former officers and directors in connection with the consolidated federal securities class actions. Of the $20 million settlement payment to the class, $16.7 million will be paid by our insurance carriers and $3.3 million will be paid by us through a combination of $2.3 million in cash and $1 million in shares of our common stock. We will be responsible for defense costs and any settlements or judgments incurred for any related opt-out lawsuits.\nAs a result of these settlements, we are responsible without insurance reimbursement for legal fees and costs incurred on our behalf as well as the current and former directors and officers in obtaining the Court\u2019s approval for the settlements. We are also responsible without insurance reimbursement for the legal fees and costs and any settlements and judgments on our behalf as well as the current and former directors and officers of any opt-out securities lawsuits and any other lawsuits raising similar claims. Those legal fees and costs as well as any settlements and judgments may have a material impact upon the use of our cash to fund our development programs and our ongoing operations.\nThe SEC is investigating certain matters relating to the use of certain outside investor-relations professionals by us and other public companies. We have been in contact with the SEC staff through our counsel and are cooperating with the investigation. We cannot predict with certainty the outcomes of this investigation, but the cost of defending against lawsuits and complying with the government investigation could be substantial and could significantly divert management\u2019s attention and resources. The outcome of this investigation could require us to take, or refrain from taking, actions which could negatively affect our operations, could require us to pay substantial amounts of money and could make it more difficult to obtain capital or access our revolving line of credit. Negative publicity surrounding this government investigation and legal actions also may harm our reputation and the demand for our products. Any one of these results could negatively affect our operations, financial condition and liquidity and impair our ability to grow or sustain our business.\nLitigation is inherently uncertain. We have incurred and may continue to incur substantial non-insurance reimbursed legal fees and other expenses in connection with these or other legal and regulatory proceedings that may not qualify for coverage under, or may exceed the limits of, our applicable directors and officers liability insurance policies and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity, and results of operations. These matters also may distract the time and attention of our officers and directors or divert our other resources away from our ongoing commercial and development programs. An unfavorable outcome in any of these matters could damage our business and reputation or result in additional claims or proceedings against us.\nThe Delaware forum provision of our amended and restated by-laws will not be given effect.\nOn August 6, 2013, our board of directors purported to adopt an amendment to our Amended and Restated By-Laws to add a new Section 6.15 to provide that, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders. Under the Delaware General Corporation Law, or DGCL, if the board of directors of a Delaware corporation such as our company is intended to have the power to adopt and amend the bylaws, that power must be set forth in the corporation\u2019s certificate of incorporation. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation does not provide for the power of our board to adopt and amend the bylaws, and we have determined that the Delaware forum bylaw is inconsistent with the DGCL and will not be given effect.\nFuture sales of substantial amounts of our common stock, or the possibility that such sales could occur, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nFuture sales in the public market of shares of our common stock, including shares referred to in the foregoing risk factors or shares issued upon exercise of our outstanding stock options, or the perception by the market that these sales could occur, could lower the market price of our common stock or make it difficult for us to raise additional capital.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had reserved for issuance 13,261,950 shares of our common stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding stock options at a weighted-average exercise price of $2.58 per share and 22,308,475 shares of our common stock issuable upon the exercise of outstanding warrants at a weighted-average exercise price of $2.10 per share. Upon exercise of these options and warrants, the underlying shares may be resold into the public market. In the case of outstanding options and warrants that have exercise prices that are below the market price of our common stock from time to time, our stockholders would experience dilution upon the exercise of these options.\nOur outstanding warrants may result in dilution to our stockholders.\nOur outstanding March 2011 and April 2011 warrants to purchase a total of 791,398 shares of common stock as of December 31, 2015 at a current exercise price of $0.65 per share contain so-called full-ratchet anti-dilution provisions. Our outstanding March 2010 and December 2012 warrants to purchase 25,000 shares and 3,031,311 shares, respectively, of common stock as of December 31, 2015 at exercise prices of $2.02 and $1.83, respectively, per share contain so-called weighted-average anti-dilution provisions. These anti-dilution provisions may be triggered by the issuance of the shares being offered hereby or upon any future issuance by us of shares of our common stock or common stock equivalents at a price per share below the then-exercise price of the warrants, subject to some exceptions.\nTo the extent that these anti-dilution provisions are triggered in the future, we would be required to reduce the exercise price of all of the warrants on either a full-ratchet or weighted-average basis, which would have a dilutive effect on our stockholders.\nWe may issue preferred stock in the future, and the terms of the preferred stock may reduce the value of our common stock.\nWe are authorized to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series. Our board of directors may determine the terms of future preferred stock offerings without further action by our stockholders. If we issue preferred stock, it could affect stockholder rights or reduce the market value of our outstanding common stock. In particular, specific rights granted to future holders of preferred stock may include voting rights, preferences as to dividends and liquidation, conversion and redemption rights, sinking fund provisions, and restrictions on our ability to merge with or sell our assets to a third party.\nAnti-takeover provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws and provisions of Delaware law could delay or prevent a change of control that our stockholders may favor.\nAnti-takeover provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or other change of control that stockholders may consider favorable or may impede the ability of the holders of our common stock to change our management. These provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, among other things:\n\u2022divide our board of directors into three classes, with members of each class to be elected for staggered three-year terms;\n\u2022limit the right of security holders to remove directors;\n\u2022prohibit stockholders from acting by written consent;\n\u2022regulate how stockholders may present proposals or nominate directors for election at annual meetings of stockholders; and\n\u2022authorize our board of directors to issue preferred stock in one or more series, without stockholder approval.\nIn addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law provides that, subject to limited exceptions, persons that acquire, or are affiliated with a person that acquires, more than 15% of the outstanding voting stock of a Delaware corporation such as our company shall not engage in any business combination with that corporation, including by merger, consolidation or acquisitions of additional shares for a three-year period following the date on which that person or its affiliate crosses the 15% stock ownership threshold. Section 203 could operate to delay or prevent a change of control of our company.\nWe have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock and we do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nOur business requires significant funding. We currently plan to invest all available funds and future earnings in the development and growth of our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future, and are prohibited by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness from paying dividends on any common stock, except with the prior consent of our lenders. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be our stockholders\u2019 sole source of potential gain for the foreseeable future.", "PERMNO": 92594, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "SLS"}
