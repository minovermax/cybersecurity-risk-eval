Risk Factors\nAn investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. Anyone who is making an investment decision regarding our securities should carefully consider the following risk factors, as well as the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this report. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we currently believe may materially affect our company or your investment. Other risks and uncertainties that we do not presently consider to be material, or of which we\nare not presently aware, may become important factors that adversely affect our security holders or us in the future. If any of the risks discussed below actually materialize, then our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows and future prospects, or your investment in our securities, could be materially and adversely affected, resulting in a loss of all or part of your investment.\nRisks Relating to Pharmacyclics\nIMBRUVICA\u00ae (ibrutinib) is our only approved drug.\nOur prospects are largely dependent on (a) successful commercialization of IMBRUVICA in the U.S. and outside the U.S. to treat the approved patient populations, and (b) obtaining regulatory approval of, and successfully commercializing, IMBRUVICA both in and outside the U.S. to treat other indications. If we are unsuccessful in achieving any one or more of these critical business objectives, our ability to generate significant revenue or achieve profitability will be adversely affected and our business may fail.\nThe commercialization of IMBRUVICA for the treatment of current patient populations or any patient populations for which IMBRUVICA may be subsequently approved may not be successful for a number of reasons, including:\n\u2022\nwe and our collaborative partner, Janssen, may face unexpected challenges from competitors with potential new therapeutic options and also in overcoming inertia in the adoption of upcoming novel therapies such as IMBRUVICA;\n\u2022\nnew safety issues or concerns with respect to IMBRUVICA being reported that may impact or narrow the approved indications;\n\u2022\nour level of experience in marketing IMBRUVICA is limited to the time during which IMBRUVICA has been commercially available for any patient population;\n\u2022\nreimbursement and coverage policies of government and private payers such as Medicare, Medicaid, insurance companies, health maintenance organizations and other plan administrators could change unexpectedly;\n\u2022\ngovernment price controls and reimbursement policies in foreign countries;\n\u2022\nthe relative price of IMBRUVICA as compared to alternative treatment options;\n\u2022\nchanged or increased legal or regulatory restrictions and our ability to comply with such restrictions;\n\u2022\nchanges to the label for IMBRUVICA that further restrict how we and Janssen market IMBRUVICA, arising from the results of any other on-going or future studies, including post-marketing studies; and\n\u2022\nwe and Janssen may not be able to obtain adequate commercial supplies of IMBRUVICA to meet demand or at an acceptable cost because of manufacturing or other issues, including a potential recall of IMBRUVICA.\nIf the commercialization of IMBRUVICA is unsuccessful, our ability to generate revenue from product sales and achieve profitability will be adversely affected.\nOur success will depend on our ability to effectively and profitably commercialize IMBRUVICA.\nOur success will depend on our ability to effectively and profitably commercialize IMBRUVICA, which will include our ability to:\n\u2022\ncreate continued market demand for IMBRUVICA through education, marketing and sales activities;\n\u2022\nachieve market acceptance and generate product sales;\n\u2022\nreceive continued reimbursement from third-party payers, such as federal government payers and private insurance programs;\n\u2022\ncomply with post-marketing requirements established by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and applicable foreign regulatory agencies, for IMBRUVICA, and any other requirements established by the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies in the future;\n\u2022\ncomply with the regulations and guidelines of the FDA, and applicable foreign regulatory agencies, surrounding promotional activities for IMBRUVICA;\n\u2022\nconduct the post-marketing studies required by the FDA;\n\u2022\ncomply with other healthcare regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nensure that the active pharmaceutical ingredient, or API, for IMBRUVICA and the finished product are manufactured in sufficient quantities and in compliance with requirements of the FDA and similar foreign regulatory agencies and with an acceptable quality and pricing level in order to meet commercial demand; and\n\u2022\nensure that the entire supply chain for IMBRUVICA - from API to finished product - efficiently and consistently delivers IMBRUVICA to our customers.\nPrior to our commercialization of IMBRUVICA, we did not have any commercial products. We believe our Sales and Marketing organizations have the technical expertise and experience that will be required for the successful marketing of IMBRUVICA in the U.S. However, we still cannot be certain that our commercialization efforts will continue to be successful for a number of reasons, including the fact that our level of experience in marketing IMBRUVICA is limited to the time during which IMBRUVICA has been commercially available for any patient population. If we are unable to continue to successfully commercialize IMBRUVICA, our ability to generate product sales will be severely limited, which will have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAcceptance of our products in the marketplace is uncertain, and failure to achieve market acceptance may harm our business.\nAlthough approved for marketing for the treatment of certain patient populations, IMBRUVICA may not achieve robust market acceptance. The degree of market acceptance for IMBRUVICA and our other product candidates will depend upon a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe receipt of regulatory approvals for additional indications of IMBRUVICA and the desired indications for our other product candidates, and the acceptance by physicians and patients of the clinical benefits that IMBRUVICA and our other product candidates may offer;\n\u2022\nthe establishment and demonstration in the medical community of the safety, clinical efficacy and cost-effectiveness of IMBRUVICA and our other product candidates and their potential advantages over existing therapeutic products;\n\u2022\nmarketing and distribution support;\n\u2022\nthe introduction, market penetration, and pricing of competing and future products; and\n\u2022\nthe general willingness of physicians, patients, payers or the medical community to accept, purchase, utilize or recommend IMBRUVICA or any of our other product candidates.\nIf we are unable to obtain additional marketing approvals for IMBRUVICA, or if we are significantly delayed or limited in doing so, our results of operations and business will be materially and adversely affected and our stock price would likely decline.\nDespite the marketing approvals that we have received to date, we do not know nor can we predict with any certainty that we will obtain additional marketing approvals for IMBRUVICA from the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities. In addition, we cannot predict the timeframe for any additional marketing approvals that we may receive. The review and potential approval of IMBRUVICA carries many risks and uncertainties, and our regulatory submissions outside of the U.S. may not be satisfactory to the applicable regulatory authorities, including with regard to demonstrating adequate safety and efficacy for regulatory approval. We have made, and expect to make in the future, assumptions, estimations, calculations and decisions as part of our analyses of data and regulatory submissions, and the applicable regulatory authorities may not accept or agree with our assumptions, estimations, calculations, decisions or analyses or may interpret or weigh the importance of data differently.\nFurthermore, as was the case with approvals that we received from the FDA and European Commission (EC), other regulatory approvals, even if obtained, may be limited to specific indications, limit the type of patients in which the drug may be used, or otherwise require specific warning or labeling language, any of which might reduce the commercial potential of IMBRUVICA. As with the FDA\u2019s and EC's approval of IMBRUVICA, regulatory authorities in other territories may condition IMBRUVICA marketing approval on the conduct of specific post-marketing studies to further evaluate safety and efficacy in particular and/or general patient populations. The results of these studies, discovery of previously unknown issues involving safety or efficacy or failure to comply with post-approval regulatory requirements, including requirements with respect to manufacturing practices, reporting of adverse events, advertising, promotion and marketing, may result in restrictions on the marketing of IMBRUVICA or the withdrawal of IMBRUVICA from the market.\nWe are subject to certain healthcare laws, regulations and enforcement that may impact the commercialization of IMBRUVICA and our product candidates. Failure to comply with such evolving laws, regulations and enforcement could subject us to significant fines and penalties and result in a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to statutory and administrative regulation of healthcare enforced by the federal government and the states, and applicable foreign equivalents, in which we conduct our business. These laws may impact, among other things, the viability of the corporation as a whole, and more specifically, the sales, marketing and education programs for IMBRUVICA or any of\nour potential future product candidates that may be approved for commercial sale. Among the most significant healthcare laws, regulations and enforcement areas are the following:\n\u2022\nthe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (collectively, HIPAA), as amended by the Health Information for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009 (HITECH) which governs the conduct of certain electronic healthcare transactions and protects the security and privacy of protected health information;\n\u2022\nthe federal healthcare programs\u2019 Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;\n\u2022\nfederal False Claims Act which prohibits, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payers that are false or fraudulent;\n\u2022\nthe federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which, among other things, strictly regulates drug product marketing, prohibits manufacturers from marketing drug products for off-label use, and regulates the distribution of drug samples;\n\u2022\nthe Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which among other things, prohibits bribery of non-U.S. government (i.e., foreign) officials;\n\u2022\nthe PhRMA Code on Interactions with Healthcare Professionals (codified into law in California), which among other things, governs appropriate interactions between pharmaceutical manufacturers and healthcare professionals;\n\u2022\nthe federal Physician Payment Sunshine Act, which requires manufacturers to report payments and other \"transfers of value\" provided to physicians and teaching hospitals to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services;\n\u2022\nfederal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;\n\u2022\nstate law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payer, including federal government payers and commercial insurers; and\n\u2022\ninternational law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, where applicable, such as EFPIA Code, UK Bribery Act, or international transparency and reporting requirements.\nAdditionally, the compliance environment is changing, with more states, such as California and Massachusetts, mandating implementation of compliance programs, compliance with industry ethics codes, and spending limits, and other states, such as Vermont, District of Columbia, and Minnesota limiting the provision of and/or requiring reporting to state governments of gifts, compensation, and other remuneration to healthcare professionals. Moreover, Section 6002 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or PPACA, includes new requirements for pharmaceuticals manufacturers, among others, to report certain financial arrangements with physicians and teaching hospitals, as defined in PPACA, including reporting any payment or \u201ctransfer of value\u201d made or distributed to teaching hospitals, prescribers, and other healthcare providers and reporting any ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members and applicable group purchasing organizations during the preceding calendar year. Section 6002 of PPACA includes in its reporting requirements a broad range of transfers of value (such as, for example, consulting fees, charitable contributions, payments for research, and grants), but excludes from the reporting obligation any transfer of value which is less than $10, unless the aggregate amount of such transfers of value to a recipient exceeds $100 annually. On February 8, 2013, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, released the final rule implementing Section 6002 of PPACA. Under the rule, drug manufacturers are required to track payments or transfers of value to recipients beginning on August 1, 2013, and annually report payments, transfers for value, and investments interests beginning on March 31, 2014. Under the rule, with our product approval on November 13, 2013 for MCL, we commenced data capture from May 12, 2014, 6 months from product registration, for reporting by March 31, 2015. Several states currently have similar laws and more states may enact similar legislation. Reporting and potential public disclosure of these expenses may make it more difficult to recruit physicians for assistance with activities that would be helpful to our business. Tracking and reporting the required expenses may result in considerable expense and additional resources.\nWhile we have developed and implemented a corporate compliance program, which adheres to: (1) the requirements set forth by the OIG in OIG\u2019s Compliance Program Guidance for Pharmaceutical Manufacturers, as codified into law in California, (2) the PhRMA Code on Interactions with Healthcare Professionals as codified into law in California, and (3) other applicable healthcare compliance laws and regulations, and is largely based on what we believe are the current pharmaceutical industry best practices, we cannot provide any assurance that governmental authorities will find that our business practices comply with current or future administrative or judicial interpretations of potentially applicable laws and regulations.\nIf our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, the exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs and imprisonment, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results.\nCurrent health care laws and regulations, including the recently enacted health care reform, as well as future legislative or regulatory changes to the healthcare system, may affect our ability to sell our products profitably.\nIn the U.S., there has been recent legislation, as well as legislative and regulatory proposals, changing the healthcare system in ways that may affect our future revenue and profitability, and the future revenue and profitability of our potential customers, suppliers and collaborative partners, and the availability of capital. Federal and state lawmakers regularly propose and, at times, enact legislation that would result in significant changes to the healthcare system and, in particular, that are intended to contain or reduce the costs of medical products and services.\nThe most significant recent health care legislation is the PPACA, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or the \u201cHealthcare Reform Act\u201d, which President Obama signed into law in March 2010. This law substantially changes how health care is funded by the state and federal government as well as private insurers, and significantly impacts the pharmaceutical industry. Though the full effect of the Healthcare Reform Act on pharmaceutical companies has yet to be seen, the changes that may affect our business include those governing enrollment in federal healthcare programs, reimbursement changes, new governmental programs, and fraud and abuse enforcements. The Healthcare Reform Act takes effect in stages through 2018.\nCertain aspects of the Health Care Reform Act are likely to adversely affect pharmaceutical manufacturers in particular. For example, in 2011, the Healthcare Reform Act imposed non-deductible annual flat fees on pharmaceutical manufacturers and importers based upon relative market share. Furthermore, as part of the Healthcare Reform Act closing a funding gap in the Medicare Part D prescription drug program, certain pharmaceutical manufacturers will be required to provide a 50% discount on drugs dispensed to beneficiaries within this funding gap.\nThere also have been and likely will continue to be legislative and regulatory proposals at the state and federal levels that could bring about significant changes to the Medicaid drug rebate program and other federal pharmaceutical pricing and rebate programs. Given these and other recent federal and state government initiatives directed at lowering the total cost of health care, federal and state lawmakers will likely continue to focus on health care reform, the cost of prescription pharmaceuticals and on the reform of the Medicare and Medicaid programs. These efforts could adversely affect our business by, among other possibilities, limiting the prices that can be charged for drugs we develop or the amount of reimbursement available for these products from governmental agencies or third-party payers, limiting the profits that pharmaceutical companies may earn on certain sales, increasing the tax obligations on pharmaceutical companies, increasing our rebate liability, or limiting our commercial opportunity. We cannot predict the impact on our business of any legislation or regulations that may be adopted in the future. Any cost containment measures and other healthcare system reforms that are adopted could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate profitably.\nPrice controls imposed in foreign markets may adversely affect our future profitability.\nIn some countries, particularly member states of the EU, the pricing of prescription drugs is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after receipt of marketing approval for a product. In addition, there can be considerable pressure by governments and other stakeholders on prices and reimbursement levels, including as part of cost containment measures. Drug pricing may be made against a reference price set by the healthcare providers as a measure for healthcare cost containment. Political, economic and regulatory developments may further complicate pricing negotiations, and pricing negotiations may continue after reimbursement has been obtained. In some countries, we or our collaborative partners may be required to conduct a clinical trial or other studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of our therapeutic candidates to other available therapies in order to obtain or maintain reimbursement or pricing approval. If reimbursement of any product candidate approved for marketing is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, any one of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEven though we have obtained approval to market IMBRUVICA for MCL in the U.S., we are subject to ongoing regulatory obligations and review, including post-approval requirements that could result in the removal of the MCL indication from the approval of IMBRUVICA.\nIMBRUVICA was approved for treating patients with MCL, who have received at least one prior therapy, under the FDA\u2019s priority review program which provides for an expedited review for drugs that may offer significant improvement in treatment or provide treatment where no satisfactory alternative therapy exists. Even though we have obtained approval to market\nIMBRUVICA for treating patients with MCL in the U.S., we are subject to extensive ongoing obligations and continued regulatory review from the FDA and other applicable regulatory agencies, such as continued adverse event reporting requirements, the requirement to have our promotional materials relating to MCL pre-cleared by the FDA, and the requirement to conduct and complete a Phase III clinical study that confirms the safety and efficacy of IMBRUVICA in patients with MCL who have received at least one prior therapy. Although we are conducting two Phase III clinical studies designed to confirm the safety and efficacy of IMBRUVICA in patients with MCL who have received at least one prior therapy, we cannot guarantee that we will successfully complete either or both of these studies or that the results of either or both of these studies will be adequate to fulfill the post-approval requirement. Failure to fulfill the post-approval requirement for a confirmatory Phase III clinical study could result in the removal of the MCL indication from the approval of IMBRUVICA in the U.S. There may also be additional FDA post-marketing obligations, all of which may result in significant expense and limit our ability to commercialize IMBRUVICA in the U.S. or potentially other jurisdictions.\nFailure to comply with applicable FDA or other foreign and domestic regulatory requirements and guidelines may subject us to administrative or judicially imposed sanctions. If we fail to comply with foreign or domestic regulatory requirements or guidelines, we may face sanctions, including:\n\u2022\nissuance of Form FDA 483 or Warning Letters by the FDA or notices of noncompliance from other regulatory agencies;\n\u2022\nimposition of fines and other civil penalties;\n\u2022\ncriminal prosecutions;\n\u2022\ninjunctions, suspensions or revocations of regulatory approvals;\n\u2022\nsuspension of any ongoing clinical trials;\n\u2022\ntotal or partial suspension of manufacturing;\n\u2022\nrefusal by the FDA to approve pending applications or supplements to approved applications filed by us;\n\u2022\nrefusals to permit drugs to be imported into or exported from the U.S.;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements; and\n\u2022\nproduct recalls or seizures.\nThe policies of the FDA and other regulatory agencies may change and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent or delay regulatory approval of IMBRUVICA in other indications or further restrict or regulate post-approval activities. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse government regulation that may arise from future legislation or administrative action, either in the U.S. or abroad. If we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we or Janssen might not be permitted to market IMBRUVICA and our business would suffer.\nOur failure to continue to manage and maintain a distribution network could compromise the distribution of IMBRUVICA.\nWe have contracted with a third-party logistics company to warehouse IMBRUVICA and distribute it to wholesalers, distributors, pharmacies, hospitals, and other drug suppliers that ultimately distribute IMBRUVICA directly to patients. Our third-party logistics company will also provide billing, collection and returns services. This distribution network requires significant coordination with our market access, finance, quality and manufacturing teams.\nFailure to maintain our contracts with our third-party logistics company, wholesalers, distributors, pharmacies, hospitals or other drug suppliers, or the inability or failure of any of them to adequately perform under the contracts, could negatively impact the distribution of IMBRUVICA. Failure to coordinate financial systems could also negatively impact our ability to accurately report and forecast product revenue. If we are unable to effectively establish and manage the distribution process, sales of IMBRUVICA could be severely compromised and our business, financial condition and results of operations would be harmed.\nWe may need substantial additional financing and we may have difficulty raising needed capital in the future.\nWe have expended and will continue to expend substantial funds for the commercialization, manufacturing, marketing and sales of IMBRUVICA and to complete the research, development and clinical testing of investigational uses of IMBRUVICA and additional products. We may be unable to entirely fund these efforts with our current financial resources. We may also raise from time to time additional funds through the public or private sale of securities, bank debt, collaborations or otherwise. If we are unable to secure additional funds, whether through additional partnership collaborations, bank debt financings, or sale of our securities, we may have to delay, reduce the scope of or discontinue one or more of our product development programs. Based upon the current status of our product development plans, we believe that our cash, cash equivalents and marketable\nsecurities will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for at least the next 12 months. We may, however, choose to raise additional funds before then. Our actual capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe level of sales of IMBRUVICA;\n\u2022\nthe timing of marketing authorization of any of our additional products granted by the FDA, EC or other regulatory authority;\n\u2022\nthe timing of market launch of any of our additional products after grant of marketing authorization by the FDA, EC or other regulatory agency;\n\u2022\nthe speed of market uptake and the timing and extent of demand for any of our additional products after grant of marketing authorization by the FDA, EC or other regulatory agency;\n\u2022\ncontinued progress of our research and development programs;\n\u2022\nprogress with preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nour ability to establish and maintain collaborative arrangements with third parties;\n\u2022\nthe costs involved in preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining and enforcing patent claims;\n\u2022\nthe amount and timing of capital equipment purchases; and\n\u2022\ncompeting technological and market developments.\nWe also expect to raise any necessary additional funds through the public or private sale of securities, bank debt financings, collaborative arrangements with corporate partners or other sources that may be highly dilutive, or otherwise disadvantageous, to existing stockholders or subject us to restrictive covenants. In addition, in the event that additional funds are obtained through arrangements with collaborative partners or other sources, such arrangements may require us to relinquish rights to some of our technologies, product candidates or products under development that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves. Additional funds may not be available on acceptable terms, if at all. Our failure to raise capital when needed and on acceptable terms may require us to reduce our costs and expenses, delay or reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs and would limit our ability to respond to competitive pressures or unanticipated requirements and to continue operations. Any one of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to successfully develop and test our drug candidates, we may not be successful.\nThe success of our business depends primarily upon our ability, and the ability of our collaborators, if any, to develop and commercialize our drug candidates, including IMBRUVICA for indications other than those approved by the FDA, and outside of the U.S., successfully. The time frame necessary to achieve these goals for any individual product or indication is long and uncertain. We cannot be certain that we will be permitted to begin or continue our planned clinical trials for our potential products.\nThe completion rate of our clinical trials depends upon, among other factors, the rate of patient enrollment, the adequacy of patient follow-up and the completion of required clinical evaluations. Many factors affect patient enrollment, including the size of the patient population, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for the trial, competing clinical trials and new drugs or procedures used for the indications we are investigating. Other companies are conducting clinical trials and have announced plans for future trials that are seeking or are likely to seek patients with the same diseases that we are studying. We may experience delays in reaching planned levels of patient enrollment in our clinical trials. Delays in planned patient enrollment may result in increased costs, and delays or termination of clinical trials, which could have a material adverse effect on us. Many factors can affect the adequacy of patient follow-up and completion of required clinical evaluations, including failure of patients to return for scheduled visits or failure of clinical sites to complete necessary documentation. Delays in or failure to obtain required clinical follow-up and completion of clinical evaluations could also have a material adverse effect on the timing and outcome of our clinical trials and product approvals.\nAdditionally, clinical trials require substantial administration and monitoring. We may fail to effectively oversee and monitor the various trials we have underway at any particular time, which would result in increased costs or delays of our clinical trials or compromise our ability to obtain product approvals.\nOur drug candidates are in various stages of development and must satisfy rigorous standards of safety and efficacy before they can be approved by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities for sale. To satisfy these standards, we and/or our collaborators must allocate resources among our various development programs and must engage in expensive and lengthy testing of our drug candidates. Despite our efforts, our drug candidates may:\n\u2022\ncause, or may appear to cause serious adverse events or potentially dangerous drug interactions;\n\u2022\nhave dose limiting toxicities;\n\u2022\nnot show signs of efficacy in any disease as a single agent or in combination, or may only work in combination with other drugs;\n\u2022\ncause resistance in patients that may diminish the clinical benefit;\n\u2022\nnot offer therapeutic or other improvement over existing competitive drugs; or\n\u2022\nnot be proven adequately safe and effective in clinical trials.\nThe failure to adequately demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of a product under development could limit or prevent regulatory approval of the potential product and would materially harm our business. Our clinical trials may not demonstrate the sufficient levels of safety and efficacy necessary to obtain the requisite regulatory approval or may not result in marketable products.\nThe strength of our pipeline of drug candidates and potential drug candidates will depend in part upon the outcomes of our ongoing and planned Phase I, Phase II and Phase III clinical trials. Findings, including toxicity, tolerability, efficacy and/or safety findings, in nonclinical studies conducted concurrently with clinical trials as well as results of our clinical trials could lead to certain changes in our development activities, including the possible cessation of development activities associated with a particular drug candidate or program, including development of our next-generation BTK inhibitor drug candidate for rheumatoid arthritis and/or other autoimmune indications, which may be discontinued at any time due to unacceptable toxicity, tolerability, efficacy and/or safety issues discovered in our ongoing Phase I clinical trial and/or nonclinical studies of this drug candidate, and including development of IMBRUVICA for indications other than those approved by the FDA and outside of the U.S. Furthermore, results from our clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the FDA or other regulatory authorities for approval of a drug candidate.\nData already obtained from preclinical studies and clinical trials of our products under development do not necessarily predict the results that will be obtained from later preclinical studies and clinical trials. As such, positive results in preclinical studies and early clinical trials may not be replicated in later clinical trials. Further, data from clinical trials we are conducting are susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. We and many other companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in late-stage clinical trials even after achieving promising results in earlier-stage clinical trials. In addition, from time to time we report interim data from our clinical trials, including our BTK program and its effects on various types of cancers. Interim data are subject to change, and there can be no assurances that interim data will be confirmed upon the analysis of final data.\nSerious adverse events may force us to limit or discontinue any of our drug development and commercialization programs.\nOur ability to develop and commercialize any of our drug candidates or products may be adversely impacted by any serious adverse events that may arise. If significant safety issues arise when patients are treated with our marketed product or product candidates, our future sales may be reduced, which would adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe data supporting the marketing approvals for our products and forming the basis for the safety warnings in our IMBRUVICA product label were obtained from a limited number of patients in a limited number of clinical studies. As our product is used over longer periods of time and by many patients outside of the more exclusive and controlled environment of a clinical study, including patients with underlying health problems, taking numerous medications, we expect to continue to find new safety signals and gather new information, which may require us to provide additional warnings to our label, which could reduce the market acceptance of our product. Further, if serious safety, resistance or drug interaction issues arise with our product, sales could be limited or halted by us or by regulatory authorities and our results of operations would be adversely affected. For further details of safety and efficacy information, please refer to the full U.S. Prescribing Information (USPI).\nWe may fail to adequately protect or enforce our intellectual property rights or secure rights to third-party patents.\nOur success depends in part upon our ability to protect and defend our proprietary technology and product candidates through patents and trade secret protection. We, therefore, aggressively pursue, prosecute, protect and defend patent applications, issued patents, trade secrets, and licensed patent and trade secret rights covering certain aspects of our technology. The evaluation of the patentability of U.S. and foreign patent applications can take years to complete and can involve considerable expense and uncertainty.\nWe have a number of patents and patent applications related to our compounds but we cannot be certain that issued patents will be enforceable or provide adequate protection or that pending patent applications will issue as patents. Even if patents are issued and maintained, these patents may not be of adequate scope to benefit us, or may be held invalid and unenforceable against third parties. In addition, if we breach our agreements with our licensors and do not cure such breaches, we may lose\nrights under patents and other intellectual property licensed to us. Moreover, if our agreement with Celera is terminated by Celera under certain circumstances, our rights in our intellectual property acquired from Celera, including that related to IMBRUVICA, would revert to Celera and we would lose our right to commercialize such intellectual property.\nWe face risks and uncertainties related to our intellectual property rights. For example:\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to obtain or maintain patent or other intellectual property protection for any products or processes that we may develop;\n\u2022\nthird parties may obtain patents covering the manufacture, use or sale of these products, which may prevent us from commercializing IMBRUVICA or any of our products under development globally or in certain regions; and\n\u2022\nany future patents that we may obtain may not prevent other companies from competing with us if such companies can design their products or conduct their activities so as to avoid the coverage of our patents.\nThe actual protection afforded by a patent varies depending on the product candidate and country and depends upon many factors, including the type of patent, the scope of its coverage, the availability of regulatory related extensions, the availability of legal remedies in a particular country and the validity and enforceability of the patents under existing and future laws. Our ability to maintain or enhance our proprietary position for our product candidates will depend on our success in obtaining effective patent claims and enforcing those patent claims once granted. Our issued patents and those that may issue in the future, or those licensed to us, may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, and the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with proprietary protection or competitive advantages against competitors with similar products. Due to the extensive amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of a potential product, it is possible that, before any of our products can be commercialized, any related patent may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization, thereby reducing any advantage of the patent.\nWe also rely upon trade secrets, technical know-how and continuing technological innovation to develop and maintain our competitive position. Although we take steps to protect our proprietary rights and information, including the use of confidentiality and other agreements with our employees and consultants, and in our academic and commercial relationships, these steps may be inadequate, these agreements may be violated, or there may be no adequate remedy available for a violation. In addition, courts outside the U.S. are sometimes less willing to protect trade secrets. Furthermore, our trade secrets may become known to our competitors even in the absence of any violation of our rights. Our competitors may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques, reverse engineer our information and techniques, or otherwise gain access to our proprietary technology. We may be unable to meaningfully protect our rights in unpatented proprietary technology.\nOur success depends in large part on our ability to operate without infringing upon the patents or other proprietary rights of third parties.\nIf we infringe the patents of others, we may be prevented from commercializing future products or may be required to obtain licenses from these third parties. We may not be able to obtain alternative technologies or any required license on reasonable terms or at all. If we fail to obtain these licenses or alternative technologies, we may be unable to develop or commercialize some or all of our products. We own patents that claim the active pharmaceutical ingredient of IMBRUVICA as a chemical entity. However, the existence of issued patents does not guarantee our right to practice the patented technology or commercialize the patented product. Third parties may have or obtain rights to patents which they may use to prevent or attempt to prevent us from commercializing IMBRUVICA or any of our patented product candidates. If these other parties are successful in obtaining valid and enforceable patents, and establishing our infringement of those patents, we could be prevented from selling IMBRUVICA or any of our other products unless we were able to obtain a license under such patents. If any license is needed it may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nMany of our employees were previously employed at universities or other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although no claims against us are currently pending, we may be subject to claims that these employees or we have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these or other claims. If we fail in defending such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may face injunctions that restrict or preclude our access to important markets, intellectual property, or personnel. Any restriction or loss of access to markets, intellectual property, research personnel or work product that are key to our operations could hamper or negate our ability to commercialize IMBRUVICA or certain potential drugs, which could severely harm our business. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nWe are dependent on our collaboration agreement with Janssen to further develop and commercialize IMBRUVICA outside of the U.S. The failure to maintain this agreement or the failure of Janssen to perform its obligations under this agreement, could negatively impact our business.\nPursuant to the terms of our collaboration and licensing agreement with Janssen, we granted Janssen a license to co-develop (with us) IMBRUVICA, our BTK Inhibitor, globally, to co-commercialize it (with us) in the U.S., and to exclusively commercialize it outside of the U.S., in each case for all non-immunology related indications. Integral to the success of our collaboration with Janssen is our ability to timely achieve certain milestones and obtain regulatory approvals. Under a global development plan, each party will be responsible for conducting certain clinical trials. The collaboration and license agreement includes a cost sharing arrangement for associated development activities. Except in certain cases, in general Janssen is responsible for approximately 60% of development costs and we are responsible for the remaining 40% of development costs. The agreement also provides that pre-tax commercial profits or pre-tax commercial losses from the commercialization of any products resulting from the collaboration are shared 50% by us and 50% by Janssen.\nThe collaboration with Janssen provides us with an annual cap of our share of collaboration costs and pre-tax commercial losses for each calendar year until the third profitable calendar quarter for the collaboration, as determined in the agreement. In the event that our share of aggregate development costs in any given calendar year, together with any other amounts that become due from us, plus our share of pre-tax commercial losses for any calendar quarter in such calendar year, less our share of pre-tax commercial profits for any calendar quarter in such calendar year, exceeds $50.0 million, then amounts that are in excess of $50.0 million (Excess Amounts) are funded by Janssen. Under the Agreement, total Excess Amounts plus interest may not exceed $225.0 million. Janssen may recoup the Excess Amounts, together with interest, from our share of pre-tax commercial profits after the third profitable calendar quarter for the collaboration until the Excess Amounts and applicable interest has been fully paid. As of December 31, 2014, total Excess Amounts were $138.3 million, which was comprised of the cumulative amount funded by Janssen to-date of $134.3 million and interest of $4.0 million. As of December 31, 2014, we have achieved two profitable quarters for the collaboration and expect the three months ending March 31, 2015 to represent the third profitable quarter for the collaboration. Accordingly, we will begin to pay Excess Amounts to Janssen from our quarterly share of pre-tax commercial profits beginning in the fourth profitable quarter for the collaboration and until Excess Amounts have been fully paid (see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information about the Agreement).\nWe have limited control over the development or commercialization costs incurred by Janssen through yearly budget approvals, and limited control over the execution of development and commercial activities performed by them. Our costs and revenue are therefore tied to efforts made by ourselves and Janssen in developing and marketing our product. We have limited control over the amount of time and effort Janssen will devote to the development, manufacturing and commercialization of IMBRUVICA, and very limited control over the manner in which Janssen conducts its business with regard to obtaining additional regulatory and other approvals and commercializing the product, especially outside the U.S. Accordingly, our revenue and financial position may be adversely affected if Janssen does not dedicate sufficient time to the development and commercialization of IMBRUVICA, fails to obtain additional regulatory approvals, or otherwise fails to comply with its obligations under the agreement.\nWe are subject to a number of other risks associated with our dependence on our collaboration and license agreement with Janssen, including:\n\u2022\nWe and Janssen could disagree as to future development plans and Janssen may delay future clinical trials or stop a future clinical trial;\n\u2022\nThere may be disputes between us and Janssen, including disagreements regarding the collaboration and license agreement, that may result in (1) the delay in or loss of additional milestone or profit share payments due to any failure to achieve regulatory and commercial objectives, (2) the delay or termination of any future development or commercialization of IMBRUVICA, and/or (3) costly litigation or arbitration that diverts our management's attention and resources;\n\u2022\nJanssen may not provide us with timely and accurate information regarding supply forecasts, which could adversely impact our ability to comply with our supply obligations to Janssen and manage our own inventory of IMBRUVICA, as well as our ability to generate accurate financial forecasts;\n\u2022\nBusiness combinations or significant changes in Janssen's business strategy may adversely affect Janssen's ability or willingness to perform its obligations under our collaboration agreement;\n\u2022\nIf Janssen is unsuccessful in performing clinical trials, or in obtaining additional regulatory approvals for or commercializing IMBRUVICA outside the U.S., we may not receive certain corresponding milestone payments or profit payments related to international sales under the collaboration and license agreement and our business prospects and financial results may be materially harmed;\n\u2022\nOur co-promotion and licensing arrangement with our partner Janssen for the marketing of IMBRUVICA in the U.S. may fail to increase the commercial success of IMBRUVICA; and\n\u2022\nJanssen may not comply with applicable regulatory requirements or guidelines with respect to developing or commercializing IMBRUVICA outside the U.S., which could adversely impact future development or sales of IMBRUVICA outside of the U.S.\nThe collaboration and license agreement is subject to early termination, including through Janssen's right to terminate without cause upon advance notice to us. Termination of the collaboration and license agreement would hinder our efforts to effectively develop and commercialize IMBRUVICA. Such termination could result in a delay in getting our product to market. Such delay could likely result in higher costs for us and could adversely affect any progress we have made in clinical trials. If Janssen terminates its relationship with us, we may decide to enter into a new co-promotion or other licensing arrangement with another large pharmaceutical or biotechnology firm in order to commercialize IMBRUVICA and may not be successful. We may have difficulty finding another collaboration partner on favorable terms if Janssen terminates our agreement. We may be unable to pursue continued development and commercialization of IMBRUVICA or raise capital on our own.\nWe rely heavily on third parties for research, pre-clinical development and clinical development of our products.\nWe currently depend heavily and will continue to depend heavily in the future on third parties for support in research, pre-clinical development and clinical development of our products. The termination of a significant number of our existing collaborative arrangements, or our inability to establish and maintain collaborative arrangements could have a material adverse effect on our ability to complete clinical development of our products. Given our limited resources, it may be necessary to establish collaborations with other pharmaceutical companies that have greater financial and technical resources in order to successfully develop and commercialize our products. Although we entered into a global strategic alliance with Servier related to the research, development, and commercialization of abexinostat (formerly known as PCI-24781), we and Servier agreed to terminate the alliance effective November 23, 2014 (see Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements). There is no assurance that any additional collaborations can be entered into, and even if entered into, that any such collaborations will be successful and will not require us to relinquish product rights to the detriment of the financial success of these products.\nWe engage clinical investigators and medical institutions to enroll subjects in our clinical trials and contract clinical research organizations, or CROs, for various aspects of our clinical development activities including clinical trial monitoring, data collection, safety monitoring and data management. As a result, we have had and continue to have less control over the conduct of clinical trials, the timing and completion of the trials, the required reporting of adverse events and the management of data developed through the trial than would be the case if we were relying entirely upon our own staff. Although we rely on CROs to conduct some of our clinical trials, we are responsible for confirming that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the investigational plan and protocol. Moreover, the FDA, the Office of the Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services (OIG) and foreign regulatory agencies require us to comply with regulations and standards, commonly referred to as good clinical practices, for conducting, recording and reporting the results of clinical trials to assure that the data and results are credible and accurate and that the trial participants are adequately protected. Our reliance on third parties does not relieve us of these responsibilities and requirements. We could be held accountable, from a regulatory or compliance standpoint, for any erroneous acts or omissions of these third parties, as they are acting on behalf of Pharmacyclics and as our agents.\nOutside parties may have staffing difficulties, may undergo changes in priorities, may become financially distressed, or may cease their operations, adversely affecting their willingness or ability to conduct our trials. We may experience unexpected cost increases that are beyond our control. Any failure of such CROs to successfully accomplish clinical trial monitoring, data collection, safety monitoring and data management and the other services they provide for us in a timely manner and in compliance with regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on our ability to complete clinical development of our products and obtain regulatory approval. Problems with the timeliness or quality of the work of a CRO or the cessation of a CRO's business may lead us to seek to terminate the relationship and use an alternate service provider. However, making such changes may be costly and may delay our trials, and contractual restrictions or other business obstacles may make such a change difficult or impossible. Additionally, it may be difficult to find a replacement organization that can conduct our trials in an acceptable manner and at an acceptable cost.\nWe rely upon contract manufacturers to manufacture pharmaceuticals for clinical development and for commercial sale.\nWe currently rely on third parties to perform activities related to the manufacture and storage of pharmaceuticals for our clinical trials and commercial sales. Our manufacturing strategy presents the following risks:\n\u2022\nwe currently rely on a single manufacturer and supply chain for IMBRUVICA and expect to continue to do so for the foreseeable future.\n\u2022\ndelays in scale-up to quantities needed for multiple clinical trials, or failure to manufacture such quantities to our specifications, or deliver such quantities on the dates we require, could cause delay or suspension of clinical trials, regulatory submissions and commercialization of our products;\n\u2022\nthere is no guarantee that the supply of clinical materials can be maintained during the clinical development of our product candidates;\n\u2022\nour current and future manufacturers are subject to ongoing periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and corresponding foreign regulatory agencies for compliance with strictly enforced GMP and similar standards in other countries. Failure to achieve an acceptable inspection outcome could have a material adverse effect on our ability to produce our products to support our operations;\n\u2022\nour reliance on third parties for manufacturing and storage does not relieve us of responsibilities and requirements of the FDA, OIG, and corresponding foreign regulatory agencies. We could be held accountable from a regulatory or compliance standpoint, for any erroneous acts or omissions of these third parties, as they are acting on behalf of Pharmacyclics and as our agents;\n\u2022\nwe may be unsuccessful in maintaining our current supply agreements and if we are required to seek new supply agreements, there is no guarantee that we will be able to obtain such agreements on favorable terms or at all. These contractors must achieve an acceptable inspection outcome by the FDA and comparable foreign regulators prior to our use;\n\u2022\nour current manufacturer might not be able to fulfill our commercial needs, which would require us to seek new manufacturing arrangements and may result in substantial delays in meeting market demand;\n\u2022\nany disruption of the ability of our manufacturing contractors to supply necessary quantities of our products could have a material adverse effect on our ability to support our operations; and\n\u2022\nour current manufacturer may have insufficient capacity to support our requirements in the event of an increase in market demand.\nAny of these factors could delay clinical trials or commercialization of our products under development and entail higher costs.\nOur manufacturing process may require the use of highly flammable solvents and agents, and may result in hazardous situations in our contract manufacturing facilities.\nThe manufacturing processes for IMBRUVICA involve the use of hazardous, volatile and flammable materials capable of igniting and/or exploding if not handled properly. Although our manufacturing processes incorporate carefully designed safety procedures to prevent the creation of conditions under which the materials could ignite and/or explode, we cannot be certain that such safety procedures will be followed or if followed will be adequate to mitigate or eliminate the risk of harm caused by fire and/or explosion during the manufacturing of IMBRUVICA. Any such event may incapacitate the manufacturing capability of any of our contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs). We have no assurance that we will avoid liability for harm caused by any such event. If we are found liable for damages or agree to pay damages in settlement of a claim against us for any harm caused by any such event, our insurance coverage may be inadequate or may not cover part or all of such damages. In addition, we do not have an alternate or back-up supply chain for the manufacturing and supply of IMBRUVICA. If such an event causes us to lose the operational capacity of any manufacturing element in the supply chain for IMBRUVICA, our ability to manufacture and supply the product will be substantially impaired or prevented, and we may be unable to supply enough product to support our development and/or commercialization programs, which may force us to curtail or discontinue our business operations.\nWe may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.\nOur income tax obligations are based on our corporate operating structure, including the manner in which we develop, value, and use our intellectual property and the scope of our international operations. The tax laws applicable to our international business activities, including the laws of the U.S. and other jurisdictions, are subject to interpretation. The taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for valuing developed technology or intercompany arrangements and our positions that defer or avoid the recognition of revenue from and taxation of intercompany technology transfer transactions, which could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations. In addition, our future income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, or by changes in tax laws, regulations, or accounting principles. We are subject to regular review and audit by both U.S. federal and state and foreign tax authorities. Any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative effect on our financial position and results of operations. In addition, the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment by\nmanagement, and there are many transactions where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made.\nThe enactment of legislation implementing changes in the U.S. taxation of international business activities or the adoption of other U.S. or foreign tax reform policies could materially affect our financial position, cash flows and results of operations.\nThe current administration has made public statements indicating that it has made international tax reform a priority, and key members of the U.S. Congress have conducted hearings and proposed a wide variety of potential changes. Certain changes to U.S. tax laws, including limitations on the ability to defer U.S. taxation on earnings outside of the U.S. until those earnings are repatriated to the U.S., could affect the tax treatment of our foreign earnings, as well as cash and cash equivalent balances we currently maintain outside of the U.S.\nFurthermore, changes to foreign rules may also materially affect us. Due to the expanding scale of our international business activities, any changes in the U.S. or foreign taxation of such activities may increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has published an action plan to address base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) impacting its member countries and other jurisdictions. It is possible that jurisdictions in which we do business could react to the BEPS initiative or their own concerns by enacting tax legislation that could adversely affect us or our shareholders.\nA number of multilateral organizations, including the EU and the OECD have, in recent years, expressed concern about some countries not participating in adequate tax information exchange arrangements and have threatened those that do not agree to cooperate with punitive sanctions by member countries. It is as yet unclear what all of these sanctions might be, which countries might adopt them, and when or if they might be imposed. We cannot assure, however, that the Tax Information Exchange Agreements (TIEAs) that have been or will be entered into by Switzerland and Cayman will be sufficient to preclude all of the sanctions described above, which, if ultimately adopted, could adversely affect us or our shareholders.\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, and an adverse change in foreign currency exchange rates could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nAll of our revenues and the majority of our expenses are denominated in U.S. dollars and as a result, we have not experienced significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses to date. We conduct some transactions in foreign currencies, primarily related to ex-U.S. clinical trial and manufacturing activities, and we expect to continue to do so. We have not entered into any agreements or transactions for currency exchange to hedge the risk associated with potential fluctuations in currencies; accordingly, we are subject to foreign currency exchange risk related to these ex-U.S. clinical trial and manufacturing activities. While we may enter into hedge or other agreements in the future to actively manage this risk, we do not believe this risk is material to our financial statements.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nIf our results do not meet the financial guidance we provide to investors in any period, analysts' forecasts or the expectations of our investors, our stock price could decline.\nAnalysts who cover our business and operations provide valuations regarding our stock price and make recommendations whether to buy, hold or sell our stock. Our stock price may be dependent upon such valuations and recommendations. Analysts' valuations and recommendations are based primarily on our reported results and our and their forecasts and expectations concerning our future results regarding, for example, expenses, revenues, clinical trials, regulatory marketing approvals and competition. Our future results are subject to substantial uncertainty, and we may fail to meet or exceed the financial guidance we provide to investors in any period or analysts' forecasts or investors' expectations as a result of a number of factors, including those discussed under the section entitled \u201cRisks Related to Pharmacyclics\u201d above. If our results do not meet the financial guidance that we provide to investors in any period or analysts' forecasts or investors' expectations, our stock price could decline as a result of analysts lowering their valuations and recommendations or otherwise.\nFuture equity issuances or a sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nBecause we may need to raise additional capital in the future to continue to expand our business and our research and development activities, among other things, we may conduct additional equity offerings. If we or our stockholders sell substantial amounts of our common stock (including shares issued upon the exercise of options and warrants) in the public\nmarket, the market price of our common stock could fall. A decline in the market price of our common stock could make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and Delaware law could prevent or delay a change in control.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws include provisions that may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable. In addition, provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law also restrict certain business combinations with interested stockholders. These provisions are intended to encourage potential acquirers to negotiate with us and allow our board of directors the opportunity to consider alternative proposals in the interest of maximizing stockholder value. However, these provisions may also discourage acquisition proposals or delay or prevent a change in control, which could harm our stock price.\nThe price of our common stock is volatile.\nThe market prices for securities of biotechnology companies, including ours, have historically been highly volatile. Our stock, like that of many other companies, has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations sometimes unrelated to operating performance. For example, during the three year period beginning January 1, 2012 and ending December 31, 2014, the sales price for one share of our common stock reached a high closing price of $151.61 per share and a low closing price of $14.99 per share. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly due to a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe commercial success of IMBRUVICA and the revenues we generate;\n\u2022\nthe progress and results of our preclinical testing, clinical trials, product development and partnering activities;\n\u2022\nquarterly fluctuations in our financial results;\n\u2022\nour actual results of operations may deviate materially from projected results;\n\u2022\nthe development of technological innovations or new therapeutic products by us, our competitors or others;\n\u2022\nchanges in governmental regulation;\n\u2022\nthe success or failure of our efforts to obtain marketing authorization for any of our products from the FDA or other regulatory authority;\n\u2022\nour ability to satisfy regulatory requirements for the maintenance of any marketing authorization granted by FDA or other regulatory authority for any of our products;\n\u2022\nthe emergence of drug safety issues that require us to add restrictions or warnings to the label or withdraw from the market any of our products after approval by the FDA or other regulatory authority;\n\u2022\ndevelopments in patent or other proprietary rights by us, our competitors or others;\n\u2022\ndevelopments and/or announcements by us, our competitors or others;\n\u2022\nlitigation;\n\u2022\npublic concern as to the safety of products developed by us, our competitors or others;\n\u2022\ndeparture of key personnel;\n\u2022\nability to manufacture our products to commercial standards;\n\u2022\nchanges in the structure of healthcare payment systems and the coverage and reimbursement policies of governmental and other third-party payers;\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully commercialize our products if they are approved;\n\u2022\ncomments by securities analysts; and\n\u2022\ngeneral market conditions in our industry.\nIn addition, if any of the risks described in this section entitled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d actually occur, there could be a dramatic and material adverse impact on the market price of our common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nOur business exposes us to product liability claims.\nThe testing, manufacture, marketing and sale of our products involve an inherent risk that product liability claims will be asserted against us. We face the risk that the use of our products when sold to patients and when used in human clinical trials will result in adverse effects. IMBRUVICA is currently marketed, and if we complete clinical testing for our additional products and receive regulatory approval to market such additional products, we will market our additional products, with\nwarnings that identify the known potential adverse effects and the patients who should not receive our product. We cannot ensure that physicians and patients will comply with these warnings. In addition, unexpected adverse effects may occur even with use of our products that have received approval for commercial sale. Although we are insured against such risks in connection with clinical trials and commercial activities, our present product liability insurance may be inadequate. A successful product liability claim in excess of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Any successful product liability claim may prevent us from obtaining adequate product liability insurance in the future on commercially desirable or reasonable terms. In addition, product liability coverage may cease to be available in sufficient amounts or at an acceptable cost. An inability to obtain sufficient insurance coverage at an acceptable cost or otherwise to protect against potential product liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercialization of our pharmaceutical products. A product liability claim or recall would have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 82513, "SIC": 2835, "TIC": "PCYC"}
