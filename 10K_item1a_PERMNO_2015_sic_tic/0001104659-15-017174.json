{"cik": "45919", "company": "HARTE HANKS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-05", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\nThis report, including the Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A), contains \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d within the meaning of the federal securities laws. All such statements are qualified by this cautionary note, which is provided pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 (1933 Act) and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (1934 Act). Forward-looking statements may also be included in our other public filings, press releases, our website and oral and written presentations by management. Statements other than historical facts are forward-looking and may be identified by words such as \u201cmay,\u201d \u201cwill,\u201d \u201cexpects,\u201d \u201cbelieves,\u201d \u201canticipates,\u201d \u201cplans,\u201d \u201cestimates,\u201d \u201cseeks,\u201d \u201ccould,\u201d \u201cintends,\u201d or words of similar meaning. Examples include statements regarding (1) our strategies and initiatives, (2) adjustments to our cost structure and other actions designed to respond to market conditions and improve our performance, and the anticipated effectiveness and expenses associated with these actions, (3) our financial outlook for revenues, earnings per share, operating income, expense related to equity-based compensation, capital resources and other financial items, (4) expectations for our businesses and for the industries in which we operate, including the impact of economic conditions of the markets we serve on the marketing expenditures and activities of our clients and prospects, (5) competitive factors, (6) acquisition and development plans, (7) our stock repurchase program, (8) expectations regarding legal proceedings and other contingent liabilities, and (9) other statements regarding future events, conditions or outcomes.\nThese forward-looking statements are based on current information, expectations and estimates and involve risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors that are difficult to predict and that could cause actual results to vary materially from what is expressed in or indicated by the forward-looking statements. In that event, our business, financial condition, results of operations or liquidity could be materially adversely affected, and investors in our securities could lose part or all of their investments. Some of these risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other factors can be found in our filings with the SEC, including the factors discussed below in this Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors\u201d, and any updates thereto in our Forms 10-Q. The forward-looking statements included in this report and those included in our other public filings, press releases, our website and oral and written presentations by management are made only as of the respective dates thereof, and we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statement in this report or in other documents, our website or oral statements for any reason, even if new information becomes available or other events occur in the future.\nIn addition to the information set forth elsewhere in this report, including in the MD&A section, the factors described below should be considered carefully in making any investment decisions with respect to our securities. The risks described below are not the only ones we face or may face in the\nfuture. Additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently anticipated or that we may currently believe are immaterial could also impair our business operations and financial performance.\nWe have developed a new strategy, and the future success of our company will depend on its successful execution.\nIn 2014, we developed and announced our new strategy, and are now executing against it. Because this new strategy will chart the company\u2019s course of action and priorities for years to come, the future success of Harte Hanks will depend on its successful execution. Our strategy will bring additional risks to the business (such as those associated with greater use of capital, development and acquisition of new products, or entry into new industries or geographic markets) or magnify existing risks as our business priorities and objectives are adjusted. If our strategy is flawed, or if we fail to execute it well, our business and financial performance may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe face significant competition for individual projects, entire client relationships and advertising dollars in general.\nOur Customer Interaction business faces significant competition in all of its offerings and within each of its vertical markets. Direct marketing is a dynamic business, subject to rapid technological change, high turnover of client personnel who make buying decisions, client consolidations, changing client needs and preferences, continual development of competing products and services and an evolving competitive landscape. This competition comes from numerous local, national and international direct marketing and advertising companies, and client internal resources, against whom we compete for individual projects, entire client relationships and marketing expenditures by clients and prospective clients. We also compete against print and electronic media and other forms of advertising for marketing and advertising dollars in general. In addition, our ability to attract new clients and to retain existing clients may, in some cases, be limited by clients\u2019 policies on or perceptions of conflicts of interest. These policies can prevent us from performing similar services for competing products or companies. Some of our clients have also sought to reduce the number of marketing vendors or use third-party procurement organizations, all of which increases pricing pressure and may disadvantage us relative to our competitors. Our failure to improve our current processes or to develop new products and services could result in the loss of our clients to current or future competitors. In addition, failure to gain market acceptance of new products and services could adversely affect our growth.\nTrillium Software faces widely varied competitors, many of whom have greater development resources and market access. In addition, because Trillium Software offers specialized information quality solutions, competitors who offer a broad array of technology solutions - such as market makers and system integrators - have advantages for many potential clients, including a greater ability to bundle unrelated products to achieve a better price. Trillium Software also competes against niche providers of information quality software and services, so that despite our relative specialization on information quality solutions, some potential clients may nevertheless seek or prefer an even more-specific solution. If Trillium Software is unable to overcome these competitive disadvantages, it will adversely affect the company\u2019s growth and financial performance.\nCurrent and future competitors may have significantly greater financial and other resources than we do, and they may sell competing products and services at lower prices or at lower profit margins, resulting in pressures on our prices and margins.\nThe sizes of our competitors vary widely across market and service segments. Therefore, some of our competitors may have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing or other resources than we do in any one or more of our market segments, or overall. As a result, our competitors may be in a position to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies, methodologies and changes in customer requirements, or may devote greater resources than we can to the development, promotion, sale and support of products and services. Moreover, new competitors or alliances among our competitors may emerge and potentially reduce our market share, revenue or margins. Some of our competitors also may choose to sell products or services competitive to ours at lower prices by accepting lower margins and profitability, or may be able to sell products or services competitive to ours at lower prices given proprietary ownership of data, technical superiority, a broader or deeper product or experience set, or economies of scale. Price reductions or pricing pressure by our competitors could negatively impact our margins and results of operations, and could also harm our ability to obtain new customers on favorable terms. Competitive pricing pressures tend to increase in difficult economic environments, such as the current environments in the U.S. and other economies, due to reduced marketing expenditures of many of our clients and prospects and the resulting impact on the competitive business environment for marketing service providers such as our company.\nWe must maintain technological competitiveness, continually improve our processes and develop and introduce new products and services in a timely and cost-effective manner.\nWe believe that our success depends on, among other things, maintaining technological competitiveness in our products, processing functionality and software systems and services. Technology changes rapidly as makers of computer hardware, network systems, programming tools,\nprogramming languages, operating systems, database technology and mobile devices continually improve their offerings. Advances in information technology may result in changing client preferences for products and product delivery channels in our industry. The increasingly sophisticated requirements of our clients require us to continually improve our processes and provide new products and services in a timely and cost-effective manner (whether through development, license or acquisition). In particular, our Trillium Software business faces continuous pressure to update offerings to deliver the latest features and capabilities while maintaining accessibility on a wide variety of platforms. We may be unable to successfully identify, develop and bring new and enhanced services and products to market in a timely and cost-effective manner, such services and products may not be commercially successful, and services, products and technologies developed by others may render our services and products noncompetitive or obsolete.\nOur success depends on our ability to consistently and effectively deliver our products and services to our clients.\nOur success depends on our ability to effectively and consistently staff and execute client engagements within the agreed upon timeframe and budget. Depending on the needs of our clients, our engagements may require customization, integration and coordination of a number of complex product and service offerings and execution across many facilities in our network. Moreover, in some of our engagements, we rely on subcontractors and other third parties to provide some of the services to our clients, and we cannot guarantee that these third parties will effectively deliver their services or that we will have adequate recourse against these third parties in the event they fail to effectively deliver their services. Other contingencies and events outside of our control may also impact our ability to provide our products and services. Our failure to effectively and timely staff, coordinate and execute our client engagements may adversely impact existing client relationships, the amount or timing of payments from our clients, our reputation in the marketplace and ability to secure additional business and our resulting financial performance. In addition, our contractual arrangements with our clients and other customers may not provide us with sufficient protections against claims for lost profits or other claims for damages.\nIf our new leaders are unsuccessful, or if we lose key management and are unable to attract and retain the talent required for our business, our operating results could suffer.\nIn the past two years, we replaced many of our leaders, including our President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman, and significantly reorganized our operational structures. If our new leaders fail in their new roles and responsibilities (and more generally if we are unable to attract new leaders with the necessary skills to manage our business) our business and its operating results may suffer. Further, our prospects depend in large part upon our ability to attract, train and retain experienced technical, client services, sales, consulting, research and development, marketing, administrative and management personnel. While the demand for personnel is dependent on employment levels, competitive factors and general economic conditions, qualified personnel historically have been in great demand. The loss or prolonged absence of the services of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or operating results.\nWe have recently experienced, and may experience in the future, reduced demand for our products and services because of general economic conditions, the financial conditions and marketing budgets of our clients and other factors that may impact the industry verticals that we serve.\nEconomic downturns and turmoil severely affect the marketing services industry. Throughout the most recent recession, as in prior economic downturns, our customers responded to weak economic conditions by reducing their marketing and software budgets, which are generally discretionary in nature and easier to reduce in the short-term than other expenses. Many of our customers have been slow to restore their marketing and software budgets to prior levels during a recovery, and may respond similarly to adverse economic conditions in the future. Our revenues are dependent on national, regional and international economies and business conditions. A lasting economic recession or anemic recovery in the markets in which we operate (such as the recent recession and recovery) could have material adverse effects on our business, financial position or operating results. Similarly, industry or company-specific factors may negatively impact our clients and prospective clients or their industries, and in turn result in reduced demand for our products and services, client insolvencies, collection difficulties or bankruptcy preference actions related to payments received from our clients. We may also experience reduced demand as a result of consolidation of clients and prospective clients in the industry verticals that we serve. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in this Form 10-K for additional information about the adverse impact on our financial performance of the ongoing difficult economic environment in the U.S. and other economies.\nWe must effectively manage our costs to be successful. If we do not achieve our cost management objectives, our financial results could be adversely affected.\nOur business plan and expectations for the future require that we effectively manage our cost structure, including our operating expenses and capital expenditures across our operations. To the\nextent that we do not accurately anticipate and effectively manage our costs, our financial results may be adversely affected in any economic climate and even more so during a prolonged recession, such as the recent economic downturn in the U.S. and elsewhere.\nPrivacy, information security and other regulatory requirements may prevent or impair our ability to offer our products and services.\nWe are subject to and affected by numerous laws, regulations and industry standards that regulate direct marketing activities, including those that address privacy, data protection, information security and marketing communications. Please refer to the section above entitled \u201cGovernment Regulation\u201d for additional information regarding some of these regulations.\nAs a result of increasing public awareness and interest in privacy rights, data protection and access, information security, environmental protection and other concerns, national and local governments and industry organizations regularly consider and adopt new laws, rules, regulations and guidelines that restrict or regulate marketing communications, services and products. Examples include data encryption standards, data breach notification requirements, registration/licensing requirements (often with fees), consumer choice, notice and consent restrictions and penalties for infractions, among others. We anticipate that additional restrictions and regulations will continue to be proposed and adopted in the future.\nOur business may also be affected by the impact of these restrictions and regulations on our clients and their marketing activities. In addition, as we acquire new capabilities and deploy new technologies to execute our strategy, we may be exposed to additional types or layers of regulation. Current and future restrictions and regulations could increase compliance requirements and costs, and restrict or prevent the collection, management, aggregation, transfer, use or dissemination of information, or change the requirements therefore so as to require other changes to our business or that of our clients. Additional restrictions and regulations may limit or prohibit current practices regarding marketing communications and information quality solutions. For example, many states and countries have considered implementing do not contact legislation that could impact our business and the businesses of our clients and customers. In addition, continued public interest in privacy rights, data protection and access, and information security may result in the adoption of further industry guidelines that could impact our direct marketing activities and business practices.\nWe cannot predict the scope of any new laws, rules, regulation or industry guidelines or how courts or agencies may interpret current ones. Additionally, enforcement priorities by governmental authorities will change over time, which may impact our business. Understanding the laws, rules, regulations and guidelines applicable to specific client multichannel engagements and across many jurisdictions poses a significant challenge, as such laws, rules, regulations and guidelines are often inconsistent or conflicting, and are sometimes at odds with client objectives. Our failure to properly comply with these regulatory requirements and client needs may materially and adversely affect our business. General compliance with privacy, data protection and information security obligations is costly and time-consuming, and we may encounter difficulties, delays or significant expenses in connection with our compliance, or because of our clients\u2019 need to comply. We may be exposed to significant penalties, liabilities, reputational harm and loss of business in the event that we fail to comply. We could suffer a material adverse impact on our business due to the enactment or enforcement of legislation or industry regulations affecting us and/or our clients, the issuance of judicial or governmental interpretations, changed enforcement priorities of governmental agencies or a change in behavior arising from public concern over privacy, data protection and information security issues.\nWe could fail to adequately protect our intellectual property rights and may face claims for intellectual property infringement.\nOur ability to compete effectively depends in part on the protection of our technology, products, services and brands through intellectual property right protections, including patents, copyrights, database rights, trade secrets, trademarks and domain name registrations and enforcement procedures. The extent to which such rights can be protected and enforced varies by jurisdiction, and capabilities we procure through acquisitions may have less protection than would be desirable for the use or scale we intend or need. Litigation involving patents and other intellectual property rights has become far more common and expensive in recent years, and we face the risk of additional litigation relating to our use or future use of intellectual property rights of third parties. Third-party infringement claims and any related litigation against us could subject us to liability for damages, significantly increase our costs, restrict us from using and providing our technologies, products or services or operating our business generally, or require changes to be made to our technologies, products and services. Please refer to the section above entitled \u201cIntellectual Property Rights\u201d for additional information regarding our intellectual property and associated risks.\nConsumer perceptions regarding the privacy and security of their data may prevent or impair our ability to offer our products and services.\nVarious local, national and international regulations, as well as industry standards, give consumers varying degrees of control as to how certain data regarding them is collected, used and shared for marketing purposes. If, due to privacy, security or other concerns, consumers exercise their ability to prevent or limit such data collection, use or sharing, it may impair our ability to provide marketing to those consumers and limit our clients\u2019 demand for our services. Additionally, privacy and security concerns may limit consumers\u2019 willingness to voluntarily provide data to our customers or marketing companies. Some of our services depend on voluntarily provided data and therefore may be impaired without such data.\nOur reputation and business results may be adversely impacted if we, or subcontractors upon whom we rely, do not effectively protect sensitive personal information of our clients and our clients\u2019 customers.\nCurrent privacy and data security laws and industry standards impact the manner in which we capture, handle, analyze and disseminate customer and prospect data as part of our client engagements. In many instances, our client contracts also mandate privacy and security practices. If we fail to effectively protect and control sensitive personal information (such as personal health information, social security numbers or credit card numbers) of our clients and their customers or prospects in accordance with these requirements, we may incur significant expense, suffer reputational harm and loss of business, and, in certain cases, be subjected to regulatory or governmental sanctions or litigation. These risks may be increased due to our reliance on subcontractors and other third parties in providing a portion of our overall services in certain engagements. We cannot guarantee that these third parties will effectively protect and handle sensitive personal information or other confidential information, or that we will have adequate recourse against these third parties in that event.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our information systems.\nOur ability to protect our information systems against damage from a data loss, security breach, human error, malfeasance, computer virus, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or other disaster is critical to our future success. Some of these systems may be outsourced to third-party providers from time to time. Any damage to our information systems that causes interruptions in our operations or a loss of data could affect our ability to meet our clients\u2019 requirements, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or operating results. While we take precautions to protect our information systems, such measures may not be effective, and existing measures may become inadequate because of changes in future conditions. Although we maintain insurance which may respond to cover some types of damages incurred by breaches of (or problems with) our information systems, such insurance is limited and expensive, and may not respond or be sufficient to offset the costs of such damages, and therefore such damages may materially harm our business.\nBreaches of security, or the perception that ecommerce is not secure, could severely harm our business and reputation.\nBusiness-to-business and business-to-consumer electronic commerce requires the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks. Some of our products and services are accessed through or are otherwise dependent on the internet. Security breaches in connection with the delivery of our products and services, or well-publicized security breaches that may affect us or our industry (such as database intrusion) could be severely detrimental to our business, operating results and financial condition. We cannot be certain that advances in criminal capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments will not compromise or breach the technology protecting the information systems that deliver our products, services and proprietary database information.\nData suppliers could withdraw data that we rely on for our products and services.\nWe purchase or license much of the data we use for ourselves and for our clients. There could be a material adverse impact on our business if owners of the data we use were to withdraw or curtail access to the data or materially restrict the authorized uses of their data. Data providers could withdraw their data if there is a competitive reason to do so, if there is pressure from the consumer community or if additional regulations are adopted restricting the use of the data. We also rely upon data from other external sources to maintain our proprietary and non-proprietary databases, including data received from customers and various government and public record sources. If a substantial number of data providers or other key data sources were to withdraw or restrict their data, if we were to lose access to data due to government regulation, or if the collection of data becomes uneconomical, our ability to provide products and services to our clients could be materially and adversely affected, which could result in decreased revenues, net income and earnings per share.\nWe must successfully identify and evaluate acquisition targets and integrate acquisitions.\nAcquisitions are an essential component of our strategy to grow Harte Hanks, and we have announced plans to use significant capital on acquisitions. We frequently evaluate acquisition opportunities to expand our product and service offerings and geographic locations, including potential international acquisitions. Acquisition activities, even if not consummated, require substantial amounts of management time and can distract from normal operations. In addition, we have in the past and may in the future be unable to achieve the profitability goals, synergies and other objectives initially sought in acquisitions, and any acquired assets, data or businesses may not be successfully integrated into our operations. Acquisitions may result in the impairment of relationships with employees and customers. Moreover, although we review and analyze assets or companies we acquire, such reviews are subject to uncertainties and may not reveal all potential risks, and we may incur unanticipated liabilities and expenses as a result of our acquisition activities. The failure to identify appropriate candidates, to negotiate favorable terms, or to successfully integrate future acquisitions into existing operations could result in not achieving planned revenue growth and could negatively impact our net income and earnings per share.\nWe may be unable to make dispositions of assets on favorable terms.\nIn 2012 we sold the assets of our Florida Shoppers operations, The Flyer, resulting in an after-tax loss of $2.7 million. In 2013 we sold the assets of our California Shoppers operations, The Pennysaver, resulting in an after-tax loss of $12.4 million. We may in the future determine to divest certain assets or businesses consistent with our corporate strategy. However, the price we obtain for such assets or businesses will be driven by performance of those businesses and the current market demand for such assets, and we may not be able to realize a profit upon sale. If we are unable to dispose of businesses or assets in a timely manner or at profitable price, our business, net income and earnings per share could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe are vulnerable to increases in postal rates and disruptions in postal services.\nOur services depend on the USPS and other commercial delivery services to deliver products. Standard postage rates have increased in recent years (most recently in September 2014) and may continue to do so at frequent and unpredictable intervals. Postage rates influence the demand for our services even though the cost of mailings is typically borne by our clients and is not directly reflected in our revenues or expenses. Accordingly, future postal increases or disruptions in the operations of the USPS may have an adverse impact on us.\nIn addition, the USPS has had significant financial and operational challenges recently. In reaction, the USPS has proposed many changes in its services, such as delivery frequency and facility access. These changes, together with others that may be adopted, individually or in combination with other market factors, could materially and negatively affect our costs and ability to meet our clients\u2019 expectations.\nWe are vulnerable to increases in paper prices.\nPrices of print materials are subject to fluctuations. Increased paper costs could cause our customers to reduce spending on other marketing programs, or to shift to media which may be less profitable for us, in each case potentially materially affecting our revenues and profits.\nOur financial results could be negatively impacted by impairments of goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives.\nIn the third quarter of 2013 we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $2.8 million related to a non-cash trade name intangible asset as a result of continuing revenue declines, an overall strategic assessment of the related operations, and management\u2019s evaluation of the business. As of December 31, 2014, the net book value of our goodwill and other intangibles represented approximately $400.4 million out of our total assets of $647.2 million. We test goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives for impairment as of November 30 of each year and on an interim basis should factors or indicators become apparent that would require an interim test. A downward revision in the fair value of our reporting unit or any of the other intangible assets could result in additional impairments and non-cash charges. Any such impairment charges could have a significant negative effect on our reported net income.\nOur indebtedness may adversely impact our ability to react to changes in our business or changes in general economic conditions.\nThe amount of our indebtedness and the terms under which we have borrowed money under our credit facilities or other agreements could have important consequences for our business. Our debt covenants require that we maintain certain financial measures and ratios. As a result of these covenants and ratios, we may be limited in the manner in which we can conduct our business, and we may be unable to engage in favorable business activities or finance future operations or capital needs. A failure to comply with these restrictions or to maintain the financial measures and ratios contained in the debt agreements could lead to an event of default that could result in an acceleration of outstanding indebtedness. In addition, the amount and terms of our indebtedness could:\n\u00b7 limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industries in which we operate, including limiting our ability to invest in our strategic initiatives, and, consequently, place us at a competitive disadvantage;\n\u00b7 reduce the availability of our cash flows that would otherwise be available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes; and\n\u00b7 result in higher interest expense in the event of increases in interest rates, as discussed below under \u201cInterest rate increases could affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial position.\u201d\nWe may incur additional indebtedness in the future and, if new debt is added to our current debt levels, the above risks could be increased.\nInterest rate increases could affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial position.\nInterest rate movements in Europe and the U.S. can affect the amount of interest we pay related to our debt and the amount we earn on cash equivalents. Our primary interest rate exposure is to interest rate fluctuations in Europe, specifically Eurodollar rates, due to their impact on interest related to our credit facilities. On December 31, 2014, we had $82.7 million of debt outstanding, all of which bore variable interest rates. Our results of operations, cash flows and financial position could be materially adversely affected by significant increases in interest rates. We also have exposure to interest rate fluctuations in the U.S., specifically money market, commercial paper and overnight time deposit rates, as these affect our earnings on excess cash. Even with the offsetting increase in earnings on excess cash in the event of an interest rate increase, we cannot be assured that future interest rate increases will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial position or operating results.\nWe are subject to risks associated with operations outside the U.S.\nHarte Hanks conducts business outside of the U.S. During 2014, approximately 16.2% of our revenues were derived from operations outside the United States, primarily Europe and Asia. We may expand our international operations in the future as part of our growth strategy. Accordingly, our future operating results could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u00b7 social, economic and political instability;\n\u00b7 changes in local, national and international legal requirements or policies resulting in burdensome government controls, tariffs, restrictions, embargoes or export license requirements;\n\u00b7 higher rates of inflation;\n\u00b7 the potential for nationalization of enterprises;\n\u00b7 less favorable labor laws that may increase employment costs and decrease workforce flexibility;\n\u00b7 potentially adverse tax treatment;\n\u00b7 less favorable foreign intellectual property laws that would make it more difficult to protect our intellectual property from misappropriation;\n\u00b7 more onerous or differing data privacy and security requirements or other marketing regulations;\n\u00b7 longer payment cycles; and\n\u00b7 the differing costs and difficulties of managing international operations.\nOur current credit facilities also contain covenants that limit to 20% the portion of our assets, revenue and earnings that we can derive from our businesses outside of the U.S. Although we believe we could obtain a waiver or amendment of these covenants if our business outside the U.S. exceeded this level (whether through acquisitions or improved organic growth), we cannot guarantee that we will obtain a waiver or amendment, or that such a request may compel us to renegotiate our credit facilities at a time, or on terms, that are not favorable.\nIn addition, exchange rate movements may have an impact on our future costs or on future cash flows from foreign investments. We have not entered into any foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The various risks that are inherent in doing business in the U.S. are also generally applicable to doing business anywhere else, and may be exacerbated by the difficulty of doing business in numerous sovereign jurisdictions due to differences in culture, laws and regulations.\nWe must maintain effective internal controls.\nIn designing and evaluating our internal controls over financial reporting, we recognize that any internal control or procedure, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving desired control objectives and that no system of internal controls can be designed to provide absolute assurance of effectiveness. If we fail to maintain a system of effective internal controls, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or operating results. Additionally, adverse publicity related to a failure in our internal controls over financial reporting could have a negative impact on our reputation and business.\nFluctuation in our revenue and operating results and other factors may impact the volatility of our stock price.\nThe price at which our common stock has traded in recent years has fluctuated greatly and has declined significantly. Our common stock price may continue to be volatile due to a number of factors including the following (some of which are beyond our control):\n\u00b7 the impact of the uneven and lackluster economic recovery from the last recession, the overall strength of the economies of the markets we serve and general market volatility;\n\u00b7 variations in our operating results from period to period and variations between our actual operating results and the expectations of securities analysts, investors and the financial community;\n\u00b7 unanticipated developments with client engagements or client demand, such as variations in the size, budget, or progress toward the completion of engagements, variability in the market demand for our services, client consolidations and the unanticipated termination of several major client engagements;\n\u00b7 announcements of developments affecting our businesses;\n\u00b7 competition and the operating results of our competitors; and\n\u00b7 other factors discussed elsewhere in this Item 1A, \u201cRisk Factors\u201d.\nAs a result of these and other factors, investors in our common stock may not be able to resell their shares at or above their original purchase price.\nWar or terrorism could affect our business.\nWar, terrorism or the threat thereof involving a market we serve could have a significant impact on our business, financial position or operating results. War or the threat of war could substantially affect the levels of advertising expenditures by clients in each of our businesses, whether due to economic declines, decreased or slowed international trade, reactions to security risks or other factors. In addition, each of our businesses could be affected by operation disruptions and a shortage of supplies and labor related to such a war or threat of war.", "PERMNO": 79903, "SIC": 7331, "TIC": "HRTH"}
