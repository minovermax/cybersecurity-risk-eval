{"cik": "1600438", "company": "GMS Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-06-24", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following risk factors may be important to understanding any statement in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or elsewhere. Our business, financial condition and results of operations can be affected by several factors, whether currently known or unknown, including but not limited to those described below. Any one or more of such factors could directly or indirectly cause our actual results of operations and financial condition to vary materially from past or anticipated future results of operations and financial condition. Any of these factors, in whole or in part, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Relating to our Industry and Economic Conditions\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely impacted economic activity and conditions worldwide, including workforces, liquidity, capital markets, consumer behavior, supply chains, and macroeconomic conditions, which in turn has materially impacted our business. In particular, the COVID-19 pandemic impacted our operations including adversely impacting demand for our products, especially for those products tied to the commercial construction sector and disrupting our business operations. While we expect the COVID-19 pandemic to continue to impact our business in the near term, the ultimate extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to impact our business, financial condition results of operations and cash flows will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. These developments include the duration, severity and scope of the pandemic (including the possibility of further surges or variations of COVID-19 or the emergence of other health epidemics or pandemics), the timing and efficacy of the vaccination program in the United States and Canada, further actions taken by governmental authorities, including future stimulus programs, in response to the pandemic and changing consumer and supplier behavior.\nOur business depends in large part on both new construction and repair and remodeling activity in both the commercial and residential markets, all of which is generally dependent on the overall health of the economy. The economic impacts resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic have had, and may continue to have, a material and adverse impact on new construction and repair and remodeling (\u201cR&R\u201d) activity, across both the commercial and residential markets, which in turn impacts demand for our products and services.\nFurthermore, market disruptions could result in downward pricing pressures as our competitors compete for fewer jobs, adversely impacting our net sales and margins. The economic impacts resulting from the pandemic could also result in further deflationary pressure on certain of our products. In addition, our commercial market segments include offices, hotels, retail stores and other commercial buildings, many of which have been particularly affected by the pandemic. There is no guarantee that the pandemic will not have a lasting material and adverse impact on construction and repair and remodeling activities in these and other market subsegments even in the event of a general economic recovery.\nWhile we are currently able to operate in all of our locations, we have experienced meaningful disruption in the operation of our business. During the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, we had to temporarily close certain of our locations. We also had to temporarily close many of our showrooms, implement permanent headcount reductions, furlough certain employees and delay or reduce capital expenditures and suspend acquisition-related activity. We have adopted and complied with new protocols and safety measures at our facilities and job sites, which may impact productivity and efficiency of delivery\nof our products and services. While our markets have largely re-opened, the severity and duration of these disruptions will depend in large part on the duration and any worsening or recurrence of the pandemic.\nThere is no guarantee that we will not face new and continued disruptions in the future resulting from the pandemic or other public health crises. These disruptions may include the ability of our suppliers to manufacture, or our ability to procure from these suppliers, the products we sell; our ability to meet delivery requirements and commitments; the ability of our employees to perform their work due to impacts caused by the pandemic or local, state, or federal orders that restrict our operations or the operations of our customers; the ability of carriers to deliver our products to our branches and customers; the ability of our customers to conduct their business and purchase our products and services; the ability of our customers to pay us on a timely basis; our ability to operate in a typical manner or at all, generate revenues and cash flows, and/or access the capital or lending markets (or significantly increase the costs of doing so), as may be necessary to sustain our business.\nConsiderable uncertainty still surrounds the COVID-19 pandemic and its potential long-term effects, and the extent of and effectiveness of any responses taken on local, state, national and global levels, including the timing and efficacy of the vaccination program in the U.S. and Canada and future stimulus programs.\nIn addition, a resurgence of the COVID-19 pandemic in key areas of our operations may require us to implement further restrictions, may require us to temporarily close facilities or may further impact our net sales. Furthermore, the other risk factors included herein could be heightened as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or any other public health crisis. We will continue to actively monitor the COVID-19 pandemic and may take further actions that alter our business operations if required by federal, state, provincial or local authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, suppliers and stockholders.\nOur business is affected by general business, financial market and economic conditions, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur business and results of operations are significantly affected by general business, financial market and economic conditions in the United States and Canada. General business, financial market and economic conditions that could impact the level of activity in the commercial and residential construction and R&R markets include, among others, interest rate fluctuations, inflation, unemployment levels, tax rates and policy, capital spending, bankruptcies, volatility in both the debt and equity capital markets, liquidity of the global financial markets, credit and mortgage markets, consumer confidence, global economic growth, local, state, provincial and federal government regulation, the strength of regional and local economies in which we operate and the impact of public health emergencies, including the COVID-19 pandemic. Because our markets are sensitive to changes in the economy, downturns (or lack of substantial improvement) in the economy in any region in which we operate could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur sales are in part dependent upon the commercial new construction market and the commercial R&R market.\nWe cannot predict the duration of the current market conditions, changes in the demand for commercial space, or the timing or strength of any future recovery or downturn of commercial construction activity in our markets. Weakness in the commercial construction market and the commercial R&R market, would have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Furthermore, uncertainty about current and future economic conditions will continue to pose a risk to our business that serves the commercial construction and R&R markets as participants in this industry may postpone spending in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, tighter credit, negative financial news, a recession and/or declines in income, which could have a continued material negative effect on the demand for our products and services.\nOur sales are also in part dependent upon the residential new construction market and home R&R activity.\nThe distribution of our products, particularly wallboard, to contractors serving the residential market represents a significant portion of our business. Though its cyclicality has historically been somewhat moderated by R&R activity, wallboard demand is highly correlated with housing starts. Housing starts and R&R activity, in turn, are dependent upon a number of factors, including housing demand, housing inventory levels, housing affordability, building mix between single- and multi-family homes, foreclosure rates, geographical shifts in the population and other changes in demographics, the availability of land, local zoning and permitting processes, the availability of construction financing, and the health of the economy and mortgage markets, including related government regulations. Unfavorable changes in any of these factors beyond our control could adversely affect consumer spending, result in decreased demand for homes and adversely affect our business.\nWe also rely, in part, on home R&R activity. Although the market for residential R&R has improved in recent years, there is no guarantee that it will continue to improve. High unemployment levels, high mortgage delinquency and foreclosure\nrates, lower home prices, limited availability of mortgage and home improvement financing and significantly lower housing turnover may restrict consumer spending, particularly on discretionary items such as home improvement projects, and affect consumer confidence levels leading to reduced spending in the R&R end markets. Furthermore, consumer preferences and purchasing practices and the strategies of our customers may adjust in a manner that could result in changes to the nature and prices of products demanded by the end consumer and our customers and could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur industry and the markets in which we operate are highly fragmented and competitive, and increased competitive pressure may adversely affect our results.\nWe primarily compete in the distribution markets of wallboard, ceilings and complementary interior construction products with smaller distributors, but we also face competition from several national and multi-regional distributors of building materials, some of which are larger and have greater financial resources than us.\nCompetition varies depending on product line, type of customer and geographic area. If our competitors have greater financial resources or offer a broader range of building products, such as roofing, they may be able to offer higher levels of service or a broader selection of inventory than we can. Furthermore, any of our competitors may (i) foresee the course of market development more accurately than we do, (ii) provide superior service and sell or distribute superior products, (iii) have the ability to supply or deliver similar products and services at a lower cost, (iv) develop stronger relationships with our customers and other consumers in the industry in which we operate, (v) adapt more quickly to evolving customer requirements than we do, (vi) develop a superior network of distribution centers in our markets, (vii) access financing on more favorable terms than we can obtain or (viii) bundle products we do not offer with other products that are competitive with the products we sell. As a result, we may not be able to compete successfully with our competitors.\nCompetition can also reduce demand for our products, negatively affect our product sales or cause us to lower prices. The consolidation of homebuilders may result in increased competition for their business. Certain product manufacturers that sell and distribute their products directly to homebuilders may increase the volume of such direct sales. Our suppliers may also elect to enter into exclusive supplier arrangements with other distributors.\nOur customers consider the performance of the products we distribute, our customer service and price when deciding whether to use our services or purchase the products we distribute. Excess industry capacity for certain products in several geographic markets could lead to increased price competition. We may be unable to maintain our operating costs or product prices at a level that is sufficiently low for us to compete effectively. If we are unable to compete effectively with our existing competitors or new competitors enter the markets in which we operate, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected.\nThe trend toward consolidation in our industry may negatively impact our business.\nCustomer demands and supplier capabilities have resulted in consolidation in our industry, which could cause markets to become more competitive as greater economies of scale are achieved by distributors that are able to efficiently expand their operations. We believe these customer demands could result in fewer overall distributors operating multiple locations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively take advantage of this trend toward consolidation which may make it more difficult for us to maintain operating margins and could also increase the competition for acquisition targets in our industry, resulting in higher acquisition costs and prices.\nThe commercial and residential construction markets are seasonal.\nThe markets in which we operate are seasonal. Although weather patterns affect our operating results throughout the year, the months of November through February have historically been, and are generally expected to continue to be, adversely affected by weather patterns in some of our markets, causing reduced commercial and residential construction activity. We experience seasonal variation as a result of our customers\u2019 dependence on suitable weather to engage in construction, R&R projects. For example, during the winter months, construction activity generally declines due to inclement weather and shorter daylight hours. In addition, to the extent that hurricanes, severe storms, earthquakes, floods, fires, other natural disasters or similar events occur in the markets in which we operate, our business may be adversely affected. As a result, our operating results have historically varied significantly between fiscal quarters, and we anticipate that we will continue to experience these quarterly fluctuations in the future.\nRisks Relating to our Business\nWe are subject to significant fluctuations in prices and mix of the products we distribute and we may not be able to pass on price increases to our customers.\nLarge contractors and homebuilders in both the commercial and residential industries have historically been able to exert significant pressure on their outside suppliers and distributors to keep prices low in the highly fragmented building products supply and services industry. Continued consolidation in the commercial and residential industries and changes in builders\u2019 purchasing policies and payment practices could result in even further pricing pressure. Furthermore, in the event that new construction and R&R activity significantly declines, we could face increased pricing pressure from our competitors as we compete for a reduced number of projects. A decline in the prices of the products we distribute could adversely impact our operating results. When the prices of the products we distribute decline, customer demand for lower prices could result in lower sales prices and, to the extent that our inventory at the time was purchased at higher costs, lower margins. Alternatively, our suppliers may increase prices or reduce discounts on the products we distribute and we may be unable to pass on any cost increase to our customers, thereby resulting in reduced margins and profits. Overall, these pricing pressures may adversely affect our operating results and cash flows. In addition, we may experience changes in our customer mix or in our product mix. If customers require more lower-margin products from us and few higher-margin products, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows may suffer.\nWe may be unable to successfully implement our business strategy, which includes pursuing strategic acquisitions and opening new branches.\nOur long-term business strategy depends in part on increasing our sales and growing our market share through strategic acquisitions and opening new branches. If we fail to identify and acquire suitable acquisition targets on appropriate terms or fail to identify and open new branches that capitalize on pre-existing customer relationships, our growth strategy may be materially and adversely affected. Further, if our operating results decline, we may be unable to obtain the capital required to effect new acquisitions or open new branches.\nIn addition, we may not be able to integrate the operations of future acquired businesses in an efficient and cost-effective manner or without significant disruption to our existing operations. Even if we successfully integrate the businesses, there can be no assurance that the integration will result in the realization of the full benefit of the anticipated synergies and cost savings or that these benefits will be realized within the expected time frames. Moreover, acquisitions involve significant risks and uncertainties, including uncertainties as to the future financial performance of the acquired business, difficulties integrating acquired personnel and corporate cultures into our business, the potential loss of key employees, customers or suppliers, difficulties in integrating different computer and accounting systems, exposure to unknown or unforeseen liabilities of acquired companies, difficulties implementing disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting for the acquired businesses, and the diversion of management attention and resources from existing operations. We may also be required to incur additional debt in order to consummate acquisitions in the future, which debt may be substantial and may limit our flexibility in using our cash flow from operations. Our failure to integrate future acquired businesses effectively or to manage other consequences of our acquisitions, including increased indebtedness, could prevent us from remaining competitive and, ultimately, could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, if we finance acquisitions by issuing our equity securities or securities convertible into our equity securities, our existing stockholders would be diluted, which, in turn, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. We could also finance an acquisition with debt, resulting in higher leverage and interest costs relating to the acquisition. As a result, if we fail to evaluate and execute acquisitions efficiently, we may not ultimately experience the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions, and we may incur costs that exceed our expectations.\nWe may not be able to expand into new geographic markets, which may impact our ability to grow our business.\nWe intend to continue to pursue our business strategy to expand into new geographic markets for the foreseeable future. Our expansion into new geographic markets may present competitive, distribution and other challenges that differ from the challenges we currently face. In addition, we may be less familiar with the customers in these markets and may ultimately face different or additional risks, as well as increased or unexpected costs, compared to those we experience in our existing markets. Expansion into new geographic markets may also expose us to direct competition with companies with whom we have limited or no past experience as competitors. To the extent we rely upon expanding into new geographic markets and do not meet, or are unprepared for, any new challenges posed by such expansion, our future sales growth could be negatively impacted, our operating costs could increase, and our business and results of operations could be negatively affected.\nProduct shortages, loss of key suppliers or failure to develop relationships with qualified suppliers, and our dependence on third-party suppliers and manufacturers could affect our financial health.\nThe products we distribute are manufactured by several major suppliers. Our ability to offer a wide variety of products to our customers is dependent upon our ability to obtain adequate product supply from manufacturers and other suppliers. Historically the wallboard and steel products we distribute have been available from various sources and in sufficient quantities to meet our customer demand. However, given the current high demand in residential construction, certain wallboard and steel products are on long lead times from suppliers and as a result, our ability to obtain adequate supply of such wallboard and steel products has been, and may continue to be, adversely affected. Ceiling distribution arrangements are often exclusive to certain specified geographic areas. Any disruption or shortage in our sources of supply, particularly of the most commonly sold items, could result in a loss of revenues, reduced margins and damage to our relationships with customers. Supply shortages may occur as a result of, among other things, unanticipated increases in demand, shortage of raw materials, including the availability of synthetic gypsum, work stoppages, manufacturing challenges, natural disasters and pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic, military conflicts, civil unrest, acts of terrorism or difficulties in production or delivery. The loss of, or a substantial decrease in the availability of, products from our suppliers or the loss of key supplier arrangements, such as those whereby we are afforded exclusive distribution rights in certain geographic areas, could adversely impact our financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nOur ability to maintain relationships with qualified suppliers who can satisfy our high standards for quality and our need to be supplied with products in a timely and efficient manner is a significant challenge. Our suppliers\u2019 ability to provide us with products can also be adversely affected in the event they become financially unstable, fail to comply with applicable laws, encounter supply or manufacturing disruptions, shipping interruptions or increased costs, or they become faced with other factors beyond our control.\nAlthough in some instances we have agreements with our suppliers, these agreements are generally terminable by either party on limited notice. If market conditions change or if suppliers change their strategies for distributing products, suppliers may stop offering us favorable terms. Failure by our suppliers to continue to supply us with products on favorable terms, commercially reasonable terms, or at all, could put pressure on our operating margins or could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe loss of any of our significant customers or a reduction in the quantity of products they purchase could affect our financial health.\nOur ten largest customers generated approximately 9.0%, 8.8% and 8.8% of our net sales in the aggregate for fiscal 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We cannot guarantee that we will maintain or improve our relationships with these customers, or successfully assume the customer relationships of any businesses that we acquire, or that we will continue to supply these customers at historical levels.\nIn addition, professional homebuilders, commercial builders and other customers may: (i) purchase some of the products that we currently sell and distribute directly from manufacturers; (ii) elect to establish their own building products manufacturing and distribution facilities; or (iii) favor doing business with manufacturing or distribution intermediaries in which they have an economic stake. Continued consolidation among professional homebuilders and commercial builders could also result in a loss of some of our present customers to our competitors. The loss of one or more of our significant customers or deterioration in our existing relationships with any of our customers could adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows. Furthermore, our customers typically are not required to purchase any minimum amount of products from us. Should our customers purchase the products we distribute in significantly lower quantities than they have in the past, or should the customers of any businesses that we acquire purchase products from us in significantly lower quantities than they\nhad prior to our acquisition of the business, such decreased purchases could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe majority of our net sales are credit sales that are made primarily to customers whose ability to pay is dependent, in part, upon the economic strength of the industry and geographic areas in which they operate, and the failure to collect or timely collect monies owed from customers could adversely affect our financial condition.\nMost of our net sales volume is facilitated through the extension of credit to our customers whose ability to pay is dependent, in part, upon the economic strength of the industry in the areas where they operate. We offer credit to customers, either through unsecured credit that is based solely upon the creditworthiness of the customer, or secured credit for materials sold for a specific construction project where we establish a security interest in the material used in the project. The type of credit we offer depends both on the customer's financial strength and the nature of the business in which the customer is involved. End users, resellers and other non-contractor customers typically purchase more on unsecured credit than secured credit. If any of our customers are unable to repay credit that we have extended in a timely manner, or at all, our financial condition, operating results and cash flows would be adversely affected. Further, our collections efforts with respect to non-paying or slow-paying customers could negatively impact our customer relations going forward.\nBecause we depend on certain of our customers to repay extensions of credit, if the financial condition of our customers declines, our credit risk could increase as a result. Significant contraction in the commercial and residential construction markets, coupled with limited credit availability and stricter financial institution underwriting standards, including as a result of a public health emergency, including the COVID-19 pandemic, or economic downturn, could adversely affect the operations and financial stability of certain of our customers. Should one or more of our larger customers declare bankruptcy, it could adversely affect the collectability of our accounts receivable, bad debt reserves and net income.\nWe occupy many of our facilities under long-term non-cancellable leases, and we may be unable to renew our leases at the end of their terms.\nMany of our facilities and distribution centers are located on leased premises subject to non-cancellable leases. Typically, our leases have initial terms ranging from three to five years, with options to renew for specified periods of time. We believe that our future leases will likely also be long-term and non-cancellable and have similar renewal options. If we close or stop fully utilizing a facility, we will most likely remain obligated to perform under the applicable lease, which would include, among other things, making the base rent payments, and paying insurance, taxes and other expenses on the leased property for the remainder of the lease term. Our inability to terminate a lease when we stop fully utilizing a facility or exit a geographic market can have a significant adverse impact on our financial condition, operating results and cash flows. In addition, at the end of the lease term and any renewal period for a facility, we may be unable to renew the lease without substantial additional cost, if at all. If we are unable to renew our facility leases, we may close or relocate a facility, which could subject us to construction and other costs and risks, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. Further, we may not be able to secure a replacement facility in a location that is as commercially viable, including access to rail service, as the lease we are unable to renew. Having to close a facility, even briefly to relocate, would reduce the sales that such facility would have contributed to our revenues. Additionally, a relocated facility may generate less revenue and profit, if any, than the facility it was established to replace.\nWe may be unable to effectively manage our inventory and working capital as our sales volume increases or the prices of the products we distribute fluctuate, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe purchase products, including wallboard, ceilings, steel framing and complementary products, from manufacturers which are then sold and distributed to customers. We must maintain, and have adequate working capital to purchase, sufficient inventory to meet customer demand. Due to the lead times required by our suppliers, we order products in advance of expected sales. As a result, we are required to forecast our sales and purchase accordingly. In periods characterized by significant changes in economic growth and activity in the commercial and residential building and home R&R industries, it can be especially difficult to forecast our sales accurately. We must also manage our working capital to fund our inventory purchases. Excessive increases in the market prices of certain building products, such as wallboard, ceilings and steel framing, can put negative pressure on our operating cash flows by requiring us to invest more in inventory. In the future, if we are unable to effectively manage our inventory and working capital as we attempt to expand our business, our cash flows may be negatively affected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny significant fuel cost increases or shortages in the supply of fuel could disrupt our ability to distribute products to our customers, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe currently use our own fleet of owned and leased delivery vehicles to service customers in the regions in which we operate. As a result, we are inherently dependent upon energy to operate and are impacted by changes in fuel prices. The cost of fuel is largely unpredictable and has a significant impact on our results of operations. Fuel availability, as well as pricing, is also impacted by political, economic and market factors that are outside our control. It is difficult to predict the future availability of fuel due to the following factors, among others:\n\u2022dependency on foreign imports of crude oil and the potential for hostilities or other conflicts in oil producing areas;\n\u2022limited refining capacity; and\n\u2022the possibility of changes in governmental policies on fuel production, transportation and marketing.\nSignificant increases in the cost of fuel or disruptions in the supply of fuel could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nNatural or man-made disruptions to our facilities may adversely affect our business and operations.\nWe currently maintain distribution facilities throughout the United States and Canada, as well as our corporate headquarters in Tucker, Georgia, which supports our facilities with various back-office functions. In the event any of our facilities are damaged or operations are disrupted from fire, earthquake, hurricanes, tornados and other weather-related events, an act of terrorism, civil unrest, pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic, or any other cause, a significant portion of our inventory could be damaged and our ability to distribute products to customers could be materially impaired. In addition, general weather patterns affect our operations throughout the year, with adverse weather historically reducing construction activity in our third and fourth quarters. Adverse weather events, natural disasters or similar events, including as a result of climate change, could generally reduce or delay construction activity and our operations, which could adversely impact our financial condition, operating results and cash flows. For example, certain of our operations were disrupted as a result of winter storms in February 2021.\nMoreover, we could incur significantly higher costs and experience longer lead times associated with distributing products to our customers during the time that it takes for us to reopen or replace a damaged facility. Disruptions to the transportation infrastructure systems in the United States and Canada, including those related to a terrorist attack, civil unrest, pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic, or changes in response to terrorism threats or attacks, civil unrest, and pandemics may also affect our ability to keep our operations and services functioning properly. If any of these events were to occur, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nOur Canadian operations could have a material adverse effect on us, including currency rate fluctuations.\nWe operate 34 locations across six provinces in Canada. We are subject to several risks specific to this country. We may also become subject to risks specific to other countries where we may operate our business. These risks include social, political and economic instability, unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, tariffs and other trade barriers, currency exchange fluctuations, acts of war or terrorism and import/export requirements. Our financial statements are reported in United States dollars with international transactions being translated into United States dollars.\nOur exposure to currency rate fluctuations could be material to the extent that currency rate changes are significant or that our international operations comprise a larger percentage of our consolidated results. In addition, such fluctuations may also affect the comparability of our results between financial periods. We do not currently hedge the net investments in our foreign operations. There can be no assurances that any of these factors will not materially impact our production cost or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Legal, Regulatory and Compliance\nWe are exposed to product liability, warranty, casualty, construction defect, contract, tort, personal injury, employment and other claims and legal proceedings related to our business, the products we distribute, the services we provide and services provided for us by third parties.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we are subject to various claims and litigation. Any such claims, whether with or without merit, could be time consuming and expensive to defend and could divert management\u2019s attention and resources. The building materials industry has been subject to personal injury and property damage claims arising from alleged exposure to raw materials contained in building products as well as claims for incidents of catastrophic loss, such as building fires. As a distributor of building materials, we face an inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of the products we have distributed in the past or may in the future distribute is alleged to have resulted in economic loss, personal injury or property damage or violated environmental, health or safety or other laws. Such product liability claims have included and may in the future include allegations of defects in manufacturing, defects in design, a failure to warn of dangers inherent in the product, negligence, strict liability or a breach of warranties. In particular, certain of our subsidiaries have been the subject of claims related to alleged exposure to asbestos-containing products they distributed prior to 1979, which have not materially impacted our financial condition or operating results. See \u201cItem 3, Legal Proceedings.\u201d Such cases are continuing to be filed, and plaintiffs are attempting to expand such causes of action to include additional products, cause of exposure, and time periods beyond 1979. If such attempted expansion by plaintiffs is successful, our financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected. We are also from time to time subject to casualty, contract, tort and other claims relating to our business, the products we have distributed in the past or may in the future distribute, and the services we have provided in the past or may in the future provide, either directly or through third parties. If any such claim were adversely determined, our financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be adversely affected if we were unable to seek indemnification for such claims or were not adequately insured for such claims. We rely on manufacturers and other suppliers to provide us with the products we sell or distribute. Since we do not have direct control over the quality of products that are manufactured or supplied to us by third parties, we are particularly vulnerable to risks relating to the quality of such products. In addition, we are exposed to potential claims arising from the conduct of our employees, builders and their subcontractors, and third-party installers for which we may be liable. We and they are subject to regulatory requirements and risks applicable to general contractors, which include management of licensing, permitting and quality of third-party installers. As they apply to our business, if we fail to manage these processes effectively or provide proper oversight of these services, we could suffer lost sales, fines and lawsuits, as well as damage to our reputation, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, claims and investigations may arise related to distributor relationships, commercial contracts, antitrust or competition law requirements, employment matters, employee benefits issues, consumer privacy concerns and other compliance and regulatory matters, including anti-corruption and anti-bribery matters. While we have processes and policies designed to mitigate these risks and to investigate and address such claims as they arise, we cannot predict or, in some cases, control the costs to defend or resolve such claims.\nInsurance costs continue to rise and retention amounts have been increasing. Although we believe we currently maintain suitable and adequate insurance in excess of our self-insured amounts, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain such insurance on acceptable terms or that such insurance will provide adequate protection against potential liabilities, and the cost of any product liability, warranty, casualty, construction defect, contract, tort, employment or other litigation or other proceeding, even if resolved in our favor, could be substantial. Additionally, we do not carry insurance for all categories of risk that our business may encounter. Any significant uninsured liability may require us to pay substantial amounts. There can be no assurance that any current or future claims will not adversely affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur operations are subject to various hazards that may cause personal injury or property damage and increase our operating costs, and which may exceed the coverage of our insurance.\nThere are inherent risks to our operations. Our delivery employees are subject to the usual hazards associated with providing services on construction sites, while our distribution center personnel are subject to the hazards associated with moving and storing large quantities of heavy materials. In addition, we employ drivers in connection with our distribution operations and, from time to time, these drivers are involved in accidents which may cause injuries and in which goods carried\nby these drivers may be lost or damaged. Our trucks with articulating boom loaders, particularly when loaded, expose our drivers and others to traffic hazards.\nOperating hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, building and equipment and environmental damage, and we cannot eliminate these risks. We maintain vehicle and commercial insurance to cover property damages and personal injuries resulting from traffic accidents, and rely on state mandated social insurance for work-related injuries of our employees. Nevertheless, any claim that exceeds the scope of our insurance coverage, if successful and of sufficient magnitude, could result in the incurrence of substantial costs and the diversion of resources, which could have a material adverse effect on us. A material increase in the frequency or severity of accidents, claims for lost or damaged goods, liability claims, workers\u2019 compensation claims, or unfavorable resolutions of any such claims could also adversely affect our results of operations to the extent such claims are not covered by our insurance or such losses exceed our reserves. Further, significant increases in insurance costs or the inability to purchase insurance as a result of these claims could reduce our profitability and have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nFederal, state, provincial, local and other regulations could impose substantial costs and restrictions on our operations that would reduce our net income.\nWe are subject to various federal, state, provincial, local and other laws and regulations, including, among other things, transportation regulations promulgated by the U.S. Department of Transportation, or the DOT, work safety regulations promulgated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, or OSHA, employment regulations promulgated by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, regulations of the U.S. Department of Labor, consumer protection laws regarding privacy, and state and local zoning restrictions, building codes and contractors\u2019 licensing regulations. More burdensome regulatory requirements in these or other areas may increase our general and administrative costs and adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows. Moreover, failure to comply with the regulatory requirements applicable to our business could expose us to litigation and substantial fines and penalties that could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur transportation operations, upon which we depend to distribute products from our distribution centers, are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the DOT, which has broad administrative powers with respect to our transportation operations. Vehicle dimensions and driver hours of service also are subject to both federal and state regulation. More restrictive limitations on vehicle weight and size, trailer length and configuration, or driver hours of service would increase our costs, which, if we are unable to pass these cost increases on to our customers, may increase our selling, general and administrative expenses and adversely affect our financial condition, operating results and cash flows. If we fail to comply adequately with the DOT regulations or regulations become more stringent, we could experience increased inspections, regulatory authorities could take remedial action including imposing fines or shutting down our operations or we could be subject to increased audit and compliance costs. If any of these events were to occur, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows would be adversely affected.\nIn addition, the commercial and residential construction industries are subject to various local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, codes, rules and regulations concerning zoning, building design and safety, construction, contractor licensing, energy conservation and similar matters, including regulations that impose restrictive zoning and density requirements on the residential new construction industry or that limit the number of homes or other buildings that can be built within the boundaries of a particular area. Regulatory restrictions may increase our operating expenses and limit the availability of suitable building lots for our customers, any of which could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCompliance with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations could be expensive. Failure to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations could subject us to significant liability.\nWe are subject to various federal, state, provincial and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including laws and regulations governing the investigation and cleanup of contaminated properties, air emissions, water discharges, waste management and disposal, product safety and the health and safety of our employees and customers. These laws and regulations impose a variety of requirements and restrictions on our operations and the products we distribute. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in fines, penalties, enforcement actions, third party claims, damage to property or natural resources and personal injury, requirements to investigate or cleanup property or to pay for the costs of investigation or cleanup, or regulatory or judicial orders requiring corrective measures, including the installation of pollution control equipment or remedial actions and could negatively impact our reputation with customers. Environmental, health and safety laws and regulations applicable to our business, the products we distribute and the business of our customers, and the interpretation or enforcement of these laws and regulations, are constantly evolving and it is difficult to accurately\npredict the effect that changes in these laws and regulations, or their interpretation or enforcement, may have upon our business, financial condition or results of operations. Should environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, or their interpretation or enforcement, become more stringent, our costs, or the costs of our customers, could increase, which may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nUnder certain environmental laws and regulations, such as the U.S. federal Superfund law or its state or foreign equivalents, the obligation to investigate, remediate, monitor and clean up contamination at a facility may be imposed on current and former owners, lessees or operators or on persons who may have sent waste to that facility for disposal. Liability under these laws and regulations may be imposed without regard to fault or to the legality of the activities giving rise to the contamination. Contamination has been identified at several of our current and former facilities, and we have incurred and will continue to incur costs to investigate, remediate, monitor and otherwise address these conditions. Moreover, we may incur liabilities in connection with environmental conditions currently unknown to us relating to our prior, existing or future owned or leased sites or operations or those of predecessor companies whose liabilities we may have assumed or acquired.\nRisks Relating to Our Liquidity and Capital Resources\nThe agreements that govern our indebtedness contain various financial covenants that could limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our best long-term interests.\nThe agreements that govern our indebtedness include covenants that, among other things, may impose significant operating and financial restrictions, including restrictions on our ability to engage in activities that may be in our best long-term interests. These covenants may restrict our ability to:\n\u2022incur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022create or maintain liens on property or assets;\n\u2022make investments, loans and advances;\n\u2022sell certain assets or engage in acquisitions, mergers or consolidations;\n\u2022redeem debt;\n\u2022pay dividends and repurchase our shares; and\n\u2022enter into transactions with affiliates.\nIn addition, under the terms of our senior secured asset based revolving credit facility (the \u201cABL Facility\u201d), we may at times be required to comply with a specified fixed charge coverage ratio. Our ability to meet this ratio could be affected by events beyond our control, and we cannot assure that we will meet this ratio.\nA breach of any of the covenants under any of our debt agreements may result in a default under such agreement. If any such default occurs, the administrative agent under the agreement would be entitled to take various actions, including the acceleration of amounts due under the agreement and all actions permitted to be taken by a secured creditor. This could have serious adverse consequences on our financial condition and could cause us to become insolvent.\nOur current indebtedness, degree of leverage and any future indebtedness we may incur, may adversely affect our cash flow, limit our operational and financing flexibility and negatively impact our business and our ability to make payments on our indebtedness and declare dividends and make other distributions.\nAs of April 30, 2021, $509.7 million was outstanding under our senior secured first lien term loan facility (the \u201cTerm Loan Facility\u201d) and $350.0 million was outstanding under our senior unsecured notes (\u201cSenior Notes\u201d). As of April 30, 2021, there were no amounts outstanding under our ABL Facility or our Canadian revolving credit facility (\u201cCanadian Facility\u201d). In addition, we may incur substantial additional debt in the future. Our current indebtedness and other debt instruments we may enter into in the future, may have significant consequences to our business and, as a result, may impact our stockholders, including:\n\u2022impairing our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or general corporate purposes;\n\u2022requiring us to dedicate a significant portion of our cash flows from operations to pay interest on any outstanding indebtedness, which would reduce the funds available to us for operations and other purposes;\n\u2022limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, the industries in which we operate;\n\u2022making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness;\n\u2022making us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation;\n\u2022placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that are less leveraged and, therefore, more able to take advantage of opportunities that our leverage prevents us from exploiting;\n\u2022impairing our ability to refinance existing indebtedness or borrow additional amounts for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our business strategy or other purposes;\n\u2022restricting our ability to pay dividends, make other distributions and repurchase our shares; and\n\u2022adversely affecting our credit ratings.\nAny of the above listed factors could materially adversely affect our financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nFurthermore, we expect that we will depend primarily on cash generated by our operations in order to pay our expenses and any amounts due under our existing indebtedness and any future indebtedness we may incur. As a result, our ability to repay our indebtedness depends on the future performance of our business, which will be affected by financial, business, economic and other factors, many of which we cannot control. Our business may not generate sufficient cash flows from operations in the future and we may not achieve our currently anticipated growth in revenues and cash flows, either or both of which could result in our being unable to repay indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs. If we do not have enough funds, we may be required to refinance all or part of our then existing indebtedness, sell assets or borrow additional funds, in each case on terms that may not be acceptable to us, if at all. In addition, the terms of existing or future debt agreements, including our existing ABL Facility, Term Loan Facility and Senior Notes, may restrict us from engaging in any of these alternatives. Our ability to recapitalize and incur additional debt in the future could also delay or prevent a change in control of our Company, make certain transactions more difficult to complete or impose additional financial or other covenants on us.\nDespite our current level of indebtedness, we may still be able to incur substantially more debt.\nWe may be able to incur significant additional indebtedness in the future, including secured debt. Although the agreements governing our indebtedness contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions, and the additional indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. These restrictions also will not prevent us from incurring obligations that do not constitute indebtedness, including obligations under operating lease arrangements. In addition, the ABL Facility provides a commitment of up to $445.0 million, subject to a borrowing base. As of April 30, 2021, we had available borrowing capacity of $429.6 million under the ABL Facility and $24.2 million under the Canadian Facility. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face could intensify.\nAn increase in interest rates would increase the cost of servicing our debt and could reduce our profitability.\nOur Term Loan Facility and ABL Facility bear interest at variable rates. We have entered into interest rate swaps for a portion of our debt with the objective of minimizing the risks associated with our Term Loan Facility. However, increases in interest rates with respect to any amount of our debt not covered by the interest rate swaps could increase the cost of servicing our debt and could materially reduce our profitability and cash flows. Such increases may occur from changes in regulatory standards or industry practices, such as the upcoming transition away from the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) as a benchmark reference for short-term interests. Such a transition may result in the usage of a higher reference rate for our variable rate debt. Excluding the effect of the interest rate swaps and the interest rate floor on the Term Loan Facility, each 1% increase in interest rates on the Term Loan Facility would increase our annual interest expense by $5.1 million based on balances outstanding under the Term Loan Facility as of April 30, 2021. Assuming the ABL Facility was fully drawn up to the $445.0 million maximum commitment, each 1% increase in interest rates would result in a $4.5 million increase in annual interest expense on the ABL Facility.\nWe may have future capital needs that require us to incur additional debt and may be unable to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms, if at all.\nWe rely substantially on the liquidity provided by our existing ABL Facility and cash on hand to provide working capital and fund our operations. Our working capital and capital expenditure requirements may increase as our markets rebound and we execute our strategic growth plan. Economic and credit market conditions, the performance of the commercial and residential construction markets, and our financial performance, as well as other factors, may constrain our financing abilities. Our ability to secure additional financing, if available, and to satisfy our financial obligations under indebtedness outstanding from time to time will depend upon our future operating performance, the availability of credit, economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. The prolonged continuation or worsening of current housing market conditions and the macroeconomic factors that affect our industry could require us to seek additional capital and have a material adverse effect on our ability to secure such capital on favorable terms, if at all.\nWe may be unable to secure additional financing or financing on favorable terms or our operating cash flow may be insufficient to satisfy our financial obligations under our outstanding indebtedness. If additional funds are raised through the issuance of additional equity or convertible debt securities, our stockholders may experience significant dilution. We may also incur additional indebtedness in the future, including secured debt, subject to the restrictions contained in the ABL Facility, the Term Loan Facility and Senior Notes. If new debt is added to our current debt levels, the related risks that we now face could intensify.\nRisks Relating to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock may be highly volatile.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile. A significant drop in our stock price could also expose us to the risk of securities class action lawsuits, which could result in substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business. Finally, volatility or a lack of positive performance in our stock price may adversely affect our ability to retain key employees, many of whom have been granted stock incentive awards. The following events and factors, in addition to other factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock:\n\u2022announcements of innovations or new products or services by us or our competitors;\n\u2022any adverse changes to our relationship with our customers, manufacturers or suppliers;\n\u2022variations in the costs of products that we distribute;\n\u2022any legal actions in which we may become involved;\n\u2022announcements concerning our competitors or the building supply industry in general;\n\u2022achievement of expected product sales and profitability;\n\u2022manufacture, supply or distribution shortages;\n\u2022adverse actions taken by regulatory agencies with respect to our services or the products we distribute;\n\u2022actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly or annual operating results;\n\u2022changes in financial estimates;\n\u2022changes in recommendations or reduced coverage by securities analysts;\n\u2022trading volume of our common stock;\n\u2022sales of our common stock by us, our executive officers and directors or our stockholders in the future;\n\u2022changes in accounting principles;\n\u2022the loss of any of our management or key personnel;\n\u2022market trends unelated to our performance;\n\u2022natural disasters or public health emergencies, such as the COVID-19 pandemic; and\n\u2022general economic and market conditions and overall fluctuations in the U.S. equity markets.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.\nWe currently anticipate that we will retain future earnings for the development, operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate declaring or paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. In addition, the terms of the ABL Facility, the Term Loan Facility and any future debt agreements may preclude our subsidiaries from paying dividends to us which, in turn, may preclude us from paying dividends to our stockholders. As a result, we expect that only appreciation of the price of our common stock, if any, will provide a return to investors in our common stock for the foreseeable future.\nSome provisions of our charter documents and Delaware law may have anti-takeover effects that could discourage an acquisition of us by others, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders, and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our third amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our second amended and restated bylaws, as well as provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or DGCL, could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us or increase the cost of acquiring us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. These provisions include:\n\u2022establishing a classified board of directors such that not all members of the board are elected at one time, which provision will no longer be in effect at our 2024 annual stockholder meeting;\n\u2022allowing the total number of directors to be determined exclusively (subject to the rights of holders of any series of preferred stock to elect additional directors) by resolution of our board of directors and granting to our board\nthe sole power (subject to the rights of holders of any series of preferred stock or rights granted pursuant to the stockholders\u2019 agreement) to fill any vacancy on the board;\n\u2022limiting the ability of stockholders to remove directors without cause;\n\u2022authorizing the issuance of \"blank check\" preferred stock by our board of directors, without further stockholder approval, to thwart a takeover attempt;\n\u2022prohibiting stockholder action by written consent (and, thus, requiring that all stockholder actions be taken at a meeting of our stockholders);\n\u2022eliminating the ability of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders; and\n\u2022establishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at annual stockholder meetings.\nIn addition, while we have opted out of Section 203 of the DGCL, our third amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains similar provisions providing that we may not engage in certain \u201cbusiness combinations\u201d with any \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d for a three-year period following the time that the stockholder became an interested stockholder, unless:\n\u2022prior to such time, our board of directors approved either the business combination or the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder;\n\u2022upon consummation of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder, the interested stockholder owned at least 85% of our voting stock outstanding at the time the transaction commenced, excluding certain shares; or\n\u2022at or subsequent to that time, the business combination is approved by our board of directors and by the affirmative vote of holders of at least two-thirds of our outstanding voting stock that is not owned by the interested stockholder.\nGenerally, a \u201cbusiness combination\u201d includes a merger, asset or stock sale or other transaction provided for or through our Company resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder. Subject to certain exceptions, an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d is a person who owns 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock and the affiliates and associates of such person. For purposes of this provision, \u201cvoting stock\u201d means any class or series of stock entitled to vote generally in the election of directors.\nUnder certain circumstances, this provision will make it more difficult for a person who would be an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d to effect certain business combinations with us for a three-year period. This provision may encourage companies interested in acquiring us to negotiate in advance with our board of directors in order to avoid the stockholder approval requirement if our board of directors approves either the business combination or the transaction that results in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder. These provisions also may have the effect of preventing changes in our board of directors and may make it more difficult to accomplish transactions that stockholders may otherwise deem to be in their best interests.\nThese anti-takeover defenses could discourage, delay or prevent a transaction involving a change in control of our Company. These provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors of their choosing and cause us to take corporate actions other than those our stockholders desire.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nFailure to attract and retain key employees could have a significant adverse effect on our business.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to attract, hire, train and retain qualified managerial, operational, sales and other personnel. We face significant competition for these types of employees in our industry and from other industries. We may be unsuccessful in attracting and retaining the personnel we require to conduct and expand our operations successfully. In addition, key personnel may leave us and compete against us. Our success also depends to a significant extent on the continued service of our senior management team. We may be unsuccessful in replacing key managers who either resign or retire. The loss of any member of our senior management team or other experienced senior employees could impair our ability to execute our business plan, cause us to lose customers and reduce our net sales, or lead to employee morale problems and/or the loss of other key employees. In any such event, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nCybersecurity breaches could harm our business.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including our proprietary business information and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, and personally identifiable information of our customers and employees, in our data centers and on our networks. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations. We have incurred costs and may incur significant additional costs in order to implement the security measures that we believe are appropriate to protect our IT systems. Our security measures are focused on the prevention, detection and remediation of damage from computer viruses, natural or man-made disasters, unauthorized access, cyber attacks and other similar disruptions. Despite our security measures, our IT systems and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. To date, we have not experienced a material breach of our IT systems. Any attacks on our IT systems could result in our systems or data being breached or damaged by computer viruses or unauthorized physical or electronic access. Such a breach could result in not only business disruption, but also theft of our intellectual property or other competitive information or unauthorized access to controlled data and any personal information stored in our IT systems. To the extent that any data is lost or destroyed or any confidential information is inappropriately disclosed or used, it could adversely affect our competitive position or customer relationships. In addition, any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, damage our reputation and cause a loss of confidence in our business, products and services, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, profitability and cash flows.\nA disruption of our IT systems could adversely impact our business and operations.\nWe rely on the accuracy, capacity and security of our IT systems, some of which are managed or hosted by third parties, and our ability to continually update these systems in response to the changing needs of our business. Our IT systems and those of our third-party service providers are vulnerable to damage or interruption from fires, earthquakes, hurricanes, tornados, floods and other natural disasters, terrorist attacks, power loss, capacity limitations, telecommunications failures, software and hardware defects or malfunctions, break-ins, sabotage and vandalism, human error and other disruptions that are beyond our control. We continue to invest capital to enhance, expand and increase the reliability of our network, but these capital expenditures may not achieve the results we expect. The occurrence of any disruption or system failure or other significant disruption to business continuity may result in a loss of business, increase expenses, damage our reputation or expose us to litigation and possible financial losses, any of which could adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nTrade policies could make sourcing product from foreign countries more difficult or more costly.\nWe source some of our products from outside of the United States or Canada. Suppliers that we utilize may rely upon non-domestic products, and therefore, any significant changes to the United States or Canadian trade policies (and those of other countries in response) may cause a material adverse effect on our ability to procure products from suppliers that source from other countries or significantly increase the costs of obtaining such products, which could result in a material adverse effect on our financial results.", "PERMNO": 16076, "SIC": 5030, "TIC": "GMS"}
