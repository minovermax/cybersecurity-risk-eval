{"cik": "1368265", "company": "Clean Energy Fuels Corp.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-07", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nAn investment in our Company involves a high degree of risk of loss. You should carefully consider the risk factors discussed below and all of the other information included in this annual report on Form 10-K before you make any investment decision regarding our securities. We believe the risks and uncertainties described below are the most significant we face. The occurrence of any of the following risks could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations, prospects and reputation and could cause the trading price of our common stock to decline. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business.\nWe have a history of losses and may incur additional losses in the future.\nIn 2014, 2015 and 2016, we incurred pre-tax losses of $89.8 million, $133.8 million and $12.4 million, respectively. During these periods our losses were substantially decreased by approximately $28.4 million, $31.0 million and $26.6 million of revenue, respectively, from the VETC alternative fuels tax credit, which ceased to be available as of January 1, 2017 and may not be available for any subsequent period. We may continue to incur losses, the amount of our losses may increase, and we may never achieve or maintain profitability, which would adversely affect our business, prospects and financial condition, and may cause the price of our common stock to fall.\nServicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our debt.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our total indebtedness was approximately $314.3 million in principal amount, which includes amounts incurred under the 7.5% Notes, 5.25% Notes, Canton Bonds, and Plains Note, each of which is defined and discussed in Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements included in this report and is reflected under \u201cContractual Obligations\u201d in Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this report. As of December 31, 2016, approximately $6.1 million, $189.6 million, $55.5 million, $54.6 million, $4.0 million and $4.5 million of the principal amount of our indebtedness matures in 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021 and thereafter, respectively. We expect our total interest payment obligations relating to our indebtedness to be approximately $19.7 million in 2017.\nWe generally intend to make payments under our various debt instruments when due and pursue opportunities for earlier repayment and/or refinancing if and when opportunities arise.\nOur ability to make payments of the principal and interest on our indebtedness, whether at or prior to their due dates, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors, including those described in these risk factors, many of which are beyond our control. Our business may not generate cash flow from operations sufficient to service our debt.\nIn that case, we may be required to pursue one or more alternatives to meet our debt obligations. For instance, as of the date of this report, we are permitted to repay up to $125.0 million of our outstanding indebtedness at maturity with shares of our common stock rather than cash, with the amount of shares determined by the then-current trading price of our common stock. Any repayment of our debt with equity would increase the number of our outstanding shares and may significantly dilute the ownership interest of our stockholders. Additionally, any shortfall of cash from operations to service our debt may lead us to seek capital from other sources, such as selling assets, restructuring or refinancing our debt or obtaining additional equity capital or debt financing. Our ability to engage in any of these activities, should we decide to do so, would depend on the capital markets, the state of our industry and our business and our financial condition at the time, and we may not be successful in obtaining\nadditional capital on desirable terms, at a desirable time or at all. Any failure to make payments on our debt when due, either in cash or stock, could result in a default on our debt obligations.\nAdditionally, certain of the agreements governing our indebtedness contain restrictive covenants, and any failure by us to comply with any of these covenants could also cause us to be in default under the agreements governing the indebtedness. In the event of any default on our debt obligations, the holders of the indebtedness could, among other things, elect to declare all amounts owed immediately due and payable, which could cause all or a large portion of our available cash flow to be used to pay such amounts and thereby reduce the amount of cash available to pursue our business plans or force us into bankruptcy or liquidation, or, with respect to our indebtedness that is secured, elect to foreclose on the assets that secure the debt, which could force us to relinquish rights to assets that are revenue generating or profitable or that we believe are otherwise beneficial or essential to our business. In addition, the substantial amount of our indebtedness, combined with our other financial obligations and contractual commitments, could have other important consequences. For example, it could make us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general U.S. and worldwide economic, industry and competitive conditions and government regulations, limit our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry, place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors who have less debt or limit our ability to borrow additional amounts as needed.\nWe may need to raise additional capital to continue to fund the growth of our business or repay our debt, which may not be available when needed, on acceptable terms or at all.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had total liquidity of $109.8 million consisting of cash and cash equivalents of $36.1 million and short-term investments of $73.7 million. Our business plan calls for approximately $29.0 million in capital expenditures for 2017, as well as additional capital expenditures thereafter. We may also require capital to make principal or interest payments on our indebtedness, either prior to or at their due dates, or for unanticipated expenses, mergers, acquisitions or strategic investments. As a result, we may find it necessary to raise additional capital through selling assets or pursuing debt or equity financing.\nAsset sales and equity or debt financing options may not be available when needed on terms favorable to us, or at all. Any sale of our assets may limit our operational capacity and could limit or eliminate any revenue streams or business plans that are dependent on the sold assets. Additional issuances of our common stock or securities convertible into our common stock (including through our established at-the-market offering program or other equity offerings) would increase the number of our outstanding shares and dilute the ownership interest of our stockholders. We may also pursue debt financing since, despite the high level of our existing indebtedness, the agreements governing much of this indebtedness do not restrict our ability to incur additional secured or unsecured debt or require us to maintain financial ratios or specified levels of net worth or liquidity. Debt financing options that we may pursue include, among others, equipment financing, sales of convertible notes, high-yield debt, asset-based loans, term loans, project finance debt, municipal bond financing, loans secured by receivables or inventory or commercial bank financing. Any debt financing we obtain may require us to make significant interest payments and to pledge some or all of our assets as security. In addition, higher levels of indebtedness could increase our risk of non-repayment and could adversely affect our creditworthiness, which could limit our ability to obtain further debt or equity financing as needed and restrict our flexibility in responding to changing business, industry and economic conditions. Further, we may incur substantial costs in pursuing any future capital-raising transactions, including investment banking, legal and accounting fees, printing and distribution expenses and other similar costs. On the other hand, if we are unable to obtain capital in amounts sufficient to fund our contractual obligations, business plans, unanticipated expenses, capital expenditures, mergers, acquisitions or strategic investments, we could be forced to suspend, delay or curtail these plans, expenditures or other transactions, which could negatively affect our business and prospects.\nOur success is dependent upon the willingness of fleets and other consumers to adopt natural gas as a vehicle fuel, which may not occur in a timely manner or at all.\nOur success is highly dependent upon the adoption by fleets and other consumers of natural gas as a vehicle fuel. If the market for natural gas as a vehicle fuel does not develop as we expect or develops more slowly than we expect or if a market does develop but we are not able to capture a significant share of the market or the market subsequently declines, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results would be harmed.\nThe market for natural gas as a vehicle fuel is a relatively new and developing market characterized by intense competition, evolving government regulation and industry standards and changing consumer demands and behaviors.\nFactors that may influence the adoption of natural gas as a vehicle fuel include, among others:\n\u2022\nIncreases, decreases or volatility in the prices of oil, gasoline, diesel, natural gas and other vehicle fuels;\n\u2022\nThe availability of natural gas compared to gasoline, diesel and other vehicle fuels;\n\u2022\nNatural gas vehicle cost, availability (including for heavy, medium and light duty applications), quality, safety, design and performance, all relative to vehicles powered by other fuels;\n\u2022\nThe existence of government programs, policies, regulations or incentives promoting natural gas, including tax credits, grants, renewable fuel standards and low carbon fuel standards;\n\u2022\nThe availability or perceived availability of, consumer acceptance of and favor by lawmakers, regulators and other policy makers for non-natural gas fuels and vehicles, including gasoline and diesel powered vehicles and growing favor for electric and hydrogen-powered vehicles;\n\u2022\nImprovements in the efficiency, fuel economy or greenhouse gas emissions of engines for gasoline and diesel-powered and alternative vehicles;\n\u2022\nPerceptions about greenhouse gas emissions from natural gas production and transportation methods, natural gas fueling stations and natural gas vehicles, and the environmental consciousness of fleets and consumers;\n\u2022\nAccess to natural gas fueling stations and the convenience and cost to fuel and service natural gas vehicles; and\n\u2022\nThe other risks discussed in these risk factors.\nIncreases, decreases and general volatility in oil, gasoline, diesel and natural gas prices could adversely affect our business.\nIn recent years, the prices of oil, gasoline, diesel and natural gas have been volatile, and this volatility may continue. Additionally, prices for crude oil in recent years have been low, due in part to over-production and increased supply without a corresponding increase in demand. Market adoption of CNG, LNG and RNG (which can be delivered in the form of CNG or LNG) as vehicle fuels could be slowed or limited if the low prices and over-supply of gasoline and diesel, today\u2019s most prevalent and conventional vehicle fuels, continue or worsen, or if the price of natural gas increases without equal and corresponding increases in prices of gasoline and diesel. Any of these circumstances could decrease the market's perception of a need for alternative vehicle fuels generally and could cause the success or perceived success of our industry and our business to materially suffer. In addition, low gasoline and diesel prices contribute to the differential between the cost of natural gas vehicles and gasoline or diesel-powered vehicles. Generally, natural gas vehicles cost more initially than gasoline or diesel powered vehicles, as the components needed for a vehicle to use natural gas add to the vehicle\u2019s base cost. Operators seek to recover the additional costs of acquiring or converting to natural gas vehicles over time through the lower costs of fueling natural gas vehicles; however, operators may perceive an inability to timely recover these additional costs if we do not offer CNG and LNG fuel at prices lower than gasoline and diesel. Our ability to offer our customers an attractive pricing advantage for CNG and LNG and maintain an acceptable margin on our sales becomes more difficult if prices of gasoline and diesel decrease or if prices of natural gas increase. These pricing conditions exacerbate the cost differential between natural gas vehicles and gasoline or diesel powered vehicles, which may lead operators to delay or refrain from purchasing or converting to natural gas vehicles at all. Any of these outcomes would decrease our potential customer base and harm our business prospects. Further, fluctuations in natural gas prices affect the cost to us of the natural gas commodity. High natural gas prices adversely impact our operating margins in cases where we cannot pass the increased costs through to our customers. Conversely, lower natural gas prices reduce our revenue in cases where the commodity cost is passed through to our customers. As a result, these fluctuations in natural gas prices can have a significant and adverse impact on our operating results.\nFactors that can cause fluctuations in gasoline, diesel and natural gas prices include, among others, changes in supply and availability of crude oil and natural gas, government regulations and political conditions, inventory levels, consumer demand, price and availability of other alternative fuels, weather conditions, negative publicity surrounding drilling, production or importing techniques and methods for oil or natural gas, economic conditions and the price of foreign imports.\nWith respect to natural gas supply and use as a vehicle fuel, there have been recent efforts to place new regulatory requirements on the production of natural gas by hydraulic fracturing of shale gas reservoirs and other means and on transporting, dispensing and using natural gas. Hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling techniques have resulted in a substantial increase in the proven natural gas reserves in the United States. Any changes in regulations that make it more expensive or unprofitable to produce natural gas through these techniques or others, as well as any changes to the regulations relating to transporting, dispensing or using natural gas, could lead to increased natural gas prices.\nIf pricing conditions worsen, or if all or some combination of factors causing further volatility in natural gas, oil and diesel prices were to occur, our business and our industry would be materially harmed.\nVehicle and engine manufacturers produce very few natural gas vehicles and engines for the United States and Canadian markets, which limits our customer base and our sales of CNG, LNG and RNG.\nOriginal equipment manufacturers produce a relatively small number of natural gas engines and vehicles, including heavy duty trucks, medium duty applications and other types of vehicles, in the U.S. and Canadian markets. Further, these manufacturers may not decide to expand, or they may decide to discontinue or curtail, their natural gas engine or vehicle product lines. This limited production of natural gas engines and vehicles increases the cost to purchase these vehicles and limits their availability, which restricts their large-scale introduction and adoption. As a result of these and other factors, the limited supply of natural gas vehicles could reduce our potential customer base and natural gas fuel sales, which could harm our business and prospects.\nThe failure of our America\u2019s Natural Gas Highway initiative and objective to fuel a greater number of natural gas heavy-duty trucks would materially and adversely affect our financial results and business.\nWe are seeking to fuel a substantial number of natural gas heavy-duty trucks and in connection with that effort we have built a nationwide network of natural gas-truck friendly fueling stations, which we refer to as America\u2019s Natural Gas Highway. Our ability to successfully execute these initiatives faces substantial risks, including, among others:\n\u2022\nThe adoption of natural gas engines that are well-suited for heavy duty trucks is essential to the success of these initiatives. We have no influence over the development, production, sales and marketing, cost or availability of natural gas trucks powered by these engines. Currently, Cummins Westport is the only natural gas engine manufacturer for the heavy-duty market, and we have no control over whether and the extent to which Cummins Westport will remain in the natural gas engine business or whether other manufacturers will enter the natural gas engine business;\n\u2022\nThese initiatives depend upon the development and expansion of the U.S. natural gas heavy duty market. Operators may not adopt heavy-duty natural gas trucks due to cost, actual or perceived performance issues, or other factors that are outside of our control. To date, adoption and deployment of natural gas trucks have been slower and more limited than we anticipated;\n\u2022\nAs a natural gas heavy-duty truck market develops in the United States, truck and other vehicle operators may not fuel at our stations due to lack of access or convenience, fuel prices or other factors.\n\u2022\nBuilding ANGH has required, and may continue to require, a commitment of capital and other resources and we may not be able to raise sufficient capital to complete it.\n\u2022\nMost of our ANGH stations were initially built to provide LNG, which costs more than CNG on an energy equivalent basis. We have been spending, and expect to continue to spend, additional capital to add CNG fueling capability to many of our ANGH stations, and we may not have sufficient capital in the future for this purpose.\n\u2022\nOur ANGH stations may experience mechanical or operational difficulties, which could require significant costs to repair and could reduce customer confidence in our stations.\n\u2022\nWe may not be able to obtain acceptable margins on fuel sales at ANGH stations.\n\u2022\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had 39 completed ANGH stations that were not open for fueling operations. We expect to open these stations when we have sufficient customers to fuel at the locations, but we do not know when this will occur. As long as these stations remain unopened, we will continue to have substantial investments in assets that do not produce revenue.\nWe must effectively manage these risks and any other risks that may arise in connection with the completion of ANGH to successfully execute our business plan. If the U.S. market for heavy-duty natural gas trucks does not develop, our financial results, operations and business, including our ability to repay our debt, would be materially and adversely affected.\nWe face increasing competition from a variety of businesses, many of which have far greater resources, customer bases, and brand awareness than we have, and we may not be able to compete effectively with these businesses.\nThe market for vehicle fuels is highly competitive. We believe the biggest competition for CNG and LNG is gasoline and diesel, as the vast majority of vehicles in the United States and Canada are powered by gasoline and diesel. We also compete with suppliers of other alternative vehicle fuels, including renewable diesel, biodiesel and ethanol, as well as fuelers of alternative vehicles, including hybrid, electric and hydrogen-powered vehicles. Additionally, our stations compete directly with other natural gas fueling stations and indirectly with electric vehicle charging stations and other alternative fueling stations. Further, for certain\nof our key customer markets, such as airports and public transit, we indirectly compete with companies such as Uber and Lyft that provide alternative transportation methods. We also face high levels of competition with respect to our other business activities, including our manufacture and sale of natural gas compressors and other equipment, our production and sale of RNG and our sale of CNG and LNG to industrial and institutional energy users.\nA significant number of established businesses, including oil and gas companies, alternative vehicle and alternative fuel companies, refuse collectors, utilities and their affiliates, industrial gas companies, truck stop and fuel station owners, fuel providers and other organizations have entered or may enter the market for natural gas and other alternatives for use as vehicle fuels. Many of these competitors have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, greater brand recognition and market penetration and substantially greater financial, marketing, research and other resources. As a result, they may be able to respond more quickly to changes in customer preferences or legal requirements, devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products, adopt more aggressive pricing policies, devote substantially more resources to infrastructure and systems development or exert more influence on the regulatory landscape that impacts the vehicle fuels market. Additionally, utilities and their affiliates typically have additional and unique competitive advantages, including a lower cost of capital, substantial and predictable cash flows, long-standing customer relationships, greater brand awareness and large and well-trained sales and marketing organizations. We may not be able to compete effectively against these organizations.\nWe expect competition to increase in the alternative fuels market generally and, if the demand for natural gas vehicle fuel increases, the market for natural gas vehicle fuel. Any such increased competition may lead to pricing pressure, reduced operating margins and fewer expansion opportunities.\nIf there are advances in other alternative vehicle fuels or technologies, or if there are improvements in gasoline, diesel or hybrid engines, demand for natural gas vehicles may decline.\nTechnological advances in the production, delivery and use of gasoline, diesel or other alternative fuels that are, or are perceived to be, cleaner, more cost-effective, more readily available or otherwise more attractive than CNG, LNG or RNG may slow or limit adoption of natural gas vehicles. For example, advances in gasoline and diesel engine technology, including efficiency improvements and further development of hybrid engines, may offer a cleaner, more cost-effective option and make fleet customers less likely to convert their vehicles to natural gas. Additionally, technological advances related to ethanol or biodiesel, which are used as an additive to, or substitute for gasoline and diesel fuel, may slow the need to diversify fuels and affect the growth of the natural gas vehicle fuel market.\nFurther, use of electric heavy-duty trucks, buses and refuse trucks, or the perception that such vehicles may soon be widely available and provide satisfactory performance at an acceptable cost, may reduce demand for natural gas vehicles. In addition, renewable diesel, hydrogen and other alternative fuels may prove to be cleaner, more cost-effective alternatives to gasoline and diesel than natural gas. Advances in technology that reduce demand for natural gas as a vehicle fuel or the failure of natural gas vehicle technology to advance at an equal pace could slow or curtail the growth of natural gas vehicle purchases or conversions, which would have an adverse effect on our business.\nOur business is influenced by environmental, tax and other government regulations, programs and incentives that promote cleaner fuels and alternative vehicles, and their adoption, modification or repeal could impact our business.\nOur business is influenced by federal, state and local government tax credits, rebates, grants and similar programs and incentives that promote the use of CNG, LNG and RNG as a vehicle fuel, including the VETC, which expired on December 31, 2016 and may not be available in any subsequent period, and various government programs that make available grant funds for the purchase and construction of natural gas vehicles and stations. Additionally, our business is influenced by laws, rules and regulations that require reductions in carbon emissions and/or the use of renewable fuels, such as the California and Oregon Low Carbon Fuel Standards and the federal Renewable Fuel Standard Phase 2, under which we generate LCFS Credits and RIN Credits by selling CNG, LNG and RNG as a vehicle fuel.\nThese programs and regulations that have the effect of encouraging the use of CNG, LNG or RNG as a vehicle fuel are subject to change, and could expire or be repealed or amended for a variety of reasons. For example, parties with an interest in gasoline and diesel or other alternative fuels, such as electricity, hydrogen, renewable diesel, biodiesel or ethanol, many of whom have substantially greater resources and influence than we have, invest significant time and money in efforts to delay, repeal or otherwise negatively influence regulations and programs that promote natural gas as a vehicle fuel. Further, changes in federal, state or local political, social or economic conditions could result in the modification or repeal of these programs or regulations. For instance, the results of the recent U.S. presidential election have created increased uncertainty regarding the future of many of these programs and regulations. Any failure to adopt, delay in implementing, expiration, repeal or modification of these programs and regulations, or the adoption of any such programs and regulations that encourage the use of other alternative fuels or alternative vehicles over natural gas, could harm our operating results and financial condition.\nCompliance with greenhouse gas emissions regulations affecting our LNG plants, RNG production facilities, LNG and CNG fueling stations or CNG, LNG and RNG fuel sales may prove costly and negatively affect our financial performance.\nCalifornia has laws requiring statewide reductions of greenhouse gas emissions to 1990 levels by 2020, 40% below 1990 levels by 2030, and 80% below 1990 levels by 2050. As of January 1, 2015, California's AB 32 law began regulating the greenhouse gas emissions from transportation fuels, including the emissions associated with LNG and CNG vehicle fuel.\nUnder AB 32, the LNG vehicle fuel provider is the regulated party with respect to LNG vehicle fuel use. We will incur costs to comply with AB 32 based on how much LNG vehicle fuel we sell that is regulated, CARB's guidance on the regulation of LNG vehicle fuel, potential regulatory changes and the cost of carbon credits we purchase to comply with AB 32. We anticipate that we will pass the costs we incur to comply with this law through to our LNG customers. With respect to CNG, the regulated party under AB 32 is the utility that owns the pipe through which the fossil fuel natural gas is sold. We anticipate that, over time, as the utilities' compliance costs increase, we or, to the extent we pass these costs through to our customers, our CNG customers will be required to pay more for CNG vehicle fuel to cover the increased AB 32 compliance costs of the utility. The amount of these costs that we or our CNG customers will be required to pay will be determined by the amount the utility spends to buy any carbon credits needed to comply with AB 32 and the amount of natural gas we or our customers buy through a utility\u2019s pipeline. These increased costs of LNG and CNG vehicle fuel as a result of AB 32 may diminish the attractiveness of LNG and CNG as a vehicle fuel for existing and potential future California customers, which could reduce our customer base and fuel sales and cause our performance to suffer.\nAlthough our Redeem\u2122 RNG vehicle fuel may qualify for an exemption from AB 32 when sold as LNG or CNG, the availability of any such exemption is uncertain at this time due to the complexity of the requirements that must be met in order to qualify for such an exemption and the possibility of changes to the law. Any Redeem\u2122 volumes that are not exempt would incur compliance costs commensurate with sales of CNG and LNG derived from fossil fuel natural gas.\nThe federal and other state governments are also considering measures to regulate and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Any of these regulations, if and when implemented, may regulate the greenhouse gas emissions produced by or associated with our LNG production plants, our CNG and LNG fueling stations, our existing RNG production facilities (which we expect to sell on or before March 31, 2017, as describe under \"Business - Products, Services and Other Business Activities - RNG Production and sales\" above) or the CNG, LNG and RNG we sell, and could require us to obtain emissions credits or invest in costly emissions prevention technology. We cannot estimate the potential costs associated with compliance with potential federal, state or local regulation of greenhouse gas emissions and these unknown costs are not contemplated by our existing customer agreements or our budgets and cost estimates. If any of these regulations are implemented, any associated compliance costs that we are not able to pass through to our customers may have a negative impact on our financial performance, reduce our margins, impair our ability to fulfill customer contracts and reduce our cash available for other aspects of our business, including operating costs, investments and debt repayments. Further, these regulations and any increased customer costs may discourage consumers from adopting natural gas as a vehicle fuel.\nWe are subject to risks associated with station construction and similar activities, including difficulties identifying suitable station locations, zoning and permitting issues, local resistance, cost overruns, delays and other contingencies.\nIn connection with our station construction operations, we may not be able to identify suitable locations for the stations we or our customers seek to build. Even if preferred sites can be located, we may also encounter land use or zoning difficulties, challenges obtaining and retaining required permits or approvals or other local resistance that prohibit us or our customers from building new stations on these sites or limit or restrict the use of new or existing stations. Any such difficulties, resistance or limitations or any failure to comply with local permit, land use or zoning requirements could restrict our station construction activity or expose us to fines, reputational damage or other liabilities, which would harm our business and results of operations. In addition, we act as the general contractor and construction manager for station construction and facility modification projects and typically rely on licensed subcontractors to perform the construction work. We may be liable for any damage we or our subcontractors cause, or for injuries suffered by our employees or our subcontractors\u2019 employees, during the course of our projects. Shortages of skilled subcontractor labor for our projects could significantly delay a project or otherwise increase our costs. Our profit on our projects is based in part on assumptions about the cost of the projects and cost overruns, delays or other execution issues may, in the case of projects that we complete and sell to customers, result in our failure to achieve our expected margins or cover our costs, and in the case of projects that we build and own, result in our failure to achieve an acceptable rate of return.\nClean Energy Compression's manufacturing operations could subject us to significant costs and other risks, including product liability claims.\nOur subsidiary, Clean Energy Compression, designs, manufactures, sells and services non-lubricated natural gas fueling compressors and related equipment used in CNG stations. The equipment Clean Energy Compression produces and sells may fail to perform, as expected, or according to legal or contractual specifications. Additionally, Clean Energy Compression may incur\nsignificant and unexpected costs during or after the manufacture of its products, including costs incurred to repair product malfunctions. The scope and likelihood of these risks may increase if Clean Energy Compression makes efforts to expand its services to new geographic and other markets. Further, the success of our compressor business is dependent upon the success of the natural gas vehicle fuels market generally, and is thus subject to many of the other risks described in these risk factors. The occurrence of any of these risks may reduce sales of Clean Energy Compression's products and services and revenue to us from this business, damage our customer relationships and reputation, delay the launch of new Clean Energy Compression products and services, force product recalls and/or result in product liability claims.\nThe global scope of Clean Energy Compression's operations exposes us to additional risks and uncertainties.\nClean Energy Compression, which has operations in Canada, China, Colombia, Bangladesh and Peru, manufactures its natural gas compression equipment primarily in Canada and sells this equipment globally. The global scope of these operations exposes us to a number of risks and uncertainties that can arise from international trade transactions, local business practices and cultural considerations, including, among others:\n\u2022\nFailure to comply with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other applicable anti-bribery laws;\n\u2022\nPolitical unrest, terrorism, war, natural disasters and economic and financial instability;\n\u2022\nLow prices for locally produced oil, gasoline or diesel;\n\u2022\nChanges in environmental and other regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nUncertainty related to developing legal and regulatory systems and standards for economic and business activities, real property ownership and application of contract rights;\n\u2022\nTrade restrictions and import-export regulations, including uncertainty in the current political climate regarding existing and proposed trade agreements and the ability to import goods into the United States;\n\u2022\nDifficulties enforcing agreements and collecting receivables;\n\u2022\nDifficulties complying with the laws and regulations of multiple jurisdictions;\n\u2022\nDifficulties ensuring that health, safety, environmental and other working conditions are properly implemented and/or maintained by local offices;\n\u2022\nDiffering employment practices and/or labor issues, including wage inflation, labor unrest and unionization policies;\n\u2022\nLimited intellectual property protection;\n\u2022\nLonger payment cycles by international customers;\n\u2022\nInadequate local infrastructure and disruptions of service from utilities or telecommunications providers, including electricity shortages;\n\u2022\nDifficulties forecasting demand and sales trends in foreign markets;\n\u2022\nRisks associated with currency exchange and convertibility, including vulnerability to appreciation and depreciation of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar;\n\u2022\nUncertain repatriation of earnings as a result of economic, monetary and regulatory factors in some countries that affect our ability to convert funds to U.S. dollars or move funds from accounts in these countries; and\n\u2022\nPotentially adverse tax consequences.\nThese risks and uncertainties could limit our operations, increase our costs or expose us to fines or other legal sanctions or damages, any of which would negatively impact our business and financial condition.\nOur RNG business may not be successful.\nAs of the date of this report we own RNG production facilities located in Canton, Michigan and North Shelby, Tennessee. We have also sought to expand our RNG business by pursuing additional RNG production projects, either on our own or with project partners, including two new projects in development in Oklahoma and Georgia.\nThe RNG production business is subject to a number of risks, including risks related to developing and operating the projects and generating a financial return. Generally, projects that produce pipeline-quality RNG have often failed due to a variety of factors, including, among others, the volatile prices of conventional natural gas, technological difficulties associated with operating the production facilities, high costs of operating the production facilities and inabilities to obtain adequate financing to fund these costs; a general lack of government programs and regulations that support these activities, unpredictable RNG production levels , limited availability or unfavorable composition of collected landfill gas, failures to obtain and renew necessary permits, landfill mismanagement and plant shutdowns caused by upgrades, expansion or required maintenance. Additionally, we have experienced difficulties producing the expected volumes of RNG at our RNG plants in the past, due to, among other factors, problems with key equipment, severe weather, landfill conditions and construction delays. These difficulties may continue or worsen in the future at our plants or at the production facilities of third-party producers from which we purchase RNG.\nIn February 2017, we entered into an agreement to sell the assets related to our RNG production business, including our two existing RNG production facilities and our interest in the two new RNG production facilities in development. Following the completion of this sale and assuming that it occurs when and as planned, which we expect will be on or before March 31, 2017, we will continue to sell RNG for use as vehicle fuel.\nIn addition to RNG production, the success of our RNG business also depends on our ability to enter into RNG supply agreements with third parties and to either sell RNG at substantial premiums to conventional natural gas prices or to sell, at favorable prices, credits we may generate under federal or state laws, rules and regulations, including RINs and LCFS Credits. If we are not successful at one or more of these activities, our RNG business could fail and our performance and financial condition could be materially harmed.\nAlthough we expect to continue to generate RINs and LCFS Credits from our continued sales of RNG for use as vehicle fuel, we expect the amount of revenue we generate from such credits will decrease if our existing RNG production assets are sold as planned, which could adversely affect our results of operations, particularly in the near term. Further, the market for RINs and LCFS Credits is volatile, and the prices for these credits are subject to significant fluctuations. We have entered into futures contracts for the sale of fixed amounts of RINs over specified periods and at fixed prices, which we expect to sell in connection with the sale of our RNG production assets. These futures contracts subject us to risks based on fluctuations in the prevailing market price for RINs, since we could be forced to purchase RINs in the open market if we are not able to produce sufficient RINs through our operations to satisfy our obligations under these futures contracts. Additionally, the value of RINs and LCFS Credits may be adversely affected by any changes to federal and state programs under which these credits are generated and sold. For example, CARB recently raised the carbon intensity rating of the RNG we sell in California, which reduced the amount of LCFS Credits we generate and may adversely affect our RNG business and our financial results. Additionally, in the absence of federal and state programs that support premium prices for RNG or that allow us to generate and sell LCFS Credits and RINs or other credits, or if our customers are not otherwise willing to pay a premium for RNG, we may be unable to operate our RNG business profitably or at all.\nOur warranty reserves may not adequately cover our warranty obligations, which could result in unexpected costs.\nWe provide product warranties with varying terms and durations for natural gas compressors and stations we build and sell to customers, and we establish reserves for the estimated liability associated with these product warranties. Our warranty reserves are based on historical trends as well as our understanding of specifically identified warranty issues, and the amounts estimated for these reserves could differ materially from the warranty costs that may actually be realized. We would be adversely affected by an increase in the rate of warranty claims or the amounts involved with warranty claim or by the occurrence of unexpected warranty claims, any of which could increase our costs beyond our established reserves and cause our cash position and financial condition to suffer.\nIncreased global IT security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime could pose a risk to our systems, networks, products, solutions and services.\nIncreased global IT security threats and more sophisticated and targeted computer crime pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. Depending on their nature and scope, such threats could potentially lead to the compromise of confidential information, improper use of our systems and networks, manipulation and destruction of data and operational disruptions.\nWe have significant contracts with government entities that are subject to unique risks.\nWe have, and will continue to seek, long-term CNG, LNG and RNG station construction, maintenance and fuel sales contracts with various government bodies, which accounted for approximately 18%, 18% and 16% of our annual revenue in 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively. In addition to normal business risks, including the other risks discussed in these risk factors, our contracts with government entities are often subject to unique risks, some of which are beyond our control. Long-term government contracts and related orders are subject to cancellation if adequate appropriations for subsequent performance periods are not made. The termination of funding for a government program supporting any of our government contracts could result in a loss of anticipated future revenue attributable to that contract, which could have a negative impact on our operations. The current political climate, including uncertainties following the recent U.S. presidential election, may increase these risks.\nIn addition, government entities with which we contract are often able to modify, curtail or terminate contracts with us at their convenience and without prior notice and would only be required to pay for work completed and commitments made at the time of termination. Modification, curtailment or termination of significant government contracts could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Further, government contracts are frequently awarded only after competitive bidding processes, which are often protracted. In many cases, unsuccessful bidders for government contracts are provided the opportunity to formally protest certain contract awards through various agencies or other administrative and judicial channels. The protest process may substantially delay a successful bidder\u2019s contract performance, result in cancellation of the contract award entirely and distract management. As a result, we may not be awarded contracts for which we bid and substantial delays or cancellation of contracts may follow any successful bids as a result of these protests.\nOur operations entail inherent safety and environmental risks that may result in substantial liability to us.\nOur operations entail inherent risks, including equipment defects, malfunctions, failures, and misuses, which could result in uncontrollable flows of natural gas, fires, explosions and other damage. For example, operation of LNG pumps requires special training because of the extremely low temperatures of LNG. Also, LNG tanker trailers and CNG fuel tanks and trailers, if involved in accidents or improper maintenance or installation, may rupture and result in explosions, fires and other damage, including death or serious injury. Further, refueling of natural gas vehicles or operation of natural gas vehicle fueling stations could result in venting of methane gas, which is a potent greenhouse gas, and such methane emissions are regulated by some state regulatory agencies and may in the future be regulated by the EPA and/or by additional state regulators. These safety and environmental risks may expose us to liability for personal injury, wrongful death, property damage, pollution and other environmental damage. We may incur substantial liability and costs if damages are not covered by insurance or are in excess of policy limits or if environmental damage causes us to violate applicable greenhouse gas emissions or other environmental laws. Moreover, any of these occurrences could harm our reputation, our business and adoption levels of natural gas generally.\nNatural gas purchase commitments may exceed demand, causing our costs to increase.\nWe are a party to two long-term natural gas purchase agreements that have a take-or-pay commitment, and we may enter into additional similar contracts in the future. Take-or-pay commitments require us to pay for the natural gas that we have agreed to purchase irrespective of whether we can sell the gas. If the market for natural gas as a vehicle fuel declines or fails to develop as we anticipate, if we lose significant natural gas vehicle fueling customers, or if demand under any existing or any future sales contract does not maintain its volume levels or grow, these commitments may exceed our natural gas demand, which could cause our operating and supply costs to increase without a corresponding increase in revenue and our margins and performance may be negatively impacted.\nWe provide financing to fleet customers for natural gas vehicles, which exposes our business to credit risks.\nWe lend to certain qualifying customers a portion and occasionally up to 100% of the purchase price of natural gas vehicles they agree to purchase. Risks associated with these financing activities include, among others, that: the equipment financed consists mostly of vehicles, which are mobile and easily damaged, lost or stolen; and the borrower may default on payments, enter bankruptcy proceedings and/or liquidate. As of December 31, 2016, we had $9.1 million outstanding in loans provided to customers to finance natural gas vehicle purchases.\nOur business is subject to a variety of government regulations that may restrict our operations and result in costs and penalties.\nWe are subject to a variety of federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to the environment, health and safety, labor and employment, building codes and construction, zoning and land use, foreign business practices, public reporting and taxation, among others. Additionally, we are subject to changing and complex regulations related to the government procurement process and any political activities or lobbying relating to natural gas or greenhouse gas emissions regulations in which we may engage. It is difficult and costly to manage the requirements of every authority having jurisdiction over our various activities and to comply with their varying standards. These laws and regulations are complex, change frequently and in many cases have become\nmore stringent over time. Any changes to existing regulations or adoption of new regulations may result in significant additional expense to us and our customers. Further, from time to time, as part of the regular evaluation of our operations, including newly acquired or developing operations, we may be subject to compliance audits by regulatory authorities, which may distract management from our operations and involve significant costs and use of other resources. Also, in connection with our operations, we often need facility permits or licenses to address, among other things, storm water or wastewater discharges, waste handling and air emissions, which may subject us to onerous or costly permitting conditions or delays if permits cannot be timely obtained.\nOur failure to comply with any applicable laws and regulations may result in a variety of administrative, civil and criminal enforcement measures, including assessment of monetary penalties, imposition of corrective requirements, or prohibition from providing services to government entities.\nWe may from time to time pursue acquisitions, divestitures, investments or other strategic relationships or transactions, which could fail to meet expectations and harm our business.\nWe may acquire or invest in other companies or businesses or pursue other strategic transactions or relationships. Acquisitions, investments and other strategic transactions and relationships involve numerous risks, any of which could harm our business, including, among others:\n\u2022\nDifficulties integrating the technologies, operations, contracts, personnel and service providers of an acquired company or partner;\n\u2022\nDiversion of financial and management resources from existing operations or alternative acquisition, investment or other opportunities;\n\u2022\nFailure to realize the anticipated benefits or synergies of a transaction or relationship;\n\u2022\nFailure to identify all of the problems, liabilities, shortcomings or challenges of a company or technology we may partner with, invest in or acquire, including issues related to intellectual property rights, regulatory compliance practices, revenue recognition or other accounting practices or employee, customer or vendor relationships;\n\u2022\nRisks of entering new customer or geographic markets in which we may have limited or no experience;\n\u2022\nPotential loss of an acquired company's, business' or partners' key employees, customers and vendors in the event of an acquisition or investment, or potential loss of our assets, employees or customers in the event of a divestiture or other similar strategic transaction;\n\u2022\nInability to generate sufficient revenue to offset costs related to an acquisition, investment or other strategic transaction;\n\u2022\nAdditional costs or incurrence of debt or equity dilution associated with funding an acquisition, investment or other relationship; and\n\u2022\nPossible write-offs or impairment charges relating to the businesses we partner with, invest in or acquire.\nWe depend on key people to generate our strategies and operate our business, and our business could be harmed if we are unable to retain our key people.\nWe believe that our future success is dependent upon the contributions of our executive officers and directors and certain other key managerial, sales, technical and finance personnel. All of our executive officers and other United States employees may terminate their employment relationships with us at any time. Additionally, our directors may resign at any time or fail to be re-elected by our stockholders on an annual basis. In many cases, these individual\u2019s knowledge of our business and experience in our industry would be extremely difficult to replace. Additionally, qualified individuals are in high demand, and we may incur significant costs to attract and retain our key people. If we are unable to retain our executive officers and key directors and employees, or if such individuals leave our Company and we are unable to attract and successfully integrate quality replacements in a timely manner, our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.\nOur quarterly results of operations fluctuate significantly and are difficult to predict.\nOur quarterly results of operations, which are disclosed under \u201cQuarterly Results of Operations\u201d in Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data of this report, have historically experienced significant fluctuations and may continue to fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors, including the amount and timing of compressor and other equipment sales, station construction sales, sales of RINs and LCFS Credits and recognition of government credits, fluctuations in commodity\ncosts, natural gas prices and sale activity, and our billing, collections and liability payments, as well as the other factors described in these risk factors.\nAs a result of the significant fluctuations of our operating results in prior periods, period-to-period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful and investors in our common stock should not rely on the results of any one quarter as an indicator of future performance. For example, in the four quarterly periods in 2016, our results were positively affected by gains related to repurchases of our outstanding convertible debt, and such gains may not recur regularly, in the same amounts or at all in future periods. Additionally, if our quarterly results of operations fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, the price of our common stock could decline substantially.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nSales of shares could cause the market price of our stock to drop significantly, regardless of the state of our business.\nAs of December 31, 2016, there were 145,538,063 shares of our common stock outstanding, 11,467,796 shares underlying outstanding options, 2,072,304 shares underlying restricted stock units and 16,573,799 shares underlying outstanding convertible notes. All outstanding shares of our common stock are eligible for sale in the public market, subject in certain cases to the requirements of Rule 144 of the Securities Act. Also, shares issued upon exercise or conversion of outstanding options and convertible notes are eligible for sale in the public market to the extent permitted by the provisions of the applicable option and convertible note agreements and Rule 144, or if such shares have been registered under the Securities Act. If these shares are sold, or if it is perceived that they may be sold, in the public market, the trading price of our common stock could decline.\nAs of December 31, 2016, 12,969,485 shares of our common stock held by our co-founder and board member T. Boone Pickens were pledged as security for loans made to Mr. Pickens. We are not a party to these loans. If the price of our common stock declines, Mr. Pickens may be forced to provide additional collateral for the loans or to sell shares of our common stock in order to remain within the margin limitations imposed under the terms of the loans. Any sales of our common stock following a margin call that is not satisfied or any other large sales of our common stock by our officers and directors, such as Mr. Pickens' sale of 3,000,000 shares of our common stock in December 2016, may cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nA significant portion of our stock is beneficially owned by a single stockholder whose interests may differ from yours and who is able to exert significant influence over our corporate decisions, including a change of control.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our co-founder and board member T. Boone Pickens beneficially owned approximately 11.84% of our outstanding common stock (including 12,969,485 outstanding shares of common stock, 725,000 shares underlying options and 4,113,923 shares underlying convertible promissory notes). As a result, Mr. Pickens is able to influence or control matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and mergers, acquisitions or other extraordinary transactions. Mr. Pickens may have interests that differ from yours and may vote in ways with which you disagree and that may be adverse to your interests. This concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change of control of our Company, which could deprive our stockholders of an opportunity to receive a premium for their stock as part of a sale of our Company and affect the market price of our common stock. Conversely, this concentration may facilitate a change of control at a time when you and other investors may prefer not to sell.\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nThe market price of our common stock has experienced, and may continue to experience, significant volatility. Such volatility may be in response to factors that are beyond our control. In addition to the other factors discussed in these risk factors, factors that may cause volatility in our stock price include, among others:\n\u2022\nVolatility in the supply, demand, use and prices of crude oil, gasoline, diesel, natural gas and other alternative fuels, including renewable diesel, biodiesel, ethanol, electricity and hydrogen;\n\u2022\nThe market's perception of a need for alternative vehicle fuels generally;\n\u2022\nThe market's perception of the benefits of natural gas relative to gasoline and diesel and other alternative vehicle fuels, including with respect to factors such as cost savings, supply, environmental and safety benefits;\n\u2022\nExpected adoption of and growth in the market for natural gas as a vehicle fuel and our ability to capture a substantial share of and enhance our leadership position within this market, if and when it expands;\n\u2022\nDevelopment, commercial availability and adoption of natural gas vehicles, including for heavy-duty trucks and medium and light duty applications, and the factors that may impact these events, such as estimated incremental costs, annual fuel usage and annual fuel cost savings for vehicles using natural gas instead of gasoline or diesel;\n\u2022\nSuccessful implementation of our business plans;\n\u2022\nFailure to meet or exceed financial estimates and projections of the investment community, due to fluctuations in our operating results or other factors;\n\u2022\nIncreasing competition, as a significant number of established businesses, many of which have substantially greater financial, marketing and other resources than we have, have entered or are planning to enter the market for natural gas and other alternatives for use as vehicle fuels;\n\u2022\nOther competitive developments, including advances in conventional fuels and other alternative vehicle fuels and technologies, such as improvements in the efficiency, fuel economy or greenhouse gas emissions of engines for conventional and alternative vehicles;\n\u2022\nChanges to the availability or effect on our business of environmental, tax or other regulations, programs or incentives that promote natural gas as a vehicle fuel, including, among others, VETC and the programs under which we generate and sell LCFS Credits and RINs;\n\u2022\nAdoption of government policies favoring vehicle fuels other than natural gas, including gasoline and diesel fuel, or favoring alternative vehicles, including growing support for electric and hydrogen-powered vehicles;\n\u2022\nChanges to emissions requirements on gasoline and diesel powered vehicles, as well as on LNG, CNG and RNG production and LNG and CNG fueling stations and fuel sales, and the impact of environmental regulations and pressures on oil and natural gas supply;\n\u2022\nThe market's perception of the success and importance of acquisitions, divestitures, investments or other strategic relationships or transactions;\n\u2022\nChanges in general political, regulatory, economic and market conditions, including general uncertainty regarding the U.S. regulatory and economic environment as a result of the recent U.S. presidential election;\n\u2022\nChanges to our management, including executive officer or director departures or other changes;\n\u2022\nSales of our common stock by us or our officers, directors or significant stockholders; and\n\u2022\nA decline in the trading volume of our common stock.\nIn addition, the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies, which have affected the market prices of these companies\u2019 securities. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 92035, "SIC": 5500, "TIC": "CLNE"}
