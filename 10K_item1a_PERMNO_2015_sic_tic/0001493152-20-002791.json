RISK FACTORS.\nYou should carefully consider each of the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this annual report. The following risks relate principally to our business and our common stock. These risks and uncertainties are not the only ones facing our company. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business. If any of the risks and uncertainties develop into actual events, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline. please also see the section \u201cRegulations and Healthcare Reform\u201d above.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe are an early stage company with a short operating history and a relatively new business model in an emerging and rapidly evolving market, which makes it difficult to evaluate our future prospects. We are a pre-revenue, early stage entity subject to all of the risks inherent in a young business enterprise, such as, lack of market recognition and limited banking and financial relationships. We have little operating history to aid in our assessing future prospects. We will encounter risks and difficulties as an early stage company in a new and rapidly evolving market. We may not be able to successfully address these risks and difficulties, which could materially harm our business and operating results.\nWe have not yet generated any revenues. We have not generated any revenues since our inception in March 2019. There is no assurance that we will generate sufficient revenue or ever be profitable. If planned operating levels are changed, higher operating costs encountered, more time needed to implement our plan, or less funding is received, more funds than currently anticipated may be required. Additional difficulties may be encountered during our development. If additional capital is not available when required, if at all, or is not available on acceptable terms we may be forced to modify or abandon our business plans.\nWe have engaged in limited product development activities and our product development efforts may not result in commercial products. We intend to build out the technology platform necessary to execute our planned business strategy. Of course, there may be other factors that prevent us from marketing a product including, but not limited to, our limited cash resources. We cannot guarantee we will be able to produce commercially successful products. Further, our eventual operating results could be susceptible to varying interpretations by potential customers, or scientists, medical personnel, regulatory personnel, statisticians and others, which may delay, limit or prevent our executing our proposed business plan.\nOur business model is unproven with no assurance of any revenues or operating profits. Our current business model is unproven and the profit potential, if any, is unknown. We are subject to all the risks inherent in a new business model. There can be no assurance that our business model will prove successful or that we will achieve significant revenue or profitability.\nIf we fail to raise additional capital, our ability to implement our business plan and strategy could be compromised. We have limited capital resources and operations. To date, our operations primarily have been funded from capital contributions and loans from our sole officer and director. We may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Even if we obtain financing for our near-term operations and product development, we may require additional capital beyond the near term. If we are unable to raise capital when needed, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be materially adversely affected, and we could be forced to reduce or discontinue our operations.\nIf we issue additional shares of common stock, it would reduce our stockholders\u2019 percent of ownership and may dilute our share value. Our Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of 900 million shares of common stock. We have outstanding 5,762,735 shares of common stock. The future issuance of common stock to raise capital may result in substantial dilution in the percentage of our common stock held by our then existing stockholders. We may value any common stock issued in the future on an arbitrary basis. The issuance of common stock for future services or acquisitions or other corporate actions may have the effect of diluting the value of the shares held by our then existing stockholders, and might have an adverse effect on any trading market for our common stock.\nOur cloud based software platform under development is new and unproven. We are in the initial phase of developing a Cloud Based Software as a Medical Service (SaaMS) platform that is new and unproven that will focus on value-based healthcare, informatics and algorithmic personalized medicine including digital therapeutics, behavior based remote patient monitoring, chronic care and preventive medicine. The market for our solutions is relatively new and evaluating the size and scope of the market is subject to risks and uncertainties. Our future success will depend in large part on the growth of this market. Potential customers may not recognize the need for, or benefits of, our platform, which may prompt them to adopt alternative products and services to satisfy their healthcare requirements. Assessing the market for our solutions we are competing in, or planning to compete in, is particularly difficult due to a number of factors, including limited available information and rapid evolution of the market. If our market does not experience significant growth, or if demand for our platform does not occur, then our business, results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected.\nDependence on Key Existing and Future Personnel. Our success depends, to a large degree, upon the efforts and abilities of Troy Grogan, our sole officer and key consultants. The loss of the services of one or more of our key providers could have a material adverse effect on our operations. In addition, as our business model is implemented, we will need to recruit and retain additional management, key employees and consulting service providers in virtually all phases of our operations. Key employees and consultants will require a strong background in our industry. We cannot assure that we will be able to successfully attract and retain key personnel.\nOur sole officer and director is engaged in other business activities and has a conflict in determining how much time to devote to our affairs. His failure to devote sufficient time to our business cloud have a negative impact on our operations.\nOur sole executive officer and director is not required to, and will not, commit his full time to our affairs, which may result in a conflict of interest in allocating his time between our operations and the other businesses in which he is engaged. Our sole executive officer and director is engaged in several other business endeavors and is not obligated to contribute any specific number of hours to our affairs. His failure to devote time to our business could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry. We encounter competition from local, regional or national entities, some of which have superior resources or other competitive advantages. Intense competition may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Our competitors may be larger and more highly capitalized, with greater name recognition. We will compete with such companies on brand name, quality of services, level of expertise, advertising, product and service innovation and differentiation of product and services. As a result, our ability to secure significant market share may be impeded.\nWe face substantial competition, and others may discover, develop, acquire or commercialize competitive products before or more successfully than we do. We operate in a highly competitive environment. Our products compete with other products or treatments for diseases for which our products may be indicated. Other healthcare companies have greater clinical, research, regulatory and marketing resources than us. In addition, some of our competitors may have technical or competitive advantages for the development of technologies and processes. These resources may make it difficult for us to compete with them to successfully discover, develop and market new products.\nThe growth of our business relies, in part, on the growth and success of our clients. The utility of our products to our clients will be determined by their ability to incorporate them into their health care regimen and the acceptance of our products by their patients. The ability of our clients to incorporate our products into their practices is outside of our control. In addition, if the number of patients of one or more of our clients using our products were to be reduced, such decrease would lead to a decrease in our revenue.\nWe will conduct business in a heavily regulated industry and if we fail to comply with applicable laws and government regulations, we could incur penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations or experience adverse publicity, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The healthcare industry is heavily regulated and closely scrutinized by federal, state and local governments. Comprehensive statutes and regulations govern the products we offer and the manner in which we provide and bill for services and collect reimbursement from governmental programs and private payors, our contractual relationships with our providers, vendors and clients, our marketing activities and other aspects of our operations. Of particular importance are:\n\u25cf the federal physician self-referral law, commonly referred to as the Stark Law;\n\u25cf the federal Anti-Kickback Act;\n\u25cf the criminal healthcare fraud provisions of HIPAA;\n\u25cf the federal False Claims Act;\n\u25cf reassignment of payment rules that prohibit certain types of billing and collection;\n\u25cf similar state law provisions pertaining to anti-kickback, self-referral and false claims issues;\n\u25cf state laws that prohibit general business corporations, such as us, from practicing medicine;\n\u25cf laws that regulate debt collection practices as applied to our debt collection practices;\nBecause of the breadth of these laws, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. Achieving and sustaining compliance with these laws may prove costly. Failure to comply with these laws and other laws can result in civil and criminal penalties such as fines, damages, overpayment recoupment, loss of enrollment status and exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs. The risk of our being found in violation of these laws and regulations is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts, and their provisions are sometimes open to a variety of interpretations. Our failure to accurately anticipate the application of these laws and regulations to our business or any other failure to comply with regulatory requirements could create liability for us and negatively affect our business. Any action against us for violation of these laws or regulations, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses, divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business and result in adverse publicity. To enforce compliance with the federal laws, the U.S. Department of Justice and the OIG, have recently increased their scrutiny of healthcare providers. Dealing with investigations can be time- and resource-consuming and can divert management\u2019s attention from the business. Any such investigation or settlement could increase our costs or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business. In addition, because of the potential for large monetary exposure under the federal False Claims Act, which provides for treble damages and mandatory minimum penalties of $5,500 to$11,000 per false claim or statement, healthcare providers often resolve allegations without admissions of liability for significant and material amounts to avoid the uncertainty of treble damages that may be awarded in litigation proceedings. Such settlements often contain additional compliance and reporting requirements as part of a consent decree, settlement agreement or corporate integrity agreement. It is expected that the government will continue to devote substantial resources to investigating healthcare providers\u2019 compliance with the healthcare reimbursement rules and fraud and abuse laws. The laws, regulations and standards governing the provision of healthcare services may change significantly in the future. We cannot assure you that any new or changed healthcare laws, regulations or standards will not materially adversely affect our business. We cannot assure you that a review of our business by judicial, law enforcement, regulatory or accreditation authorities will not result in a determination that could adversely affect our operations.\nOur use and disclosure of personally identifiable information, including health information, is subject to federal and state privacy and security regulations, and our failure to comply with those regulations or to adequately secure the information we hold could result in significant liability or reputational harm and, in turn, a material adverse effect on our client base, membership base and revenue. Numerous state and federal laws and regulations govern the collection, dissemination, use, privacy, confidentiality, security, availability and integrity of personally identifiable information (PII), including protected health information (PHI). These laws and regulations include HIPAA. HIPAA establishes a set of basic national privacy and security standards for the protection of PHI, by health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and certain healthcare providers, referred to as covered entities, and the businesses with which such covered entities contract for services, which includes us. HIPAA requires healthcare providers like us to develop and maintain policies and procedures with respect to PHI that is used or disclosed, including the adoption of administrative, physical and technical safeguards to protect such information. HIPAA also implemented the use of standard transaction code sets and standard identifiers that covered entities must use when submitting or receiving certain electronic healthcare transactions, including activities associated with the billing and collection of healthcare claims. HIPAA imposes mandatory penalties for certain violations which can be significant. However, a single incident can result in violations of multiple standards. HIPAA also authorizes state attorneys general to file suit on behalf of their residents. Courts will be able to award damages, costs and attorneys\u2019 fees related to violations of HIPAA in such cases. The standards established in HIPAA have been used as the basis for duty of care in state civil suits such as those for negligence or recklessness in the misuse or breach of PHI. In addition, HIPAA mandates that the Secretary of Health and Human Services, or HHS conduct periodic compliance audits of HIPAA covered entities or business associates. It also tasks HHS with establishing a methodology whereby individuals who were the victims of breaches of unsecured PHI may receive a percentage of the Civil Monetary Penalty fine paid by the violator. HIPAA further requires that patients and, in some instances, HHS be notified of any unauthorized acquisition, access, use or disclosure of their unsecured PHI that compromises the privacy or security of such information, with certain exceptions related to unintentional or inadvertent use or disclosure by employees or authorized individuals. Numerous other federal and state laws protect the confidentiality, privacy, availability, integrity and security of personally identifiable information, or PII, including PHI. These laws in many cases are more restrictive than, and may not be preempted by, HIPAA and may be subject to varying interpretations by courts and government agencies, creating complex compliance issues for us and our clients potentially exposing us to additional expense, adverse publicity and liability. New health information standards could have a significant effect on the manner in which we must handle healthcare related data, and the cost of complying with standards could be significant. If we do not comply with existing or new laws and regulations related to PHI, we could be subject to criminal or civil sanctions. Because of the extreme sensitivity of the PII we store and transmit, the security features of our technology platform are very important. If our security measures, some of which are managed by third parties, are breached or fail, unauthorized persons may obtain access to sensitive client and patient data, including HIPAA-regulated PHI. As a result, our reputation could be severely damaged, adversely affecting client and patient confidence. Clients may curtail their use of or stop using our services or our client base could decrease, which would cause our business to suffer. In addition, we could face litigation, damages for contract breach, penalties and regulatory actions for violation of HIPAA and other applicable laws or regulations and significant costs for remediation, notification to individuals and for measures to prevent future occurrences. Any security breach could also result in increased costs associated with liability for stolen assets or information, repairing system damage that may have been caused by such breaches, incentives offered to clients or other business partners in an effort to maintain our business relationships after a breach and implementing measures to prevent future occurrences, including organizational changes, deploying additional personnel and protection technologies, training employees and engaging third-party experts and consultants. While we maintain insurance covering certain security and privacy damages and claim expenses, we may not carry insurance or maintain coverage sufficient to compensate for all liability and in any event, insurance coverage would not address the reputational damage that could result from a security incident. We outsource important aspects of the storage and transmission of client and patient information, and thus rely on third parties to manage functions that have material cyber-security risks. We attempt to address these risks by requiring outsourcing subcontractors who handle client and patient information to sign business associate agreements contractually requiring those subcontractors to adequately safeguard personal health data to the same extent that applies to us and in some cases by requiring such outsourcing subcontractors to undergo third-party security examinations. However, we cannot assure you that these contractual measures and other safeguards will adequately protect us from the risks associated with the storage and transmission of client and patient proprietary and protected health information. In addition, various states have enacted laws governing the privacy of personal information collected and used by businesses online. For example, California adopted the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018. This law, in part, requires that companies make certain disclosures to consumers via their privacy policies, or otherwise at the time personal data is collected. The Company will have to determine what personal data it is collecting from individuals and for what purposes, and to update its privacy policy every 12 months to make the required disclosures, among other things. Since this law is newly enacted and has not yet gone into effect, it is unclear whether it will have any material impact on the Company\u2019s business and operations.\nThe security of our platform, networks or computer systems may be breached, and any unauthorized access to our customer data will have an adverse effect on our business and reputation. The use of our products will involve the storage, transmission and processing of our clients\u2019 and their patients\u2019 private data, and this data may contain confidential and proprietary information of our clients and their patients\u2019 or other personal or identifying information regarding our clients, and their patients\u2019, their employees or other persons. Individuals or entities may attempt to penetrate our network or platform security, or that of our third-party hosting and storage providers, and could gain access to our clients\u2019 and their patients\u2019 private data, which could result in the destruction, disclosure or misappropriation of proprietary or confidential information of our clients\u2019 and their patients\u2019 or their customers, employees and business partners. If any of our clients\u2019 private data is leaked, obtained by others or destroyed without authorization, it could harm our reputation, we could be exposed to civil and criminal liability, and we may lose our ability to access private data, which will adversely affect the quality and performance of our platform. In addition, our platform may be subject to computer malware, viruses and computer hacking, fraudulent use attempts and phishing attacks, all of which have become more prevalent in our industry. Though it is difficult to determine what, if any, harm may directly result from any specific interruption or attack, they may include the theft or destruction of data owned by us or our customers, and/or damage to our platform. Any failure to maintain the performance, reliability, security and availability of our products or services and technical infrastructure to the satisfaction of our clients may harm our reputation and our ability to retain existing customers and attract new users. While we will implement procedures and safeguards that are designed to prevent security breaches and cyber-attacks, they may not be able to protect against all attempts to breach our systems, and we may not become aware in a timely manner of any such security breach. Unauthorized access to or security breaches of our platform, network or computer systems, or those of our technology service providers, could result in the loss of business, reputational damage, regulatory investigations and orders, litigation, indemnity obligations, damages for contract breach, civil and criminal penalties for violation of applicable laws, regulations or contractual obligations, and significant costs, fees and other monetary payments for remediation. If customers believe that our platform does not provide adequate security for the storage of sensitive information or its transmission over the Internet, our business will be harmed. Customers\u2019 concerns about security or privacy may deter them from using our platform for activities that involve personal or other sensitive information.\nTo the extent we use \u201copen source\u201d software, our use could adversely affect our ability to offer our services and subject us to possible litigation. We may use open source software in connection with our products and services. Companies that incorporate open source software into their products have, from time to time, faced claims challenging the use of open source software and/or compliance with open source license terms. As a result, we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software or claiming noncompliance with open source licensing terms. Some open source software licenses require users who distribute software containing open source software to publicly disclose all or part of the source code to such software and/or make available any derivative works of the open source code, which could include valuable proprietary code of the user, on unfavorable terms or at no cost. While we monitor the use of open source software and try to ensure that none is used in a manner that would require us to disclose our proprietary source code or that would otherwise breach the terms of an open source agreement, such use could inadvertently occur, in part because open source license terms are often ambiguous. Any requirement to disclose our proprietary source code or pay damages for breach of contract could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could help our competitors develop products and services that are similar to or better than ours.\nAssertions by third parties of infringement or other violations by us of their intellectual property rights could result in significant costs and harm our business and operating results. Our success depends upon our ability to refrain from infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others. Some companies, including some of our competitors, own large numbers of patents, copyrights and trademarks, which they may use to assert claims against us. As we grow and enter new markets, we will face a growing number of competitors. As the number of competitors in our industry grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps, we expect that software and other solutions in our industry may be subject to such claims by third parties. Third parties may in the future assert claims of infringement, misappropriation or other violations of intellectual property rights against us. We cannot assure you that infringement claims will not be asserted against us in the future, or that, if asserted, any infringement claim will be successfully defended. A successful claim against us could require that we pay substantial damages or ongoing royalty payments, prevent us from offering our services, or require that we comply with other unfavorable terms. We may also be obligated to indemnify our customers or business partners or pay substantial settlement costs, including royalty payments, in connection with any such claim or litigation and to obtain licenses, modify applications or refund fees, which could be costly. Even if we were to prevail in such a dispute, any litigation regarding our intellectual property could be costly and time-consuming and divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations.\nRisks Related to Regulation\nOur products may be subject to product liability legal claims, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Certain of our products provide applications that relate to patient clinical information. Any failure by our products to provide accurate and timely information concerning patients, their medication, treatment and health status, generally, could result in claims against us which could materially and adversely impact our financial performance, industry reputation and ability to market new system sales. In addition, a court or government agency may take the position that our delivery of health information directly, including through licensed practitioners, or delivery of information by a third party site that a consumer accesses through our websites, exposes us to assertions of malpractice, other personal injury liability, or other liability for wrongful delivery/handling of healthcare services or erroneous health information. We anticipate that in the future we will maintain insurance to protect against claims associated with the use of our products as well as liability limitation language in our end-user license agreements, but there can be no assurance that our insurance coverage or contractual language would adequately cover any claim asserted against us. A successful claim brought against us in excess of or outside of our insurance coverage could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Even unsuccessful claims could result in our expenditure of funds for litigation and management time and resources.\nCertain healthcare professionals who use our Cloud-based products will directly enter health information about their patients including information that constitutes a record under applicable law that we may store on our computer systems. Numerous federal and state laws and regulations, the common law and contractual obligations, govern collection, dissemination, use and confidentiality of patient-identifiable health information, including:\n\u25cf state and federal privacy and confidentiality laws;\n\u25cf contracts with clients and partners;\n\u25cf state laws regulating healthcare professionals;\n\u25cf Medicaid laws;\n\u25cf the HIPAA and related rules proposed by the Health Care Financing Administration; and\n\u25cf Health Care Financing Administration standards for Internet transmission of health data.\nAny failure by us or by our personnel or partners to comply with applicable requirements may result in a material liability to us. Although we have systems and policies in place for safeguarding Protected Health Information from unauthorized disclosure, these systems and policies may not preclude claims against us for alleged violations of applicable requirements. Also, third party sites and/or links that consumers may access through our web sites may not maintain adequate systems to safeguard this information or may circumvent systems and policies we have put in place. In addition, future laws or changes in current laws may necessitate costly adaptations to our policies, procedures, or systems. There can be no assurance that we will not be subject to product liability claims, that such claims will not result in liability in excess of our insurance coverage, that our insurance will cover such claims or that appropriate insurance will continue to be available to us in the future at commercially reasonable rates. Such product liability claims could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThere is significant uncertainty in the healthcare industry in which we operate, and we are subject to the possibility of changing government regulation, which may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. The healthcare industry is subject to changing political, economic and regulatory influences that may affect the procurement processes and operation of healthcare facilities. During the past several years, the healthcare industry has been subject to an increase in governmental regulation of, among other things, reimbursement rates and certain capital expenditures.\nRecently enacted public laws reforming the U.S. healthcare system may have an impact on our business. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (H.R. 3590; Public Law 111-148) (\u201cPPACA\u201d) and The Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (H.R. 4872) (the \u201cReconciliation Act\u201d), which amends the PPACA (collectively the \u201cHealth Reform Laws\u201d), were signed into law in March 2010. The Health Reform Laws contain various provisions which may impact us and our patients. Some of these provisions may have a positive impact, while others, such as reductions in reimbursement for certain types of providers, may have a negative impact due to fewer available resources. Increases in fraud and abuse penalties may also adversely affect participants in the health care sector, including us.\nVarious legislators have announced that they intend to examine further proposals to reform certain aspects of the U.S. healthcare system. Healthcare providers may react to these proposals, and the uncertainty surrounding such proposals, by curtailing or deferring investments, including those for our systems and related services. Cost-containment measures instituted by healthcare providers as a result of regulatory reform or otherwise could result in a reduction of the allocation of capital funds. Such a reduction could have an adverse effect on our ability to sell our systems and related services. On the other hand, changes in the regulatory environment have increased and may continue to increase the needs of healthcare organizations for cost-effective data management and thereby enhance the overall market for healthcare management information systems. We cannot predict what effect, if any, such proposals or healthcare reforms might have on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have taken steps to modify our products, services and internal practices as necessary to facilitate our compliance with applicable regulations, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so in a timely or complete manner. Achieving compliance with these regulations could be costly and distract management\u2019s attention and divert other company resources, and any noncompliance by us could result in civil and criminal penalties.\nDevelopments of additional federal and state regulations and policies have the potential to negatively affect our business.\nOur software is anticipated to be considered a medical device by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d) and therefore subject to regulation by the FDA as a medical device. Such regulation requires the registration of the applicable manufacturing facility and software and hardware products, application of detailed record-keeping and manufacturing standards, and FDA approval or clearance prior to marketing. An approval or clearance requirement could create delays in marketing, and the FDA could require supplemental filings or object to certain of these applications, the result of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCompliance with changing regulation of corporate governance and public disclosure will result in significant additional expenses. Changing laws, regulations, and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure for public companies, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and various rules and regulations adopted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \u201cSEC\u201d), are creating uncertainty for public companies. Our Company\u2019s management will need to invest significant time and financial resources to comply with both existing and evolving requirements for public companies, which will lead, among other things, to significantly increased general and administrative expenses and a certain diversion of management time and attention from revenue generating activities to compliance activities.\nWe may be subject to false or fraudulent claim laws. There are numerous federal and state laws that forbid submission of false information or the failure to disclose information in connection with submission and payment of physician claims for reimbursement. In some cases, these laws also forbid abuse of existing systems for such submission and payment. Any failure of our services to comply with these laws and regulations could result in substantial liability including, but not limited to, criminal liability, could adversely affect demand for our services and could force us to expend significant capital, research and development and other resources to address the failure. Errors by us or our systems with respect to entry, formatting, preparation or transmission of claim information may be determined or alleged to be in violation of these laws and regulations. Determination by a court or regulatory agency that our services violate these laws could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, invalidate all or portions of some of our client contracts, require us to change or terminate some portions of our business, require us to refund portions of our services fees, cause us to be disqualified from serving clients doing business with government payers and have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to the Stark Law, which may result in significant penalties. Provisions of the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1395nn) (the \u201cStark Law\u201d) prohibit referrals by a physician of \u201cdesignated health services\u201d which are payable, in whole or in part, by Medicare or Medicaid, to an entity in which the physician or the physician\u2019s immediate family member has an investment interest or other financial relationship, subject to several exceptions. Unlike the Fraud and Abuse Law, the Stark Law is a strict liability statute. Proof of intent to violate the Stark Law is not required. The Stark Law also prohibits billing for services rendered pursuant to a prohibited referral. Several states have enacted laws similar to the Stark Law. These state laws may cover all (not just Medicare and Medicaid) patients. Many federal healthcare reform proposals in the past few years have attempted to expand the Stark Law to cover all patients as well. As with the Fraud and Abuse Law, we consider the Stark Law in planning our products, marketing and other activities, and believe that our operations are in compliance with the Stark Law. If we violate the Stark Law, our financial results and operations could be adversely affected. Penalties for violations include denial of payment for the services, significant civil monetary penalties, and exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs.\nWe are Required to Comply with Medical Device Reporting (MDR) and We Must Report Certain Malfunctions, Deaths and Serious Injuries Associated with Our Medical Device Which Can Result In Voluntary Corrective Actions, Mandatory Recall or FDA Enforcement Actions. Under applicable FDA MDR regulations, medical device manufacturers are required to submit information to the FDA when they receive a report or become aware that a device has or may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or has or may have a malfunction that would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur.\nAll manufacturers placing medical devices on the market in the European Economic Area and the United States are legally bound to report any serious or potentially serious incidents involving devices they produce or sell to the regulatory agency, or Competent Authority, in whose jurisdiction the incident occurred.\nIf our products fail to comply with evolving government and industry standards and regulations, we may have difficulty selling our products. We may be subject to additional federal and state statutes and regulations in connection with offering services and products via the Internet. On an increasingly frequent basis, federal and state legislators are proposing laws and regulations that apply to Internet commerce and communications. Areas being affected by these regulations include user privacy, pricing, content, taxation, copyright protection, distribution, and quality of products and services. To the extent that our products and services are subject to these laws and regulations, the sale of our products and services could be harmed.\nRisks related to our Common Stock\nThere is not now, and there may never be, an active market for our common stock. Our common stock is listed on the OTC Pink level of the OTC Market under the symbol \u201cUSAQ,\u201d but there is no active trading market for our common stock. There can be no assurance that an active trading market for our securities will develop, or that if one develops, that it will be sustained. The trading market for securities of companies listed on the OTC Market is substantially less liquid than the average trading market for companies listed on a national securities exchange. In addition, our ability to raise capital will be adversely affected by a listing on the OTC Market, as compared to a listing on a national securities exchange.\nOur common stock is subject to the \u201cPenny Stock\u201d Rules of the SEC and the trading market in our securities is limited, which makes transactions in our stock cumbersome and may reduce the value of an investment in our stock. The SEC has adopted Rule 15g-9 which establishes the definition of a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d for the purposes relevant to us, as any equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share or with an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. For any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require: (a) that a broker or dealer approve a person\u2019s account for transactions in penny stocks; and (b) the broker or dealer receive from the investor a written agreement to the transaction, setting forth the identity and quantity of the penny stock to be purchased.\nIn order to approve a person\u2019s account for transactions in penny stocks, the broker or dealer must: (a) obtain financial information and investment experience and objectives of the person; and (b) make a reasonable determination that the transactions in penny stocks are suitable for that person and the person has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial matters to be capable of evaluating the risks of transactions in penny stocks.\nThe broker or dealer must also deliver, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prescribed by the Commission relating to the penny stock market, which, in highlight form: (a) sets forth the basis on which the broker or dealer made the suitability determination; and (b) that the broker or dealer received a signed, written agreement from the investor prior to the transaction. Generally, brokers may be less willing to execute transactions in securities subject to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules. This may make it more difficult for investors to dispose of our common shares and cause a decline in the market value of our stock.\nDisclosure also has to be made about the risks of investing in penny stocks in both public offerings and in secondary trading and about the commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and the rights and remedies available to an investor in cases of fraud in penny stock transactions. Finally, monthly statements have to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks.\nThe majority of our issued and outstanding capital stock is owned and controlled by our sole Director and Officer. Our sole director and officer currently owns the majority of our issued and outstanding capital stock, and therefore controls our operations and will have the ability to control all matters submitted to stockholders for approval.,\nThis stockholder thus has complete control over our management and affairs. Accordingly, his ownership may have the effect of impeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business consolidation, or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer for our common stock, which may further affect its liquidity.\nUnder our Certificate of Incorporation, our Board of Directors has the authority, without stockholder approval, to issue preferred stock with terms that may not be beneficial to common stockholders and with the ability to adversely affect stockholder voting power and perpetuate the board\u2019s control over our company. Our Board of Directors may authorize the issuance of preferred stock in one or more series with such limitations and restrictions as it may determine, in its sole discretion, with no further authorization by security holders required for the issuance of such shares. The Board may determine the specific terms of the preferred stock, including: designations; preferences; conversions rights; cumulative, relative; participating; and optional or other rights, including: voting rights; qualifications; limitations; or restrictions of the preferred stock.\nThe issuance of preferred stock may adversely affect the voting power and other rights of the holders of common stock. Preferred stock may be issued quickly with terms calculated to discourage, make more difficult, delay or prevent a change in control of our company or make removal of management more difficult. As a result, the Board of Directors\u2019 ability to issue preferred stock may discourage the potential hostile acquirer, possibly resulting in beneficial negotiations. Negotiating with an unfriendly acquirer may result in terms more favorable to us and our stockholders. Conversely, the issuance of preferred stock may adversely affect the market price of, and the voting and other rights of the holders of the common stock. We presently have no plans to issue any preferred stock.\nWe incur significant costs as a result of operating as a public company and our management will have to devote substantial time to public company compliance obligations. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as rules subsequently implemented by the SEC and the national stock exchanges, has imposed various requirements on public companies, including requiring changes in corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel will need to devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance requirements and any new requirements that the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 may impose on public companies. Moreover, these rules and regulations, along with compliance with accounting principles and regulatory interpretations of such principles, have increased and will continue to increase our legal, accounting and financial compliance costs and have made and will continue to make some activities more time- consuming and costly. For example, we expect these rules and regulations to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantial costs to maintain the same or similar coverage. These rules and regulations could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors or our board committees, or as executive officers. We will evaluate the need to hire additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting and financial knowledge. We estimate the additional costs to be incurred as a result of being a public company to be in excess of $100,000 annually.\nPart of the requirements imposed on us as a public company will be to document and test our internal control procedures in order to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, which requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting and a report by our independent registered public accounting firm addressing these assessments. The process of designing and implementing effective internal controls is a continuous effort that requires us to anticipate and react to changes in our business and the economic and regulatory environments and to expend significant resources to maintain a system of internal controls that is adequate to satisfy our reporting obligations as a public company.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and to effectively prevent fraud. We maintain a system of internal control over financial reporting, which is defined as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by our board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe cannot assure you that we will not, in the future, identify areas requiring improvement in our internal control over financial reporting. We cannot assure that the measures we will take to remediate any areas in need of improvement will be successful or that we will implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future as we continue our growth. If we are unable to maintain appropriate internal financial reporting controls and procedures, it could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, result in the restatement of our financial statements, harm our operating results, subject us to regulatory scrutiny and sanction, cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and have a negative effect on the market price for shares of our common stock.\nBecause we do not intend to pay any cash dividends on our common stock, our stockholders will not be able to receive a return on their shares unless they sell them. We have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock nor do we anticipate paying any in the foreseeable future. Furthermore, we expect to retain any future earnings to finance our operations and expansion. The payment of cash dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend upon our earnings levels, capital requirements, any restrictive loan covenants and other factors the Board considers relevant. Unless we pay dividends, our stockholders will not be able to receive a return on their shares unless they sell them. We cannot assure you that you will be able to sell shares when you desire to do so.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d and our election to comply with the reduced disclosure requirements as a public company may make our common stock less attractive to investors. For so long as we remain an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act, we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various requirements applicable to public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies,\u201d including not being required to comply with the independent auditor attestation requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, being required to provide fewer years of audited financial statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We would cease to be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d upon the earliest to occur of: (i) the last day of the fiscal year in which we have more than $1.07 billion in annual revenue; (ii) the date we qualify as a large accelerated filer, with at least $700 million of equity securities held by non-affiliates; (iii) the date on which we have, in any three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities; and (iv) the last day of the fiscal year ending five years after our initial public offering of our stock. We may choose to take advantage of some but not all of these reduced reporting burdens. Accordingly, the information contained in our periodic reports may be different than the information provided by other public companies. The JOBS Act also provides that an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d can take advantage of an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards. We have elected to take advantage of this extended transition period under the JOBS Act. As a result, our operating results and financial statements may not be comparable to the operating results and financial statements of other companies who have adopted the new or revised accounting standards. It is possible that some investors will find our common stock less attractive as a result, which may result in a less active trading market for our common stock and higher volatility in our stock price.", "PERMNO": 76295, "SIC": 2835, "TIC": "USAQ"}
