{"cik": "1606163", "company": "Limbach Holdings, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-05-12", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the following risk factors, together with all of the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks described below are those which we believe are the material risks that we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or which we currently consider immaterial may also have an adverse effect on us. Any risk described below may have a material adverse impact on Limbach's business or financial condition. Some statements in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including such statements in the following risk factors, constitute forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are based on Limbach management's current expectations, forecasts and assumptions, and involve a number of risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, forward-looking statements should not be relied upon as representing our views as of any subsequent date, and we do not undertake any obligation to update forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date they were made, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as may be required under applicable securities laws.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nIntense competition in our industry could reduce our market share and profit.\nThe markets we serve are highly fragmented and competitive. The commercial specialty contractor industry is characterized by numerous companies, many of which are small and whose activities are often geographically concentrated. We compete on the basis of our technical expertise and experience, financial and operational resources, industry reputation and dependability. While we believe our customers consider a number of these factors in awarding available contracts, a large portion of our work is awarded through a bid process. Consequently, price is often the principal factor in determining which contractor is selected, especially on smaller, less complex projects. As such, smaller competitors are sometimes able to win bids for such projects based on price alone due to their lower cost and financial return requirements. We expect competition in the commercial specialty contractor industry to remain intense for the foreseeable future, presenting us with significant challenges in our ability to maintain strong growth rates and acceptable profit margins. We also expect increased competition from in-house service providers as some of our customers have employees who perform service and maintenance work similar to the services we provide. Vertical consolidation is also expected to intensify competition in the industry. In addition, new and emerging technologies and services are expected to significantly impact the industry in coming years. If we are unable to meet these competitive challenges, we could lose market share to our competitors and experience an overall reduction in our profits. In addition, our profitability could be impaired if we have to reduce prices to remain competitive.\nIf we do not effectively manage the size and cost of our operations, our existing infrastructure may become either strained or overly-burdened, and we may be unable to increase revenue growth.\nThe growth we have experienced in the past, and that we may experience in the future, may provide challenges to our organization, requiring us to expand our personnel and operations. Future growth may strain our infrastructure, operations and other managerial and operating resources. We have also experienced severe constriction in the markets in which we operated in the past and, as a result, in our operating requirements. Failing to maintain the appropriate cost structure for a particular economic cycle may result in us incurring costs that affect our profitability. If our business resources become strained or overly-burdensome, our earnings may be adversely affected and we may be unable to increase revenue growth. Further, we may undertake contractual commitments that exceed our labor resources, which could also adversely affect our earnings and ability to increase revenue growth.\nOur dependence on a limited number of customers could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nDue to the size and nature of our regional construction contracts, one or a few customers have in the past, and may in the future, represent a substantial portion of our consolidated revenues and gross profits in any one year or over a period of several consecutive years. For example, the Company had a single Construction segment customer that accounted for approximately 10% of consolidated total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2019 and a single Construction segment customer that accounted for approximately 18% of consolidated total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2018. Similarly, our backlog frequently reflects multiple contracts for a limited number of customers; therefore, one customer may comprise a significant percentage of backlog at a certain point in time. The loss of business from any one of such customers could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. Also, a default or delay in payment on a significant scale by a customer may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur contract backlog is subject to unexpected adjustments and cancellations and could be an uncertain indicator of our future earnings.\nWe cannot guarantee that the revenues projected in our contract backlog will be realized or, if realized, will be profitable. Projects reflected in the contract backlog may be affected by project cancellations, scope adjustments, time extensions or other changes. Such changes may materially and adversely affect the revenue and profit we ultimately realize on these projects.\nBecause we bear the risk of cost overruns in most of our contracts, we may experience reduced profits or, in some cases, losses if costs increase above estimates.\nOur contract prices are established largely upon estimates and assumptions of our projected costs, including assumptions about: future economic conditions; prices, including commodities prices; availability of labor, including the costs of providing labor, equipment, and materials; and other factors outside our control. If our estimates or assumptions prove to be inaccurate, if circumstances change in a way that renders our assumptions and estimates inaccurate or we fail to successfully execute the work, cost overruns may occur and we could experience reduced profits or a loss for affected projects. For instance, unanticipated technical problems may arise; we could have difficulty obtaining permits or approvals; local laws, labor costs or labor conditions could change; bad weather could delay construction; prices of raw materials could increase; suppliers or subcontractors may fail to perform as expected; or site conditions may be different than expected. We are also exposed to increases in energy prices. Additionally, in certain circumstances, we guarantee project completion or the achievement of certain acceptance and performance testing levels by a scheduled date. Failure to meet schedule or performance requirements typically results in additional costs to us, and in some cases may also create liability for consequential and liquidated damages. Performance problems for existing and future projects could also cause our actual results of operations to differ materially from those anticipated and could damage our reputation within the industry and our customer base.\nIn addition, the costs incurred and gross profit realized on our contracts can vary, sometimes substantially, from our original projections due to a variety of factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\non-site conditions that differ from those described in the original bid or contract;\n\u2022\nfailure to include required materials, equipment, or work in a bid, or the failure to estimate properly the quantities or costs needed to complete a lump sum or guaranteed maximum price contract;\n\u2022\ncontract or project modifications creating unanticipated costs not covered by change orders;\n\u2022\nfailure by the customer, owner or general contractor to properly approve and authorize change orders for work that is required and as a result, the inability to bill and collect for the value of the work performed;\n\u2022\nfailure by suppliers, vendors, subcontractors, designers, engineers, consultants, joint venture partners or customers to perform their obligations;\n\u2022\ndelays in quickly identifying and taking measures to address issues which arise during contract execution;\n\u2022\nchanges in availability, proximity and costs of materials and equipment, including pipe, sheet metal, other construction materials and mechanical HVAC, electrical and plumbing equipment;\n\u2022\nclaims or demands from third parties for alleged damages arising from the design, construction or use and operation of a project of which our work is part;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in obtaining required governmental permits or approvals;\n\u2022\navailability and skill level of workers in the geographic location of a project;\n\u2022\ncitations issued by any governmental authority, including the Occupational Safety and Health Administration;\n\u2022\nunexpected labor conditions, shortages or work stoppages causing delays in completion, or acceleration of the contracted work to maintain milestone completion dates, which could cause losses due to not meeting estimated production targets;\n\u2022\ninstallation productivity rates different than the rate that was estimated;\n\u2022\nchanges in applicable tariffs, laws and regulations;\n\u2022\ndelays caused by weather conditions;\n\u2022\nfraud, theft or other improper activities by suppliers, vendors, subcontractors, designers, engineers, consultants, joint venture partners, customers or our own personnel; and\n\u2022\nmechanical or performance problems with equipment.\nMany of our customer contracts contain provisions that purport to shift some or all of the above risks from the customer to us, even in cases where the customer is partly at fault. We are not always able to shift this risk to subcontractors. Our experience has been that customers are willing to negotiate equitable adjustments in the contract compensation or completion time provisions if unexpected circumstances arise. However, customers may seek to impose contractual risk-shifting provisions more aggressively, which could increase risks and adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nTiming of the award and performance of new contracts could have an adverse effect on our operating results and cash flow.\nThe timing of project awards is unpredictable and outside of our control. Project awards often involve complex and lengthy negotiations and competitive bidding processes. These processes can be impacted by a wide variety of factors, including a customer\u2019s decision to not proceed with the development of a project, governmental approvals, financing contingencies, commodity prices, environmental conditions, and overall market and economic conditions. We may not win contracts that we have bid upon for any number of reasons, including price, a customer\u2019s perception of our ability to perform, a competitor\u2019s relationships and/or perceived technology advantages held by others. Many of our competitors may be more inclined to take greater or unusual risks or accept terms and conditions in a contract that we might not deem acceptable. Because a significant portion of our revenue is generated from large projects, our results of operations can fluctuate quarterly and annually depending on whether, and when, large project awards occur, as well as the commencement and progress of work under large contracts already awarded. As a result, we are subject to the risk of losing new awards to competitors or the risk that revenue may not be derived from awarded projects as quickly as anticipated.\nThe uncertainty of the timing of project awards may also present difficulties in matching the size of our work crews with project needs. In some cases, we may maintain and bear the cost of more ready work crews than are currently required in anticipation of future needs for existing contracts or expected future contracts. If a project is delayed or an expected project award is not received, we would incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on our anticipated profit.\nIn addition, the timing of the revenues, earnings and cash flows from our contracts in backlog could be delayed by a number of factors, including adverse weather conditions; other subcontractors delaying the progression of proceeding work; delays in receiving material and equipment from suppliers and services from subcontractors; and changes in the scope of work to be performed. Such delays, if they occur, could have material and adverse effects on our operating results for current and future periods until the affected contracts are completed.\nWe may incur significant costs in performing our work in excess of the original project scope and contract amount without having an approved change order.\nAfter the award of a contract, we may perform additional work that was not contemplated in our original contract price, at the request or direction of the customer, without the benefit of an approved change order. Our contracts generally afford the customer the right to order such changed or additional work, and typically require the customer to compensate us for the additional work. If we are unable to successfully negotiate a change order, or fail to obtain adequate compensation for these matters, we could be required to record in the current period an adjustment to revenue and profit recognized in prior periods. Such adjustments, if substantial, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur failure to adequately recover on claims brought by us against contractors, project owners or other project participants for additional contract costs could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition, liquidity and on our credit facilities.\nIn certain circumstances, we assert or have asserted claims against project contractors, owners, engineers, consultants, subcontractors or others involved in a project for additional costs exceeding the contract price or for amounts not included in the original contract price. These types of claims occur due to matters such as delays, inefficiencies or errors caused by others or changes from the initial project scope, all of which may result in additional costs. Often, these claims can be the subject of lengthy negotiations, arbitration or even litigation proceedings, and it is difficult to accurately predict when and on what terms these claims will be ultimately resolved.\nThe potential impact of recoveries for claims may be material in future periods when they, or a portion of them, become probable and estimable or are settled and therefore these claims have the ability to negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition. For example, we could have estimated and reported a profit on a contract over several periods and later determined, that all or a portion of such previously estimated and reported profits were overstated due to the results of the settlement of a claim. If this occurs, the full aggregate amount of the overstatement would be reported for the period in which such determination is made, thereby offsetting all or a portion of any profits from other contracts that would be reported in such period, or even resulting in a loss being reported for such period. On a historical basis and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America, the Company has used a detailed process in estimating and accounting for these claims and we believe that the Company has typically made reliable estimates of such claims. However, given the uncertainties associated with these types of claims, it is possible for actual recoveries to materially and adversely vary from estimates previously made, which may result in reductions or reversals of previously recorded revenue and profits. We could also recognize additional revenues and profits when the final settlements exceed our recorded estimates.\nIn addition, when these types of claims are made, we may use or have used working capital to cover cost overruns pending the resolution of the relevant claims and may incur additional costs when pursuing such potential recoveries. A failure to recover on these types of claims promptly and fully could have a negative impact on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. Moreover, given that our credit agreements have certain requirements and covenants related to minimum liquidity, our use of working capital to cover cost overruns related to pending claims may impact our ability to meet our credit agreement covenants or limit the use of our credit agreements. If we default under our credit agreements, it could result in, among other things, us no longer being entitled to borrow under one or more of the credit agreements, acceleration of the maturity of outstanding indebtedness under the agreements, foreclosure on collateral securing the obligations under the agreements or require us to enter into amendments and/or waivers to those credit agreements that may place additional requirements on us and that cost us additional amounts payable to our lenders.\nWe place significant decision making powers with our subsidiaries\u2019 management, which presents certain risks that may cause the operating results of individual branches to vary.\nWe operate from various locations across the United States, supported by corporate executives and services, with local branch management retaining responsibility for day-to-day operations and adherence to applicable laws. We believe that our practice of placing significant decision making powers with local management is important to our successful growth and allows us to be responsive to opportunities and to our customers\u2019 needs. However, this practice can make it difficult to coordinate procedures across our operations and presents certain risks, including the risk that we may be slower or less effective in our attempts to identify or react to problems affecting an important business issue than we would under a more centralized structure, or that we would be slower to identify a misalignment between a subsidiary\u2019s and our overall business strategy. If a subsidiary location fails to follow our compliance policies, we could be made party to a contract, arrangement or situation with exposure to large liabilities or that has less advantageous terms than is typically found across the markets in which we operate. Likewise, inconsistent implementation of corporate strategy and policies at the local level could materially and adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows and prospects.\nThe operating results of an individual location may differ from those of another location for a variety of reasons, including market size, local customer base, regional construction practices, competitive landscape, regulatory requirements, state and local laws and local economic conditions. As a result, certain of our locations may experience higher or lower levels of profitability and growth than other locations.\nDesign/Build contracts subject us to the risks of design errors and omissions.\nDesign/build projects provide the customer with a single point of responsibility for both design and construction. When we are awarded these projects, we typically perform the design and engineering work in-house. In the event that a design error or omission\nby us causes damage, there is risk that we, our subcontractors or the respective professional liability or errors and omissions insurance would not be able to absorb the liability. Any liability resulting from an asserted design defect with respect to our construction projects may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nIf we experience delays and/or defaults in customer payments, we could be unable to recover all expenditures.\nDue to the nature of our contracts, we sometimes commit resources to projects prior to receiving payments from the customer in amounts sufficient to cover expenditures on projects as they are incurred. Delays in customer payments may require us to make a working capital investment. If a customer defaults in making their payments on a project to which we have devoted resources, it could have a material negative effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nUnsatisfactory safety performance may subject us to penalties, affect customer relationships, result in higher operating costs, negatively impact employee morale and result in higher employee turnover.\nOur projects are conducted at a variety of sites including construction sites and industrial facilities. Each location is subject to numerous safety risks, including electrocutions, fires, explosions, mechanical failures, weather-related incidents, motor vehicle and transportation accidents and damage to equipment. In addition, the Company leases a sizeable fleet of vehicles operated by Company employees, and many of our employees operate their personal vehicles in the course and scope of their employment, traveling to and from the sites and our facilities. These hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life, severe damage to or destruction of property and equipment and other consequential damages, and could lead to suspension of operations, large damage claims and, in extreme cases, criminal liability. While we have taken what we believe are appropriate precautions to minimize safety risks, we have experienced serious accidents in the past and may experience additional accidents in the future. Serious accidents may subject us to penalties, civil litigation or criminal prosecution. Claims for damages to persons, including claims for bodily injury or loss of life, could result in significant costs and liabilities, which could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, like other companies in our industry, we track our injury history in the form of an Experience Modification Rate (\u201cEMR\u201d). In the event that the EMR associated with certain of our operating units exceeds the minimum threshold set by customers, we may be unable to pursue certain projects. Poor safety performance could also jeopardize our relationships with our customers and harm our reputation.\nOur inability to properly utilize our workforce could have a negative impact on our profitability.\nThe extent to which we utilize our workforce affects our profitability. Underutilizing our workforce could result in lower gross margins and, consequently, a decrease in our short-term profitability. On the other hand, overutilization of our workforce could negatively impact safety, employee satisfaction, and project execution, leading to a potential decline in future project awards. The utilization of our workforce is impacted by numerous factors, including:\n\u2022\nour estimates of headcount requirements and our ability to manage attrition;\n\u2022\nefficiency in scheduling projects and our ability to minimize downtime between project assignments;\n\u2022\nproductivity;\n\u2022\nlabor disputes; and\n\u2022\navailability of skilled labor at any given time.\nOur business has union and open shop operations, subjecting the business to risk for labor disputes.\nWe have separate subsidiary employers that have union and non-union operations. There is a risk that our corporate structure and operations in this regard could be challenged by one or more of the unions to which the employees belong. An adverse claim or judgment resulting from such a challenge could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nStrikes or work stoppages could have a negative impact on our operations and results.\nWe are party to collective bargaining agreements covering a majority of our craft workforce. Although strikes, work stoppages and other labor disputes have not had a significant impact on our operations or results in the recent past, any such labor actions, or our inability to renew the collective bargaining agreements, could materially and adversely impact our financial position, results of operations and cash flows if they occur in the future.\nOur success depends upon the continuing contributions of certain key personnel, each of whom would be difficult to replace. If we lose the benefit of the experience, efforts and abilities of one or more of these individuals, our operating results could suffer.\nOur continuing success depends on the performance of our management team. We rely on the experience, efforts and abilities of these individuals, each of whom would be difficult to replace. We cannot guarantee the continued employment of any of our key executives who may choose to leave the company for any number of reasons, such as other business opportunities, differing views on strategic direction, etc. If we lose members of our management team, our business, financial position, results of operations, cash flows, and customer base, as well as the market price of our common stock, could be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain qualified managers, employees, joint venture partners, subcontractors and suppliers, we will be unable to operate efficiently, which could reduce our profitability.\nOur business is labor intensive, and many of our operations experience a high rate of employment turnover. It is often difficult to find qualified personnel in certain geographic areas where we operate. Additionally, our business is managed by a small number of key executive and operational officers. Generally, the industry is facing a shortage of trained, skilled, and qualified management, operational, and field personnel. We may be unable to hire and retain the skilled labor force necessary to operate efficiently and to support our growth strategy or to execute our work in backlog. Changes in general or local economic conditions and the resulting impact on the labor market and on our joint venture partners, subcontractors and suppliers, may make it difficult to attract or retain qualified individuals in the geographic areas where we perform our work. Our labor expenses may increase as a result of a shortage in the supply of skilled personnel. Labor shortages, increased labor costs or the loss of key personnel could reduce our profitability and negatively impact our business. Further, our relationship with some customers could suffer if we are unable to retain the employees with whom those customers primarily work and have established relationships.\nMisconduct by our employees, subcontractors or partners, or our overall failure to comply with laws or regulations could harm our reputation, damage our relationships with customers, reduce our revenue and profits, and subject us to criminal and civil enforcement actions.\nMisconduct, fraud, non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations, or other improper activities by one or more of our employees, subcontractors, suppliers or partners could have a significant negative impact on our business and reputation. Examples of such misconduct include employee or subcontractor theft, the failure to comply with safety standards, state-specific laws related to automobile operations (including mobile phone usage), customer requirements, environmental laws, DBE regulatory compliance, and any other applicable laws or regulations. While we take precautions to prevent and detect these activities, such precautions may not be effective and are subject to inherent limitations, including human error and fraud. Our failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations or acts of misconduct could subject us to fines and penalties, harm our reputation, damage relationships with customers, reduce our revenue and profits, and subject us to criminal and civil enforcement actions.\nOur dependence on subcontractors and suppliers of equipment and materials could increase our costs and impair our ability to complete contracts on a timely basis or at all, which would adversely affect our profits and cash flow.\nWe rely heavily on third-party subcontractors to perform some, and often a majority, of the work on many of our contracts. We also rely almost exclusively on third-party suppliers to provide the equipment and materials (including pipe, sheet metal and control systems) for our contracts. If we are unable to retain qualified subcontractors or suppliers, or if our subcontractors or suppliers do not perform as anticipated for any reason, our execution and profitability could be harmed. By contract, we remain liable to our customers for the performance or failures of our subcontractors and suppliers.\nWe generally do not bid on projects unless we have commitments from suppliers for the materials and equipment and from subcontractors for the services required to complete the projects at prices that have been included in the bid. Thus, to the extent that we cannot obtain commitments from our suppliers for materials and equipment, and from subcontractors for services needed, our ability to bid for contracts may be impaired. In addition, if a supplier or subcontractor is unable to deliver materials, equipment or services according to the negotiated terms of a supply/services agreement for any reason, including the deterioration of our financial condition, we may suffer delays and be required to purchase the materials, equipment and services from another source at a higher price or incur other unanticipated costs. This may reduce the profit to be realized, or result in a loss, on a contract.\nPrice increases in materials could affect our profitability.\nWe purchase materials, including sheet metal, steel and copper piping, electrical conduit, wire and other various materials from numerous sources. We also purchase equipment from various manufacturers. The prices we pay for these materials and equipment may be impacted by transportation costs, government regulations, import duties and tariffs, changes in currency exchange rates, general economic conditions and other circumstances beyond our control. Although we may attempt to pass on certain of these\nincreased costs to our customers, we may not be able to pass all of these cost increases on to our customers. As a result, our margins may be adversely impacted by such cost increases.\nWe may be unable to identify and contract with qualified Disadvantaged Business Enterprise (\u201cDBE\u201d) contractors to perform as subcontractors.\nCertain of our projects include contract clauses requiring DBE participation. The participation clauses may be in the form of a goal or in the form of a minimum amount of work that must be subcontracted to a DBE firm. If we fail to complete these projects with the minimum DBE participation, we may be held responsible for breach of contract, which may include restrictions on our ability to bid on future projects, as well as monetary damages. To the extent we are responsible for monetary damages, the total costs of the project could exceed the original estimates, we could experience reduced profits or a loss for that project, and there could be a material adverse impact to our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity. Further, if we contract with a DBE contractor that is not properly qualified to perform a commercially useful function, we could be held responsible for violation of federal, state or local laws related to DBE contracting.\nOur participation in construction joint ventures exposes us to liability and/or harm to our reputation for failures of our partners.\nAs part of our business, we are a party to special purpose, project specific joint venture arrangements, pursuant to which we typically jointly bid on and execute particular projects with other companies in the construction industry. Success on these joint projects depends upon the various risks discussed elsewhere in this section and on whether our joint venture partners satisfy their contractual obligations.\nWe and our joint venture partners are generally jointly and severally liable for all liabilities and obligations of the joint ventures. If a joint venture partner fails to perform or is financially unable to bear its portion of required capital contributions or other obligations, including liabilities stemming from lawsuits, we could be required to make additional investments, provide additional services or pay more than our proportionate share of a liability to make up for our partner\u2019s shortfall. Furthermore, if we are unable to adequately address our partner\u2019s performance issues, the customer may terminate the project, which could result in legal liability to us, harm to our reputation and reduction to our profit on a project. We may be the controlling member of a joint venture; however, to the extent we are not controlling, we may have limited control over certain of the decisions made by the controlling member with respect to the work being performed by the joint venture. The other member(s) may not be subject to the same compliance and regulatory requirements. While we have processes and controls intended to mitigate risks associated with our joint ventures, to the extent the controlling member makes decisions that negatively impact the joint venture it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flow and profits.\nA significant portion of our business depends on our ability to provide surety bonds. Any difficulties in the financial and surety markets may cause a material adverse effect on our bonding capacity and availability.\nIn the past we have expanded, and it is possible we will continue to expand, the number and percentage of total contract dollars that require an underlying construction surety bond (bid, payment, and performance bonds). Historically, surety market conditions have experienced times of difficulty as a result of significant losses incurred by surety companies and the results of macroeconomic trends outside of our control. Consequently, during times when less overall bonding capacity is available in the market, surety terms have become more expensive and more restrictive. We cannot guarantee our ability to maintain a sufficient level of bonding capacity in the future, which could preclude our ability to bid for certain contracts or successfully contract with some customers. Additionally, even if we continue to be able to access bonding capacity to sufficiently bond future work, we may be required to post collateral to secure bonds, which would decrease the liquidity we would have available for other purposes. Our surety providers are under no commitment to guarantee our access to new bonds in the future; thus, our ability to access or increase bonding capacity is at the sole discretion of our surety providers. If our surety companies were to limit or eliminate our access to bonds, the alternatives would include seeking bonding capacity from other surety companies, increasing business with clients that do not require bonds and posting other forms of collateral for project performance, such as letters of credit or cash. We may be unable to secure these alternatives in a timely manner, on acceptable terms, or at all. As such, if we were to experience an interruption or reduction in the availability of bonding capacity, it is likely we would be unable to compete for or work on certain projects.\nOur insurance policies against many potential liabilities require high deductibles. Additionally, difficulties in the insurance markets may adversely affect our ability to obtain necessary insurance.\nAlthough we maintain insurance policies with respect to certain of our related exposures, these policies are subject to high deductibles; as such, we are, in effect, self-insured for substantially all of our typical claims. Our estimates of liabilities for unpaid claims and associated expenses and the appropriateness of the estimated liability are reviewed and updated quarterly. However, insurance liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to the many relevant factors, the effects of which are often unknown, including the severity of an injury, the determination of our liability in proportion to other parties, the number of incidents that\nhave occurred but are not reported, and the effectiveness of our safety program. Our accruals are based on known facts, historical trends (both internal trends and industry averages) and our reasonable estimate of our future expenses. We believe our accruals are adequate. However, our risk management strategies and techniques may not be fully effective in mitigating the risk exposure in all market environments or against all types of risk. If any of the variety of instruments, processes or strategies we use to manage our exposure to various types of risk are not effective, we may incur losses that are not covered by our insurance policies (including potential punitive damages awards) or that exceed our accruals or coverage limits.\nAdditionally, it is possible that insurance markets will become more expensive and restrictive. Also, our prior casualty loss history might adversely affect our ability to procure insurance within commercially reasonable ranges. As such, we may not be able to maintain commercially reasonable levels of insurance coverage in the future, which could preclude our ability to work on many projects. Our insurance providers are under no commitment to renew our existing insurance policies in the future; therefore, our ability to obtain necessary levels or kinds of insurance coverage are subject to market forces outside our control. If we are unable to obtain necessary levels of insurance, we likely would be unable to compete for or work on most projects.\nOur use of the cost-to-cost method of accounting could result in a reduction or reversal of previously recorded revenue or profits.\nA material portion of our revenue is recognized using the cost-to-cost method of accounting, which results in recognizing contract revenue and earnings ratably over the contract term in the proportion that our actual costs bear to our estimated contract costs. The earnings or losses recognized on individual contracts are based on estimates of contract revenue, costs and profitability. We review our estimates of contract revenue, costs and profitability on an ongoing basis. Prior to contract completion, we may adjust our estimates on one or more occasions as a result of change orders to the original contract, collection disputes with the customer on amounts invoiced, or claims against the customer for increased costs incurred due to customer-induced delays and other factors. Contract losses are recognized in the fiscal period in which the loss is determined. Contract profit estimates are also adjusted in the fiscal period in which it is determined that an adjustment is required. As a result of the requirements of the cost-to-cost method of accounting, the possibility exists, for example, that we could have estimated and reported a profit on a contract over several periods and later determined, usually near contract completion, that all or a portion of such previously estimated and reported profits were overstated. If this occurs, the full aggregate amount of the overstatement will be reported for the period in which such determination is made, thereby offsetting all or a portion of any profits from other contracts that would be reported in such period, or even resulting in a loss being reported for such period. On a historical basis, in most branches, we believe that the Company has typically made reasonably reliable estimates of the progress towards completion on our long-term contracts. However, given the uncertainties associated with these types of contracts, it is possible for actual costs to materially and adversely vary from estimates previously made, which may result in reductions or reversals of previously recorded revenue and profits.\nEarnings for future periods may be impacted by impairment charges for goodwill and intangible assets.\nWe carry a significant amount of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheets. Goodwill is the excess of purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets of acquired businesses. We assess goodwill for impairment each year, and more frequently if circumstances suggest an impairment may have occurred. We may determine in the future that a significant impairment has occurred in the value of our unamortized intangible assets or fixed assets, which could require us to write off a portion of our assets and could adversely affect our financial condition or reported results of operations.\nContractual warranty obligations could adversely affect our profits and cash flow.\nWe often warrant the services provided, typically as a function of contract, guaranteeing the work performed against defects in workmanship and the material we supply. If warranty claims occur, we could be required to repair or replace warrantied work in place at our cost. In addition, our customers may elect to repair or replace the warrantied item by using the services of another provider and require us to pay for the cost of the repair or replacement. Costs incurred as a result of warranty claims could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nRecent and potential changes in U.S. trade policies and retaliatory responses from other countries may significantly increase the costs or limit supplies of raw materials and products used in our operations.\nThe U.S. federal government has recently imposed new or increased tariffs or duties on an array of imported materials and goods that are used in connection with our operations. Foreign governments and trading blocs have responded by imposing or increasing tariffs, duties and/or trade restrictions on U.S. goods, and are reportedly considering other measures. These trade conflicts and related escalating governmental actions that result in additional tariffs, duties and/or trade restrictions could increase our operating costs, cause disruptions or shortages in our supply chains and/or negatively impact the U.S., regional or local economies in which we operate, and, individually or in the aggregate, materially and adversely affect our business and our consolidated financial statements.\nRising inflation and/or interest rates, or deterioration of the United States economy could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEconomic factors, including inflation and fluctuations in interest rates, recession and fears of recession could have a negative impact on our business. If our costs were to become subject to significant inflationary pressures, we may not be able to fully offset such higher costs through price increases. To the extent that Congress is unable to lower United States debt substantially, a decrease in federal spending could result, which could negatively impact the ability of government agencies to fund existing or new infrastructure projects. In addition, such actions could have a material adverse effect on the financial markets and economic conditions in the United States and throughout the world, which may limit our ability and the ability of our customers to obtain financing and/or could impair our ability to execute our acquisition strategy. These and related economic factors could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nBorrowings under our Refinancing Agreements (as defined below) are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness will increase even though any amount borrowed remains the same, and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, will correspondingly decrease. As of the December 31, 2019, we had $14.0 million of available borrowing capacity (with zero drawn) under the 2019 Revolving Credit Facility (as defined below), $41.0 million outstanding under the 2019 Refinancing Term Loan (as defined below) and $25.0 million available under the 2019 Delayed Draw Term Loan (as defined below). In addition, we may determine to enter into interest rate swaps that involve the exchange of variable for fixed rate interest payments in order to reduce interest rate volatility. However, we may not maintain interest rate swaps with respect to all of our variable rate indebtedness, and any swaps we enter into may not fully mitigate our interest rate risk and could be subject to credit risk themselves.\nFailure to remain in compliance with covenants under our debt and credit agreements or service our indebtedness could adversely impact our business.\nOur Refinancing Agreements and other debt obligations include certain debt covenants, some of which are financial in nature, are further described in \u201cItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our failure to comply with any of these covenants, or to pay principal, interest or other amounts when due thereunder, would constitute an event of default under the applicable agreements. Under certain circumstances, the occurrence of an event of default under one of these agreements (or the acceleration of the maturity of the indebtedness under one of these agreements) may constitute an event of default under one or more of our other debt or surety agreements. Default under our debt agreements could result in, among other things, us no longer being entitled to borrow under one or more of the agreements, acceleration of the maturity of outstanding indebtedness under the agreements, and/or foreclosure on any collateral securing the obligations under the agreements. If we are unable to service our debt obligations, or if we are unable to comply with our financial or other debt covenants, and our indebtedness would become immediately due and payable, and we could be forced to curtail our operations, reorganize our capital structure (including through bankruptcy proceedings), or liquidate some or all of our assets in a manner that could cause holders of our securities to experience a partial or total loss of their investment.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to meet all of our existing or potential future debt service obligations.\nOur ability to meet all of our existing or potential future debt service obligations (including those under our Refinancing Agreements, pursuant to which we may incur significant indebtedness), to refinance our existing or potential future indebtedness, and to fund our operations, working capital, acquisitions, capital expenditures, and other important business uses, depends on our ability to generate sufficient cash flow in the future. Our future cash flow is subject to, among other factors, general economic, industry, financial, competitive, operating, legislative and regulatory conditions, many of which are beyond our control.\nWe cannot assure that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future sources of cash will be available to us on favorable terms, or at all, in amounts sufficient to enable us to meet all of our existing or potential future debt service obligations, or to fund our other important business uses or liquidity needs. Furthermore, if we incur additional indebtedness in connection with future acquisitions or for any other purpose, our existing or potential future debt service obligations could increase significantly and our ability to meet those obligations could depend, in large part, on the returns from such acquisitions or projects, as to which no assurance can be given.\nFurthermore, our obligations under the terms of our borrowings could impact us negatively. For example, such obligations could:\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes;\n\u2022\nrestrict us from making strategic acquisitions or cause us to make non-strategic divestitures;\n\u2022\nincrease our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions; and\n\u2022\nrequire a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our borrowings, thereby reducing our ability to use cash flow to fund our operations, capital expenditures and future business opportunities.\nWe may also refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness at or prior to the scheduled maturity. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness or obtain additional financing will depend on, among other things, (i) our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations, and then-current market conditions; and (ii) restrictions in the agreements governing our indebtedness. As a result, we may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness or obtain additional financing on favorable terms, or at all.\nIf we do not generate sufficient cash flow from operations and additional borrowings or refinancings are not available to us, we may be unable to meet all of our existing or potential future debt service obligations. As a result, we would be forced to take other actions to meet those obligations, such as raising equity or delaying capital expenditures, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company. Furthermore, we cannot assure that we will be able to effect any of these actions on favorable terms, or at all.\nOur obligation to contribute to multiemployer pension plans could give rise to significant expenses and liabilities in the future.\nWe contribute to approximately 40 multiemployer pension plans in the United States under collective bargaining agreements that generally provide pension benefits to employees covered by these agreements. Approximately 50% of our current employees are members of collective bargaining units. Our contributions to these plans were approximately $44.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2019 and $43.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. The costs of providing benefits through such plans have increased in recent years. The amount of any increase or decrease in our required contributions to these multiemployer pension plans will depend upon many factors, including the outcome of collective bargaining, actions taken by trustees who manage the plans, government regulations, the actual return on assets held in the plans and the potential payment of a withdrawal liability. Based upon the information available to us from the multiemployer pension plans\u2019 administrators, we believe that some of these multiemployer pension plans are underfunded. The unfunded liabilities of these plans may result in required increased future payments by us and the other participating employers. Underfunded multiemployer pension plans may impose a surcharge requiring additional pension contributions. Our risk of such increased payments may be greater if any of the participating employers in these underfunded plans withdraws from the plan and is not able to contribute an amount sufficient to fund the unfunded liabilities associated with its participants in the plan.\nWith limited exception, an employer who is obligated under a collective bargaining agreement to contribute to a multiemployer pension plan is liable, upon termination of such contribution obligation to the plan or withdrawal from a plan, for its proportionate share of the plan\u2019s unfunded vested pension liabilities. In the event that we withdraw from participation in a plan, applicable law could require us to make withdrawal liability contributions to such plan, and we would have to reflect that liability and the related expense in our consolidated financial statements. Our withdrawal liability payable to an individual multiemployer pension plan would depend on the extent of the plan\u2019s funding of vested benefits. While we currently have no intention of withdrawing from a plan, and underfunded plan obligations have not affected our operations in the past, there can be no assurance that we will not be required to make material cash contributions to one or more of these plans in the future. If the multiemployer pension plans in which we participate have significant underfunded liabilities, such underfunding could increase the size of our potential withdrawal liability. No liability for underfunding of multiemployer pension plans was recorded in our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2019 or 2018.\nFailure or circumvention of our disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls over financial reporting could seriously harm our financial condition, results of operations, and business.\nWe plan to continue to maintain and strengthen internal controls and procedures to enhance the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and internal controls over financial reporting. Any system of controls, however well designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure of our disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls over financial reporting could harm our financial condition and results of operations. Though we are required to disclose changes made in our internal controls and procedures on a quarterly basis, and have made annual assessments of our internal control over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, due to our status as an emerging growth company prior to fiscal year 2020, our independent registered public accounting firm has not historically been required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\nOur management has concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting are effective. However, if we are unable to establish and maintain effective disclosure controls and internal control over financial reporting or have material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis could be impaired, and the market price of our securities may be negatively affected.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. In connection with our 2018 audit, our management conducted an assessment of our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting and determined that, as of December 31, 2018, we had the following material weakness:\n\u2022\nOur controls related to monthly project reviews and the review of our work-in-process schedule did not operate effectively for the year ended December 31, 2018. Specifically, in certain limited instances, management determined that monthly project reviews were ineffective in properly identifying project claim and pending change order (\u201cPCO\u201d) situations, thereby resulting in improper and untimely accounting for these issues. In those instances, our primary controls did not operate at a precision level sufficient to detect errors in project accounting.\nSee Part II, Item 9A Controls and Procedures for further discussion.\nDuring 2019 we remediated this material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting. However, if we were unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, or if we identify additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, our management would be unable to assert in future reports that our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal control over financial reporting are effective. This could cause investors, counterparties and customers to lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial statements and reports and have a material adverse effect on our liquidity, access to capital markets and perceptions of our creditworthiness and/or a decline in the market price of our common stock. In addition, we could become subject to investigations by Nasdaq, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, which could require additional financial and management resources. These events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nActual and potential claims, lawsuits and proceedings could ultimately reduce our profitability and liquidity and weaken our financial condition.\nWe have been and will continue to be named as a defendant in legal proceedings claiming damages in connection with the operation of our business. These actions and proceedings may involve claims for, among other things, compensation for alleged personal injury, workers\u2019 compensation, employment law violations and/or discrimination, breach of contract, or property damage. In addition, we may be subject to lawsuits involving allegations of violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act and state wage and hour laws, or allegations of violations of applicable securities laws. Due to the inherent uncertainties of litigation, we cannot accurately predict the ultimate outcome of any such actions or proceedings. We also are, and will likely continue to be, from time to time a plaintiff in legal proceedings against customers, or will pursue claims against our customers prior to litigation, in which we seek to recover payment of contractual amounts we are owed, as well as claims for increased costs we incur. When appropriate, we will establish provisions against possible exposures, and adjust these provisions from time to time according to ongoing exposure. If the assumptions and estimates related to these exposures prove to be inadequate or inaccurate, we could experience a reduction in our profitability and liquidity and a weakening of our financial condition. In addition, claims, lawsuits and proceedings may harm our reputation or divert management resources away from operating the business.\nOur future acquisitions may not be successful.\nWe may pursue selective acquisitions to grow our business. We cannot provide assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition targets or that we will be able to consummate acquisitions on terms and conditions acceptable to us, or that acquired businesses will be profitable. Acquisitions may expose us to additional business risks different than those we have traditionally experienced. We also may encounter difficulties integrating acquired businesses and successfully managing the growth we expect to experience from these acquisitions.\nWe may choose to finance future acquisitions with debt, equity, cash or a combination of the three. Future acquisitions could dilute earnings. To the extent we succeed in making acquisitions, a number of risks may result, including:\n\u2022\nthe assumption of material liabilities (including for environmental-related costs and multiemployer pension plans);\n\u2022\nfailure of due diligence to uncover situations that could result in legal exposure or to quantify the true liability exposure from known risks;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management\u2019s attention from the management of daily operations to the integration of operations;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in the assimilation and retention of employees, in the assimilation of different cultures and practices, in the assimilation of broad and geographically dispersed personnel and operations, and the retention of employees generally;\n\u2022\nthe risk of additional financial and accounting challenges and complexities in areas such as tax planning, treasury management, financial reporting and internal controls;\n\u2022\nthe assumption of multiemployer pension plans (\u201cMEPP\u201d) liability in the event of an acquisition with existing unions, and an increased exposure to challenges to the structure of our union and non-union subsidiaries and operations if an open shop business is acquired; and\n\u2022\npotential inability to realize the cost savings or other financial benefits anticipated prior to the acquisition.\nThe failure to successfully integrate acquisitions could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, the costs associated with a failed acquisition or attempted acquisition transaction could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nForce majeure events, including natural disasters and terrorists\u2019 actions, could negatively impact our business, which may affect our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nForce majeure, or extraordinary events beyond the control of the contracting parties, such as natural and man-made disasters, terrorist actions, and state and federal government shutdowns, could negatively impact us. We attempt to negotiate contract language seeking to mitigate force majeure events in both public and private client contracts. When successful, we remain obligated to perform our services after most extraordinary events subject to relief that may be available pursuant to a force majeure clause. If we are not able to react quickly to force majeure events, our operations may be affected significantly, which would have a negative impact on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nA pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease in the markets in which we operate or that otherwise impacts our facilities or suppliers could adversely impact our business.\nIf a pandemic, epidemic, or outbreak of an infectious disease including the recent outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) first identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, or other public health crisis were to affect our markets or facilities or those of our suppliers, our business could be adversely affected. Consequences of the coronavirus outbreak are resulting in disruptions in or restrictions on our ability to travel. If such an infectious disease broke out at one or more of our offices, facilities or work sites, our operations may be affected significantly, our productivity may be affected, our ability to complete projects in accordance with our contractual obligations may be affected, and we may incur increased labor and materials costs. If the customers with which we contract are affected by an outbreak of infectious disease, Construction and Service work may be delayed or cancelled, and we may incur increased labor and materials costs. If our subcontractors with whom we work were affected by an outbreak of infectious disease, our labor supply may be affected and we may incur increased labor costs. In addition, we may experience difficulties with certain suppliers or with vendors in their supply chains, and our business could be affected if we become unable to procure essential equipment, supplies or services in adequate quantities and at acceptable prices. Further, infectious outbreak has caused disruption to the U.S. economy, or the local economies of the markets in which we operate, and may cause shortages of building materials, increase costs associated with obtaining building materials, affect job growth and consumer confidence, or cause economic changes, including the possibility of an economic recession, that we cannot anticipate. Overall, the potential impact of a pandemic, epidemic or outbreak of an infectious disease with respect to our markets or our facilities is difficult to predict and could adversely impact our business. In response to the COVID-19 situation, federal, state and local governments (or other governments or bodies) are considering placing, or have placed, restrictions on travel and conducting or operating business activities. At this time those restrictions are very fluid and evolving. We have been and will continue to be impacted by those restrictions. Given that the type, degree and length of such restrictions are not known at this time, we cannot predict the overall impact of such restrictions on us, our customers, our subcontractors and supply chain, others that we work with or the overall economic environment. As such, the impact these restrictions may have on our financial position, operating results and liquidity cannot be reasonably estimated at this time, but the impact may be material. In addition, due to the speed with which the COVID-19 situation is developing and evolving, there is uncertainty around its ultimate impact on public health, business operations and the overall economy, including the possibility that we may continue to experience adverse impacts to our business as a result of an economic recession that occurs after the virus has subsided; therefore, the negative impact on our financial position, operating results and liquidity cannot be reasonably estimated at this time, but the impact may be material.\nDeliberate, malicious acts, including terrorism and sabotage, could damage our facilities, disrupt our operations or injure employees, contractors, customers or the public and result in liability to us.\nIntentional acts of theft, vandalism and destruction could damage or destroy our facilities, as well as the materials and equipment our labor forces are installing, thereby reducing our operational production capacity and requiring us to repair or replace facilities or installed work at substantial cost. Additionally, employees, contractors and the public could suffer substantial physical injury from acts of terrorism for which we could be liable. Governmental authorities may also impose security or other requirements that could make our operations more difficult or costly. The consequences of any such actions could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are susceptible to adverse weather conditions, which may harm our business and financial results.\nOur business may be adversely affected by severe weather in areas where we have significant operations. Repercussions of severe weather conditions may include:\n\u2022\ncurtailment of services;\n\u2022\nsuspension of operations;\n\u2022\ninability to meet performance schedules in accordance with contracts and potential liability for liquidated damages;\n\u2022\ninjuries or fatalities;\n\u2022\nweather related damage to facilities;\n\u2022\ndisruption of information systems;\n\u2022\ninability to receive machinery, equipment and materials at jobsites; and\n\u2022\nloss of productivity.\nInformation technology system failures, network disruptions or cyber security breaches could adversely affect our business.\nWe use sophisticated information technology systems, networks, and infrastructure in conducting some of our day-to-day operations and providing services to certain customers, including technology used for building designs, project modeling and scheduling. Information technology system failures, including suppliers\u2019 or vendors\u2019 system failures, could disrupt our operations by causing transaction errors, processing inefficiencies, the loss of customers, other business disruptions, or the loss of employee personal information. In addition, these systems, networks, and infrastructure may be vulnerable to deliberate cyber-attacks that interfere with their functionality or the confidentiality of our information or our customers\u2019 data. Increasingly advanced cyber-attacks against rapidly evolving computer technologies pose a risk to the security of our systems, networks and data. Likewise, cyber-attacks by employees, or surreptitiously through the Company\u2019s systems, pose a risk to the security of the systems, networks and data of our customers, subcontractors and suppliers. Despite efforts to protect confidential business information, personal data of employees and subcontractors, our information technology systems and those of our third-party service providers may be subject to system breaches. System breaches can lead to disclosure, modification and destruction of proprietary business data, personally identifiable information, other sensitive information, production downtime, and damage to our reputation, competitiveness and operations. Of special note is our risk when implementing new capabilities. As we implement new systems, many times both new and old systems run in parallel until all processes have successfully transferred to the new system and thorough testing has been performed. These events could impact our customers, employees and our reputation and lead to financial losses from remediation actions, loss of business or potential liability, or an increase in expense, all of which may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe have subsidiary operations throughout the United States and are exposed to multiple state and local regulations, as well as federal laws and requirements applicable to government contractors. Changes in laws, regulations or requirements, or a material failure of any of our subsidiaries or us to comply with any of them, could increase our costs and have other negative impacts on our business.\nOur branch locations operate in 18 states, which exposes us to a variety of state and local laws and regulations, particularly those pertaining to contractor licensing requirements. These laws and regulations govern many aspects of our business, and there are often different standards and requirements in different locations. In addition, our subsidiaries that perform work for federal government entities are subject to additional federal laws and regulatory and contractual requirements. Changes in any of these laws, or any subsidiary\u2019s material failure to comply with them, can adversely impact our operations by, among other things, increasing costs, distracting management\u2019s time and attention from other items, and harming our reputation.\nAs Federal Government Contractors under applicable federal regulations, our subsidiaries are subject to a number of rules and regulations, and our contracts with government entities are subject to audit. Violations of the applicable rules and regulations could result in a subsidiary being barred from future government contracts.\nFederal Government Contractors must comply with many regulations and other requirements that relate to the award, administration and performance of government contracts. A violation of these laws and regulations could result in imposition of fines and penalties, the termination of a government contract, or debarment from bidding on government contracts in the future. Further, despite our decentralized nature, a violation at one of our locations could impact the ability of the other locations to bid on and perform government contracts; additionally, because of our decentralized nature, we face risk in maintaining compliance with all local, state and federal government contracting requirements. Prohibition against bidding on future government contracts could have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nA change in tax laws or regulations of any federal or state jurisdiction in which we operate could increase our tax burden and otherwise adversely affect our financial position, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nWe continue to assess the impact of various U.S. federal or state legislative proposals that could result in a material increase to our U.S. federal or state taxes. We cannot predict whether any specific legislation will be enacted or the terms of any such legislation. However, if such proposals were to be enacted, or if modifications were to be made to certain existing regulations, the consequences could have a material adverse impact on us, including increasing our tax burden, increasing the cost of tax compliance or otherwise adversely affecting our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nPast and future environmental, safety and health regulations could impose significant additional costs on us that reduce our profits.\nHVAC systems are subject to various environmental statutes and regulations, including the Clean Air Act and those regulating the production, servicing and disposal of certain ozone-depleting refrigerants used in HVAC systems. There can be no assurance that the regulatory environment in which we operate will not change significantly in the future. Various local, state and federal laws and regulations impose licensing standards on technicians who install and service HVAC systems. And additional laws, regulations and standards apply to contractors who perform work that is being funded by public money, particularly federal public funding. Our failure to comply with these laws and regulations could subject us to substantial fines, the loss of licenses or potential debarment from future publicly funded work. It is impossible to predict the full nature and effect of judicial, legislative or regulatory developments relating to health and safety regulations and environmental protection regulations applicable to our operations.\nOur failure to comply with immigration laws and labor regulations could affect our business.\nIn certain markets, we rely heavily on our immigrant labor force. We have taken steps that we believe are sufficient and appropriate to ensure compliance with immigration laws. However, we cannot provide assurance that our management has identified, or will identify in the future, all illegal immigrants who work for us. The failure to identify such illegal immigrants may result in fines or other penalties being imposed upon the Company, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock has been volatile and may be volatile in the future, and could be subject to wide fluctuations in price in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include, among other things:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in our quarterly results of operations;\n\u2022\nrecommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022\noperating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic conditions, such as a recession;\n\u2022\nnews reports relating to trends, concerns and other issues in the financial services industry generally;\n\u2022\nperceptions in the marketplace regarding us and/or our competitors;\n\u2022\nnew technology used, or services offered, by competitors; and\n\u2022\nchanges in government regulations.\nIn addition, if the market for stocks in our industry, or the stock market in general, experiences a loss of investor confidence, the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, financial condition or results of operations. If any of the foregoing occurs, it could cause our stock price to fall and may expose us to lawsuits that, even if unsuccessful, could be costly to defend and a distraction to management.\nFuture sales of our common stock may cause our common stock price to decline.\nAny transfer or sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market or the perception that such transfer or sales might occur may cause the market price of our common stock to decline. As of May 11, 2020, we had an aggregate of 7,799,197 shares of our outstanding common stock, of which 2,544,692 shares were held by our directors, officers and holders of greater than 10% of our common stock. If a substantial number of these shares are sold in the public market, the trading price of our common stock may decline.\nIn addition, our board has the power, without stockholder approval, to set the terms of any series of preferred stock that may be issued, including voting rights, dividend rights, preferences over our common stock with respect to dividends or in the event of a dissolution, liquidation or winding up and other terms. In the event that we issue preferred stock in the future that has preference over our common stock with respect to payment of dividends or upon our liquidation, dissolution or winding up, or if we issue preferred stock with voting rights that dilute the voting power of our common stock, the rights of the holders of our common stock or the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected.\nFuture equity issuances could result in dilution, which could cause our common stock price to decline.\nWe are generally not restricted from issuing additional shares of our common stock, up to the 100,000,000 shares of voting common stock authorized by our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation, which could be increased by a vote of the holders of a majority of our shares. In connection with the 2019 Refinancing Agreement, we have issued warrants which may cause further dilution of our stock upon becoming exercisable. In addition, we may issue additional shares of our common stock in the future pursuant to current or future equity compensation plans, upon conversions of preferred stock or debt, upon exercise of warrants or in connection with future acquisitions or financings. If we choose to raise capital by selling shares of our common stock for any reason, the issuance would have a dilutive effect on the holders of our common stock and could have a material negative effect on the market price of our common stock.\nIf equity research analysts publish unfavorable commentary or downgrade our common stock, the price and trading volume of our common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock could be affected by equity research analysts\u2019 research or reports about us and our business. The price of our stock could decline if one or more securities analysts downgrade our stock or if analysts issue other unfavorable commentary about us or our business. In addition, if any of these analysts ceases coverage of us, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our common stock price or trading volume to decline and our common stock to be less liquid.\nWe no longer qualify as an \"emerging growth company\", effective December 31, 2019, and will be required to comply with certain provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and can no longer take advantage of certain reduced disclosure requirements.\nFor as long as we remained an emerging growth company, we could take advantage of reduced regulatory and reporting requirements that are otherwise generally applicable to public companies. We no longer qualify for such status, and as we are no longer an emerging growth company, we expect to incur additional expenses and devote substantial management effort toward ensuring compliance with those requirements applicable to companies that are not emerging growth companies. Even though we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, we currently do, and may continue to, qualify as a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d which allows us to take advantage of many of the same exemptions from disclosure requirements. However, we cannot be certain we will continue to qualify as a smaller reporting company.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K, including all documents incorporated by reference, contains forward-looking statements regarding the Company and represents our expectations and beliefs concerning future events.
