Risk Factors\nYou should consider carefully the following risks and uncertainties when reading this Annual Report. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our common stock could decline. Although we believe that we have identified and discussed below the key risk factors affecting our business, there may be additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known or that are not currently believed to be significant that may adversely affect our performance or financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nWe are vulnerable to changes in consumer preferences and economic conditions that could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nFood service businesses depend on consumer discretionary spending and are often affected by changes in consumer tastes, national, regional and local economic conditions and demographic trends. Factors such as traffic\npatterns, weather, fuel prices, local demographics and the type, number and locations of competing restaurants may adversely affect the performances of individual locations. In addition, economic downturns, inflation or increased food or energy costs could harm the restaurant industry in general and our locations in particular. Adverse changes in any of these factors could reduce consumer traffic or impose practical limits on pricing that could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. There can be no assurance that consumers will continue to regard Southern-inspired, chicken-based or fried food favorably or that we will be able to develop new menu items that appeal to consumer preferences. Also, changes in consumer shopping habits, such as increased utilization of online retailers, could reduce traffic and transactions in our restaurants and negatively impact our business. Our business, financial condition and results of operations depend in part on our ability to anticipate, identify and respond to changing consumer preferences and economic conditions. In addition, the restaurant industry is currently under heightened legal and legislative scrutiny related to menu labeling and resulting from the perception that the practices of restaurant companies have contributed to nutritional, caloric intake, obesity or other health concerns of their guests. If we are unable to adapt to changes in consumer preferences and trends, we may lose customers and our revenues may decline.\nOur growth strategy depends in part on opening new restaurants in existing and new markets and expanding our franchise system. We may be unsuccessful in opening new company-operated or franchised restaurants or establishing new markets, which could adversely affect our growth.\nOne of the key means to achieving our growth strategy will be through opening restaurants and operating those restaurants on a profitable basis. We opened 29 company-operated restaurants in fiscal 2015, opened 29 company-operated restaurants in fiscal 2016 and opened 26 company-operated restaurants in fiscal 2017. Our franchisees opened 34 franchise operated restaurants in fiscal 2015, opened 29 franchise operated restaurants in fiscal 2016 and opened 26 franchise operated restaurants in fiscal 2017. We expect to slow the pace of system-wide unit expansion by reducing development of company-operated restaurants while shifting our focus towards enabling new and existing franchised partners to lead brand expansion on a go-forward basis. Our ability to open new restaurants is dependent upon a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including our and our franchisees\u2019 ability to:\n\u2022\nidentify available and suitable restaurant sites;\n\u2022\ncompete for restaurant sites;\n\u2022\nreach acceptable agreements regarding the lease or purchase of locations;\n\u2022\nobtain or have available the financing required to acquire and operate a restaurant, including construction and opening costs, which includes access to build-to-suit leases and equipment financing leases at favorable interest and capitalization rates;\n\u2022\nrespond to unforeseen engineering or environmental problems with leased premises;\n\u2022\navoid the impact of inclement weather, natural disasters and other calamities;\n\u2022\nhire, train and retain the skilled management and other employees necessary to meet staffing needs;\n\u2022\nobtain, in a timely manner and for an acceptable cost, required licenses, permits and regulatory approvals and respond effectively to any changes in local, state or federal law and regulations that adversely affect our and our franchisees\u2019 costs or ability to open new restaurants; and\n\u2022\ncontrol construction and equipment cost increases for new restaurants.\nThere is no guarantee that a sufficient number of suitable restaurant sites will be available in desirable areas or on terms that are acceptable to us in order to achieve our growth plan. If we are unable to open new restaurants or sign new franchisees, or if existing franchisees do not open new restaurants, or if restaurant openings are significantly delayed, our revenues or earnings growth could be adversely affected and our business negatively affected.\nAs part of our longer term growth strategy, we may enter into geographic markets in which we have little or no prior operating or franchising experience through company-operated restaurant growth and through franchise development agreements. The challenges of entering new markets include: difficulties in hiring experienced personnel; unfamiliarity with local real estate markets and demographics; consumer unfamiliarity with our brand; and different competitive and economic conditions, consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns that are more difficult to predict or satisfy than in our existing markets. Consumer recognition of our brand has been important in the success of company-operated and franchised restaurants in our existing markets. Restaurants we open in new markets may take longer to reach expected sales and profit levels on a consistent basis and may have higher construction, occupancy and operating costs than existing restaurants, thereby affecting our overall profitability. In addition, consumer tastes and breakfast preferences may vary geographically for Southern-inspired items, which could affect our overall sales and profitability. Any failure on our part to recognize or respond to these challenges may adversely affect the success of any new restaurants. Expanding our franchise system could require the implementation, expense and successful management of enhanced business support systems, management information systems and financial controls as well as additional staffing, franchise support and capital expenditures and working capital.\nDue to brand recognition and logistical synergies, as part of our growth strategy, we also intend to open new restaurants in areas where we have existing restaurants. The operating results and comparable restaurant sales for our restaurants could be adversely affected due to close proximity with our other restaurants and market saturation.\nNew restaurants, once opened, may not be profitable or may close, and historical average restaurant revenues and comparable restaurant sales may not be indicative of future results.\nSome of our restaurants open with an initial start-up period of higher than normal sales volumes, which subsequently decrease to stabilized levels. In new markets, the length of time before average sales for new restaurants stabilize is less predictable and can be longer as a result of our limited knowledge of these markets and consumers\u2019 limited awareness of our brand. In addition, our average restaurant revenues and comparable restaurant sales may not increase at historical rates. We may also not be successful in our new restaurant design for new restaurants and remodels of our existing restaurants in connection with our \u201cBojangles\u2019 of the Future\u201d project. Our ability to operate new restaurants profitably and increase average restaurant revenues and comparable restaurant sales will depend on many factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nconsumer awareness and understanding of our brand;\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions, which can affect restaurant traffic, local labor costs and prices we pay for the food products and other supplies we use;\n\u2022\nconsumption patterns and food preferences that may differ from region to region;\n\u2022\nchanges in consumer preferences and discretionary spending;\n\u2022\ndifficulties obtaining or maintaining adequate relationships with distributors or suppliers in new markets;\n\u2022\nincreases in prices for commodities, including chicken and other proteins;\n\u2022\ninefficiency in our labor costs as the staff gains experience;\n\u2022\ncompetition, either from our competitors in the restaurant industry or our own restaurants;\n\u2022\ntemporary and permanent site characteristics of new restaurants;\n\u2022\nchanges in government regulation;\n\u2022\nincreased remodeling projects and associated costs, construction costs, cash capital expenditures, operating costs, depreciation and amortization expenses, and general and administrative expenses associated with our \u201cBojangles\u2019 of the Future\u201d and technology projects; and\n\u2022\nother unanticipated increases in costs, any of which could give rise to delays or cost overruns.\nIf our new restaurants do not perform as planned or close, our business and future prospects could be harmed. We may refranchise more company-operated restaurants to franchisees over time and also expect closures of underperforming company-operated and franchised restaurants during fiscal 2018, and potentially in subsequent years, to exceed levels experienced in recent years. In addition, an inability to achieve our expected average restaurant revenues could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOpening new restaurants in existing markets may negatively impact sales at our and our franchisees\u2019 existing restaurants.\nThe consumer target area of our and our franchisees\u2019 restaurants varies by location, depending on a number of factors, including population density, other local retail and business attractions, area demographics and geography. As a result, the opening of a new restaurant in or near markets in which we or our franchisees already have restaurants could adversely impact sales at these existing restaurants. Existing restaurants could also make it more difficult to build our and our franchisees\u2019 consumer base for a new restaurant in the same market. Our core business strategy does not entail opening new restaurants that we believe will materially affect sales at our or our franchisees\u2019 existing restaurants. However, we cannot guarantee there will not be significant impact in some cases and we may selectively open new restaurants in and around areas of existing restaurants that are operating at or near capacity to effectively serve our customers. Sales cannibalization between our restaurants may become significant in the future as we continue to expand our operations and could affect our sales growth, which could, in turn, materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur sales growth and ability to achieve profitability could be adversely affected if comparable restaurant sales are less than we expect.\nThe level of comparable restaurant sales, which reflect the change in year-over-year sales for restaurants in the fiscal month following 15 months of operation using a mid-month convention, will affect our sales growth and will continue to be a critical factor affecting our ability to generate profits because the profit margin on comparable restaurant sales is generally higher than the profit margin on new restaurant sales. Our ability to increase comparable restaurant sales depends in part on our ability to successfully implement our initiatives to build sales. It is possible such initiatives will not be successful, that we will not achieve our target comparable restaurant sales growth or that the change in comparable restaurant sales could be negative, which may cause a decrease in sales growth and ability to achieve profitability that would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur marketing programs may not be successful, and our new menu items, advertising campaigns, technology initiatives and restaurant designs and remodels may not generate increased sales or profits.\nWe incur costs and expend other resources in our marketing efforts on new menu items, advertising campaigns and restaurant designs and remodels to raise brand awareness and attract and retain customers. We recently introduced the Bojangles\u2019 Mobile App, which includes features such as mobile payment and our Bo Rewards customer loyalty program, and we are also working on several other key technology initiatives, including mobile ordering and a potential test of delivery. We believe these technology solutions will improve our customer experience, capture large group ordering and increase transactions. These initiatives may not be successful, resulting in expenses incurred without the benefit of higher revenues. If our technology initiatives are not adopted by our customers and/or our franchisees, we may experience a decrease in our revenues, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, if we choose higher price points for promotional items, do less targeted discounting or increase our prices too much, our sales could be negatively impacted, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nFurther, if we are successful with the implementation of our technology initiatives related to mobile payment, our Bo Rewards customer loyalty program, and mobile ordering and delivery, we may be required to introduce new\nin-store procedures and tools in order to execute operationally, which could include adding new roles and resources. Further, utilizing a third-party delivery service may not be profitable and may introduce additional food safety and food quality risks. Any changes to our restaurant operations associated with our technology initiatives could result in additional restaurant operating expenses and could negatively impact our results of operations.\nAdditionally, some of our competitors have greater financial resources, which enable them to spend significantly more on marketing and advertising and other initiatives than we are able to. Some of our competitors have implemented, and may continue to implement, discounting strategies, which may have a negative impact on our revenues and profitability. Should our competitors increase spending on marketing and advertising and other initiatives such as additional discounting or our marketing funds decrease for any reason, or should our advertising, promotions, new menu items, technology initiatives and restaurant designs and remodels be less effective than our competitors, there could be a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nChanges in food and supplies costs, especially for chicken, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur profitability depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in food and supplies costs. We are susceptible to increases in food costs as a result of factors beyond our control, such as general economic conditions, seasonal economic fluctuations, weather conditions, global demand, food safety concerns, infectious diseases, fluctuations in the U.S. dollar, product recalls and government regulations. The costs of many basic foods for humans and animals, including wheat and cooking oil, can increase markedly in a short period of time, which can result in upward pricing pressures on all of our raw ingredients at various points in time, including chicken (especially limited service restaurant-sized chickens) and pork. Food prices for a number of our key ingredients escalated markedly at various points in fiscal 2015, fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017. As a result of such pricing pressures, we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, significant increases in the costs of certain ingredients for items on our menu. In addition, due to the avian flu the cost of our eggs and seasoned fried turkeys were significantly higher at various points in time. Weather related issues, such as freezes or drought, may also lead to temporary spikes in the prices of some ingredients such as produce or meats. Any increase in the prices of the ingredients most critical to our menu, such as chicken, pork, dairy and wheat, would adversely affect our operating results. Alternatively, in the event of cost increases with respect to one or more of our raw ingredients, we may choose to temporarily suspend serving menu items rather than paying the increased cost for the ingredients. Any such changes to our available menu may negatively impact our restaurant traffic, business and comparable restaurant sales during the shortage and thereafter. We have implemented menu price increases in the past to significantly offset the higher prices of food and supplies costs. We may not be able to offset all or any portion of increased food and supplies costs through higher menu prices in the future. If we or our franchisees implement further menu price increases in the future to protect our margins, restaurant traffic could be materially adversely affected, at both company-operated and franchised restaurants.\nOur principal food product is chicken. In fiscal 2015, fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017, the cost of chicken and other proteins included in our product cost was approximately 46%, 45% and 45%, respectively, of our food and supplies costs from company-operated restaurants. Material increases in the cost of chicken and other proteins could materially adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Changes in the cost and availability of chicken can result from a number of factors, including seasonality, increases in the cost of grain, disease and other factors that affect availability, greater international demand for domestic chicken products, decreased numbers of size and choice chickens, especially limited service restaurant-sized chickens, increased costs for larger-sized chickens, which must be purchased if we are unable to purchase sufficient quantities of limited service restaurant-sized chickens, and increased transportation costs.\nA major driver of the price of corn, which is the primary feed source for chicken, has been the increasing demand for corn by the ethanol industry as an alternative fuel source, as most ethanol plants in the United States use corn\nas the primary source of grain to make ethanol. This increased demand on the nation\u2019s corn crop has had and may continue to have an adverse impact on chicken prices. While we have some supply agreements that allow us to lock in prices of certain raw ingredients for certain periods of time, we currently do not make extensive use of futures contracts or other financial risk management strategies with respect to potential price fluctuations in the cost of chicken, pork or other raw ingredients, food and supplies.\nWheat is an ingredient in some of our principal food products. Changes in the cost and availability of wheat may be affected by a number of factors, including economic and industry conditions, crop disease, weed control, water availability, various planting/growing/harvesting problems, and severe weather conditions such as drought, floods or frost that are difficult to anticipate and which cannot be controlled. Demand for food products made from wheat flour is affected by changes in consumer tastes, demographic trends and national, regional and local economic conditions.\nAnother of our principal food products is pork. Material increases in the cost of pork could materially adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Changes in the cost of pork can result from a number of factors, including seasonality, increases in the cost of grain, disease and viruses and other factors that affect availability and greater international demand for domestic pork products.\nWe may not be able to compete successfully with other quick-service and fast-casual restaurants. Intense competition in the restaurant industry could make it more difficult to expand our business and could also have a negative impact on our operating results if customers favor our competitors or we are forced to change our pricing and other marketing strategies.\nThe food service industry, and particularly its quick-service and fast-casual segments, is intensely competitive. In addition, the Southeastern United States, the primary market in which we compete, consists of what we believe to be the most competitive Southern-inspired quick-service and fast-casual market in the United States. We expect competition in this market and each of our other markets to continue to be intense because consumer trends are favoring limited service restaurants that offer healthier menu items made with better quality products, and many limited service restaurants are responding to these trends. Competition in our industry is primarily based on price, convenience, quality of service, brand recognition, restaurant location and type and quality of food. If our company-operated and franchised restaurants cannot compete successfully with other quick-service and fast-casual restaurants in new and existing markets, we could lose customers and our revenues could decline. Our company-operated and franchised restaurants compete with national and regional quick-service and fast-casual restaurant chains for customers, restaurant locations and qualified management and other staff. Compared with us, some of our competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources, have been in business longer, have greater brand recognition or are better established in the markets where our restaurants are located or are planned to be located. In addition, competition has increased in the breakfast market as more competitors have entered the breakfast market or expanded their breakfast menu to be served all day, and some competitors have expanded their lunch and dinner menus to include more chicken items, all of which may negatively impact our sales and profitability. Also, certain of our competitors have significantly increased discounting and others have introduced or expanded their online and mobile ordering, loyalty program and delivery options, all of which may negatively impact our sales. Any of these competitive factors may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe financial performance of our franchisees can negatively impact our business.\nAs 57% of our restaurants are franchised as of December 31, 2017, our financial results are dependent in part upon the operational and financial success of our franchisees. We receive royalties, franchise fees, contributions to our marketing development fund and co-op advertising funds, and other fees from our franchisees. We have established operational standards and guidelines for our franchisees; however, we have limited control over how our franchisees\u2019 businesses are run. While we are responsible for ensuring the success of our entire system of restaurants and for taking a longer term view with respect to system improvements, our franchisees have\nindividual business strategies and objectives, which might conflict with our interests. Our franchisees may not be able to secure adequate financing to open or continue operating their Bojangles\u2019 restaurants. If they incur too much debt or if economic or sales trends deteriorate such that they are unable to repay existing debt, our franchisees could experience financial distress or even bankruptcy. We and our franchisees have been and could further be financially impacted by the implementation of, and any potential changes to, the health care reform legislation and labor regulations. If a significant number of franchisees become financially distressed, it could harm our operating results through reduced royalty revenues and the impact on our profitability could be greater than the percentage decrease in the royalty revenues. Closure of franchised restaurants, which during fiscal 2018, and potentially in subsequent years, could exceed levels experienced in recent years, would reduce our royalty revenues and could negatively impact margins, since we may not be able to reduce fixed costs which we continue to incur.\nWe have limited control with respect to the operations of our franchisees, which could have a negative impact on our business.\nFranchisees are independent business operators and are not our employees, and we do not exercise control over the day-to-day operations of their restaurants. We provide training and support to franchisees, and set and monitor operational standards, but the quality of franchised restaurants may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control. Consequently, franchisees may not successfully operate restaurants in a manner consistent with our standards and requirements, or may not hire and train qualified managers and other restaurant personnel. If franchisees do not operate to our expectations, our image and reputation, and the image and reputation of other franchisees, may suffer materially and system-wide sales could decline significantly, which would reduce our royalty revenues, and the impact on profitability could be greater than the percentage decrease in royalties and fees.\nThe challenging economic environment may affect our franchisees, with adverse consequences to us.\nWe rely in part on our franchisees and the manner in which they operate their locations to develop and promote our business. As of December 31, 2017, our top three franchisees operated 170 of our franchised restaurants and accounted for approximately 44% of our royalty revenues in both fiscal 2017 and fiscal 2016. Due to the continuing challenging economic environment, it is possible that some franchisees could file for bankruptcy or become delinquent in their payments to us, which could have a significant adverse impact on our business due to loss or delay in payments of royalties, contributions to our marketing development fund and co-op advertising funds and other fees. Bankruptcies by our franchisees could prevent us from terminating their franchise agreements so that we can offer their territories to other franchisees, negatively impact our market share and operating results as we may have fewer well-performing restaurants, and adversely impact our ability to attract new franchisees.\nAlthough we have developed criteria to evaluate and screen prospective developers and franchisees, we cannot be certain that the developers and franchisees we select will have the business acumen or financial resources necessary to open and operate successful franchises in their franchise areas, and state franchise laws may limit our ability to terminate or modify these franchise arrangements. Moreover, franchisees may not successfully operate restaurants in a manner consistent with our standards and requirements, or may not hire and train qualified managers and other restaurant personnel. The failure of developers and franchisees to open and operate franchises successfully could have a material adverse effect on us, our reputation, our brand and our ability to attract prospective franchisees and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFranchisees may not have access to the financial or management resources that they need to open the restaurants contemplated by their agreements with us, or be able to find suitable sites on which to develop them. Franchisees may not be able to negotiate acceptable lease or purchase terms for restaurant sites, obtain the necessary permits\nand government approvals or meet construction schedules. Any of these problems could slow our growth and reduce our franchise revenues. Additionally, our franchisees typically depend on financing from banks and other financial institutions, which may not always be available to them, in order to construct and open new restaurants. For these reasons, franchisees operating under development agreements may not be able to meet the new restaurant opening dates required under those agreements. Also, as of December 31, 2017, we sublease certain restaurants and equipment to six franchisees which comprise twelve restaurants and lease land, building and equipment we own to one of our franchisees. If any such franchisees cannot meet their financial obligations under their subleases, or otherwise fail to honor or default under the terms of their subleases, we would be financially obligated under a master lease and could be adversely affected.\nOur system-wide restaurant base is geographically concentrated in the Southeastern United States, and we could be negatively affected by conditions specific to that region.\nOur company-operated and franchised restaurants in the Southeastern United States represent approximately 99% of our system-wide restaurants as of December 31, 2017. Our company-operated and franchised restaurants in North Carolina and South Carolina represent approximately 59% of our system-wide restaurants as of December 31, 2017. Approximately 68% of our company-operated restaurants are located in North Carolina and South Carolina as of December 31, 2017. Adverse changes in demographic, unemployment, economic, regulatory or weather conditions in the Southeastern United States have had, and may continue to have, material adverse effects on our business. As a result of our concentration in this market, we have been, and in the future may be, disproportionately affected by these adverse conditions compared to other chain restaurants with a national footprint.\nIn addition, our competitors could open additional restaurants in North Carolina and South Carolina, where we have significant concentration with 447 of our system restaurants as of December 31, 2017, which could result in reduced market share for us and may adversely impact our profitability.\nNegative publicity could reduce sales at some or all of our restaurants.\nWe may, from time to time, be faced with negative publicity relating to food quality, the safety, sanitation and welfare of our restaurant facilities, customer complaints or litigation alleging illness or injury, health inspection scores, integrity of our or our suppliers\u2019 food processing and other policies, practices and procedures, employee relationships and welfare or other matters at one or more of our restaurants. Negative publicity may adversely affect us, regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are held to be responsible. In addition, the negative impact of adverse publicity relating to one restaurant may extend far beyond the restaurant involved, especially due to the high geographic concentration of many of our restaurants, to affect some or all of our other restaurants, including our franchised restaurants. The risk of negative publicity is particularly great with respect to our franchised restaurants because we are limited in the manner in which we can regulate them, especially on a real-time basis and negative publicity from our franchised restaurants may also significantly impact company-operated restaurants. A similar risk exists with respect to food service businesses unrelated to us, if customers mistakenly associate such unrelated businesses with our operations. Employee claims against us based on, among other things, wage and hour violations, discrimination, harassment or wrongful termination may also create not only legal and financial liability but negative publicity that could adversely affect us and divert our financial and management resources that would otherwise be used to benefit the future performance of our operations. These types of employee claims could also be asserted against us, on a co-employer theory, by employees of our franchisees. A significant increase in the number of these claims or an increase in the number of successful claims could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFood safety and quality concerns may negatively impact our business and profitability, our internal operational controls and standards may not always be met and our employees may not always act professionally, responsibly and in our and our customers\u2019 best interests. Any possible instances of food-borne illness could reduce our restaurant sales.\nIncidents or reports of food-borne or water-borne illness or other food safety issues, food contamination or tampering, employee hygiene and cleanliness failures or improper employee conduct at our restaurants could lead to product liability or other claims. Such incidents or reports could negatively affect our brand and reputation as well as our business, revenues and profits. Similar incidents or reports occurring at limited service restaurants unrelated to us could likewise create negative publicity, which could negatively impact consumer behavior towards us.\nWe cannot guarantee to consumers that our internal controls and training will be fully effective in preventing all food-borne illnesses. Furthermore, our reliance on third-party food processors makes it difficult to monitor food safety compliance and may increase the risk that food-borne illness would affect multiple locations rather than single restaurants. Some food-borne illness incidents could be caused by third-party food suppliers and transporters outside of our control. New illnesses resistant to our current precautions may develop in the future, or diseases with long incubation periods could arise, that could give rise to claims or allegations on a retroactive basis. One or more instances of food-borne illness in one of our company-operated or franchised restaurants could negatively affect sales at all of our restaurants if highly publicized, especially due to the high geographic concentration of many of our restaurants. This risk exists even if it were later determined that the illness was wrongly attributed to one of our restaurants. A number of other restaurant chains have experienced incidents related to food-borne illnesses that have had material adverse impacts on their operations, and we cannot assure you that we could avoid a similar impact upon the occurrence of a similar incident at one of our restaurants. Additionally, even if food-borne illnesses were not identified at our restaurants, our restaurant sales could be adversely affected if instances of food-borne illnesses at other restaurant chains were highly publicized. In addition, our restaurant sales could be adversely affected by publicity regarding other high-profile illnesses such as avian flu or swine flu that customers may associate with our food products.\nWe rely on one company to distribute substantially all of our food and supplies to company-operated and franchised restaurants. We also rely on a limited number of companies, and, in some cases, a sole company, to supply certain products, supplies and ingredients to our distributor. Failure to receive timely deliveries of food or other supplies could result in a loss of revenues and materially and adversely impact our operations.\nOur and our franchisees\u2019 ability to maintain consistent quality menu items and prices significantly depends upon our ability to acquire quality food products, including chicken and related items, from reliable sources in accordance with our specifications on a timely basis. Shortages or interruptions in the supply of food products caused by unanticipated demand, problems in production or distribution, contamination of food products, an outbreak of poultry or pork diseases, inclement weather or other conditions could materially adversely affect the availability, quality and cost of ingredients, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We have contracts with a limited number of suppliers, and, in some cases, a sole supplier, for certain products, supplies and ingredients. Certain menu items and ingredients are provided to us and our franchisees by single suppliers for various proteins and a single supplier for spices. We have limited rights to access the exclusive formulas used for us by one of the single-source suppliers. McLane is the approved distributor for substantially all of the food and supplies used in our company-operated and franchised stores. Our franchisees are required to purchase their food and supplies from approved distributors and approved manufacturers. Certain of our franchisees have elected to transition to bone-in chicken distribution through McLane, and other franchisees purchase fresh bone-in chicken from other approved distributors. If McLane or our other suppliers fail to perform as anticipated or seek to terminate agreements with us or our franchisees, or if there is any disruption in any of our supply or distribution relationships for any other reason, we or our franchisees could be forced to temporarily close a restaurant or remove popular items from a restaurant\u2019s menu due to a supply shortage. In such event, that restaurant may experience a significant reduction in revenues during\nthe time affected by the shortage and thereafter if our customers change their dining habits as a result, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur level of indebtedness could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe total debt outstanding under our credit facility and capital lease obligations at December 31, 2017 was $156.0 million and we had no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility. Our indebtedness could have significant effects on our business, such as:\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to borrow additional amounts to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our growth strategy and other purposes;\n\u2022\nrequiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay principal and interest on our debt, which would reduce availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, execution of our growth strategy and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nmaking us more vulnerable to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions, in government regulation and in our business by limiting our ability to plan for and react to changing conditions;\n\u2022\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage compared with our competitors that have less debt; and\n\u2022\nexposing us to risks inherent in interest rate fluctuations because our borrowings are at variable rates of interest, which could result in higher interest expense in the event of increases in interest rates.\nIn addition, we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from our operations to repay our indebtedness when it becomes due and to meet our other cash needs. If we are not able to pay our debts as they become due, we will be required to pursue one or more alternative strategies, such as selling assets, refinancing or restructuring our indebtedness or selling additional debt or equity securities. We may not be able to refinance our debt or sell additional debt or equity securities or our assets on favorable terms, if at all, and if we must sell our assets, it may negatively affect our ability to generate revenues.\nOur agreements relating to our term loan and revolving credit facility contain a number of covenants that, among other things, restrict, subject to certain exceptions, our ability to (i) incur additional indebtedness, (ii) issue preferred stock, (iii) create liens on assets, (iv) engage in mergers or consolidations, (v) sell assets, (vi) make investments, loans, or advances, (vii) make certain acquisitions, (viii) engage in certain transactions with affiliates, (ix) authorize or pay dividends, (x) change our lines of business or fiscal year and (xi) not exceed pre-determined maximum cash capital expenditures. In addition, our term loan and revolving credit facility requires us to maintain, on a consolidated basis, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, not to exceed a maximum total lease adjusted leverage ratio and not to exceed a maximum cash capital expenditure limit. Our ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility depends on our compliance with these tests. Events beyond our control, including changes in general economic and business conditions, may affect our ability to meet these tests. We cannot assure you that we will meet these tests in the future, or that our lenders will waive any failure to meet these tests.\nThe failure to comply with our debt covenants or the volatile credit and capital markets could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nOur ability to manage our debt is dependent on our level of positive cash flow from company-operated and franchised restaurants, net of costs. An economic downturn may negatively impact our cash flows. Credit and capital markets can be volatile, which could make it more difficult for us to refinance our existing debt or to obtain additional debt or equity financings in the future. Such constraints could increase our costs of borrowing\nand could restrict our access to other potential sources of future liquidity. Our failure to comply with the debt covenants in our term loan and revolving credit facility or to have sufficient liquidity to make interest and other payments required by our debt could result in a default of such debt and acceleration of our borrowings, which would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition. The lack of availability or access to build-to-suit leases and equipment financing leases could result in a decreased number of new restaurants and have a negative impact on our growth.\nIf the interest rate swaps entered into in connection with our credit facility prove ineffective, it could result in volatility in our operating results, including potential losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we have an interest rate swap contract with one of our lenders under our current credit agreement to exchange our variable interest rate payment commitments for fixed interest rate payments on our term loans. On October 26, 2015, we entered into an interest rate swap contract with a notional amount of $50.0 million, an effective date of October 30, 2015 and a termination date of October 31, 2019, under which we pay a fixed interest rate of 1.115% and receive the one-month LIBOR rate. Early termination of interest rate swap contracts may result in payments by us and expiration of swaps without replacement may result in increased interest payments by us, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flow.\nWe record the swaps at fair value, and are currently designated as an effective cash flow hedge under ASC 815, Derivatives and Hedging (\u201cASC 815\u201d). Each fiscal quarter, we assess whether each derivative that qualifies for hedge accounting continues to be highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged item and record in earnings any gains or losses resulting from hedge ineffectiveness. The hedge provided by our swaps could prove to be ineffective for a number of reasons, including early retirement of our term loan, as is allowed under the credit facility, or in the event the counterparty to the interest rate swaps are determined in the future to not be creditworthy. Any determination that the hedge created by the swaps is ineffective could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows and result in volatility in our operating results. In addition, any changes in relevant accounting standards relating to the swaps, especially ASC 815, could materially increase earnings volatility.\nThere can be no assurance that we will continue to repurchase stock or that we will repurchase stock at favorable prices.\nOn October 31, 2017, our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program under which we may purchase up to $50.0 million of our outstanding common stock through April 30, 2019. The purchases may be made from time to time in the open market (including, without limitation, the use of Rule 10b5-1 plans), depending on a number of factors, including our evaluation of general market and economic conditions, the trading price of the common stock, regulatory requirements, and compliance with the terms of our outstanding indebtedness. The share repurchase program may be extended, modified, suspended or discontinued at any time. We expect to fund the share repurchase program with either, or a combination of, existing cash on hand, cash generated from operations, and borrowings under our revolving line of credit. Through March 1, 2018, we have acquired 0.4 million shares at a total cost of $4.9 million. As March 1, 2018, up to $45.1 million of our common stock remains available for purchase under the program. A reduction in, or the completion or expiration of, our share repurchase program could have a negative effect on our stock price. We can provide no assurance that we will repurchase stock at favorable prices, if at all.\nA prolonged economic downturn could materially affect us in the future.\nThe restaurant industry is dependent upon consumer discretionary spending. The recession from late 2007 to mid-2009 reduced consumer confidence to historic lows, impacting the public\u2019s ability and desire to spend discretionary dollars as a result of job losses, home foreclosures, significantly reduced home values, investment\nlosses, bankruptcies and reduced access to credit, resulting in lower levels of customer traffic and lower average check sizes in our restaurants. If the economy experiences another significant decline, our business, results of operations and ability to comply with the terms of our term loan and revolving credit facility could be materially adversely affected and may result in a deceleration of the number and timing of new restaurant openings by us and our franchisees. Deterioration in customer traffic or a reduction in average check size would negatively impact our revenues and profitability and could result in reductions in staff levels, additional impairment charges and potential restaurant closures.\nThe interests of our franchisees may conflict with ours or yours in the future and we could face liability from our franchisees or related to our relationship with our franchisees.\nFranchisees, as independent business operators, may from time to time disagree with us and our strategies regarding the business or our interpretation of our respective rights and obligations under the franchise agreement and the terms and conditions of the franchisee/franchisor relationship. This may lead to disputes with our franchisees and we expect such disputes to occur from time to time in the future as we continue to offer franchises. Such disputes may result in legal action against us. To the extent we have such disputes, the attention, time and financial resources of our management and our franchisees will be diverted from our restaurants, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows even if we have a successful outcome in the dispute.\nIn addition, various state and federal laws govern our relationship with our franchisees and our potential sale of a franchise. A franchisee and/or a government agency may bring legal action against us based on the franchisee/franchisor relationships that could result in the award of damages to franchisees and/or the imposition of fines or other penalties against us.\nInformation technology system failures, breaches of our network security or inability to upgrade or expand our technological capabilities could interrupt our operations and adversely affect our business.\nWe and our franchisees rely on our computer systems and network infrastructure across our operations, including point-of-sale processing at our restaurants. Our and our franchisees\u2019 operations depend upon our and our franchisees\u2019 ability to protect our computer equipment and systems against damage from physical theft, fire, power loss, telecommunications failure or other catastrophic events, as well as from internal and external security breaches, viruses and other disruptive problems. Any damage or failure of our computer systems or network infrastructure that causes an interruption in our operations could have a material adverse effect on our business and subject us or our franchisees to litigation or to actions by regulatory authorities.\nWe are continuing to expand, upgrade and develop our information technology capabilities, including our point-of-sale system, as well as the adoption of cloud services for e-mail, intranet, and file storage. If we are unable to successfully upgrade or expand our technological capabilities, we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities, manage our costs and transactional data effectively, satisfy customer requirements, execute our business plan or respond to competitive pressures. Additionally, unforeseen problems with our point-of-sale system may affect our operational abilities and internal controls and we may incur additional costs in connection with such upgrades and expansion.\nIf we or our franchisees are unable to protect our customers\u2019 data, we could be exposed to data loss, litigation, liability and reputational damage.\nIn connection with credit and debit card sales, we and our franchisees transmit confidential credit and debit card information by way of secure private retail networks. We also accept mobile payments from our customers in our company-operated restaurants. A number of restaurant operators and retailers have experienced actual or potential security breaches in which credit and debit card information may have been stolen. Although we and our franchisees use private networks, third parties may have the technology or know-how to breach the security\nof the customer information transmitted in connection with credit and debit card sales, and our and our franchisees\u2019 security measures and those of our and our franchisees\u2019 technology vendors may not effectively prohibit others from obtaining improper access to this information. If a person were able to circumvent these security measures, he or she could destroy or steal valuable information or disrupt our and our franchisees\u2019 operations. Any security breach could expose us and our franchisees to risks of data loss and liability and could seriously disrupt our and our franchisees\u2019 operations and any resulting negative publicity could significantly harm our reputation. We may also be subject to lawsuits or other proceedings in the future relating to these types of incidents. Proceedings related to theft of credit and debit card information may be brought by payment card providers, banks, and credit unions that issue cards, cardholders (either individually or as part of a class action lawsuit), and federal and state regulators. Any such proceedings could harm our reputation, distract our management team members from running our business and cause us to incur significant unplanned liabilities, losses and expenses.\nWe also sell and accept for payment Bojangles\u2019 gift cards and virtual wallets on mobile devices, and our Bo Rewards customer loyalty program provides rewards that can be redeemed for purchases. Like credit and debit cards, gift cards, virtual wallets and rewards earned by our customers are vulnerable to theft, whether physical or electronic. We believe that our gift cards are primarily vulnerable to physical theft, as we have implemented gift card policies such as requiring a physical card to be presented when redeeming value from a gift card; however, there could be instances of non-compliance with these policies. We believe that, due to their electronic nature, virtual wallets and rewards earned through our Bo Rewards customer loyalty program are primarily vulnerable to hacking. Customers affected by any loss of data or funds could litigate against us, and security breaches or even unsuccessful attempts at hacking could harm our reputation, and guarding against or responding to hacks could require significant time and resources.\nWe also receive and maintain certain personal information about our customers, including information received through our Bo Rewards customer loyalty program, and team members. The use of this information by us is regulated at the federal and state levels. If our security and information systems are compromised or our team members fail to comply with these laws and regulations and this information is obtained by unauthorized persons or used inappropriately, it could adversely affect our reputation, as well as the results of operations, and could result in litigation against us or the imposition of penalties. In addition, our ability to accept credit and debit cards as payment in our restaurants and online depends on us maintaining our compliance status with standards set by the PCI Security Standards Council. These standards, set by a consortium of the major credit card companies, require certain levels of system security and procedures to protect our customers\u2019 credit and debit card information as well as other personal information. Privacy and information security laws and regulations change over time, and compliance with those changes may result in cost increases due to necessary system and process changes.\nThe failure to enforce and maintain our trademarks and protect our other intellectual property could materially adversely affect our business, including our ability to establish and maintain brand awareness.\nWe have registered Bojangles\u2019\u00ae and certain other names used by our restaurants as trademarks or service marks with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. The Bojangles\u2019\u00ae trademark is also registered in some form in approximately 25 foreign countries. Our current brand campaign, \u201cIt\u2019s Bo Time\u201d has also been approved for registration with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. In addition, the Bojangles\u2019 logo, website name and address and Facebook and Twitter accounts are our intellectual property. The success of our business strategy depends on our continued ability to use our existing trademarks and service marks in order to increase brand awareness and develop our branded products. If our efforts to protect our intellectual property are not adequate, or if any third-party misappropriates or infringes on our intellectual property, whether in print, on the Internet or through other media, the value of our brands may be harmed, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, including the failure of our brands and branded products to achieve and maintain market acceptance. There can be no assurance that all of the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property in the United States and in foreign countries will be adequate. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States.\nWe or our suppliers maintain the seasonings and additives for our chicken, biscuits and other offerings, as well as certain standards, specifications and operating procedures, as trade secrets or confidential information. We may not be able to prevent the unauthorized disclosure or use of our trade secrets or information, despite the existence of confidentiality agreements and other measures. While we try to ensure that the quality of our brand and branded products is maintained by all of our franchisees, we cannot be certain that these franchisees will not take actions that adversely affect the value of our intellectual property or reputation. If any of our trade secrets or information were to be disclosed to or independently developed by a competitor, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nThird-party claims with respect to intellectual property assets, if decided against us, may result in competing uses or require adoption of new, non-infringing intellectual property, which may in turn adversely affect sales and revenues.\nThere can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement or misappropriation claims against us, or assert claims that our rights in our trademarks, service marks, trade dress and other intellectual property assets are invalid or unenforceable. Any such claims could have a material adverse effect on us or our franchisees if such claims were to be decided against us. If our rights in any intellectual property were invalidated or deemed unenforceable, it could permit competing uses of intellectual property which, in turn, could lead to a decline in restaurant revenues. If the intellectual property became subject to third-party infringement, misappropriation or other claims, and such claims were decided against us, we may be forced to pay damages, be required to develop or adopt non-infringing intellectual property or be obligated to acquire a license to the intellectual property that is the subject of the asserted claim. There could be significant expenses associated with the defense of any infringement, misappropriation, or other third-party claims.\nWe depend on our executive officers, the loss of whom could materially harm our business.\nWe rely upon the accumulated knowledge, skills and experience of our executive officers. If they were to leave us or become incapacitated, we might suffer in our planning and execution of business strategy and operations, impacting our brand and financial results. We also do not maintain any key man life insurance policies for any of our employees.\nMatters relating to employment and labor law may adversely affect our business.\nVarious federal and state labor laws govern our relationships with our employees and affect operating costs. These laws include employee classifications as exempt or non-exempt, minimum wage requirements, unemployment tax rates, workers\u2019 compensation rates, citizenship requirements and other wage and benefit requirements for employees classified as non-exempt. Significant additional government regulations and new laws, including mandating increases in minimum wages, changes in exempt and non-exempt status, or mandated benefits such as health insurance could materially affect our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flow. Since we self-insure our medical plan, increased medical claims could negatively impact our margins, as will the PPACA. Furthermore, if our or our franchisees\u2019 employees unionize, it could materially affect our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flow.\nWe are also subject in the ordinary course of business to employee claims against us based, among other things, on discrimination, harassment, wrongful termination, or violation of wage and labor laws, including a current lawsuit seeking class action status against us regarding overtime and exempt versus non-exempt status. Such claims could also be asserted against us by employees of our franchisees. Moreover, claims asserted against franchisees may at times be made against us as a franchisor. These claims may divert our financial and management resources that would otherwise be used to benefit our operations. The ongoing expense of any resulting lawsuits, and any substantial settlement payment or damage award against us, could adversely affect our business, brand image, employee recruitment, financial condition, operating results or cash flows.\nRestaurant companies have been the target of class action lawsuits and other proceedings alleging, among other things, violations of federal and state workplace and employment laws. Proceedings of this nature are costly, divert management attention and, if successful, could result in our payment of substantial damages or settlement costs.\nOur business is subject to the risk of litigation by employees, consumers, suppliers, franchisees, stockholders or others through private actions, class actions, administrative proceedings, regulatory actions or other litigation. The outcome of litigation, particularly class action and regulatory actions, is difficult to assess or quantify. In recent years, restaurant companies, including us, have been subject to lawsuits, including class action lawsuits, alleging violations of federal and state laws regarding workplace and employment conditions, discrimination and similar matters. A number of these lawsuits have resulted in the payment of substantial damages by the defendants. Similar lawsuits have been instituted from time to time alleging violations of various federal and state wage and hour laws regarding, among other things, employee meal deductions, overtime eligibility of managers and failure to pay for all hours worked. Though we do not believe any lawsuits in which we are currently involved will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources, we may in the future be subject to lawsuits that could have such an effect.\nOccasionally, our customers file complaints or lawsuits against us alleging that we are responsible for some illness or injury they suffered at or after a visit to one of our restaurants, including actions seeking damages resulting from food-borne illness or accidents in our restaurants. We are also subject to a variety of other claims from third parties arising in the ordinary course of our business, including contract claims. The restaurant industry has also been subject to a growing number of claims that the menus and actions of restaurant chains have led to the obesity of certain of their customers. We may also be subject to lawsuits from our employees, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission or others alleging violations of federal and state laws regarding workplace and employment conditions, discrimination and similar matters.\nRegardless of whether any claims against us are valid or whether we are liable, claims may be expensive to defend and may divert time and money away from our operations and result in increases in our insurance premiums. In addition, they may generate negative publicity, which could reduce customer traffic and sales. Although we maintain what we believe to be adequate levels of insurance, insurance may not be available at all or in sufficient amounts to cover any liabilities with respect to these or other matters. A judgment or other liability in excess of our insurance coverage for any claims or any adverse publicity resulting from claims could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nIf we or our franchisees face labor shortages or increased labor costs, our results of operations and our growth could be adversely affected.\nLabor is a primary component in the cost of operating our company-operated and franchised restaurants. If we or our franchisees face labor shortages or increased labor costs because of increased competition for employees, higher employee turnover rates, unionization of restaurant workers, or increases in the federally-mandated or state-mandated minimum wage, change in exempt and non-exempt status, or other employee benefits costs (including costs associated with health insurance coverage or workers\u2019 compensation insurance), our and our franchisees\u2019 operating expenses could increase and our growth could be adversely affected.\nWe have a substantial number of hourly employees who are paid wage rates at or based on the applicable federal or state minimum wage and increases in the minimum wage will increase our labor costs and the labor costs of our franchisees. The federal minimum wage has been $7.25 per hour since July 24, 2009. Federally-mandated, state-mandated or locally-mandated minimum wages may be raised in the future. As of the date hereof, 29 states and the District of Columbia have set a minimum wage level higher than the federal minimum wage. We may be unable to increase our menu prices in order to pass future increased labor costs on to our customers, in which case our margins would be negatively affected. Also, reduced margins of franchisees could make it more difficult to sell franchises. If menu prices are increased by us and our franchisees to cover increased labor costs, the\nhigher prices could adversely affect transactions which could lower sales and thereby reduce our margins and the royalties that we receive from franchisees.\nIn addition, our success depends in part upon our and our franchisees\u2019 ability to attract, motivate and retain a sufficient number of well-qualified restaurant operators, management personnel and other employees. Qualified individuals needed to fill these positions can be in short supply in some geographic areas, and in fiscal 2017 some of our stores experienced increased competition for qualified employees and were required to pay higher wages to hire employees. In addition, limited service restaurants have traditionally experienced relatively high employee turnover rates. Our turnover, which results in inefficiencies and higher labor costs, increased significantly in fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2017 at company-operated restaurants. In addition, the low unemployment rate and labor inflation have both contributed to an increase in our labor costs. Our and our franchisees\u2019 ability to recruit and retain employees may delay the planned openings of new restaurants or result in higher employee turnover in existing restaurants, which could increase our and our franchisees\u2019 labor costs and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. If we or our franchisees are unable to recruit and retain sufficiently qualified individuals, our business and our growth could be adversely affected. Competition for these employees could require us or our franchisees to pay higher wages, which could also result in higher labor costs.\nFinally, labor initiatives we or our franchisees implement across company-operated and franchised restaurants influence our labor costs. Certain initiatives, such as the expansion of our table service at company-operated restaurants, will increase our labor costs and overall operating expenses, which could adversely affect our growth. Changing the mix of full-time and part-time team members is another labor initiative that will influence our labor costs. Increasing our full-time team members at company-operated restaurants and/or franchised restaurants relative to part-time team members will result in higher labor costs for us and/or our franchisees, which could adversely affect our growth.\nWe are locked into long-term and non-cancelable leases and may be unable to renew leases at the end of their terms.\nMany of our restaurant leases are non-cancelable and typically have initial terms up to between 15 and 20 years and three renewal terms of five years each that we may exercise at our option. We expect closures of underperforming company-operated restaurants during fiscal 2018, and potentially in subsequent years, to exceed levels experienced in recent years. Even if we close a restaurant, we are required to perform our obligations under the applicable lease, which could include, among other things, a provision for a closed restaurant reserve when the restaurant is closed, which would impact our profitability, and payment of the base rent, property taxes, insurance and maintenance for the balance of the lease term. In addition, in connection with leases for restaurants that we will continue to operate, we may, at the end of the lease term and any renewal period for a restaurant, be unable to renew the lease without substantial additional cost, if at all. As a result, we may close or relocate the restaurant, which could subject us to construction and other costs and risks. Additionally, the revenues and profit, if any, generated at a relocated restaurant may not equal the revenues and profit generated at the existing restaurant.\nWe and our franchisees are subject to extensive government regulations that could result in claims leading to increased costs and restrict our ability to operate or sell franchises.\nWe and our franchisees are subject to extensive government regulation at the federal, state and local government levels. These include, but are not limited to, regulations relating to the preparation and sale of food, zoning and building codes, franchising, land use and employee, health, sanitation and safety matters. We and our franchisees are required to obtain and maintain a wide variety of governmental licenses, permits and approvals. Difficulty or failure in obtaining them in the future could result in delaying or canceling the opening of new restaurants. Local authorities may suspend or deny renewal of our governmental licenses if they determine that our operations do not meet the standards for initial grant or renewal. This risk would be even higher if there were a major change in the licensing requirements affecting our types of restaurants.\nThe PPACA requires employers such as us to provide adequate and affordable health insurance for all qualifying employees or pay a monthly per-employee fee or penalty for non-compliance beginning in fiscal 2015. The PPACA increased our costs in providing health insurance for our employees beginning in fiscal 2015, and we expect additional increases in future years.\nWe are also subject to regulation by the Federal Trade Commission and subject to state laws that govern the offer, sale, renewal and termination of franchises and our relationship with our franchisees. The failure to comply with these laws and regulations in any jurisdiction or to obtain required approvals could result in a ban or temporary suspension on franchise sales, fines or the requirement that we make a rescission offer to franchisees, any of which could affect our ability to open new restaurants in the future and thus could materially adversely affect our business and operating results. Any such failure could also subject us to liability to our franchisees.\nCompliance with environmental laws may negatively affect our business.\nWe are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations, including those concerning waste disposal, pollution, protection of the environment, and the presence, discharge, storage, handling, release and disposal of, and exposure to, hazardous or toxic substances. These environmental laws provide for significant fines and penalties for non-compliance and liabilities for remediation, sometimes without regard to whether the owner or operator of the property knew of, or was responsible for, the release or presence of hazardous toxic substances. Third parties may also make claims against owners or operators of properties for personal injuries and property damage associated with releases of, or actual or alleged exposure to, such hazardous or toxic substances at, on or from our restaurants. Environmental conditions relating to the presence of hazardous substances at prior, existing or future restaurant sites could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, environmental laws and regulations, and the administration, interpretation and enforcement thereof, are subject to change and may become more stringent in the future, each of which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLegislation and regulations requiring the display and provision of nutritional information for our menu offerings, and new information or attitudes regarding diet and health or adverse opinions about the health effects of consuming our menu offerings, could affect consumer preferences and negatively impact our results of operations.\nGovernment regulation and consumer eating habits may impact our business as a result of changes in attitudes regarding diet and health or new information regarding the health effects of consuming our menu offerings, including our buttermilk biscuits, legendary sweet tea and bone-in fried chicken. These changes have resulted in, and may continue to result in, the enactment of laws and regulations that impact the ingredients and nutritional content of our menu offerings, or laws and regulations requiring us to disclose the nutritional content of our food offerings.\nThe PPACA establishes a uniform, federal requirement for certain restaurants to post certain nutritional information on their menus. Specifically, the PPACA amended the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act to require chain restaurants with 20 or more locations operating under the same name and offering substantially the same menus to publish the total number of calories of standard menu items on menus and menu boards, along with a statement that puts this calorie information in the context of a total daily calorie intake. In May 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d) extended the compliance date for the menu labeling requirements from May 5, 2017 to May 7, 2018. The PPACA also requires covered restaurants to, as of May 7, 2018, provide to consumers, upon request, a written summary of detailed nutritional information for each standard menu item, and to provide a statement on menus and menu boards about the availability of this information. The PPACA further permits the FDA to require covered restaurants to make additional nutrient disclosures, such as disclosure of trans-fat content. An unfavorable report on, or reaction to, our menu ingredients, the size of our portions or the nutritional content of our menu items could negatively influence the demand for our offerings.\nFurthermore, a number of states, counties and cities have enacted menu labeling laws requiring multi-unit restaurant operators to disclose certain nutritional information to customers, or have enacted legislation restricting the use of certain types of ingredients in restaurants.\nCompliance with current and future laws and regulations regarding the ingredients and nutritional content of our menu items may be costly and time-consuming. Additionally, if consumer health regulations or consumer eating habits change significantly, we may be required to modify or discontinue certain menu items, and we may experience higher costs associated with the implementation of those changes. Additionally, some government authorities are increasing regulations regarding trans-fats and sodium, which may require us to limit or eliminate trans-fats and sodium in our menu offerings or switch to higher cost ingredients or may hinder our ability to operate in certain markets. Some jurisdictions have banned certain cooking ingredients, such as trans-fats, which a limited number of our menu products contain in small, but measurable amounts, or have discussed banning certain products, such as large sodas. Removal of these products and ingredients from our menus could affect product tastes, customer satisfaction levels, and sales volumes, whereas if we fail to comply with these laws or regulations, our business could experience a material adverse effect.\nWe cannot make any assurances regarding our ability to effectively respond to changes in consumer health perceptions or our ability to successfully implement the nutrient content disclosure requirements and to adapt our menu offerings to trends in eating habits. The imposition of additional menu-labeling laws could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position, as well as on the restaurant industry in general.\nWe may become subject to liabilities arising from environmental laws that could likely increase our operating expenses and materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe are subject to federal, state and local laws, regulations and ordinances that:\n\u2022\ngovern activities or operations that may have adverse environmental effects, such as discharges to air and water, as well as waste handling and disposal practices for solid and hazardous wastes; and\n\u2022\nimpose liability for the costs of cleaning up, and damage resulting from, sites of past spills, disposals or other releases of hazardous materials.\nIn particular, under applicable environmental laws, we may be responsible for remediation of environmental conditions and may be subject to associated liabilities, including liabilities for clean-up costs and personal injury or property damage, relating to our restaurants and the land on which our restaurants are located, regardless of whether we lease or own the restaurants or land in question and regardless of whether such environmental conditions were created by us or by a prior owner or tenant. If we are found liable for the costs of remediating contamination at any of our properties, our operating expenses would likely increase and our results of operations would be materially adversely affected. See \u201cBusiness-Environmental Matters.\u201d Some of our leases provide for indemnification of our landlords for environmental contamination, clean-up or owner liability.\nWe are exposed to the risk of natural disasters, unusual weather conditions, pandemic outbreaks, political events, war and terrorism that could disrupt business and result in lower sales, increased operating costs and capital expenditures.\nOur headquarters, company-operated and franchised restaurant locations, third-party sole distributor and its facilities, as well as certain of our vendors and customers, are located in areas which have been and could be subject to natural disasters such as floods, hurricanes, tornadoes, fires or earthquakes. Adverse weather conditions or other extreme changes in the weather, including resulting electrical and technological failures, especially such events which occur in North Carolina or South Carolina, as a result of the concentration of our restaurants, may disrupt our and our franchisees\u2019 business and may adversely affect our and our franchisees\u2019 ability to obtain food and supplies and sell menu items. Our business may be harmed if our or our franchisees\u2019 ability to obtain food and supplies and sell menu items is impacted by any such events, any of which could\ninfluence customer trends and purchases and may negatively impact our and our franchisees\u2019 revenues, properties or operations. Such events could result in physical damage to one or more of our or our franchisees\u2019 properties, the temporary closure of some or all of our company-operated restaurants, franchised restaurants and third-party sole distributor, the temporary lack of an adequate work force in a market, temporary or long-term disruption in the transport of goods, delay in the delivery of goods and supplies to our company-operated and franchised restaurants and third-party sole distributor, disruption of our technology support or information systems, or fuel shortages or dramatic increases in fuel prices, all of which would increase the cost of doing business. These events also could have indirect consequences such as increases in the costs of insurance if they result in significant loss of property or other insurable damage. Any of these factors, or any combination thereof, could adversely affect our operations.\nBecause of our international franchised restaurants, we could be adversely affected by violations of the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery and anti-kickback laws.\nWe currently have three franchised locations located outside the United States. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and other similar anti-bribery and anti-kickback laws and regulations, generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in preventing our franchisees or other agents from taking actions in violation of these laws or regulations. Such violations, or allegations of such violations, could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nIf the ownership of our common stock continues to be highly concentrated, it may prevent minority stockholders from influencing significant corporate decisions and may result in conflicts of interest.\nAdvent International Corporation (\u201cAdvent\u201d) indirectly beneficially owns approximately 51% of our outstanding common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2017. As a result, Advent indirectly beneficially owns shares sufficient for majority votes over all matters requiring stockholder votes, including: the election of directors; mergers, consolidations and acquisitions; the sale of all or substantially all of our assets and other decisions affecting our capital structure; amendments to our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws; and our winding up and dissolution.\nThis concentration of ownership may delay, deter or prevent acts that would be favored by our other stockholders. The interests of Advent may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of our other stockholders. This concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying, preventing or deterring a change in control of us. Also, Advent may seek to cause us to take courses of action that, in its judgment, could enhance its investment in us, but which might involve risks to our other stockholders or adversely affect us or our other stockholders. As a result, the market price of our common stock could decline or stockholders might not receive a premium over the then-current market price of our common stock upon a change in control. In addition, this concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock because investors may perceive disadvantages in owning shares in a company with significant stockholders.\nThe interests of Advent may conflict with ours or those of our other stockholders in the future.\nAdvent engages in a range of investing activities, including investments in restaurants and other consumer-related companies in particular. In the ordinary course of its business activities, Advent may engage in activities where its interests conflict with our interests or those of our other stockholders. Our amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains provisions renouncing any interest or expectancy held by our directors affiliated with Advent in certain corporate opportunities. Accordingly, the interests of Advent may supersede ours, causing them or their affiliates to compete against us or to pursue opportunities instead of us, for which we\nhave no recourse. Such actions on the part of Advent and inaction on our part could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, Advent may have an interest in pursuing acquisitions, divestitures and other transactions that, in its judgment, could enhance its investment in us, even though such transactions might involve risks to our stockholders, including, without limitation, debt financed acquisitions, repurchases of stock and dividends.\nAs a controlled company, we are not subject to all of the corporate governance rules of NASDAQ.\nWe are considered a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d under the rules of NASDAQ. Controlled companies are exempt from NASDAQ corporate governance rules requiring that listed companies have (i) a majority of the board of directors consist of \u201cindependent\u201d directors under the listing standards of NASDAQ, (ii) a nominating/corporate governance committee composed entirely of independent directors and a written nominating/corporate governance committee charter meeting NASDAQ requirements and (iii) a compensation committee composed entirely of independent directors and a written compensation committee charter meeting the requirements of NASDAQ. As a result of relying on certain of these exceptions, our nominating and corporate governance committee does not consist entirely of independent directors. While we have chosen not to rely on certain of the exceptions, we may in the future choose to rely on such exceptions as long as we continue to be a controlled company. Accordingly, our stockholders may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of NASDAQ.\nBojangles\u2019, Inc. is a holding company with no operations and relies on its operating subsidiaries to provide it with funds necessary to meet its financial obligations and to pay dividends.\nBojangles\u2019, Inc. is a holding company with no material direct operations. Bojangles\u2019, Inc.\u2019s principal assets are the equity interests it directly or indirectly holds in its operating subsidiaries which own our operating assets. As a result, Bojangles\u2019, Inc. is dependent on loans, dividends and other payments from its operating subsidiaries to generate the funds necessary to meet its financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock. Its subsidiaries are legally distinct from Bojangles\u2019, Inc. and may be prohibited or restricted from paying dividends, including the restrictions contained in our term loan and revolving credit facility described below, or otherwise making funds available to us under certain conditions. Although Bojangles\u2019, Inc. does not expect to pay dividends on its common stock for the foreseeable future, if it is unable to obtain funds from its subsidiaries, it may be unable to, or its board may exercise its discretion not to, pay dividends.\nWe do not anticipate paying any dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future.\nWe do not expect to declare or pay any cash or other dividends in the foreseeable future on our common stock because we intend to use cash flow generated by operations to grow our business. Our term loan and revolving credit facility restrict our ability to pay cash dividends on our common stock. We may also enter into other credit agreements or other borrowing arrangements in the future that restrict or limit our ability to pay cash dividends on our common stock. As a result, our stockholders may not receive any return on an investment in our common stock unless they sell our common stock for a price greater than that which they paid for it.\nIf we are unable maintain compliance with the requirements for continued listing on the NASDAQ Global Select Market, our common stock may be delisted and the price of our common stock could be negatively impacted.\nOur common stock is currently listed for trading on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. We must satisfy NASDAQ\u2019s continued listing requirements or risk delisting, which would have a material adverse effect on our business. A delisting of our common stock from the NASDAQ Global Select Market could materially reduce the liquidity of our common stock, resulting in a corresponding material reduction in the price of our common stock, and may result in the potential loss of confidence by investors, suppliers, customers and employees and fewer business development opportunities.\nAs a public company, we incur significant costs to comply with the laws and regulations affecting public companies which could harm our business and results of operations.\nAs a public company, we are subject to the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended (the \u201cSarbanes-Oxley Act\u201d), and the listing requirements of NASDAQ, and other applicable securities rules and regulations. These rules and regulations have increased and will continue to increase our legal, accounting and financial compliance costs and have made and will continue to make some activities more time consuming and costly, particularly after we cease to be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as defined in the JOBS Act. For example, these rules and regulations could make it more difficult and more costly for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or to incur substantial costs to maintain the same or similar coverage. These rules and regulations could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors or our board committees or as executive officers. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. As a result, management\u2019s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could harm our business and operating results. In fiscal 2015, we hired additional employees to comply with these requirements. Despite the increase in headcount, we will need to hire more employees in the future, which will further increase our costs and expenses.\nOur management team and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to new compliance initiatives and we may not successfully or efficiently manage our ongoing transition to a public company. To comply with the requirements of being a public company, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, we have undertaken and will continue to undertake various actions, such as implementing new internal controls and procedures and hiring accounting or internal audit staff, which will require us to incur additional expenses and harm our results of operations.\nOur management has limited experience managing a public company and our current resources may not be sufficient to fulfill our public company obligations.\nAs a public company, we are subject to various regulatory requirements, including those of the SEC and NASDAQ. These requirements include record keeping, financial reporting and corporate governance rules and regulations. Our management team has limited experience in managing a public company and, historically, has not had the resources typically found in a public company. Our internal infrastructure may not be adequate to support our increased reporting obligations and we may be unable to hire, train or retain necessary staff and may be reliant on engaging outside consultants or professionals to overcome our lack of experience or employees. Our business could be adversely affected if our internal infrastructure is inadequate, we are unable to engage outside consultants or are otherwise unable to fulfill our public company obligations.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research, do not continue to publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. Moreover, if our operating results do not meet the expectations of the investor community, or one or more of the analysts who cover our company downgrade our stock, our stock price could decline.\nFor as long as we are an emerging growth company, we will not be required to comply with certain reporting requirements, including those relating to accounting standards and disclosure about our executive compensation, that apply to other public companies.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in Section 2(a) of the Securities Act, as modified by the JOBS Act. As such, we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements\nthat are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies,\u201d including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a non-binding advisory vote on executive compensation and of stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We take advantage of some of these exceptions, and we do not know if some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result. The result may be a less-active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nIn addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards. In other words, an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies. We have irrevocably elected not to avail ourselves of this exemption and, therefore, we will be subject to the same new or revised accounting standards as other public companies that are not emerging growth companies.\nWe could remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d until December 27, 2020 or until the earliest of (a) the last day of the first fiscal year in which our annual gross revenues exceed $1.07 billion, (b) the date that we become a \u201clarge accelerated filer\u201d as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, which would occur if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter, or (c) the date on which we have issued more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt securities in the preceding three-year period.\nIf we fail to establish and maintain an effective system of integrated internal controls, we may not be able to report our financial results accurately, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEnsuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place so that we can produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort that will need to be evaluated frequently. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires public companies to conduct an annual review and evaluation of their internal controls and attestations by independent auditors regarding the effectiveness of internal controls. We currently qualify as an emerging growth company, and thus, we are exempt from the auditors\u2019 attestation requirement until such time as we no longer qualify as an emerging growth company. Regardless of whether we qualify as an emerging growth company, we still need to implement substantial control systems and procedures in order to satisfy the reporting requirements under the Exchange Act and applicable NASDAQ requirements, among other items. Establishing these internal controls have been and will continue to be costly and may divert management\u2019s attention.\nEvaluation by us of our internal controls over financial reporting may identify material weaknesses that may cause us to be unable to report our financial information on a timely basis and thereby subject us to adverse regulatory consequences, including sanctions by the SEC or violations of NASDAQ listing rules. There also could be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of investor confidence in us and the reliability of our financial statements. Confidence in the reliability of our financial statements also could suffer if we or our independent registered public accounting firm were to report a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting. This could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price.\nThe market price and trading volume of our common stock has been and may be volatile, which could result in rapid and substantial losses for our stockholders, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nPrior to our IPO, there had been no public market for our common stock. Shares of our common stock were sold in our IPO in May 2015 at a price of $19.00 per share. During fiscal year 2015, our common stock traded as high\nas $28.45 and as low as $14.70. During fiscal year 2016, our common stock traded as high as $20.15 and as low as $13.39. During fiscal year 2017, our common stock traded as high as $22.35 and as low as $11.45. An active, liquid and orderly market for our common stock may not be sustained, which could depress the trading price of our common stock or cause it to be highly volatile or subject to wide fluctuations. The market price of our common stock has and may continue to fluctuate or may decline significantly in the future. Some of the factors that could negatively affect our share price or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of our common stock include:\n\u2022\nvariations in our quarterly or annual operating results;\n\u2022\nchanges in our earnings estimates (if provided) or differences between our actual financial and operating results and those expected by investors and analysts;\n\u2022\nthe contents of published research reports about us or our industry or the failure of securities analysts to cover our common stock;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key management personnel;\n\u2022\nany increased indebtedness we may incur in the future;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or others and developments affecting us;\n\u2022\nactions by institutional stockholders;\n\u2022\nlitigation and governmental investigations;\n\u2022\nlegislative or regulatory changes;\n\u2022\njudicial pronouncements interpreting laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nchanges in government programs;\n\u2022\nchanges in market valuations of similar companies;\n\u2022\nspeculation or reports by the press or investment community with respect to us or our industry in general;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, dispositions, restaurant closures, strategic relationships, joint ventures or capital commitments; and\n\u2022\ngeneral market, political and economic conditions, including local conditions in the markets in which we operate.\nThese broad market and industry factors may decrease the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. The stock market in general has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations, including recently. In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and decreases in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources.\nFuture offerings of debt or equity securities by us may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nIn the future, we may attempt to obtain financing or to further increase our capital resources by issuing additional shares of our common stock or by offering debt or other equity securities, including senior or subordinated notes, debt securities convertible into equity or shares of preferred stock. Opening new company-operated restaurants in existing and new markets could require substantial additional capital in excess of cash from operations. We would expect to finance the capital required for new company-operated restaurants through a combination of additional issuances of equity, corporate indebtedness, leases and cash from operations.\nIssuing additional shares of our common stock or other equity securities or securities convertible into equity may dilute the economic and voting rights of our existing stockholders or reduce the market price of our common stock or both. Upon liquidation, holders of such debt securities and preferred shares, if issued, and lenders with respect to other borrowings would receive a distribution of our available assets prior to the holders of our common stock. Debt securities convertible into equity could be subject to adjustments in the conversion ratio pursuant to which certain events may increase the number of equity securities issuable upon conversion. Preferred shares, if issued, could have a preference with respect to liquidating distributions or a preference with respect to dividend payments that could limit our ability to pay dividends to the holders of our common stock. Our decision to issue securities in any future offering will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, which may adversely affect the amount, timing, or nature of our future offerings. Thus, holders of our common stock bear the risk that our future offerings may reduce the market price of our common stock and dilute their stockholdings in us.\nThe market price of our common stock could be negatively affected by sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public markets.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had 36,899,194 shares of common stock outstanding. Of our issued and outstanding shares, all common stock is freely transferable, except for any shares held by our \u201caffiliates,\u201d as that term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act. Approximately 51% of our outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2017 is beneficially owned by Advent, and can be resold into the public markets in the future in accordance with the requirements of Rule 144.\nSales or distributions of substantial amounts of our common stock, or the perception that such sales or distributions could occur, may cause the market price of our common stock to decline. A decline in the price of our common stock might impede our ability to raise capital through the issuance of additional common stock or other equity securities.\nPursuant to our stockholders\u2019 agreement, certain of our stockholders may require us to file registration statements under the Securities Act at our expense, covering resales of our common stock held by them or piggyback on a registration statement in certain circumstances. Any such sales, or the prospect of any such sales, could materially impact the market price of our common stock.\nThe future issuance of additional common stock in connection with the Amended and Restated 2011 Equity Incentive Plan, acquisitions or otherwise will dilute all other stockholdings.\nAs of December 31, 2017, we had an aggregate of 105,602,167 shares of common stock authorized but unissued and not reserved for issuance under the Amended and Restated 2011 Equity Incentive Plan (the \u201cAmended 2011 Plan\u201d). We may issue all of these shares of common stock without any action or approval by our stockholders, subject to certain exceptions. Any common stock issued in connection with the Amended 2011 Plan, the exercise of outstanding stock options, or otherwise, would dilute the percentage ownership held investors.\nDelaware law and our organizational documents, as well as our existing and future debt agreements, may impede or discourage a takeover, which could deprive our investors of the opportunity to receive a premium for their shares.\nWe are a Delaware corporation, and the anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law impose various impediments to the ability of a third-party to acquire control of us, even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws may make it more difficult for, or prevent a third-party from, acquiring control of us without the approval of our board of directors. Among other things, these provisions:\n\u2022\nprovide for a classified board of directors with staggered three-year terms;\n\u2022\ndo not permit cumulative voting in the election of directors, which would otherwise allow less than a majority of stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u2022\ndelegate the sole power of a majority of the board of directors to fix the number of directors;\n\u2022\nprovide the power of our board of directors to fill any vacancy on our board of directors, whether such vacancy occurs as a result of an increase in the number of directors or otherwise;\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock without any need for action by stockholders;\n\u2022\neliminate the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominations for election to our board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings; and\n\u2022\nprovide that a 66 2\u20443% supermajority vote will be required to amend or repeal provisions relating to, among other things, the classification of the board of directors, the filling of vacancies on the board of directors and the advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and director nominations.\nIn addition, our term loan and revolving credit facility imposes, and we anticipate that documents governing our future indebtedness may impose, limitations on our ability to enter into change of control transactions. Thereunder, the occurrence of a change of control transaction could constitute an event of default permitting acceleration of the indebtedness, thereby impeding our ability to enter into certain transactions.\nThe foregoing factors, as well as the significant common stock ownership by Advent could impede a merger, takeover, or other business combination, or discourage a potential investor from making a tender offer for our common stock, which, under certain circumstances, could reduce the market value of our common stock.\nOur amended and restated bylaws designate the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees.\nOur amended and restated bylaws provide that, subject to certain exceptions, unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware shall be the sole and exclusive forum for (A) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (B) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, (C) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, or DGCL, our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws, or (D) any action asserting a claim against us governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers, or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers, and other employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find this provision of our amended and restated bylaws inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.", "PERMNO": 15363, "SIC": 5812, "TIC": "BOJA"}
