{"cik": "1102112", "company": "PACWEST BANCORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-28", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIn the course of conducting our business operations, we are exposed to a variety of risks, some of which are inherent in the financial services industry and others of which are more specific to our own businesses. The discussion below addresses the most significant factors, of which we are currently aware, that could affect our businesses, results of operations and financial condition. Additional factors that could affect our businesses, results of operations and financial condition are discussed in \"Item 1. Business - Forward-Looking Information.\" However, other factors not discussed below or elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K could adversely affect our businesses, results of operations and financial condition. Therefore, the risk factors below should not be considered a complete list of potential risks we may face.\nAny risk factor described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in any of our other SEC filings could by itself, or together with other factors, materially adversely affect our liquidity, cash flows, competitive position, business, reputation, results of operations, capital position or financial condition, including materially increasing our expenses or decreasing our revenues, which could result in material losses.\nGeneral Economic and Market Conditions Risk\nOur business is adversely affected by unfavorable economic, market, and political conditions.\nThe United States economy has been in a ten-year expansion since the Great Recession ended in 2009. This current expansion has been longer than most U.S. expansionary periods in recent history. Going into 2020, while global economic growth has continued and the underlying macroeconomic environment remains largely positive, there continue to be various economic, market and political risks and uncertainties that could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operation.\nIn the event of an economic recession, our operating results could be adversely affected because we could experience higher loan and lease charge-offs and higher operating costs. Global economic conditions also affect our operating results because global economic conditions directly influence the U.S. economic conditions. Brexit has the potential to impact global economic conditions which may in turn impact U.S. economic conditions, but we would not expect any direct impact as we do not operate in the United Kingdom. Various market conditions also affect our operating results. Real estate market conditions directly affect performance of our loans secured by real estate. Debt markets affect the availability of credit which impacts the rates and terms at which we offer loans and leases. Stock market downturns often signal broader economic deterioration and/or a downward trend in business earnings which may adversely affect businesses\u2019 ability to raise capital and/or service their debts.\nAn economic recession or a downturn in various markets could have one or more of the following adverse effects on our business:\n\u2022\na decrease in the demand for our loans and leases and other products and services offered by us;\n\u2022\na decrease in our deposit balances due to overall reductions in the accounts of customers;\n\u2022\na decrease in the value of collateral securing our loans and leases;\n\u2022\nan increase in the level of nonperforming and classified loans and leases:\n\u2022\nan increase in provisions for credit losses and loan and lease charge-offs;\n\u2022\na decrease in net interest income derived from our lending and deposit gathering activities;\n\u2022\na decrease in the Company's stock price;\n\u2022\na decrease in our ability to access the capital markets; or\n\u2022\nan increase in our operating expenses associated with attending to the effects of certain circumstances listed above.\nOur ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to our success.\nOur employees are our most important resource, and in many areas of the financial services industry, competition for qualified personnel is intense. We endeavor to attract talented and diverse new employees and retain and motivate our existing employees to assist in executing our growth, acquisition, and business strategies. We also seek to retain proven, experienced senior employees with superior talent, augmented from time to time by external hires, to provide continuity of succession of our executive management team. In addition, the Company\u2019s Board oversees succession planning, including review of the succession plans for the Chief Executive Officer and other members of executive management. Losses of or changes in our current executive officers or other key personnel, or the inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nCredit Risk\nCredit Risk is the Risk of Loss Arising from the Inability or Failure of a Borrower or Counterparty To Meet Its Obligation.\nWe may not recover all amounts that are contractually owed to us by our borrowers.\nWe are dependent on the collection of loan and lease principal, interest, and fees to partially fund our operations. A shortfall in collections and proceeds may impair our ability to fund our operations or to repay our existing debt.\nWhen we loan money, commit to loan money or enter into a letter of credit or other contract with a counterparty, we incur credit risk. The credit quality of our portfolio can have a significant impact on our earnings. We expect to experience charge-offs and delinquencies on our loans and leases in the future. Our clients' actual operating results may be worse than our underwriting indicated when we originated the loans and leases, and in these circumstances, if timely corrective actions are not taken, we could incur substantial impairment or loss of the value on these loans and leases. We may fail to identify problems because our client did not report them in a timely manner or, even if the client did report the problem, we may fail to address it quickly enough or at all. Even if clients provide us with full and accurate disclosure of all material information concerning their businesses, we may misinterpret or incorrectly analyze this information. Mistakes may cause us to make loans and leases that we otherwise would not have made or to fund advances that we otherwise would not have funded, either of which could result in losses on loans and leases, or necessitate that we significantly increase our allowance for loan and lease losses. As a result, we could suffer loan losses and have nonperforming loans and leases, which could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings and results of operations and financial condition, to the extent the losses exceed our allowance for loan and lease losses.\nSome of our loans and leases are secured by a lien on specified collateral of the borrower and we may not obtain or properly perfect our liens or the value of the collateral securing any particular loan may not protect us from suffering a partial or complete loss if the loan becomes nonperforming and we proceed to foreclose on or repossess the collateral. In such event, we could suffer loan losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our net earnings, allowance for loan and lease losses, financial condition, and results of operations.\nAdditionally, loans to venture-backed companies support the borrowers\u2019 operations, including operating losses, working capital requirements and fixed asset acquisitions. Venture-backed borrowers are at various stages in their development and are, generally, reporting operating losses. The primary sources of repayment are future additional venture capital equity investments or the sale of the company or its assets. Our venture-backed borrowers\u2019 business plans may fail, increasing the likelihood for credit losses related to loans to venture-backed companies.\nAt December 31, 2019 and 2018, loans to venture-backed companies totaled $980.2 million, or 5% of total loans and leases, and $1.2 billion, or 7% of total loans and leases. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, net charge-offs related to venture-backed borrowers totaled $1.2 million and $24.2 million. For these years, net charge-offs related to venture-back borrowers comprised 7% and 55% of total net charge-offs. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, we maintain an allowance for loan and lease losses to provide for loan defaults and non-performance. Our allowance for loan and lease losses allocable to loans to venture-backed borrowers may not be adequate to absorb actual credit losses arising from these loans, and future provisions for credit losses could materially and adversely affect our operating results.\nOur allowance for credit losses may not be adequate to cover actual losses.\nIn accordance with U.S. GAAP, we maintain an allowance for loan and lease losses to provide for loan and lease defaults and non-performance and a reserve for unfunded loan commitments, which, when combined, we refer to as the allowance for credit losses. Our allowance for credit losses may not be adequate to absorb actual credit losses, and future provisions for credit losses could materially and adversely affect our operating results. Our allowance for credit losses is based on prior experience and an evaluation of the risks inherent in the current portfolio. The amount of future losses is influenced by changes in economic, operating and other conditions, including changes in interest rates that may be beyond our control, and these losses may exceed current estimates.\nFurther impacting the sufficiency of our current allowance for credit losses is the implementation of a new accounting standard, \u201cMeasurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,\u201d commonly referred to as the \u201cCurrent Expected Credit Losses\u201d standard, or \u201cCECL,\u201d which is effective on January 1, 2020. CECL changes the allowance for credit losses methodology from an incurred loss concept to an expected loss concept, which is even more dependent on future economic forecasts, assumptions and models than existing U.S. GAAP and could result in increases and add volatility to our allowance for credit losses and future provisions for loan losses. These forecasts, assumptions and models are inherently uncertain and are based upon management\u2019s reasonable judgment in light of information currently available.\nOur federal and state regulators, as an integral part of their examination process, review our loans and leases and allowance for credit losses. While we believe our allowance for credit losses is appropriate for the risk identified in our loan and lease portfolio, we cannot provide assurance that we will not further increase the allowance for credit losses, that it will be sufficient to address losses, or that regulators will not require us to increase this allowance. We also cannot be certain that actual results will be consistent with forecasts and assumptions used in our CECL modeling. Any of these occurrences could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. See \"Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" for more information.\nOur loans and leases are concentrated by location, collateral value, and borrower type which could exacerbate credit losses if certain markets or industries were to experience economic difficulties or operating issues.\nReal estate mortgage loans and real estate construction and land loans comprised 57% of our total loans and leases at December 31, 2019. Of total loans and leases, 35% are secured by real estate collateral located in California, 25% are secured by multi-family properties, and 6% are secured by commercial real estate construction projects.\nFor real estate mortgage loans, the respective primary and secondary sources of loan repayments are the net operating incomes of the properties and the proceeds from the sales or refinancing of the properties. For real estate construction and land loans, the primary source of loan repayments is the proceeds from the sales or refinancing of the properties following the completion of construction and the stabilization/attainment of sufficient debt service coverage. As such, our commercial real estate borrowers generally are required to refinance the loans with us or another lender or sell the properties to repay our loans.\nWe have a number of large credit relationships and individual commitments.\nAt December 31, 2019, there were ten individual real estate construction and land commitments greater than or equal to $100 million with the largest commitment being $150 million. At December 31, 2019, these ten individual commitments totaled $1.2 billion and had an aggregate outstanding balance of $451 million. The projects financed by these commitments were a hotel, three mixed use properties, and six multi-family projects. For these ten commitments, the average commitment to budgeted projected cost ratio was 52.4%.\nAt December 31, 2019, we had 11 individual loan commitments greater than or equal to $150 million that ranged in size from $150 million to $300 million and totaled $2.1 billion and had an aggregate outstanding balance of $720 million. Seven of these commitments totaling $1.4 billion were equity fund loans, three of these commitments totaling $500 million were lender finance & timeshare loans, and one of these commitments totaling $150 million was a commercial construction loan.\nA significant loss related to one of our large lending relationships or individual commitments could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nA slowdown in venture capital investment levels may reduce the market for venture capital investment for our Venture Banking clients, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nPart of our strategy is focused on providing banking products and credit to entrepreneurial and venture-backed businesses, including in particular early- and expansion-stage companies that receive financial support from sophisticated investors, including venture capital or private equity firms, and corporate investors. We derive a significant portion of deposits, including large deposits, from these companies and provide them with loans as well as other banking products and services. In many cases, our credit decisions are based on our analysis of the likelihood that our venture capital-backed clients will receive additional rounds of equity capital from investors. If the amount of capital available to such companies decreases, we could suffer loan losses, which could have a material adverse effect on our deposit balances, net earnings, allowance for loan and lease losses, financial condition, and results of operations.\nMarket Risk\nMarket Risk Is the Risk That Market Conditions May Adversely Impact the Value of Assets or Liabilities or Otherwise Negatively Impact Earnings. Market Risk Is Inherent To the Financial Instruments Associated with Our Operations, Including Loans, Deposits, Securities, Short-term Borrowings, Long-term Debt, and Derivatives.\nOur business is subject to interest rate risk, and variations in interest rates may materially and adversely affect our financial performance.\nChanges in the interest rate environment may reduce our profits. It is expected that we will continue to realize income from the differential or \"spread\" between the interest earned on loans, securities and other interest-earning assets, and interest paid on deposits, borrowings and other interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest spreads are affected by the difference between the maturities and repricing characteristics of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Changes in market interest rates generally affect loan volume, loan yields, funding sources and funding costs. Our net interest spread depends on many factors that are partly or completely out of our control, including competition, federal economic monetary and fiscal policies, and general economic conditions.\nWhile an increase in interest rates may increase our loan yield, it may adversely affect the ability of certain borrowers with variable rate loans to pay the contractual interest and principal due to us. Following an increase in interest rates, our ability to maintain a positive net interest spread is dependent on our ability to increase our loan offering rates, replace loans that mature and repay or that prepay before maturity with new originations, minimize increases on our deposit rates, and maintain an acceptable level and composition of funding. We cannot provide assurances that we will be able to increase our loan offering rates and continue to originate loans due to the competitive landscape in which we operate. Additionally, we cannot provide assurances that we can minimize the increases in our deposit rates while maintaining an acceptable level of deposits. Finally, we cannot provide any assurances that we can maintain our current levels of noninterest-bearing deposits as customers may seek higher-yielding products when interest rates increase.\nAccordingly, changes in levels of interest rates could materially and adversely affect our net interest spread, net interest margin, cost of deposits, asset quality, loan origination volume, average loan portfolio balance, liquidity, and overall profitability.\nWe May be Adversely Impacted by the Transition from LIBOR as a Reference Rate.\nThe Financial Conduct Authority has announced that the London Interbank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) will no longer be published after 2021. With LIBOR\u2019s expected discontinuance after 2021, there is uncertainty as to what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, or what the effect of any such changes in views or alternatives may be on the markets for LIBOR-indexed financial instruments. In response, the Alternative Reference Rates Committee (\u201cARRC\u201d) was convened in the U.S. to explore alternative reference rates and supporting processes. The ARRC identified a potential successor rate to LIBOR in the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) and crafted the Paced Transition Plan to facilitate the transition. However, there are conceptual and technical differences between LIBOR and SOFR that remain unresolved at this time.\nWe have a significant number of loans, some securities and borrowings, such as our TruPS, and one deposit product with attributes that are either directly or indirectly dependent on LIBOR. We have not yet determined the optimal reference rate(s) that we will ultimately use for our financial instruments going forward; however, it appears likely that it will be SOFR. We have organized a multidisciplinary project team to identify operational and contractual best practices, assess our risks, identify the detailed list of all financial instruments impacted, manage the transition, facilitate communication with our customers and counterparties, and monitor the impacts. We have already drafted and begun including fallback language in our loan agreements beginning in August of 2019. The transition from LIBOR could create considerable costs and additional risk. The uncertainty as to the nature and effect of the discontinuance of LIBOR may adversely affect the value of, the return on or the expenses associated with our financial assets and liabilities that are based on or are linked to LIBOR, may require extensive changes to the contracts that govern these LIBOR-based products as well as our systems and processes, and could impact our pricing and interest rate risk models, our loan product structures, our funding costs, our valuation tools and result in increased compliance and operational costs. In addition, the market transition away from LIBOR to an alternative reference rate could prompt inquiries or other actions from regulators in respect of our preparation and readiness for the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative reference rate, and result in disputes, litigation or other actions with counterparties regarding the interpretation and enforceability of certain fallback language in LIBOR-based financial instruments. Furthermore, failure to adequately manage this transition process with our customers could adversely impact our reputation.\nAlthough we are currently unable to assess the ultimate impact of the transition from LIBOR, the failure to adequately manage the transition could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe value of our securities in our investment portfolio may decline in the future.\nThe fair market value of our investment securities may be adversely affected by general economic and market conditions, including changes in interest rates, credit spreads, and the occurrence of any events adversely affecting the issuer of particular securities in our investments portfolio or any given market segment or industry in which we are invested. We analyze our securities on a quarterly basis to determine if an impairment has occurred. The process for determining whether any portion of the impairment is credit-related usually requires complex, subjective judgments about the future financial performance of the issuer in order to assess the probability of receiving principal and interest payments sufficient to recover our amortized cost of the security. Because of changing economic and market conditions affecting issuers, we may be required to recognize impairments in future periods, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nLiquidity Risk\nLiquidity Risk Is the Potential Inability to Meet Our Contractual and Contingent Financial Obligations, On- or Off-Balance Sheet, as They Become Due.\nWe are subject to liquidity risk, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nEffective liquidity management is essential for the operation of our business. Although we have implemented strategies to maintain sufficient and diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned, as well as unanticipated, changes in assets, liabilities, and off-balance sheet commitments under various economic conditions, an inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of investment securities and other sources could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry in general. Factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity due to a market disruption, a decrease in the borrowing capacity assigned to our pledged assets by our secured creditors, or adverse regulatory action against us. Deterioration in economic conditions and the loss of confidence in financial institutions may increase our cost of funding and limit our access to some of our customary sources of liquidity, including, but not limited to, inter-bank borrowings and borrowings from the FRBSF and FHLB. Our ability to acquire deposits or borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as a severe disruption of the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry generally as a result of conditions faced by banking organizations in the domestic and international credit markets.\nWe may be adversely affected by changes in the actual or perceived soundness or condition of other financial institutions.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial and financial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial institutions are closely related as a result of credit, trading, investment, liquidity management, clearing, counterparty and other relationships. Loss of public confidence in any one institution, including through default, could lead to liquidity and credit problems, losses, or defaults for other institutions. Even the perceived lack of creditworthiness of, or questions about, a counterparty may lead to market-wide liquidity and credit problems, losses, or defaults by various institutions. This systemic risk may adversely affect financial intermediaries, such as clearing agencies, banks and exchanges we interact with on a daily basis or key funding providers such as the Federal Home Loan Banks, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our access to liquidity or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nThe primary source of the holding company's liquidity from which we pay dividends, among other things, is the receipt of dividends from the Bank.\nThe holding company, PacWest, is a legal entity separate and distinct from the Bank and our other subsidiaries. The availability of dividends from the Bank is limited by various statutes and regulations. It is possible, depending upon the financial condition of the Bank and other factors, that the FRB, the FDIC and/or the DBO could assert that payment of dividends or other payments is an unsafe or unsound practice. In the event the Bank is unable to pay dividends to the holding company, it is likely that we, in turn, would have to discontinue capital distributions in the form of dividends or share repurchases and may have difficulty meeting our other financial obligations, including payments in respect of any outstanding indebtedness or subordinated debentures. The Bank may declare a dividend without the approval of the DBO and FDIC as long as the total dividends declared in a calendar year do not exceed either the retained earnings or the total of net earnings for the three previous fiscal years less any dividend paid during such period. The Bank's net earnings during the previous three fiscal years exceeded dividends paid by the Bank during that same period by $34.8 million. Since the Bank had an accumulated deficit of $490.6 million at December 31, 2019, for the foreseeable future, any cash dividends from the Bank to the holding company will continue to require DBO and FDIC approval. The inability of the Bank to pay dividends to the holding company could have a material adverse effect on our business, including the market price of our common stock.\nWe may reduce or discontinue the payment of dividends on common stock.\nOur stockholders are only entitled to receive such dividends as our Board may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. Although we have historically declared cash dividends on our common stock, we are not required to do so and may reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in the future. Our ability to pay dividends is subject to the restrictions set forth in Delaware law, by the FRB, and by certain covenants contained in our subordinated debentures. Notification to the FRB is also required prior to our declaring and paying a cash dividend during any period in which our quarterly and/or cumulative twelve-month net earnings are insufficient to fund the dividend amount, among other requirements. We may not pay a dividend if the FRB objects or until such time as we receive approval from the FRB or we no longer need to provide notice under applicable regulations. In addition, we may be restricted by applicable law or regulation or actions taken by our regulators, now or in the future, from paying dividends to our stockholders. We cannot provide assurance that we will continue paying dividends on our common stock at current levels or at all.\nCapital Risk\nWe are subject to capital adequacy standards, and a failure to meet these standards could adversely affect our financial condition.\nThe Company and the Bank are each subject to capital adequacy and liquidity rules and other regulatory requirements specifying minimum amounts and types of capital that must be maintained. From time to time, the regulators implement changes to these regulatory capital adequacy and liquidity guidelines. If we fail to meet these minimum capital and liquidity guidelines and other regulatory requirements, we may be restricted in the types of activities we may conduct and may be prohibited from taking certain capital actions, such as making TruPS payments or paying executive bonuses or dividends, and repurchasing or redeeming capital securities.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future and such capital may not be available when needed or at all.\nWe are required by federal and state regulators to maintain adequate levels of capital. We may need to raise additional capital in the future to meet regulatory or other internal requirements. As a publicly traded company, a likely source of additional funds is the capital markets, accomplished generally through the issuance of equity, both common and preferred stock, and the issuance of subordinated debentures. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on, among other things, conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside of our control, and our financial performance.\nWe cannot provide any assurance that access to such capital will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. Any occurrence that may limit our access to the capital markets, such as a decline in the confidence of debt purchasers or counter-parties participating in the capital markets, may materially and adversely affect our capital costs and our ability to raise capital and, in turn, our liquidity. Further, if we need to raise capital in the future, we may have to do so when many other financial institutions are also seeking to raise capital and would then have to compete with those institutions for investors. The inability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms when needed could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nRegulatory, Compliance and Legal Risk\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, which could materially and adversely affect our business.\nThe banking industry is extensively regulated and supervised under both federal and state laws and regulations that are intended primarily for the protection of depositors, customers, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole, not for the protection of our stockholders and creditors. The Company is subject to regulation and supervision by the FRB, and the Bank is subject to regulation and supervision by the FDIC, DBO and CFPB. The laws and regulations applicable to us govern a variety of matters, including, but not limited to, permissible types, amounts and terms of loans and investments we make, the maximum interest rate that may be charged, consumer disclosures on the products and services we offer, the amount of reserves we must hold against our customers' deposits, the types of deposits we may accept and the rates we may pay on such deposits, the establishment of new branch offices by the Bank, maintenance of adequate capital and liquidity, restrictions on dividends, and stock repurchases. We must obtain approval from our regulators before engaging in certain activities, including certain acquisitions, and there can be no assurance that any regulatory approvals we may require will be obtained, or obtained without conditions, either in a timely manner or at all. Our regulators have the ability to compel us to, or restrict us from, taking certain actions entirely, such as actions that our regulators deem to constitute unsafe or unsound banking practice. While we have policies and procedures designed to prevent violations of the extensive federal and state regulations, any failure to comply with any applicable laws or regulations, or regulatory policies and interpretations of such laws and regulations, could result in regulatory enforcement actions, civil monetary penalties, or damage to our reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operation.\nRegulations affecting banks and other financial institutions are undergoing continuous review and frequent change. The ultimate effect of such changes cannot be predicted. Because our business is highly regulated, compliance with such regulations and laws may increase our costs and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities. There can be no assurance that laws, rules, and regulations, including any future government stabilization program, will not be proposed or adopted in the future, which could (i) subject us to additional restrictions, (ii) make compliance much more difficult or expensive, (iii) restrict our ability to originate, broker, or sell loans or accept certain deposits, (iv) further limit or restrict the amount of commissions, interest, or other charges earned on loans originated or sold, or (v) otherwise materially and adversely affect our business or prospects for business. While new legislation in 2018 scaled back portions of the Dodd-Frank Act and the current administration in the United States may ultimately roll back or modify certain of the regulations adopted since the financial crisis, any future changes in bank regulation are uncertain and could negatively impact our business.\nThough the Company and Bank are no longer required to prepare annual stress tests pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, we continue to prepare an annual internal capital stress test under adverse economic and market conditions. Our stress test results are considered by the FRB and FDIC in evaluating our capital adequacy and could have a negative impact on our ability to make capital distributions in the form of dividends or share repurchases.\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are subject to changes in federal and state tax laws, interpretation of existing laws and examinations and challenges by taxing authorities.\nOur financial performance is impacted by federal and state tax laws. Given the current economic and political environment, and ongoing budgetary pressures, the enactment of new federal or state tax legislation or new interpretations of existing tax laws could occur. The enactment of such legislation, or changes in the interpretation of existing law, including provisions impacting income tax rates, apportionment, consolidation or combination, income, expenses, and credits, may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.\nIn the normal course of business, we are routinely subjected to examinations and audits from federal, state, and local taxing authorities regarding tax positions taken by us and the determination of the amount of tax due. These examinations may relate to income, franchise, gross receipts, payroll, property, sales and use, or other tax returns. The challenges made by taxing authorities may result in adjustments to the amount of taxes due, and may result in the imposition of penalties and interest. If any such challenges are not resolved in our favor, they could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity.\nWe are subject to claims and litigation which could adversely affect our cash flows, financial condition and results of operations, or cause us significant reputational harm.\nWe and certain of our directors, officers, and subsidiaries may be involved, from time to time, in reviews, investigations, litigation, and other proceedings pertaining to our business activities. If claims or legal actions, whether founded or unfounded, are not resolved in a favorable manner to us, they may result in significant financial liability. Although we establish accruals for legal matters when and as required by U.S. GAAP and certain expenses and liabilities in connection with such matters may be covered by insurance, the amount of loss ultimately incurred in relation to those matters may be substantially higher than the amounts accrued and/or insured. Substantial legal liability could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, and reputation.\nRisk of the Competitive Environment in which We Operate\nWe face strong competition from financial services companies and other companies that offer banking services, which could materially and adversely affect our business.\nThe financial services industry has become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued banking consolidation, which may increase in connection with current economic, market and political conditions. We face substantial competition in all phases of our operations from a variety of competitors, including national banks, regional banks, community banks and, more recently, financial technology (or \"fintech\") companies. Many of our competitors offer the same banking services that we offer and our success depends on our ability to adapt our products and services to evolving industry standards. Increased competition in our market may result in reduced new loan and lease production and/or decreased deposit balances or less favorable terms on loans and leases and/or deposit accounts. We also face competition from many other types of financial institutions, including without limitation, non-bank specialty lenders, insurance companies, private investment funds, investment banks, and other financial intermediaries. While there are a limited number of direct competitors in the venture banking market, some of our competitors have long-standing relationships with venture firms and the companies that are funded by such firms. Many of our competitors have significantly greater resources, established customer bases, more locations, and longer operating histories.\nShould competition in the financial services industry intensify, our ability to market our products and services may be adversely affected. If we are unable to attract and retain banking customers, we may be unable to grow or maintain the levels of our loans and deposits and our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected as a result. Ultimately, we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors.\nOur ability to maintain, attract and retain customer relationships and investors is highly dependent on our reputation.\nDamage to our reputation could undermine the confidence of our current and potential customers and investors in our ability to provide high-quality financial services. Such damage could also impair the confidence of our counterparties and vendors and ultimately affect our ability to effect transactions. Maintenance of our reputation depends not only on our success in maintaining our service-focused culture and controlling and mitigating the various risks described herein, but also on our success in identifying and appropriately addressing issues that may arise in areas such as potential conflicts of interest, anti-money laundering, client personal information and privacy issues, customer and other third-party fraud, record-keeping, technology-related issues including but not limited to cyber fraud, regulatory investigations and any litigation that may arise from the failure or perceived failure to comply with legal and regulatory requirements. Defense of our reputation, trademarks, and other intellectual property, including through litigation, also could result in costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nRisks Related to Risk Management\nOur acquisitions may subject us to unknown risks.\nAs an active acquirer having successfully completed 29 acquisitions since 2000, certain events may arise after the date of an acquisition, or we may learn of certain facts, events or circumstances after the closing of an acquisition, that may affect our financial condition or performance or subject us to risk of loss. These events include, but are not limited to: litigation resulting from circumstances occurring at the acquired entity prior to the date of acquisition; loan downgrades and credit loss provisions resulting from deterioration in the credit quality of the acquired loans; personnel changes that cause instability within a department; delays in implementing new policies or procedures or the failure to apply new policies or procedures; and other events relating to the performance of our business. Acquisitions involve inherent uncertainty and we cannot determine all potential events, facts and circumstances that could result in loss or increased costs or give assurances that our due diligence or mitigation efforts will be sufficient to protect against any such loss or increased costs.\nOur ability to execute our strategic initiatives successfully will depend on a variety of factors. These factors likely will vary based on the nature of the initiative but may include our success in integrating the operations, services, products, personnel and systems of an acquired company into our business, operating effectively with any partner with whom we elect to do business, retaining key employees, achieving anticipated synergies, meeting expectations and otherwise realizing the undertaking's anticipated benefits. Our ability to address these matters successfully cannot be assured. In addition, our strategic initiatives may divert resources or management's attention from ongoing business operations and may subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny. If we do not successfully execute a strategic undertaking, it could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, reputation, regulatory relationships and growth prospects. To the extent we issue capital stock in connection with future acquisitions, these transactions may be dilutive to tangible book value and will dilute share ownership.\nFailure to keep pace with technological change could adversely affect our business.\nThe financial services industry experiences continuous technological change with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Many of our competitors, however, have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements or are technology focused start-ups with internally developed cloud-native systems that offer improved user interfaces and experiences. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. In addition, we depend on internal and outsourced technology to support all aspects of our business operations. Interruption or failure of these systems creates a risk of business loss as a result of adverse customer experiences and possible diminishing of our reputation, damage claims or civil fines. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry or to successfully implement core processing strategies could have a material adverse impact on our business and, in turn, our financial condition and results of operations.\nA failure, interruption or breach in the security of our systems, or those of contracted vendors, could disrupt our business, result in the disclosure of confidential information, damage our reputation, and create significant financial and legal exposure.\nAlthough we devote significant resources to maintain and regularly update our systems and processes that are designed to protect the security of our computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets, as well as the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information belonging to us and our customers, there is no assurance that all of our security measures will provide absolute security.\nMany financial institutions, including the Company, have been subjected to attempts to infiltrate the security of their websites or other systems, some involving sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information, destroy data, disrupt or degrade service, sabotage systems or cause other damage, including through the introduction of computer viruses or malware, cyber-attacks and other means. We have been targeted by individuals and groups using phishing campaigns, pretext calling, malicious code and viruses, and have experienced distributed denial-of-service attacks with the objective of disrupting on-line banking services and expect to be subject to such attacks in the future.\nDespite efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems, it is possible that we may not be able to anticipate, detect or recognize threats to our systems or to implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types inside or outside our business, especially because the techniques used change frequently or are not recognized until launched, and because cyber-attacks can originate from a wide variety of sources, including individuals or groups who are associated with external service providers or who are or may be involved in organized crime or linked to terrorist organizations or hostile foreign governments. Those parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers, third-party service providers or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or that of our customers or clients. These risks may increase in the future as our web-based product offerings grow or we expand internal usage of web-based applications.\nA successful penetration or circumvention of the security of our systems, including those of our third-party vendors, could cause serious negative consequences, including significant disruption of our operations, misappropriation of confidential information, or damage to computers or systems, and may result in violations of applicable privacy and other laws, financial loss, loss of confidence in our security measures, customer dissatisfaction, increased insurance premiums, significant litigation exposure and harm to our reputation, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and future prospects.\nWe rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure.\nWe rely on certain third parties to provide products and services necessary to maintain day-to-day operations, such as data processing and storage, recording and monitoring transactions, on-line banking interfaces and services, Internet connections, telecommunications, and network access. Even though we have a vendor management program to help us carefully select and monitor the performance of third parties, we do not control their actions. The failure of a third-party to perform in accordance with the contracted arrangements under service level agreements as a result of changes in the third party\u2019s organizational structure, financial condition, support for existing products and services, strategic focus, system interruption or breaches, or for any other reason, could be disruptive to our operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Replacing these third parties could also create significant delays and expense. Accordingly, use of such third parties creates an inherent risk to our business operations.\nOur controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented.\nWe regularly review and update our internal controls, disclosure controls and procedures, compliance monitoring activities and corporate governance policies and procedures. Any system of controls, however well-designed and operated, is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurances that the objectives of the system are met. Any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, reputation and financial condition. In addition, if we identify material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting or are required to restate our financial statements, we could be required to implement expensive and time-consuming remedial measures. We could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and potentially subject us to litigation. Any material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting or restatement of our financial statements could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, reputation, and financial condition.\nSevere weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism, public health issues, or other adverse external events could harm the Company's business.\nSevere weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism, public health issues, and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on our ability to conduct business. The nature and level of severe weather and/or natural disasters cannot be predicted and may be exacerbated by global climate change. Severe weather and natural disasters could harm our operations through interference with communications, including the interruption or loss of our computer systems, which could prevent or impede us from gathering deposits, originating loans and processing and controlling the flow of business, as well as through the destruction of facilities and our operational, financial and management information systems. California, in which a substantial portion of our business and a substantial portion of our loan collateral is located, is susceptible to severe weather and natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods, droughts and wildfires. Additionally, the United States remains a target for potential acts of war or terrorism. Moreover, a public health issue, such as a major epidemic or pandemic, could adversely affect economic conditions. Severe weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism, public health issues, or other adverse external events could each negatively impact our business operations or the stability of our deposit base, cause significant property damage, adversely impact the values of collateral securing our loans and/or interrupt our borrowers' abilities to conduct their business in a manner to support their debt obligations, which could result in losses and increased provisions for credit losses. There is no assurance that our business continuity and disaster recovery program can adequately mitigate the risks of such business disruptions and interruptions.\nRisk from Accounting and Other Estimates\nThe Company's consolidated financial statements are based in part on assumptions and estimates which, if incorrect, could cause unexpected losses in the future.\nWe have made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period to prepare these consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP. Actual results could differ from these estimates. Material estimates subject to change in the near term include, among other items, the allowance for credit losses, particularly in light of adopting the new CECL standard on January 1, 2020; the carrying value of intangible assets; the fair value estimates of certain assets and liabilities; and the realization of deferred tax assets and liabilities. These estimates may be adjusted as more current information becomes available, and any adjustment may be significant.\nThere are risks resulting from the extensive use of models in our business.\nWe rely on quantitative models to measure risks and to estimate certain financial values. Models may be used in such processes as determining the pricing of various products, grading loans and extending credit, measuring interest rate and other market risks, predicting or estimating losses, assessing capital adequacy and calculating regulatory capital levels, as well as to estimate the value of financial instruments and balance sheet items. Poorly designed or implemented models present the risk that our business decisions based on information incorporating model output could be adversely affected due to the inaccuracy of that information. Some of the decisions that our regulators make, including those related to capital distributions, could be affected due to the perception that the quality of the models used to generate the relevant information is insufficient, which could have a negative impact on our ability to make capital distributions in the form of dividends or share repurchases. Our reliance on models continues to increase as rules, guidance and expectations change. The most recent example of this is the additional models that will be used in the determination of our allowance for credit losses under CECL effective January 1, 2020.", "PERMNO": 88343, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "PACW"}
