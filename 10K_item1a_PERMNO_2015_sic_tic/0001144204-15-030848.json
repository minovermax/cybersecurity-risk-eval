RISK FACTORS\nOur business, operations and financial condition are subject to various risks. Some of these risks are described below, and stockholders should take such risks into account in evaluating us or any investment decision involving our Company. This section does not describe all risks that may be applicable to us, our industry or our business, and it is intended only as a summary of certain material risk factors. Additional risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know about or that we currently believe are not material may also adversely affect our business. More detailed information concerning certain of the risk factors described below is contained in other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Stockholders should also refer to the other information contained in our periodic reports, including the Special Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements section, our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section for a further discussion of the risks, uncertainties and assumptions relating to our business.\nWe have a limited operating history and have not generated a profit and consequently our business plan is difficult to evaluate and our long term viability cannot be assured.\nOur prospects for financial success are difficult to assess because we have a limited operating history since emergence from bankruptcy and, more recently, as a going concern. The predecessor to the Company filed for Chapter 11 relief on November 2, 2011, and the Company emerged from bankruptcy on September 14, 2012. The Company resumed reporting on the going concern basis of accounting on February 10, 2015. Since emergence from bankruptcy, we have generated limited revenues and the development of our business plan will require substantial capital expenditures. Our business could be subject to any or all of the problems, expenses, delays and risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise, including, but not limited to capital resources. There can be no assurance that our business will be successful, that we will be able to achieve or maintain a profitable operation, or that we will not encounter unforeseen difficulties that may deplete our capital resources more rapidly than anticipated. There can be no assurance that we will achieve or sustain profitability or positive cash flows from our operating activities.\nMuch of our current business plan is focused on the development or sale of the Trinity Place Property and an inability to execute this business plan could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur business plan includes the development, redevelopment and/or sale of our remaining commercial real estate properties and in particular the development or sale of the Trinity Place Property. The Trinity Place Property currently makes up a majority of our assets. As a result, our revenues and future growth are heavily dependent on the success of implementing our business plan to develop or sell the Trinity Place Property, which is currently in pre-development. An inability to successfully execute our business plan with respect to the Trinity Place Property could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur revenues and the value of our portfolio are affected by a number of factors that affect investments in leased real estate generally.\nWe are subject to the general risks of investing in and owning leased real estate. These include the ability to secure leases with new tenants, the non-performance of lease obligations by tenants, leasehold improvements that will be costly or difficult to remove or certain upgrades that may be needed should it become necessary to re-rent the leased space for other uses, rights of termination of leases due to events of casualty or condemnation affecting the leased space or the property or due to interruption of the tenant\u2019s quiet enjoyment of the leased premises, and obligations of a landlord to restore the leased premises or the property following events of casualty or condemnation. The occurrence of any of these events could adversely impact our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. In addition, if our competitors offer space at rental rates below our current rates or the market rates, we may lose current or potential tenants to other properties in our markets. Additionally, we may need to reduce rental rates below our current rates in order to retain tenants upon expiration of their leases or to attract new tenants. Our results of operations and cash flow may be adversely affected as a result of these factors.\nWe may be unable to renew our current leases, lease vacant space, or re-lease space as our current leases expire.\nWe cannot assure you that leases at our properties will be renewed or that such properties will be re-leased at favorable rental rates. If the rental rates for our properties decrease, our tenants do not renew their leases or we do not re-lease a significant portion of our available space, including vacant space resulting from tenant defaults or space that is currently unoccupied, and space for which leases are scheduled to expire, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. In addition, if we are unable to renew leases or re-lease a property, the resale value of that property could be diminished because the market value of a particular property will depend in part upon the value of the leases of such property.\nCompetition may adversely affect our ability to purchase properties and to attract and retain tenants.\nThere are numerous commercial developers, real estate companies, financial institutions and other investors with greater financial resources than we have that compete with us in seeking properties for acquisition and tenants who will lease space in our properties. Our competitors include real estate investment trusts, financial institutions, private funds, insurance companies, pension funds, private companies, family offices, sovereign wealth funds and individuals. This competition may result in a higher cost for properties than we wish to pay. In addition, retailers at our properties face increasing competition from outlet malls, discount shopping clubs, e-commerce, direct mail and telemarketing, which could reduce rents payable to us and reduce our ability to attract and retain tenants at our properties leading to increased vacancy rates at our properties.\nWe may become subject to the risks associated with partnerships and joint ventures.\nAlthough we do not currently have joint ventures, we may become involved in partnerships and/or joint ventures in the future with respect to current or future properties. Partnerships and joint venture investments may involve risks not otherwise present for investments made or owned solely by us, including the possibility that our partner or co-venturer might become bankrupt, or may take action contrary to our instructions, requests, policies or objectives. Other risks of joint venture investments include impasse on decisions, such as a sale, because neither we nor a joint venture partner would have full control over the joint venture, activities conducted by a partner that have a negative impact on the joint venture or us, and disputes with our partner. Also, there is no limitation under our organizational documents as to the amount of our funds that may be invested in joint ventures.\nOur ability to develop and/or redevelop our properties will depend on our obtaining certain permits, site plan approvals and other governmental approvals from local municipalities, which we may not be able to obtain on a timely basis or at all.\nIn order to develop and/or redevelop our properties, we will be required to obtain certain permits, site plan approvals or other governmental approvals from local municipalities. We may not be able to secure all the necessary permits or approvals on a timely basis or at all, which may prevent us from developing and/or redeveloping our properties according to our business plan. The specific permit and approval requirements are set by the state and the various local jurisdictions, including but not limited to city, town, county, township and state agencies having control over the specific properties. Lack of permits and approvals to develop and/or redevelop our properties could severely and adversely affect our business.\nWe have generated minimal revenues from operations and have limited cash resources, and may be reliant on external sources of financing to fund operations in the future.\nAs of February 28, 2015, our revenue generating activities have not yet produced sufficient funds for profitable operations. Our continued operation will be dependent upon the success of future operations and will likely require raising additional financing on acceptable terms. We have relied and may continue to rely substantially upon equity and debt financing to fund our ongoing operations. There can be no assurance that additional sources of financing would be available to the Company on commercially favorable terms should our capital requirements exceed cash available from operations and existing cash and cash equivalents.\nOver 50% of our shares of common stock are controlled by three of our stockholders who may have the ability to influence the election of directors and the outcome of matters submitted to our stockholders.\nOver 50% of our shares of common stock are controlled by three of our stockholders. As a result, these stockholders may have the ability to significantly influence the outcome of issues submitted to our stockholders. The interests of these stockholders may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders, and they may act in a manner that advances their best interests and not necessarily those of other stockholders. The concentration of ownership could also deter unsolicited takeovers, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current market prices.\nCertain of our directors could have conflicts of interest due to their affiliations with certain of our stockholders, which may be resolved in a manner adverse to us.\nAlexander Matina and Marina Shevyrtalova, directors of the Company, are affiliated with entities that own a significant percentage of our common stock. This ownership could create or appear to create potential conflicts of interest when these individuals are faced with decisions that involve the Company or any of its subsidiaries.\nThe holder of our Series A preferred stock has certain voting rights and the holders of our Series A preferred stock and special stock have the right to appoint members to our Board of Directors and, consequently, the ability to exert significant influence over us.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides for certain rights in favor of the holder of the Series A preferred stock until such time as the General Unsecured Claim Satisfaction has occurred, including substantial voting rights and the right to elect two individuals to our Board of Directors (one of whom is the \u201cindependent director\u201d nominated by the holders of common stock, with the reasonable consent of the holder of the Series A preferred stock, and one of which is elected by the holder of the Series A preferred stock). In addition, in connection with the investment in the Company by Third Avenue, a beneficial holder of over 16% of the Company\u2019s common stock, Third Avenue was issued one share of a class of special stock and the Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation was amended to provide that, from the issuance of the one share of special stock and until the \u201cSpecial Stock Ownership Threshold\u201d (which is 2,345,000 out of the 3,369,444 shares of common stock purchased by Third Avenue) is no longer satisfied, Third Avenue has the right to elect one director to the Board of Directors, and the total number of directors that constitute the Board of Directors elected by the holders of common stock was reduced from three to two. As a result of these voting rights and the right to elect members of our Board of Directors, these stockholders are expected to be able to exert significant influence over our policies and management, potentially in a manner which may not be in our best interests or the best interests of the other stockholders.\nThe loss of key personnel upon whom we depend to operate our business or the inability to attract additional qualified personnel could adversely affect our business.\nWe believe that our future success will depend in large part on our ability to retain or attract highly qualified management and other personnel, including in particular our Chief Executive Officer, Matthew Messinger. We may not be successful in retaining key personnel or in attracting other highly qualified personnel. Any inability to retain or attract qualified management and other personnel would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe failure of our wholly-owned subsidiary TPHGreenwich Owner LLC to repay the loan and any liability the Company incurs as a result of the financing arrangements and guarantees of the Company required by that loan could have a material and adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe failure by TPHGreenwich Owner LLC (\u201cTPH Borrower\u201d), a newly formed, bankruptcy remote special purpose entity and wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company to make scheduled repayments under the loan agreement entered into by TPH Borrower in February 2015, or the default by TPH Borrower of any of its obligations under the loan, may have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, TPH Borrower may be required to immediately repay all amounts outstanding under the loan and the lenders may exercise other remedies available to them, including foreclosing on the Trinity Place Property. See Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Liquidity and Capital Resources and Note 10 to the Company\u2019s consolidated financial statements (Loan Payable) for further discussion regarding the loan transaction.\nWe have not paid dividends on our common stock in the past and do not expect to pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. Any return on investment may be limited to the value of our common stock.\nNo cash dividends have been paid on our common stock. We expect that any income received from operations will be devoted to our future operations and growth. We do not expect to pay cash dividends on our common stock in the near future. The payment of any dividends on the common stock is currently strictly limited by the terms of the Plan, which provides that dividends (other than in common stock and in other limited circumstances) are not payable until after the former Majority Shareholder payments are made in full. Accordingly, the Company has no intention of and is unable to pay dividends to the holders of common stock until at least such time as the Company\u2019s distribution obligations under the Plan have been satisfied. Payment of dividends would depend upon our profitability at the time, cash available for those dividends, and other factors as our Board of Directors may consider relevant. If we do not pay dividends, our common stock may be less valuable because a return on an investor\u2019s investment will only occur if our stock price appreciates.\nOur ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards may be limited.\nUnder the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), a corporation is generally allowed a deduction for net operating loss carryforwards (\u201cNOLs\u201d). As of February 28, 2015, we had available NOLs of approximately $195.0 million for regular Federal income tax purposes which will expire, if unused, beginning in 2029. Our NOLs are subject to adjustment on audit by the Internal Revenue Service.\nA corporation\u2019s ability to deduct its NOLs and to utilize certain other available tax attributes can be substantially constrained under the general annual limitation rules of Section 382 of the Code (\u201cSection 382\u201d) if it undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d as defined in Section 382 (generally where cumulative stock ownership changes among material shareholders exceed 50% during a rolling three-year period). We experienced an ownership change in connection with our emergence from the Chapter 11 cases. An ownership change that occurs in the future could severely limit our ability to utilize our NOLs and other tax attributes. To reduce the risk of a potential adverse effect on our ability to utilize our NOLs, our certificate of incorporation contains transfer restrictions applicable to certain substantial shareholders, as discussed below. Although the purpose of these transfer restrictions is to prevent an ownership change from occurring, no assurance can be given that such an ownership change will not occur, in which case our ability to utilize our NOLs and other tax attributes could be severely limited or effectively eliminated.\nIn addition, our ability to use our NOLs will depend on the amount of taxable income generated in future periods. The NOLs may expire before we can generate sufficient taxable income to use them.\nIn order to protect NOLs and certain other tax attributes, our certificate of incorporation includes certain transfer restrictions with respect to our stock, which may limit the liquidity of our common stock.\nTo reduce the risk of a potential adverse effect on our ability to use our NOLs and certain other tax attributes for U.S. Federal income tax purposes, our certificate of incorporation contains certain transfer restrictions with respect to our stock by substantial stockholders. These restrictions may adversely affect the ability of certain holders of our common stock to dispose of or acquire shares of our common stock and may have an adverse impact on the liquidity of our stock generally.\nOur common stock is thinly traded and the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly.\nOur common stock is thinly traded. We cannot assure stockholders that an active market for our common stock will develop in the foreseeable future or, if developed, that it will be sustained. As a result stockholders may not be able to resell their common stock. Our common stock is currently quoted for trading on the OTC Markets. For companies whose securities are traded in the OTC Markets, it is often more difficult to obtain accurate quotations, to obtain coverage for significant news events because major wire services generally do not publish press releases about such companies, and to obtain needed capital.\nBecause our common stock is thinly traded, even small trades can have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock. Volatility in the market price of our common stock may prevent stockholders from being able to sell their shares at or above the price paid for such shares. The market price could fluctuate significantly for various reasons, many of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022 changes in the real estate markets in which we operate;\n\u2022 our ability to develope, re-develope or sell the Trinity Place Property and our other properties;\n\u2022 our financial results or those of other companies in our industry;\n\u2022 the public\u2019s reaction to our press releases and other public announcements and our filings with the SEC;\n\u2022 new laws or regulations or new interpretations of laws or regulations applicable to our business;\n\u2022 changes in general conditions in the United States and global economies or financial markets, including those resulting from war, incidents of terrorism or responses to such events;\n\u2022 the potential issuance of additional shares of common stock;\n\u2022 sales of common stock by our executive officers, directors and significant stockholders;\n\u2022 changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles; and\n\u2022 other factors described in our filings with the SEC, including among others in connection with the risks noted herein.\nA sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may cause the price of our common stock to decline and may impair our ability to raise capital in the future.\nFinance transactions resulting in a large amount of newly issued shares that become readily tradable, or other events that cause current stockholders to sell shares, could place downward pressure on the trading price of our stock. In addition, the lack of a robust resale market may require a stockholder who desires to sell a large number of shares of common stock to sell the shares in increments over time to mitigate any adverse impact of the sales on the market price of our stock.\nIf our stockholders sell, or the market perceives that our stockholders intend to sell for various reasons, including the ending of restrictions on resale of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market, including shares issued upon the exercise of outstanding options, the market price of our common stock could fall. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock may make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem reasonable or appropriate. In addition, until our common stock is more widely held and actively traded small sales or purchases will likely cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate dramatically up or down without regard to our financial health or business prospects.\nStockholders may experience dilution of their ownership interests because of the future issuance of additional shares of our common stock.\nIn the future, we may issue additional equity securities in capital raising transactions or otherwise, resulting in the dilution of the ownership interests of our present stockholders. We are currently authorized to issue an aggregate of 120,000,000 shares of capital stock consisting of 79,999,997 shares of common stock, one share of Series A preferred stock, one share of Series B preferred stock, one share of a class of special stock and 40,000,000 shares of blank-check preferred stock. As of May 14, 2015, there were 20,121,619 shares of our common stock, one share of our Series A preferred stock, one share of Series B preferred stock and one share of special stock outstanding.\nAny future issuance of our equity securities may dilute then-current stockholders\u2019 ownership percentages and could also result in a decrease in the fair market value of our equity securities, because our assets would be owned by a larger pool of outstanding equity. We may need to raise additional capital through public or private offerings of our common stock or other securities that are convertible into or exercisable for our common stock. We may also issue such securities in connection with hiring or retaining employees and consultants, as payment to providers of goods and services, in connection with future acquisitions and investments, development, redevelopment and repositioning of assets, or for other business purposes. Our Board of Directors may at any time authorize the issuance of additional common stock without stockholder approval, unless the approval of our common stockholders or the holder of our Series A preferred stock is required by applicable law, rule or regulation or our certificate of incorporation. The terms of equity securities issued by us in future transactions may be more favorable to new investors, and may include dividend and/or liquidation preferences, superior voting rights and the issuance of warrants or other derivative securities, which may have a further dilutive effect. Also, the future issuance of any such additional shares of common stock or other securities may create downward pressure on the trading price of our common stock. There can be no assurance that any such future issuances will not be at a price or have exercise prices below the price at which shares of the common stock are then traded.\nOur charter documents and Delaware law could prevent a takeover that stockholders consider favorable and could also reduce the market price of our stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company. These provisions could also make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. In addition to the matters identified in the risk factors above relating to the provisions of our certificate of incorporation, these provisions include:\n\u2022 a classified Board of Directors with two-year staggered terms;\n\u2022 rights of the holders of the Series A preferred stock and special stock to appoint a majority of the members of our Board of Directors;\n\u2022 vacancies on our Board of Directors, and any newly created director positions created by the expansion of the Board of Directors, may be filled only by a majority of remaining directors then in office;\n\u2022 not providing for cumulative voting in the election of directors; and\n\u2022 authorizing blank check preferred stock, which could be issued with voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to our common stock.\nThese and other provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and under Delaware law could discourage potential takeover attempts, reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of common stock and result in the market price of the common stock being lower than it would be without these provisions.\nIf certain of our obligations are not satisfied by specific dates, the Plan and our certificate of incorporation provide for certain changes in control.\nIf there has not been a General Unsecured Claim Satisfaction (as defined in the Plan) by October 1, 2016, then the Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation provides for the Board of Directors to automatically increase to nine members, seven of which are to be elected by the holder of the Series A preferred stock. Also if a General Unsecured Claim Satisfaction has occurred but the required payment to the former Majority Shareholder has not been made by October 16, 2016, then the Board of Directors will automatically be adjusted to have four members, three of whom are to be elected by the former Majority Shareholder. In each case, the Board of Directors will remain controlled by the holder of the Series A preferred stock or the former Majority Shareholder, as applicable, until the required payments are made.\nProceeds from the monetization of the Company\u2019s assets, after the payment of budgeted costs and transaction expenses, generally must be used to pay the Company\u2019s obligations under the Plan until such time as a General Unsecured Claim Satisfaction has occurred and the required payments to the former Majority Shareholder are made.\nUnder the Plan, any proceeds generated from the monetization of the Company\u2019s assets are generally first used to pay transaction expenses and to fund the Company\u2019s operating budget. All net proceeds must then be used to satisfy Allowed Claims under the Plan and the Majority Shareholder redemption payment. As of May 14, 2015, based on the reconciliation work to date, the Company believes that the remaining estimated aggregate allowed amount of creditor claims, together with the net amount due to the former Majority Shareholder, is approximately $18.0 million. Because Filene\u2019s long-term allowed claims are entitled to a 75% recovery, the remaining estimated aggregate amount of distributions to creditors and the former Majority Shareholder under the Plan is approximately $16.3 million. Only if there are proceeds remaining after the satisfaction of such obligations under the Plan can they be used in the business of the Company or distributed to stockholders.\nThere can be no assurance that our reserves for operating expenses will be sufficient.\nAs part of the Plan, the Company established a reserve of $5 million for corporate overhead expenses to be incurred in the first two years following the effectiveness of the Plan. The Company\u2019s corporate overhead expenses have exceeded the original expectations, and the corporate overhead reserve initially contemplated by the Plan has been depleted. The Plan similarly established reserves for other operating expenses in the first two years following the effectiveness of the Plan, including one for general carrying costs and tenant improvements and one specifically for the Trinity Place Property, and there can be no assurance that those reserves will be sufficient. Although as described below under Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources, the holder of the Series A preferred stock consented to an increase in the corporate overhead reserve and the Company raised approximately $13.0 million of net cash proceeds from a sale of stock in 2013 which can be can be used to fund overhead and other expenses, there can be no assurances that these steps will be sufficient to cover overhead expenses.", "PERMNO": 65429, "SIC": 6512, "TIC": "TPHS"}
