RISK FACTORS.\nThe risks described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks we are not presently aware of or that we currently believe are immaterial may also impair our business operations. Our business could be harmed by any of these risks. The trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of these risks, and you may lose all or part of your investment. In assessing these risks, you should also refer to the other information contained or incorporated by reference into this prospectus supplement and the accompanying prospectus, including our financial statements and related notes.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe are at an early stage of development as a company and currently have no source of revenue and may never become profitable. We are a development stage biopharmaceutical company. Currently, we have no products approved for commercial sale and, to date, we have not generated any revenue. Our ability to generate revenue depends heavily on:\n\u00b7 our ability to raise additional capital on a timely basis to continue to fund our clinical trials;\n\u00b7 demonstration in current and future clinical trials that our product candidate, plecanatide for the treatment of CIC and IBS-C, is safe and effective;\n\u00b7 our ability to seek and obtain regulatory approvals, including with respect to the indications we are seeking;\n\u00b7 successful manufacture and commercialization of our product candidates; and\n\u00b7 market acceptance of our products.\nAll of our existing product candidates are in various stages of development and will require extensive additional preclinical and clinical evaluation, regulatory review and approval, significant marketing efforts and substantial investment before they could provide us with any revenue. As a result, even if we successfully develop, achieve regulatory approval and commercialize plecanatide, we will be unable to generate any revenue for many years, if at all. We do not anticipate that we will generate revenue for several years, at the earliest, or that we will achieve profitability for at least several years after generating material revenue, if at all. If we are unable to generate revenue, we will not become profitable, and we may be unable to continue our operations.\nWe will need to raise substantial additional capital to fund our operations, and our failure to obtain funding when needed may force us to delay, reduce or eliminate our lead product development programs or even discontinue or curtail our operations.\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013, our operating activities used net cash of approximately $89 million and $52.6 million, respectively. Our available-for-sale securities as of December 31, 2014 and December 31, 2013 were $50 million and $50 million, respectively, which consists of U.S. Treasury securities with maturities of less than one year. In addition, as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 the amount of our cash and cash equivalents was $146.5 million and $18.1 million, respectively, consisting of checking accounts and short-term money market mutual funds.\nWe expect to continue to spend substantial amounts to:\n\u00b7 continue clinical development of plecanatide to treat GI disorders;\n\u00b7 continue development of other product candidates, including SP-333;\n\u00b7 finance our general and administrative expenses;\n\u00b7 prepare regulatory approval applications and seek approvals for plecanatide and other product candidates, including SP-333;\n\u00b7 license or acquire additional technologies;\n\u00b7 manufacture product for clinical trials;\n\u00b7 launch and commercialize our product candidates, if any such product candidates receive regulatory approval; and\n\u00b7 develop and implement sales, marketing and distribution capabilities.\nWe will need to raise additional capital to fund our future operations and we cannot be certain that funding will be available on acceptable terms on a timely basis, or at all. To the extent that we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, our stockholders may experience significant dilution. Any debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants that impact our ability to conduct our business. If we are unable to raise additional capital when required or on acceptable terms, we may have to significantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development and/or commercialization of our lead product candidates. We also may be required to:\n\u00b7 seek collaborators for our product candidates at an earlier stage than otherwise would be desirable and on terms that are less favorable than might otherwise be available; and/or\n\u00b7 relinquish license or otherwise dispose of rights to technologies, product candidates or products that we would otherwise seek to develop or commercialize ourselves on unfavorable terms.\nWe do not have any products that are approved for commercial sale and therefore do not expect to generate any revenues from product sales in the foreseeable future, if ever.\nWe currently do not have any products that are approved for commercial sale. To date, we have funded our operations primarily from sales of our equity and debt securities. We have not received, and do not expect to receive for at least the next several years, if at all, any revenues from the commercialization of our product candidates. To obtain revenues from sales of our product candidates, we must succeed, either alone or with third parties, in developing, obtaining regulatory approval for, manufacturing and marketing drugs with commercial potential. We may never succeed in these activities, and may not generate sufficient revenues to continue our business operations or achieve profitability.\nWe have incurred significant losses since inception and anticipate that we will incur continued losses for the foreseeable future.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $267 million. We expect to incur significant and increasing operating losses for the next several years as we expand our research and development, continue our clinical trials of plecanatide for the treatment of GI disorders, acquire or license technologies, advance other product candidates into clinical development, including SP- 333, complete clinical trials, seek regulatory approval and, if we receive FDA approval, commercialize our products. Because of the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with product development efforts, we are unable to predict the extent of any future losses or when we will become profitable, if at all. If we are unable to achieve and then maintain profitability, the market value of our common stock will likely experience significant decline.\nWe are largely dependent on the success of our lead product candidate, plecanatide, and we cannot be certain that this product candidate will receive regulatory approval or be successfully commercialized.\nWe currently have no products for sale, and we cannot guarantee that we will ever have any drug products approved for sale. We and our product candidates are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and comparable regulatory authorities in other countries governing, among other things, research, testing, clinical trials, manufacturing, labeling, promotion, selling, adverse event reporting and recordkeeping. We are not permitted to market any of our product candidates in or outside the United States until we receive approval of a new drug application, or NDA, for a product candidate from the FDA or the equivalent approval from a foreign regulatory authority. Obtaining FDA approval is a lengthy, expensive and uncertain process. We currently have one lead product candidate, plecanatide for the treatment of GI disorders, and the success of our business currently depends on our successful development, approval and commercialization. This product candidate has not completed the clinical development process; therefore, we have not yet submitted an NDA or foreign equivalent, or received marketing approval for this product candidate anywhere in the world.\nThe clinical development program for plecanatide may not lead to commercial products for a number of reasons, including if we fail to obtain necessary approvals from the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities because our clinical trials fail to demonstrate to their satisfaction that this product candidate is safe and effective. We may also fail to obtain the necessary approvals if we have inadequate financial or other resources to advance our product candidates through the clinical trial process. Any failure or delay in completing clinical trials or obtaining regulatory approval for plecanatide in a timely manner would have a material adverse impact on our business and our stock price.\nWe will need to obtain FDA approval of any proposed product brand names, and any failure or delay associated with such approval may adversely impact our business.\nA pharmaceutical product cannot be marketed in the U.S. or other countries until it has completed a rigorous and extensive regulatory review processes, including approval of a brand name. Any brand names we intend to use for our product candidates will require approval from the FDA regardless of whether we have secured a formal trademark registration from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or the PTO. The\nFDA typically conducts a review of proposed product brand names, including an evaluation of potential for confusion with other product names. The FDA may also object to a product brand name if we believe the name inappropriately implies medical claims. If the FDA objects to any of our proposed product brand names, we may be required to adopt an alternative brand name for our product candidates. If we adopt an alternative brand name, we would lose the benefit of our existing trademark applications for such product candidate and may be required to expend significant additional resources in an effort to identify a suitable product brand name that would qualify under applicable trademark laws, not infringe the existing rights of third parties and be acceptable to the FDA. We may be unable to build a successful brand identity for a new trademark in a timely manner or at all, which would limit our ability to commercialize our product candidates.\nClinical trials involve a lengthy and expensive process with an uncertain outcome, and results of earlier studies and trials may not be predictive of future trial results.\nOur product candidates may not prove to be safe and efficacious in clinical trials and may not meet all the applicable regulatory requirements needed to receive regulatory approval. In order to receive regulatory approval for the commercialization of our product candidates, we must conduct, at our own expense, extensive preclinical testing and clinical trials to demonstrate safety and efficacy of these product candidates for the intended indication of use. Clinical testing is expensive, can take many years to complete, if at all, and its outcome is uncertain. Failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process.\nThe results of preclinical studies and early clinical trials of new drugs do not necessarily predict the results of later-stage clinical trials. The design of our clinical trials is based on many assumptions about the expected effects of our product candidates, and if those assumptions are incorrect may not produce statistically significant results. Preliminary results may not be confirmed on full analysis of the detailed results of an early clinical trial. Product candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show safety and efficacy sufficient to support intended use claims despite having progressed through initial clinical testing. The data collected from clinical trials of our product candidates may not be sufficient to support the filing of an NDA or to obtain regulatory approval in the United States or elsewhere. Because of the uncertainties associated with drug development and regulatory approval, we cannot determine if or when we will have an approved product for commercialization or achieve sales or profits.\nDelays in clinical testing could result in increased costs to us and delay our ability to generate revenue.\nWe may experience delays in clinical testing of our product candidates. We do not know whether planned clinical trials will begin on time, will need to be redesigned or will be completed on schedule, if at all. Clinical trials can be delayed for a variety of reasons, including delays in obtaining regulatory approval to commence a clinical trial, in securing clinical trial agreements with prospective sites with acceptable terms, in obtaining institutional review board approval to conduct a clinical trial at a prospective site, in recruiting patients to participate in a clinical trial or in obtaining sufficient supplies of clinical trial materials. Many factors affect patient enrollment, including the size of the patient population, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the eligibility criteria for the clinical trial, competing clinical trials and new drugs approved for the conditions we are investigating. Clinical investigators will need to decide whether to offer their patients enrollment in clinical trials of our product candidates versus treating these patients with commercially available drugs that have established safety and efficacy profiles. Any delays in completing our clinical trials will increase our costs, slow down our product development and timeliness and approval process and delay our ability to generate revenue.\nThe FDA\u2019s expectations for clinical trials may change over time, complicating the process of obtaining evidence to support approval of our product candidates.\nIn May 2012, the FDA\u2019s Center for Drugs Evaluation and Research, or CDER, released guidance entitled: \u201cIrritable Bowel Syndrome-Clinical Evaluation of Products for Treatment\u201d to assist the product sponsors developing new drugs for the treatment of IBS. In pertinent part, this document provides recommendations for IBS clinical trial design and endpoints, and describes the need for the future development of patient-reported outcome, or PRO, instruments for use in IBS clinical trials. The clinical trials we have planned for plecanatide are designed to follow the recommendations included in this guidance. The guidance document represents the FDA\u2019s thinking on the clinical evaluation of products for the treatment of IBS. FDA guidance documents, however, do not establish legally enforceable requirements, should be viewed only as recommendations, and may be changed at any time. Therefore, even insofar as we intend to follow the recommendations provided in the guidance document, we cannot be sure that the FDA will accept the results of our clinical research even if such research follows the recommendations in the guidance document.\nWe may be required to suspend or discontinue clinical trials due to unexpected side effects or other safety risks that could preclude approval of our product candidates.\nOur clinical trials may be suspended at any time for a number of reasons. For example, we may voluntarily suspend or terminate our clinical trials if at any time we believe that they present an unacceptable risk to the clinical trial patients. In addition, the FDA or other regulatory agencies may order the temporary or permanent discontinuation of our clinical trials at any time if they believe that the clinical trials are not being conducted in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements or that they present an unacceptable safety risk to the clinical trial patients.\nAdministering any product candidate to humans may produce undesirable side effects. These side effects could interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials of our product candidates and could result in the FDA or other regulatory authorities denying further development or approval of our product candidates for any or all targeted indications. Ultimately, some or all of our product candidates may prove to be unsafe for human use. Moreover, we could be subject to significant liability if any volunteer or patient suffers, or appears to suffer, adverse health effects as a result of participating in our clinical trials.\nIf we fail to comply with healthcare regulations, we could face substantial enforcement actions, including civil and criminal penalties and our business, operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nAs a developer of pharmaceuticals, even though we do not intend to make referrals of healthcare services or bill directly to Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors, certain federal and state healthcare laws and regulations pertaining to fraud and abuse, false claims and patients\u2019 privacy rights are and will be applicable to our business. We could be subject to healthcare fraud and abuse laws and patient privacy laws of both the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business.\nThe laws include:\n\u00b7 the federal healthcare program anti-kickback law, which prohibits, among other things, persons from soliciting, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, to induce either the referral of an individual, for an item or service or the purchasing or ordering of a good or service, for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs;\n\u00b7 federal false claims laws which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent, and which may apply to entities like us which provide coding and billing information to customers;\n\u00b7 the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, which prohibits executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters and which also imposes certain requirements relating to the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n\u00b7 the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, which among other things, strictly regulates drug manufacturing and product marketing, prohibits manufacturers from marketing drug products for off-label use and regulates the distribution of drug samples; and\n\u00b7 state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers, and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by federal laws, thus complicating compliance efforts.\nIf our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any governmental regulations that apply to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Any penalties, damages, fines, curtailment or restructuring of our operations could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. Although compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, the risks cannot be entirely eliminated. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business. Moreover, achieving and sustaining compliance with applicable federal and state privacy, security and fraud laws may prove costly.\nIf we are unable to satisfy regulatory requirements, we may not be able to commercialize our product candidates.\nWe need FDA approval prior to marketing our product candidates in the United States. If we fail to obtain FDA approval to market our product candidates, we will be unable to sell our product candidates in the United States and we will not generate any revenue.\nThe FDA\u2019s review and approval process, including among other things, evaluation of preclinical studies and clinical trials of a product candidate as well as the manufacturing process and facility, is lengthy, expensive and uncertain. To receive approval, we must, among other things, demonstrate with substantial evidence from well-designed and well-controlled pre- clinical testing and clinical trials that the product candidate is both safe and effective for each indication for which approval is sought. Satisfaction of these requirements typically takes several years and the time needed to satisfy them may vary substantially, based on the type, complexity and novelty of the pharmaceutical product. We cannot predict if or when we will submit an NDA for approval for any of our product candidates currently under development. Any approvals we may obtain may not cover all of the clinical indications for which we are seeking approval or may contain significant limitations on the conditions of use.\nThe FDA has substantial discretion in the NDA review process and may either refuse to file our NDA for substantive review or may decide that our data is insufficient to support approval of our product candidates for the claimed intended uses. Following any regulatory approval of our product candidates, we will be subject to continuing regulatory obligations such as safety reporting, required and additional post marketing obligations, and regulatory oversight of promotion and marketing. Even if we receive regulatory approvals, the FDA may subsequently seek to withdraw approval of our NDA if we determine that new data or a reevaluation of existing data show the product is unsafe for use under the conditions of use upon the basis of which the NDA was approved, or based on new evidence of adverse effects or adverse clinical experience, or upon other new information. If the FDA does not file or approve our NDA or withdraws approval of our NDA, the FDA may require that we\nconduct additional clinical trials, preclinical or manufacturing studies and submit that data before it will reconsider our application. Depending on the extent of these or any other requested studies, approval of any applications that we submit may be delayed by several years, may require us to expend more resources than we have available, or may never be obtained at all.\nWe will also be subject to a wide variety of foreign regulations governing the development, manufacture and marketing of our products. Whether or not FDA approval has been obtained, approval of a product by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries must still be obtained prior to marketing the product in those countries. The approval process varies and the time needed to secure approval in any region such as the European Union or in a country with an independent review procedure may be longer or shorter than that required for FDA approval. We cannot assure you that clinical trials conducted in one country will be accepted by other countries or that an approval in one country or region will result in approval elsewhere.\nIf our product candidates are unable to compete effectively with marketed drugs targeting similar indications as our product candidates, our commercial opportunity will be reduced or eliminated.\nWe face competition generally from established pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as from academic institutions, government agencies and private and public research institutions. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development, manufacturing, preclinical testing, conducting clinical trials, obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing approved products than we do. Small or early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large, established companies. Our commercial opportunity will be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and commercialize GI drugs that are safer, more effective, have fewer side effects or are less expensive than our product candidates. These potential competitors compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient enrollment for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies and technology licenses complementary to our programs or advantageous to our business.\nIf approved and commercialized, plecanatide will compete with at least two currently approved prescription therapies for the treatment of CC and IBS-C, Amitiza and Linzess. In addition, over-the-counter products are also used to treat certain symptoms of CC and IBS-C. We believe other companies are developing products that will compete with plecanatide should they be approved by the FDA. To our knowledge, other potential competitors are in earlier stages of development. If potential competitors are successful in completing drug development for their product candidates and obtain approval from the FDA, they could limit the demand for plecanatide. We expect that our ability to compete effectively will depend upon our ability to:\n\u00b7 successfully and rapidly complete clinical trials and submit for and obtain all requisite regulatory approvals in a cost-effective manner;\n\u00b7 maintain a proprietary position for our products and manufacturing processes and other related product technology;\n\u00b7 attract and retain key personnel;\n\u00b7 develop relationships with physicians prescribing these products; and\n\u00b7 build an adequate sales and marketing infrastructure for our product candidates.\nBecause we will be competing against significantly larger companies with established track records, we will have to demonstrate that, based on experience, clinical data, side-effect profiles and other factors, our products, if approved, are competitive with other products. If we are unable to compete effectively in the GI drug market and differentiate our products from other marketed GI drugs, we may never generate meaningful revenue.\nIf we fail to attract and keep senior management and key scientific personnel, we may be unable to successfully develop our product candidates, conduct our clinical trials and commercialize our product candidates.\nOur success depends in part on our continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly qualified management, clinical and scientific personnel and on our ability to develop and maintain important relationships with leading academic institutions, clinicians and scientists. We are highly dependent upon our senior management and scientific staff, particularly Gary S. Jacob, Ph.D., our President and Chief Executive Officer and Kunwar Shailubhai, Ph.D., our Chief Scientific Officer. The loss of services of Dr. Jacob or one or more of our other members of senior management could delay or prevent the successful completion of our planned clinical trials or the commercialization of our product candidates.\nThe competition for qualified personnel in the biotechnology and pharmaceuticals field is intense. We will need to hire additional personnel as we expand our clinical development and commercial activities. We may not be able to attract and retain quality personnel on acceptable terms given the competition for such personnel among biotechnology, pharmaceutical and other companies.\nWe will need to increase the size of our organization, and we may experience difficulties in managing growth.\nWe are a small company with 33 employees as of March 16, 2015. To continue our clinical trials and commercialize our product candidates, we will need to expand our employee base for managerial, operational, financial and other resources. Future growth will impose significant added responsibilities on members of management, including the need to identify, recruit, maintain and integrate additional employees. Over the next 12 months depending on the progress of our planned clinical trials, we plan to add additional employees to assist us with our clinical and commercial programs. Our future financial performance and our ability to commercialize our product candidates and to compete effectively will depend, in part, on our ability to manage any future growth effectively. To that end, we must be able to:\n\u00b7 manage development efforts effectively;\n\u00b7 manage our clinical trials effectively;\n\u00b7 integrate additional management, administrative, manufacturing and sales and marketing personnel;\n\u00b7 maintain sufficient administrative, accounting and management information systems and controls; and\n\u00b7 hire and train additional qualified personnel.\nWe may not be able to accomplish these tasks, and our failure to accomplish any of them could harm our financial results and impact our ability to achieve development milestones.\nWe currently have no sales and marketing organization. If we are unable to establish a direct sales force in the United States to promote our products, the commercial opportunity for our products may be diminished.\nWe currently have no sales and marketing organization. If any of our product candidates are approved by the FDA, we may market that product through our own sales force. We will incur significant additional expenses and commit significant additional management resources to establish our own sales force. We may not be able to establish these capabilities despite these additional expenditures. We will also have to compete with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies to recruit, hire and train sales and marketing personnel. If we elect to rely on third parties to sell our product candidates in the United States, we may receive less revenue than if we sold our products directly. In addition, although we would intend to use due diligence in monitoring their activities, we may have little or no control over the sales efforts of those third parties. In the event we are unable to develop our own sales force or collaborate with a third party to sell our product candidates, we may not be able to commercialize our product candidates which would negatively impact our ability to generate revenue.\nWe may need to rely on third parties to market and commercialize our product candidates in international markets.\nCurrently, we do not have any plans to enter international markets. In the future, if appropriate regulatory approvals are obtained, we may commercialize our product candidates in international markets. However, we have not decided how to commercialize our product candidates in those markets. We may decide to build our own sales force or sell our products through third parties. If we decide to sell our product candidates in international markets through a third party, we may not be able to enter into any marketing arrangements on favorable terms or at all. In addition, these arrangements could result in lower levels of income to us than if we marketed our product candidates entirely on our own. If we are unable to enter into a marketing arrangement for our product candidates in international markets, we may not be able to develop an effective international sales force to successfully commercialize those products in international markets. If we fail to enter into marketing arrangements for our products and are unable to develop an effective international sales force, our ability to generate revenue would be limited.\nIf the manufacturers upon whom we rely fail to produce plecanatide and our other product candidates, including SP-333, in the volumes that we require on a timely basis, or fail to comply with stringent regulations applicable to pharmaceutical drug manufacturers, we may face delays in the development and commercialization of our product candidates.\nWe do not currently possess internal manufacturing capacity. We currently utilize the services of contract manufacturers to manufacture our clinical supplies. With respect to the manufacturing of plecanatide, we have executed supply agreements with two contract manufacturers sufficient to meet our foreseeable clinical trial requirements. Any curtailment in the availability of plecanatide, however, could result in production or other delays with consequent adverse effects on us. In addition, because regulatory authorities must generally approve raw material sources for pharmaceutical products, changes in raw material suppliers may result in production delays or higher raw material costs.\nWe continue to pursue additional active pharmaceutical ingredients, or API, and drug product supply agreements with other manufacturers. We may be required to agree to minimum volume requirements, exclusivity arrangements or other restrictions with the contract manufacturers. We may not be able to enter into long-term agreements on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we change or add manufacturers, the FDA and comparable foreign regulators may require approval of the changes. Approval of these changes could require new testing by the manufacturer and compliance inspections to ensure the manufacturer is conforming to all applicable laws and regulations, including good manufacturing practices, or GMP. In addition, the new manufacturers would have to be educated in or independently develop the processes necessary for the production of our product candidates. Peptide manufacturing is a highly specialized manufacturing business. While we believe we will have long term arrangements with a sufficient number of contract manufacturers, if we lose a manufacturer, it would take us a substantial amount of time to identify and develop a relationship, and seek regulatory approval, where necessary, for an alternative manufacturer.\nThe manufacture of pharmaceutical products requires significant expertise and capital investment, including the development of advanced manufacturing techniques and process controls. Manufacturers of pharmaceutical products may encounter difficulties in production, particularly in scaling up production. These problems include difficulties with production costs and yields, quality control, including stability of the product and quality assurance testing, shortages of qualified personnel, as well as compliance with federal, state and foreign regulations. In addition, any delay or interruption in the supply of clinical trial supplies could delay the completion of our clinical trials, increase the costs associated with conducting our clinical trials and, depending upon the period of delay, require us to commence new clinical trials at significant additional expense or to terminate a clinical trial.\nWe are responsible for ensuring that each of our contract manufacturers comply with the GMP requirements of the FDA and other regulatory authorities from which we seek to obtain product approval. These requirements include, among other things, quality control, quality assurance and the maintenance of records and documentation. The approval process for NDAs includes a review of the manufacturer\u2019s compliance with GMP requirements. We are responsible for regularly assessing a contract manufacturer\u2019s compliance with GMP requirements through record reviews and periodic audits and for ensuring that the contract manufacturer takes responsibility and corrective action for any identified deviations. Manufacturers of plecanatide and other product candidates, including SP-333, may be unable to comply with these GMP requirements and with other FDA and foreign regulatory requirements, if any.\nWhile we will oversee compliance by our contract manufacturers, ultimately we will not have control over our manufacturers\u2019 compliance with these regulations and standards. A failure to comply with these requirements may result in fines and civil penalties, suspension of production, suspension or delay in product approval, product seizure or recall, or withdrawal of product approval. If the safety of plecanatide or other product candidates is compromised due to a manufacturers\u2019 failure to adhere to applicable laws or for other reasons, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize plecanatide or other product candidates, and we may be held liable for any injuries sustained as a result. Any of these factors could cause a delay of clinical trials, regulatory submissions, approvals or commercialization of plecanatide or other product candidates, entail higher costs or result in us being unable to effectively commercialize plecanatide or other product candidates. Furthermore, if our manufacturers fail to deliver the required commercial quantities on a timely basis and at commercially reasonable prices, we may be unable to meet demand for any approved products and would lose potential revenues.\nWe may not be able to manufacture our product candidates in commercial quantities, which would prevent us from commercializing our product candidates.\nTo date, our product candidates have been manufactured in small quantities for preclinical studies and clinical trials. If any of our product candidates is approved by the FDA or comparable regulatory authorities in other countries for commercial sale, we will need to manufacture such product candidate in larger quantities. We may not be able to increase successfully the manufacturing capacity for any of our product candidates in a timely or economic manner, or at all. Significant scale-up of manufacturing may require additional validation studies, which the FDA must review and approve. If we are unable to increase successfully the manufacturing capacity for a product candidate, the clinical trials as well as the regulatory approval or commercial launch of that product candidate may be delayed or there may be a shortage in supply. Our product candidates require precise, high quality manufacturing. Our failure to achieve and maintain these high quality manufacturing standards in collaboration with our third-party manufacturers, including the incidence of manufacturing errors, could result in patient injury or death, product recalls or withdrawals, delays or failures in product testing or delivery, cost overruns or other problems that could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMaterials necessary to manufacture our product candidates may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, which may delay the development and commercialization of our product candidates.\nWe rely on the third-party manufacturers of our product candidates to purchase from third-party suppliers the materials necessary to produce the bulk APIs and product candidates for our clinical trials, and we will rely on such manufacturers to purchase such materials to produce the APIs and finished products for any commercial distribution of our products if we obtain marketing approval. Suppliers may not sell these materials to our manufacturers at the time they need them in order to meet our required delivery schedule or on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. We do not have any control over the process or timing of the acquisition of these materials by our manufacturers. Moreover, we currently do not have any agreements for the production of these materials. If our manufacturers are unable to obtain these materials for our clinical trials, testing of the affected product candidate would be delayed, which may significantly impact our ability to develop the product candidate. If we, or our manufacturers, are unable to purchase these materials after regulatory approval has been obtained for one of our products, the commercial launch of such product would be delayed or there would be a shortage in supply of such product, which would harm our ability to generate revenues from such product and achieve or sustain profitability.\nOur product candidates, if approved for sale, may not gain acceptance among physicians, patients and the medical community, thereby limiting our potential to generate revenues.\nIf one of our product candidates is approved for commercial sale by the FDA or other regulatory authorities, the degree of market acceptance of any approved product by physicians, healthcare professionals and third-party payors and our profitability and growth will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7 demonstration of safety and efficacy;\n\u00b7 changes in the practice guidelines and the standard of care for the targeted indication;\n\u00b7 relative convenience and ease of administration;\n\u00b7 the prevalence and severity of any adverse side effects;\n\u00b7 budget impact of adoption of our product on relevant drug formularies\n\u00b7 the availability, cost and potential advantages of alternative treatments, including less expensive generic drugs;\n\u00b7 pricing, reimbursement and cost effectiveness, which may be subject to regulatory control;\n\u00b7 effectiveness of our or any of our partners\u2019 sales and marketing strategies;\n\u00b7 the product labeling or product insert required by the FDA or regulatory authority in other countries; and\n\u00b7 the availability of adequate third-party insurance coverage or reimbursement.\nIf any product candidate that we develop does not provide a treatment regimen that is as beneficial as, or is perceived as being as beneficial as, the current standard of care or otherwise does not provide patient benefit, that product candidate, if approved for commercial sale by the FDA or other regulatory authorities, likely will not achieve market acceptance. Our ability to effectively promote and sell any approved products will also depend on pricing and cost-effectiveness, including our ability to produce a product at a competitive price and our ability to obtain sufficient third-party coverage or reimbursement. If any product candidate is approved but does not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, patients and third-party payors, our ability to generate revenues from that product would be substantially reduced. In addition, our efforts to educate the medical community and third-party payors on the benefits of our product candidates may require significant resources, may be constrained by FDA rules and policies on product promotion, and may never be successful.\nGuidelines and recommendations published by various organizations can impact the use of our products candidates.\nGovernment agencies promulgate regulations and guidelines directly applicable to us and to our product candidates. In addition, professional societies, practice management groups, private health and science foundations and organizations involved in various diseases from time to time may also publish guidelines or recommendations to the health care and patient communities. Recommendations of government agencies or these other groups or organizations may relate to such matters as usage, dosage, route of administration and use of concomitant therapies. Recommendations or guidelines suggesting the reduced use of our product candidates or the use of competitive or alternative products that are followed by patients and health care providers could result in decreased use of our proposed product candidates.\nIf product liability lawsuits are successfully brought against us, we may incur substantial liabilities and may be required to limit commercialization of our product candidates.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability lawsuits related to the testing of our product candidates, and will face an even greater risk if we sell our product candidates commercially. Currently, we are not aware of any anticipated product liability claims with respect to our product candidates. In the future, an individual may bring a liability claim against us if one of our product candidates causes, or merely appears to have caused, an injury. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against the product liability claim, we may incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u00b7 decreased demand for our product candidates;\n\u00b7 injury to our reputation;\n\u00b7 withdrawal of clinical trial participants;\n\u00b7 costs of related litigation;\n\u00b7 initiation of investigations by regulators;\n\u00b7 substantial monetary awards to patients or other claimants;\n\u00b7 distraction of management\u2019s attention from our primary business;\n\u00b7 product recalls;\n\u00b7 loss of revenue; and\n\u00b7 the inability to commercialize our product candidates.\nWe have clinical trial liability insurance with a $5,000,000 aggregate limit. We intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products if marketing approval is obtained for our product candidates. Our current insurance coverage may prove insufficient to cover any liability claims brought against us. In addition, because of the increasing costs of insurance coverage, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or obtain insurance coverage that will be adequate to satisfy liabilities that may arise.\nOur failure to successfully discover, acquire, develop and market additional product candidates or approved products could impair our ability to grow.\nAs part of our growth strategy, we intend to develop and market additional products and product candidates. We are pursuing various therapeutic opportunities through our pipeline. We may spend several years completing our development of any particular current or future internal product candidate, and failure can occur at any stage. The product candidates to which we allocate our resources may not end up being successful. In addition, because our internal research capabilities are limited, we may be dependent upon pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, academic scientists and other researchers to sell or license products or technology to us. The success of this strategy depends partly upon our ability to identify, select, discover and acquire promising pharmaceutical product candidates and products. Failure of this strategy would impair our ability to grow.\nThe process of proposing, negotiating and implementing a license or acquisition of a product candidate or approved product is lengthy and complex. Other companies, including some with substantially greater financial, marketing and sales resources, may compete with us for the license or acquisition of product candidates and approved products. We have limited resources to identify and execute the acquisition or in-licensing of third-party products, businesses and technologies and integrate them into our current infrastructure. Moreover, we may devote resources to potential acquisitions or in-licensing opportunities that are never completed, or we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such efforts. We may not be able to acquire the rights to additional product candidates on terms that we find acceptable, or at all. In addition, future acquisitions may entail numerous operational and financial risks, including:\n\u00b7 disruption of our business and diversion of our management\u2019s time and attention to develop acquired products or technologies;\n\u00b7 incurrence of substantial debt, dilutive issuances of securities or depletion of cash to pay for acquisitions;\n\u00b7 higher than expected acquisition and integration costs;\n\u00b7 difficulty in combining the operations and personnel of any acquired businesses with our operations and personnel;\n\u00b7 increased amortization expenses;\n\u00b7 assumption of known and unknown liabilities;\n\u00b7 impairment of relationships with key suppliers or customers of any acquired businesses due to changes in management and ownership; and\n\u00b7 inability to motivate key employees of any acquired businesses.\nFurther, any product candidate that we acquire may require additional development efforts prior to commercial sale, including extensive clinical testing and approval by the FDA and applicable foreign regulatory authorities. All product candidates are prone to risks of failure typical of pharmaceutical product development, including the possibility that a product candidate will not be shown to be sufficiently safe and effective for approval by regulatory authorities.\nEven if our product candidates receive regulatory approval, they may still face future development and regulatory difficulties.\nEven if U.S. regulatory approval is obtained, the FDA may still impose significant restrictions on a product\u2019s indicated uses or impose ongoing requirements for potentially costly post-approval studies. Plecanatide and our other product candidates, including SP-333, would also be subject to ongoing FDA requirements governing the labeling, packaging, storage, advertising, promotion, recordkeeping and submission of safety and other post-market information. In addition, manufacturers of drug products and their facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities for compliance with GMP, regulations. If we or a regulatory agency discovers previously unknown problems with a product, such as adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where the product is manufactured, a regulatory agency may impose restrictions on that product or the manufacturer, including requiring withdrawal of the product from the market or suspension of manufacturing. If we, our product candidates or the manufacturing facilities for our product candidates fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory agency may:\n\u00b7 issue warning letters;\n\u00b7 impose civil or criminal penalties;\n\u00b7 suspend regulatory approval;\n\u00b7 suspend any ongoing clinical trials;\n\u00b7 refuse to approve pending applications or supplements to applications filed by us;\n\u00b7 impose restrictions on operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements;\n\u00b7 seize or detain products or request us to initiate a product recall; or\n\u00b7 pursue and obtain an injunction.\nDrugs approved to treat IBS have been subject to considerable post- market scrutiny, with consequences up to and including voluntary withdrawal of approved products from the market. This may heighten FDA scrutiny of our product candidates before or following market approval.\nProducts approved for the treatment of IBS have been subject to considerable post-market scrutiny. For example, in 2007, Novartis voluntarily discontinued marketing Zelnorm (tegaserod), a product approved for the treatment of women with IBS-C, after the FDA found an increased risk of serious cardiovascular events associated with the use of the drug. Earlier, in 2000, GlaxoWellcome withdrew Lotronex (alosetron), which was approved for women with severe diarrhea-prominent IBS, after the manufacturer received numerous reports of adverse events or AEs, including ischemic colitis, severely obstructed or ruptured bowel, or death. In 2002, the FDA approved the manufacturer\u2019s application to make Lotronex available again, on the condition that the drug only be made available through a restricted marketing program.\nAlthough plecanatide is being investigated for IBS, plecanatide is from a different pharmacologic class than Zelnorm or Lotronex, and would not be expected to share the same clinical risk profile as those agents. Nevertheless, because these products are in the same or related therapeutic classes, it is possible that the FDA will have heightened scrutiny of plecanatide or any other agent under development for IBS. This could delay product approval, increase the cost of our clinical development program, or increase the cost of post- market study commitments for our IBS product candidates, including plecanatide.\nEven if our product candidates receive regulatory approval in the United States, we may never receive approval to commercialize them outside of the United States.\nIn the future, we may seek to commercialize plecanatide and/or our other product candidates, including SP-333, in foreign countries outside of the United States. In order to market any products outside of the United States, we must establish and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other jurisdictions regarding safety and efficacy. Approvals procedures vary among jurisdictions and can involve product testing and administrative review periods different from, and greater than, those in the United States. The time required to obtain approval in other jurisdictions might differ from that required to obtain FDA approval. The regulatory approval process in other jurisdictions may include all of the risks detailed above regarding FDA approval in the United States as well as other risks. Regulatory approval in one jurisdiction does not ensure regulatory approval in another, but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one jurisdiction may have a negative effect on the regulatory processes in others. Failure to obtain regulatory approvals in other jurisdictions or any delay or setback in obtaining such approvals could have the same adverse effects detailed above regarding FDA approval in the United States. As described above, such effects include the risks that plecanatide or our other product candidates may not be approved for all indications for use included in proposed labeling or for any indications at all, which could limit the uses of plecanatide or other product candidates and have an adverse effect on our products\u2019 commercial potential or require costly post-marketing studies.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may not be able to seek or obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates.\nWe have agreements with third-party contract research organizations, or CROs, under which we have delegated to the CROs the responsibility to coordinate and monitor the conduct of our clinical trials and to manage data for our clinical programs. We, our CROs and our clinical sites are required to comply with current Good Clinical Practices, or cGCPs, regulations and guidelines issued by the FDA and by similar governmental authorities in other countries where we are conducting clinical trials. We have an ongoing obligation to monitor the activities conducted by our CROs and at our clinical sites to confirm compliance with these requirements. In the future, if we, our CROs or our clinical sites fail to comply with applicable GCPs, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with product produced under cGMP regulations, and will require a large number of test subjects. Our failure to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process.\nIf CROs do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, if they need to be replaced, or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to their failure to adhere to our clinical protocols, regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our product candidates. As a result, our financial results and the commercial prospects for our product candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase, and our ability to generate revenue could be delayed.\nReimbursement may not be available for our product candidates, which would impede sales.\nMarket acceptance and sales of our product candidates may depend on coverage and reimbursement policies and health care reform measures. Decisions about formulary coverage as well as levels at which government authorities and third-party payers, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, reimburse patients for the price they pay for our products as well as levels at which these payors pay directly for our products, where applicable, could affect whether we are able to commercialize these products. We cannot be sure that reimbursement will be available for any of these products. Also, we cannot be sure that coverage or reimbursement amounts will not reduce the demand for, or the price of, our products. We have not commenced efforts to have our product candidates reimbursed by government or third party payors. If coverage and reimbursement are not available or are available only at limited levels, we may not be able to commercialize our products.\nIn recent years, officials have made numerous proposals to change the health care system in the United States. These proposals include measures that would limit or prohibit payments for certain medical treatments or subject the pricing of drugs to government control. In addition, in many foreign countries, particularly the countries of the European Union, the pricing of prescription drugs is subject to government control. If our products are or become subject to government regulation that limits or prohibits payment for our products, or that subjects the price of our products to governmental control, we may not be able to generate revenue, attain profitability or commercialize our products.\nAs a result of legislative proposals and the trend towards managed health care in the United States, third-party payors are increasingly attempting to contain health care costs by limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement of new drugs. They may also impose strict prior authorization requirements and/or refuse to provide any coverage of uses of approved products for medical indications other than those for which the FDA has granted market approvals. As a result, significant uncertainty exists as to whether and how much third-party payors will reimburse patients for their use of newly-approved drugs, which in turn will put pressure on the pricing of drugs.\nHealthcare reform measures could hinder or prevent our product candidates\u2019 commercial success.\nThe U.S. government and other governments have shown significant interest in pursuing healthcare reform. Any government-adopted reform measures could adversely impact the pricing of healthcare products and services in the United States or internationally and the amount of reimbursement available from governmental agencies or other third party payors. The continuing efforts of the U.S. and foreign governments, insurance companies, managed care organizations and other payors of health care services to contain or reduce health care costs may adversely affect our ability to set prices for our products which we believe are fair, and our ability to generate revenues and achieve and maintain profitability.\nNew laws, regulations and judicial decisions, or new interpretations of existing laws, regulations and decisions, that relate to healthcare availability, methods of delivery or payment for products and services, or sales, marketing or pricing, may limit our potential revenue, and we may need to revise our research and development programs. The pricing and reimbursement environment may change in the future and become more challenging due to several reasons, including policies advanced by the current executive administration in the United States, new healthcare legislation or fiscal challenges faced by government health administration authorities. Specifically, in both the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the health care system in ways that could affect our ability to sell our products profitably.\nFor example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, or the PPACA has substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both government health plans and private insurers, and significantly impacts the pharmaceutical industry. The PPACA contains a number of provisions that are expected to impact our business and operations in ways that may negatively affect our potential revenues in the future. For example, the PPACA imposes a non-deductible excise tax on pharmaceutical manufacturers or importers that sell branded prescription drugs to U.S. government programs which we believe will increase the cost of our products. In addition, as part of the PPACA\u2019s provisions closing a funding gap that currently exists in the Medicare Part D prescription drug program (commonly known as the \u201cdonut hole\u201d), we will be required to provide a discount on branded prescription drugs equal to 50% of the government-negotiated price, for drugs provided to certain beneficiaries who fall within the donut hole. Similarly, PPACA increases the level of Medicaid rebates payable by manufacturers of brand-name drugs from 15.1% to 23.1% and requires collection of rebates for drugs paid by Medicaid managed care organizations. The PPACA also includes significant changes to the 340B drug discount program including expansion of the list of eligible covered entities that may purchase drugs under the program. At the same time, the expansion in eligibility for health insurance benefits created under PPACA is expected to increase the number of patients with insurance coverage who may receive our products. While it is too early to predict all the specific effects the PPACA or any future healthcare reform legislation will have on our business, they could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nCongress periodically adopts legislation like the PPACA and the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, that modifies Medicare reimbursement and coverage policies pertaining to prescription drugs. Implementation of these laws is subject to ongoing revision through regulatory and sub regulatory policies. Congress also may consider additional changes to Medicare policies, potentially including Medicare prescription drug policies, as part of ongoing budget negotiations. While the scope of any such legislation is uncertain at this time, there can be no assurances that future legislation or regulations will not decrease the coverage and price that we may receive for our proposed products. Other third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services. It will be time consuming and expensive for us to go through the process of seeking coverage and reimbursement from Medicare and private payors. Our proposed products may not be considered cost-effective, and coverage and reimbursement may not be available or sufficient to allow us to sell our proposed products on a profitable basis. Further federal and state proposals and health care reforms are likely which could limit the prices that can be charged for the product candidates that we develop and may further limit our commercial opportunities. Our results of operations could be materially adversely affected by proposed healthcare reforms, by the Medicare prescription drug coverage legislation, by the possible effect of such current or future legislation on amounts that private insurers will pay and by other health care reforms that may be enacted or adopted in the future.\nIn September 2007, the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007 was enacted, giving the FDA enhanced post-marketing authority, including the authority to require post-marketing studies and clinical trials, labeling changes based on new safety information, and compliance with risk evaluations and mitigation strategies approved by the FDA. The FDA\u2019s exercise of this authority could result in delays or increased costs during product development, clinical trials and regulatory review, increased costs to assure compliance with post-approval regulatory requirements, and potential restrictions on the sale and/or distribution of approved products.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which would cause our business and reputation to suffer.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our suppliers and business partners, as well as personally identifiable information of clinical trial participants and employees. Similarly, our business partners and third party providers possess certain of our sensitive data. The secure maintenance of this information is critical to our operations and business strategy. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information, including our data being breached at our business partners or third-party providers, could result in legal claims or proceedings, liability under laws that protect the privacy of personal information, disrupt our operations, and damage our reputation which could adversely affect our business.\nOur clinical activities involve the handling of hazardous materials, and we must comply with environmental laws and regulations, which can be expensive and restrict how we do business.\nOur pre-clinical and clinical activities involve the controlled storage, use and disposal of hazardous materials. We are subject to federal, state, city and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations governing, among other matters, the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these hazardous materials. We cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of an accident or if we fail to comply with such laws or regulations, local, city, state or federal authorities may curtail the use of these materials and interrupt our business operations or impose sanctions, such as fines, and we could be liable for any resulting damages or liabilities. We do not currently maintain hazardous materials insurance coverage.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards may be subject to limitation.\nGenerally, a change of more than 50% in the ownership of a company\u2019s stock, by value, over a three-year period constitutes an ownership change for U.S. federal income tax purposes. An ownership change may limit our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards attributable to the period prior to the change. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards to offset U.S. federal taxable income may become subject to limitations, which could potentially result in increased future tax liability for us. At December 31, 2014, we had net operating loss (NOL) carryforwards aggregating approximately $284 million. We have determined that an ownership change occurred as of April 30, 2003 pursuant to Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Code. In addition, the shares of our common stock that we issued from July 14, 2008 through July 8, 2010 have resulted in an additional ownership change. Finally the merger with Callisto Pharmaceuticals, Inc. concluded on January 17, 2013 was a 100% change of control with respect to Callisto NOL carryforwards. As a result of these events, our ability to utilize our operating loss carryforwards discussed above is significantly limited.\nRisks Related to our Intellectual Property\nIt is difficult and costly to protect our proprietary rights, and we may not be able to ensure protection of such rights.\nOur commercial success will depend in part on obtaining and maintaining patent protection and trade secret protection of our product candidates, and the methods used to manufacture them, as well as successfully defending these patents against third-party challenges. We will only be able to protect our product candidates from unauthorized making, using, selling and offering to sell or importation by third parties to the extent that we have rights under valid and enforceable patents or trade secrets that cover these activities.\nPatents and Proprietary Rights\nAs of March 6, 2015 we have 15 issued United States patents related to guanylate cyclase agonists. Two of these patents cover the composition-of-matter of plecanatide and were issued on May 9, 2006 and September 21, 2010; they will expire in 2023 and 2022, respectively. The patent that issued on May 9, 2006 has claims directed to the species of plecanatide, whereas the patent that issued on September 21, 2010 has claims directed to a genus of peptides that are identical in length to plecanatide and is inclusive of plecanatide. A third patent covers the composition-of-matter of SP-333 issued on February 1, 2011 and expires in 2028. A fourth patent granted October 11, 2011 covers the composition-of-matter of certain analogs related to plecanatide and SP-333 and will expire in 2029. A fifth patent granted February 14, 2012 covers certain methods of treating inflammatory bowel disease using plecanatide and will expire in 2022. A sixth patent granted January 28, 2014 covers methods of stimulating water transport in the gastrointestinal tract using plecanatide and will expire in 2022. A seventh patent granted June 26, 2012 covers an additional composition-of-matter related to certain analogs of plecanatide and SP-333 and will expire in 2029. An eighth patent granted on January 22, 2013 covers another composition-of-matter related to certain analogs of plecanatide and will expire in 2029. A ninth patent granted on July 30, 2013 covers another composition-of-matter related to certain analogs of plecanatide and will expire in 2029. Another three patents that also cover compositions-of-matter related to certain analogs of plecanatide were issued on February 5, 2013, October 29, 2013, and March 4, 2014 and will expire in 2029. A thirteenth patent granted May 6, 2014 covers certain methods of treating a variety of gastrointestinal and other disorders using SP-333 and will expire in 2029. A fourteenth patent granted December 2, 2014 and covers composition-of-matter of SP-333 and expires in 2028. A fifteenth patent granted on March 3, 2015 and covers methods of use of plecanatide and expires in 2031. In addition, we have four granted foreign patents which cover the composition-of-matter of plecanatide and expire in 2022. These foreign patents cover Austria, Belgium, Switzerland, Cyprus, Germany, Denmark, Spain, Finland, France, the United Kingdom, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Monaco, the Netherlands, Portugal, Sweden, Turkey, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Moldova, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Canada and Japan. We also have six granted foreign patents that cover the composition-of-matter related to SP-333 that expire in 2028. These patents cover Switzerland, Germany, Denmark, Spain, France, the United Kingdom, Ireland, Italy, the Netherlands, Hong Kong, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Moldova, the Russian Federation, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, China, Australia, Japan and Mexico. We also have two foreign patents that cover composition-of-matter of certain analogs related to plecanatide and expire in 2029. This patent covers Australia, France, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom.\nAdditionally, as of the date of this report on Form 10-K, we have 13 pending United States utility patent applications; 2 pending U.S. provisional applications; and 66 pending foreign patent applications relating to plecanatide and SP-333, various derivatives and analogs of plecanatide and SP-333, and their uses and manufacture.\nIn April 2010, two parties filed an opposition to one of our granted European patents with the European Patent Office. An opposition hearing was held December 14, 2011, which resulted in the European Patent Office issuing the following statement: \u201cAccount being taken of the amendments made by the patent proprietor during the opposition proceedings, the patent and the invention to which it relates are found to meet the requirements of the European Patent Convention (Art.101(3)(a)EPC).\u201d In particular, the composition-of-matter claim covering plecanatide was upheld.\nOn September 14, 2012 we entered into a binding letter of intent with Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (\u201cIronwood\u201d), pursuant to which we and Ironwood agreed to enter into a definitive license agreement giving us an exclusive worldwide license to Ironwood\u2019s method of use patents on plecanatide for the treatment of chronic constipation, or CC. The letter of intent contemplates a low single digit royalty on net sales of plecanatide and both parties agreed not to challenge each other\u2019s patents covering certain GC-C agonists, except that we retain the right to challenge Ironwood\u2019s method of use patents on plecanatide.\nDuring 2013, we transferred ownership of all FV-100 intellectual property rights we acquired from BristolMeyersSquib Company (\u201cBMS\u201d), in August 2012, to ContraVir, our former majority-owned subsidiary which we spun off to our shareholders on February 18, 2014. The FV-100 assets acquired by ContraVir from us are licensed from University College Cardiff Consultants Limited (\u201cCardiff\u201d) pursuant to the terms of that certain Patent and Technology License Agreement, dated as of February 2, 2005, between Cardiff and Contravir Research Incorporated, an entity with no prior relationship with the Company (\u201cCRI\u201d), as amended March 27, 2007, which ContraVir assumed from us (the \u201cCardiff Agreement\u201d). Cardiff and Rega Foundation (\u201cRega\u201d) were originally the joint owners of the patent rights. Pursuant to the terms of an agreement, dated September 24, 1998, as amended December 23, 2004, Cardiff received from Rega an exclusive, irrevocable worldwide license to manufacture, use, sell, or otherwise deal in or with products utilizing the patent rights, including the right to grant sublicenses thereunder. We assumed the obligations under the Cardiff Agreement from BMS pursuant to the terms of the BMS Agreement. BMS assumed the obligations under the Cardiff Agreement from Inhibitex Inc. (\u201cInhibitex\u201d) upon its acquisition of Inhibitex in January 2012. Inhibitex assumed the obligations under the Cardiff Agreement upon its acquisition of FermaVir Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (\u201cFermaVir\u201d) in September 2010. FermaVir was the successor to CRI in a merger consummated in August 2005.\nFor example:\n\u00b7 others may be able to make compounds that are competitive with our products but that are not covered by the claims of our patents;\n\u00b7 we may not have been the first to make the inventions covered by our pending patent applications;\n\u00b7 we may not have been the first to file patent applications for these inventions;\n\u00b7 others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies;\n\u00b7 it is possible that our pending patent applications will not result in issued patents\n\u00b7 it is possible that our issued patents could be narrowed in scope, invalidated, held to be unenforceable, or circumvented;\n\u00b7 we may not develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable; or\n\u00b7 the patents of others may have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe also may rely on trade secrets to protect our technology, especially where we do not believe patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. While we use reasonable efforts to protect our trade secrets, our employees, consultants, contractors, outside scientific collaborators and other advisors may unintentionally or willfully disclose our information to competitors. Enforcing a claim that a third party illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets is expensive and time consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the United States are sometimes less willing to protect trade secrets. Moreover, our competitors may independently develop equivalent knowledge, methods and know-how.\nWe may incur substantial costs as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to patent and other intellectual property rights and we may be unable to protect our rights to, or use, our technology.\nIf we choose to go to court to stop someone else from using the inventions claimed in our patents, that individual or company has the right to ask the court to rule that these patents are invalid and/or should not be enforced against that third party. These lawsuits are expensive and would consume time and other resources even if we were successful in stopping the infringement of these patents. In addition, there is a risk that the court will decide that these patents are not valid and that we do not have the right to stop the other party from using the inventions. There is also the risk that, even if the validity of these patents is upheld, the court will refuse to stop the other party on the ground that such other party\u2019s activities do not infringe our rights to these patents.\nFurthermore, a third party may claim that we are using inventions covered by the third party\u2019s patent rights and may go to court to stop us from engaging in our normal operations and activities, including making or selling our product candidates. These lawsuits are costly and could affect our results of operations and divert the attention of managerial and technical personnel. There is a risk that a court would decide that we are infringing the third party\u2019s patents and would order us to stop the activities covered by the patents. In addition, there is a risk that a court\nwill order us to pay the other party damages for having violated the other party\u2019s patents. The biotechnology industry has produced a proliferation of patents, and it is not always clear to industry participants, including us, which patents cover various types of products or methods of use. The coverage of patents is subject to interpretation by the courts, and the interpretation is not always uniform. If we are sued for patent infringement, we would need to demonstrate that our products or methods of use either do not infringe the patent claims of the relevant patent and/or that the patent claims are invalid, and we may not be able to do this. Proving invalidity, in particular, is difficult since it requires a showing of clear and convincing evidence to overcome the presumption of validity enjoyed by issued patents.\nBecause some patent applications in the United States may be maintained in secrecy until the patents are issued, patent applications in the United States and many foreign jurisdictions are typically not published until eighteen months after filing, and publications in the scientific literature often lag behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that others have not filed patent applications for technology covered by our issued patents or our pending applications or that we were the first to invent the technology. Our competitors have filed, and may in the future file, patent applications covering technology similar to ours. Any such patent application may have priority over our patent applications and could further require us to obtain rights to issued patents covering such technologies. If another party has filed a United States patent application on inventions similar to ours, we may have to participate in an interference proceeding declared by the PTO, to determine priority of invention in the United States. The costs of these proceedings could be substantial, and it is possible that such efforts would be unsuccessful, resulting in a loss of our United States patent position with respect to such inventions.\nSome of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. In addition, any uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation could have a material adverse effect on our ability to raise the funds necessary to continue our operations.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submissions, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nThe PTO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentaries, fee payment and other provisions during the patent process. There are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. In such an event, competitors might be able to enter the market earlier than would otherwise have been the case.\nWe have not yet registered trademarks for plecanatide in our potential markets, and failure to secure those registrations could adversely affect our ability to market our product candidate and our business.\nWe have not yet registered trademarks for plecanatide in any jurisdiction. Our trademark applications in the United States, when filed, and any other jurisdictions where we may file may not be allowed for registration, and our registered trademarks may not be maintained or enforced. During trademark registration proceedings, we may receive rejections. Although we are given an opportunity to respond to those rejections, we may be unable to overcome such rejections. In addition, in the PTO and in comparable agencies in many foreign jurisdictions, third parties are given an opportunity to oppose pending trademark applications and to seek to cancel registered trademarks. Opposition or cancellation proceedings may be filed against our trademarks, and our trademarks may not survive such proceedings. Failure to secure such trademark registrations in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions could adversely affect our ability to market our product candidates and our business.\nConfidentiality agreements with employees and others may not adequately prevent disclosure of our trade secrets and other proprietary information and may not adequately protect our intellectual property, which could limit our ability to compete.\nBecause we operate in the highly technical field of research and development of small molecule drugs, we rely in part on trade secret protection in order to protect our proprietary trade secrets and unpatented know-how. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect, and we cannot be certain that others will not develop the same or similar technologies on their own. We have taken steps, including entering into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers and other advisors, to protect our trade secrets and unpatented know-how. These agreements generally require that the other party keep confidential and not disclose to third parties all confidential information developed by the party or made known to the party by us during the course of the party\u2019s relationship with us. We also typically obtain agreements from these parties that provide that inventions conceived by the party in the course of rendering services to us will be our exclusive property. However, these agreements may not be honored and may not effectively assign intellectual property rights to us. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets or know-how is difficult, expensive and time consuming, and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the United States may be less willing to protect trade secrets or know-how. The failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive position.\nWe may be subject to claims that our employees have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of their former employers.\nAs is common in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry, we employ individuals who were previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Although no claims against us are currently pending, we may be subject to claims that these employees or we have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management.\nRisks Related to the Notes\nThe indenture contains covenants limiting our financial and operating flexibility.\nThe indenture contains covenants that will restrict our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to:\n\u00b7 incur or guarantee additional indebtedness, other than subordinated debt;\n\u00b7 declare or pay any dividends on our or our subsidiaries\u2019 capital stock;\n\u00b7 redeem or repurchase capital stock or prepay or repurchase subordinated debt; or\n\u00b7 sell or license rights in North America to or otherwise encumber any of the intellectual property related to plecanatide.\nThese restrictive covenants could limit our ability to pursue our growth plans, restrict our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry and increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions. We may enter into additional financing arrangements in the future, which could further restrict our flexibility.\nAny defaults of covenants contained in the Notes may lead to an event of default under the Notes and the indenture. We may not be able to pay any amounts due to holders of the Notes in the event of such default, and such default may significantly impair our ability to satisfy our obligations under the Notes.\nWe will not make any adjustment to the conversion rate for Notes converted in connection with a fundamental change, and noteholders will not be compensated for any lost value of their Notes as a result of such transaction.\nWe will not increase or make any other adjustment to the conversion rate upon a conversion of Notes in connection with a fundamental change or similar event. Therefore, noteholders will not be compensated for any lost value of their Notes as a result of such transaction.\nThe Notes are effectively subordinated to any of our future secured debt and any liabilities of our subsidiaries.\nThe Notes will rank senior in right of payment to our future indebtedness that is expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Notes; equal in right of payment to our trade payables and other future unsecured indebtedness that is not so subordinated; effectively junior to any of our secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness; and structurally junior to all future indebtedness (including trade payables) incurred by our subsidiaries. In the event of our bankruptcy, liquidation, reorganization or other winding up, our assets that secure debt ranking senior or equal in right of payment to the Notes will be available to pay obligations on the Notes only after the secured debt has been repaid in full. There may not be sufficient assets remaining to pay amounts due on any or all of the Notes then outstanding.\nServicing our debt will require a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to pay our debt.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness, including the Notes, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations.\nRecent regulatory actions may adversely affect the trading price and liquidity of the Notes.\nWe expect that investors in, and potential purchasers of, the Notes may employ, or seek to employ, an arbitrage strategy with respect to the Notes. Investors that employ an arbitrage strategy with respect to the Notes typically implement that strategy by selling short the common stock underlying the Notes and dynamically adjusting their short position while they hold the Notes. Investors may also implement this hedging strategy by entering into swaps on our common stock in lieu of or in addition to short selling the common stock.\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) and other regulatory and self-regulatory authorities have implemented various rules and may adopt additional rules in the future that may impact those engaging in short selling activity involving equity securities (including our common stock), including Rule 201 of SEC regulation SHO, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc.\u2019s \u201cLimit Up-Limit Down\u201d program, market-wide circuit breaker systems that halt trading of stock for certain periods following specific market declines, and rules\nstemming from the enactment and implementation of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Past regulatory actions, including emergency actions or regulations, have had a significant impact on the trading prices and liquidity of equity-linked instruments. Any governmental action that similarly restricts the ability of investors in, or potential purchasers of, the Notes to effect short sales of our common stock could similarly adversely affect the trading price and the liquidity of the Notes.\nVolatility in the market price and trading volume of our common stock could adversely impact the trading price of the Notes.\nThe stock market in recent years has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of companies. The market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly for many reasons, including in response to the risks described in this section, elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or the documents we have incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or for reasons unrelated to our operations, such as reports by industry analysts, investor perceptions or negative announcements by our customers, competitors or suppliers regarding their own performance, as well as industry conditions and general financial, economic and political instability. A decrease in the market price of our common stock would likely adversely impact the trading price of the Notes. The market price of our common stock could also be affected by possible sales of our common stock by investors who view the Notes as a more attractive means of equity participation in us and by hedging or arbitrage trading activity that we expect to develop involving our common stock. This trading activity could, in turn, affect the trading prices of the Notes. This may result in greater volatility in the trading price of the Notes than would be expected for non-convertible debt securities.\nSubject to certain limitations, we continue to have the ability to incur debt; if we incur substantial additional debt, these higher levels of debt may affect our ability to pay the principal of and interest on the Notes.\nSubject to certain limitations, we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional debt in the future, some of which may be secured debt. The indenture governing the Notes does not restrict our ability to incur additional subordinated indebtedness or require us to maintain financial ratios or specified levels of net worth or liquidity. If we incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future, these higher levels of indebtedness may affect our ability to pay the principal of and interest on the Notes, or any fundamental change purchase price, and our creditworthiness generally.\nWe may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to purchase the Notes as required upon a fundamental change, and our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to purchase of the Notes.\nFollowing a fundamental change as defined, holders of Notes will have the right to require us to purchase their Notes for cash. A fundamental change may also constitute an event of default or prepayment under, and result in the acceleration of the maturity of, our then-existing indebtedness. We cannot assure noteholders that we will have sufficient financial resources, or will be able to arrange financing, to pay the fundamental change purchase price in cash with respect to any Notes surrendered by holders for purchase upon a fundamental change. In addition, restrictions in our then existing credit facilities or other indebtedness, if any, may not allow us to purchase the Notes upon a fundamental change. Our failure to purchase the Notes upon a fundamental change when required would result in an event of default with respect to the Notes which could, in turn, constitute a default under the terms of our other indebtedness, if any. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness and purchase the Notes.\nSome significant restructuring transactions may not constitute a fundamental change, in which case we would not be obligated to offer to purchase the Notes.\nUpon the occurrence of a fundamental change as defined, noteholders have the right to require us to purchase their Notes. However, the fundamental change provisions will not afford protection to holders of Notes in the event of certain transactions that could adversely affect the Notes. For example, transactions such as leveraged recapitalizations, refinancings, restructurings or acquisitions initiated by us would not constitute a fundamental change requiring us to repurchase the Notes. In addition, holders will not be entitled to require us to purchase their Notes upon a significant change in the composition of our board. In the event of any such transaction, holders of the Notes would not have the right to require us to purchase their Notes, even though each of these transactions could increase the amount of our indebtedness, or otherwise adversely affect our capital structure or any credit ratings, thereby adversely affecting holders of the Notes.\nFuture sales of our common stock in the public market could lower the market price for our common stock and adversely impact the trading price of the Notes.\nIn the future, we may sell additional shares of our common stock to raise capital. In addition, a substantial number of shares of our common stock are reserved for issuance upon the exercise of stock options and warrants and upon conversion of the Notes. We cannot predict the size of future issuances or the effect, if any, that they may have on the market price for our common stock. The issuance and sale of substantial amounts of common stock, or the perception that such issuances and sales may occur, could adversely affect the trading price of the Notes and the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities.\nThe Notes may not have an active market, and the price may be volatile, so noteholders may be unable to sell their Notes at the price they desire or at all.\nThe Notes are a new issue of securities for which there is currently no active trading market. We cannot be certain that a liquid market will develop for the Notes, that noteholders will be able to sell any of the Notes at a particular time (if at all) or that the prices they receive if or when noteholders sell the Notes will be above their initial offering price. In addition, we do not intend to apply to list the Notes on any securities exchange or for inclusion of the Notes on any automated dealer quotation system. The initial purchasers have advised us that they intend to make a market in the Notes, but they are not obligated to do so and may discontinue any market-making in the Notes at any time in their sole discretion and without notice. Future trading prices of the Notes on any market that may develop will depend on many factors, including our operating performance and financial condition, prevailing interest rates, the market for similar securities and general economic conditions.\nMoreover, even if noteholders are able to sell their Notes, they may not receive a favorable price for their Notes. Future trading prices of the Notes will depend on many factors, including, among other things, prevailing interest rates, our operating results, the price of our common stock and the market for similar securities. Historically, the market for convertible debt has been subject to disruptions that have caused volatility in prices. It is possible that the market for the Notes will be subject to disruptions that may have a negative effect on the holders of the Notes, regardless of our prospects or financial performance.\nAny adverse rating of the Notes may negatively affect the trading price and liquidity of the Notes and the price of our common stock.\nWe do not intend to seek a rating on the Notes. However, if a rating service were to rate the Notes and if such rating service were to assign the Notes a rating lower than the rating expected by investors or were to lower its rating on the Notes below the rating initially assigned to the Notes or otherwise announce its intention to put the Notes on credit watch, the trading price or liquidity of the Notes and the price of our common stock could decline.\nThe conversion rate of the Notes may not be adjusted for all dilutive events.\nThe conversion rate of the Notes is subject to adjustment for certain events, including, but not limited to, the issuance to all or substantially all holders of our common stock of stock dividends, certain rights, options or warrants, capital stock, indebtedness, assets or cash, and subdivisions and combinations of our common stock, and certain issuer tender or exchange offers as defined. However, the conversion rate will not be adjusted for other events, such as a third-party tender or exchange offer or an issuance of common stock for cash, that may adversely affect the trading price of the Notes or the common stock. An event that adversely affects the value of the Notes may occur, and that event may not result in an adjustment to the conversion rate.\nThe Notes are protected by restrictive covenants only to a limited extent.\nThe indenture governing the Notes does not contain any financial or operating covenants or restrictions on the payment of dividends, the incurrence of indebtedness or the issuance or repurchase of securities by us or any of our subsidiaries. The indenture does not contain covenants or other provisions to afford protection to holders of the Notes in the event of a fundamental change except as defined. We could engage in many types of transactions, such as acquisitions, refinancings or recapitalizations that could substantially affect our capital structure and the value of the Notes and shares of our common stock but may not constitute a fundamental change that permits holders to require us to purchase their Notes. For these reasons, noteholders should not consider the covenants in the indenture or the fundamental change purchase feature of the Notes as significant factors in evaluating whether to invest in the Notes.\nThe issuance of shares of common stock upon conversions of the Notes will dilute the ownership interest of our existing stockholders, including holders who had previously converted their Notes.\nThe issuance of shares of common stock upon the conversion of some or all of the Notes will dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders. Any sales in the public market of such shares of our common stock could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the Notes could depress the price of our common stock.\nNoteholders are not entitled to any rights with respect to our common stock, but are subject to all changes made with respect to our common stock to the extent noteholders convert their Notes and receive shares of our common stock.\nHolders who convert their Notes will not be entitled to any rights with respect to our common stock (including, without limitation, voting rights and rights to receive any dividends or other distributions on our common stock) until the conversion date relating to such Notes, but holders of Notes will be subject to all changes affecting our common stock. For example, if an amendment is proposed to our certificate of incorporation or by-laws requiring stockholder approval and the record date for determining the stockholders of record entitled to vote on the amendment occurs prior to the conversion date with respect to any Notes surrendered for conversion, then the holder surrendering such Notes will not be entitled to vote on the amendment, although such holder will nevertheless be subject to any changes affecting our common stock.\nUpon conversion of the Notes, holders may receive less valuable consideration than expected because the value of our common stock may decline after they exercise their conversion right but before we settle our conversion obligation.\nUnder the Notes, a converting holder will be exposed to fluctuations in the value of our common stock during the period from the date such holder surrenders Notes for conversion until the date we settle our conversion obligation.\nUpon conversion of the Notes, we will be required to deliver the shares of our common stock, together with cash for any fractional share, on the third business day following the relevant conversion date. Accordingly, if the price of our common stock decreases during this period, the value of the shares that you receive will be adversely affected and would be less than the conversion value of the Notes on the conversion date.\nThe fundamental change purchase feature of the Notes may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial attempt to take over our company.\nThe terms of the Notes require us to offer to purchase the Notes for cash in the event of a fundamental change, as defined. A non-stock takeover of our company may trigger the requirement that we purchase the Notes. This feature may have the effect of delaying or preventing a takeover of our company that would otherwise be beneficial to investors.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe market price of our common stock may be volatile and adversely affected by several factors.\nThe market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly in response to various factors and events, including:\n\u00b7 our ability to integrate operations, technology, products and services;\n\u00b7 our ability to execute our business plan;\n\u00b7 operating results below expectations;\n\u00b7 announcements concerning product development results, including clinical trial results, or intellectual property rights of others;\n\u00b7 litigation or public concern about the safety of our potential products;\n\u00b7 our issuance of additional securities, including debt or equity or a combination thereof, necessary to fund our operating expenses;\n\u00b7 announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7 loss of any strategic relationship;\n\u00b7 industry developments, including, without limitation, changes in healthcare policies or practices or third-party reimbursement policies;\n\u00b7 economic and other external factors;\n\u00b7 period-to-period fluctuations in our financial results; and\n\u00b7 whether an active trading market in our common stock develops and is maintained.\nIn addition, the securities markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These market fluctuations may also materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe have not paid cash dividends in the past and do not expect to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future. Any return on investment in shares of common stock may be limited to the value of our common stock.\nWe have never paid cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. The payment of dividends on our capital stock will depend on our earnings, financial condition and other business and economic factors affecting us at such time as the board of directors may consider relevant. If we do not pay dividends, our common stock may be less valuable because a return on any investment in shares of our common stock will only occur if the common stock price appreciates.\nA sale of a substantial number of shares of the common stock may cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nIf our stockholders sell, or the market perceives that our stockholders intend to sell for various reasons, substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market it may make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that we deem reasonable or appropriate.\nThe stock markets have from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices for the common stock of biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies. These broad market fluctuations may cause the market price of our common stock to decline. In the past, securities class action litigation has often been brought against a company following a decline in the market price of our securities. This risk is especially relevant for us because biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies have experienced significant stock price volatility in recent years. We may become involved in this type of litigation in the future. Litigation often is expensive and diverts management\u2019s attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly.\nWe expect our operating results to be subject to quarterly fluctuations. Our net loss and other operating results will be affected by numerous factors, including:\n\u00b7 variations in the level of expenses related to our development programs;\n\u00b7 initiation or completion of clinical trials;\n\u00b7 any intellectual property infringement lawsuit in which we may become involved;\n\u00b7 regulatory developments affecting our product candidates;\n\u00b7 our execution of any collaborative, licensing or similar arrangements, and the timing of payments under these arrangements; and\n\u00b7 if plecanatide receives regulatory approval, the level of underlying demand for that product and wholesalers\u2019 buying patterns.\nIf our quarterly operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. Furthermore, any quarterly fluctuations in our operating results may, in turn, cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially.\nIf we fail to comply with the rules under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 related to accounting controls and procedures, or if we discover material weaknesses and deficiencies in our internal control and accounting procedures, our stock price could decline significantly and raising capital could be more difficult.\nIf we fail to comply with the rules under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 related to disclosure controls and procedures, or, if we discover material weaknesses and other deficiencies in our internal control and accounting procedures, our stock price could decline significantly and raising capital could be more difficult. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and a report by our independent auditors addressing these assessments. If material weaknesses or significant deficiencies are discovered or if we otherwise fail to achieve and maintain the adequacy of our internal control, we may not be able to ensure that we can conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Moreover, effective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important to helping prevent financial fraud. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our business and operating results could be harmed, investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information, and the trading price of our common stock could drop significantly.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law may have anti-takeover effects that could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control, which may cause our stock price, and the value of the Notes, to decline.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, even if closing such a transaction would be beneficial to our stockholders or holders of the Notes. We are authorized to issue up to 20,000,000 shares of preferred stock. This preferred stock may be issued in one or more series, the terms of which may be determined at the time of issuance by our board of directors without further action by stockholders. The terms of any series of preferred stock may include voting rights (including the right to vote as a series on particular matters), preferences as to dividend, liquidation, conversion and redemption rights and sinking fund provisions. No preferred stock is currently outstanding. The issuance of any preferred stock could materially adversely affect the rights of the holders of our common stock, and therefore, reduce the value of our common stock and the Notes. In particular, specific rights granted to future holders of preferred stock could be used to restrict our ability to merge with, or sell our assets to, a third party and thereby preserve control by the present management.\nProvisions of our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law also could have the effect of discouraging potential acquisition proposals or making a tender offer or delaying or preventing a change in control, including changes a stockholder or holder of the Notes might consider favorable. Such provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management. In particular, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws and Delaware law, as applicable, among other things:\n\u00b7 provide the board of directors with the ability to alter the bylaws without stockholder approval;\n\u00b7 place limitations on the removal of directors; and\n\u00b7 provide that vacancies on the board of directors may be filled by a majority of directors in office, although less than a quorum.\nWe are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law which, subject to certain exceptions, prohibits \u201cbusiness combinations\u201d between a publicly-held Delaware corporation and an \u201cinterested stockholder,\u201d which is generally defined as a stockholder who becomes a beneficial owner of 15% or more of a Delaware corporation\u2019s voting stock for a three-year period following the date that such stockholder became an interested stockholder. These provisions are expected to discourage certain types of coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids and to encourage persons seeking to acquire control of us to first negotiate with our board. These provisions may delay or prevent someone from acquiring or merging with us, which may cause the market price of our common stock and the value of the Notes to decline.", "PERMNO": 13167, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "SGYPQ"}
