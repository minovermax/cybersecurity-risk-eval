RISK FACTORS.\nThe following are certain risk factors that could affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. These risks are not the only ones we face. If any of the following risks occur, our business, results of operations or financial condition could be adversely affected.\nThe industries in which we operate are affected by the economy in general.\nWe may experience substantial increases and decreases in business volume throughout economic cycles. Industries we serve, including the automotive and vehicle parts, heavy-duty truck, industrial equipment, aircraft and locomotive, health care, education, pharmaceutical, industrial manufacturing, agricultural, and petrochemical industries are affected by consumer spending, general economic conditions and the impact of international trade. A downturn in any of the industries we serve could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nAdverse credit market conditions may significantly affect our access to capital, cost of capital and ability to meet liquidity needs.\nDisruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the credit markets may adversely impact our ability to access credit already arranged and the availability and cost of credit to us in the future. These market conditions may limit our ability to replace, in a timely manner, maturing liabilities and access the capital necessary to grow and maintain our business. Accordingly, we may be forced to delay raising capital or pay unattractive interest rates, which could increase our interest expense, decrease our profitability and significantly reduce our financial flexibility. Longer-term disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of uncertainty, changing or increased regulation, reduced alternatives or failures of significant financial institutions could adversely affect our access to liquidity needed for our business. Any disruption could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize or until alternative credit arrangements or other funding for our business needs can be arranged. Such measures could include deferring capital expenditures or other discretionary uses of cash. Overall, our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected by disruptions in the credit markets.\nAdverse global economic conditions may have significant effects on our customers that would result in our inability to borrow or to meet our fixed charge coverage ratio in our revolving credit facility.\nAs of September 30, 2017, we were in compliance with our fixed charge coverage ratio covenant and other covenants contained in our revolving credit facility. While we expect to remain in compliance throughout 2018, declines in sales volumes could adversely impact our ability to remain in compliance with certain of these financial covenants. Additionally, to the extent our customers are adversely affected by a decline in the economy in general, they may not be able to pay their accounts payable to us on a timely basis or at all, which would make the accounts receivable ineligible for purposes of the revolving credit facility and could reduce our borrowing base and our ability to borrow.\nWe are dependent on key customers.\nWe rely on several key customers. For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2017, our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 37% of our net sales. Due to competitive issues, we have lost key customers in the past and may again in the future. Customer orders are dependent upon their markets and may be subject to delays or cancellations. As a result of dependence on our key customers, we could experience a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations if any of the following were to occur:\n\u2022\nthe loss of any key customer, in whole or in part;\n\u2022\nthe insolvency or bankruptcy of any key customer;\n\u2022\na declining market in which customers reduce orders or demand reduced prices; or\n\u2022\na strike or work stoppage at a key customer facility, which could affect both their suppliers and customers.\nIf any of our key customers become insolvent or file for bankruptcy, our ability to recover accounts receivable from that customer would be adversely affected and any payments we received in the preference period prior to a bankruptcy filing may be potentially forfeitable, which could adversely impact our results of operations.\nWe may not realize the improved operating results that we anticipate from past and recent acquisitions or from acquisitions we may make in the future and we may experience difficulties in integrating the acquired businesses or may inherit significant liabilities related to such businesses.\nWe explore opportunities to acquire businesses that we believe are related to our core competencies from time to time, some of which may be material to us. We expect such acquisitions will produce operating results consistent with our other operations; however, we may be unable to achieve the benefits expected to be realized from our acquisitions. In addition, we may incur additional costs and our management\u2019s attention may be diverted because of unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other risks inherent in acquiring businesses.\nFuture claims, litigation and regulatory actions could adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to conduct our business.\nWhile we strive to ensure that our products comply with applicable government regulatory standards and internal requirements and that our products perform effectively and safely, customers from time to time could claim that our products do not meet contractual requirements, and users could be harmed by use or misuse of our products. This could give rise to breach of contract, warranty or recall claims, or claims for negligence, product liability, strict liability, personal injury or property damage. Product liability insurance coverage may not be available or adequate in all circumstances. In addition, claims may arise related to patent infringement, environmental liabilities, distributor terminations, commercial contracts, antitrust or competition law, employment law and employee benefits issues and other regulatory matters. While we have in place processes and policies to mitigate these risks and to investigate and address such claims as they arise, we cannot predict the underlying costs to defend or resolve such claims.\nOur business operations could be significantly disrupted if members of our senior management team were to leave.\nOur success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our senior management team. Our senior management team has extensive marketing, sales, manufacturing, finance and engineering experience, and we believe that the depth of our management team is instrumental to our continued success. The loss of any of our key managers in the future could significantly impede our ability to successfully implement our business strategy, financial plans, expansion of services, marketing and other objectives.\nWe may be subject to risks relating to our information technology systems.\nWe rely on information technology systems to process, transmit and store electronic information and manage and operate our business. While we have implemented security measures designed to prevent and mitigate the risk of such breaches, a breach in security could expose us and our customers and suppliers to risks of misuse of confidential information, manipulation and destruction of data, production downtimes and operations disruptions, which in turn could negatively affect our reputation, competitive position, business, results of operations or cash flows.\nUnforeseen future events may negatively impact our economic condition.\nFuture events may occur that would adversely affect the reported value of our assets. Such events may include, but are not limited to, strategic decisions made in response to changes in economic and competitive conditions, the impact of the economic environment on our customer base, or a material adverse change in our relationship with significant customers.", "PERMNO": 41823, "SIC": 3564, "TIC": "CRAWA"}
