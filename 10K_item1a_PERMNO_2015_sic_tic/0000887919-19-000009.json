Risk Factors\nLike all financial companies, the Company\u2019s business and results of operations are subject to a number of risks, many of which are outside of the Company\u2019s control. In addition to the other information in this report, readers should carefully consider that the following important factors, among others, could materially impact the Company\u2019s business and future results of operations.\nChanges in interest rates could negatively impact the Company\u2019s results of operations\nThe earnings of Premier are primarily dependent on net interest income, which is the difference between interest earned on loans and investments, and interest paid on interest-bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowings. Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors, including government monetary and fiscal policies; domestic and international economic and political conditions; and, in particular, changes in the discount rate by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Conditions such as inflation, recession, unemployment, money supply, government borrowing and other factors beyond management\u2019s control may also affect interest rates. If Premier\u2019s interest-earning assets mature, reprice or prepay more quickly than interest-bearing liabilities in a given period, a decrease in market interest rates could adversely affect net interest income. Likewise, if interest-bearing liabilities mature or reprice, or, in the case of deposits, are withdrawn by the accountholder more quickly than interest-earning assets in a given period, an increase in market interest rates could adversely affect net interest income. Given Premier\u2019s current mix of assets and liabilities, a rising interest rate environment would have a slightly positive to neutral impact on Premier\u2019s results of operations, because the Company has more interest bearing assets than interest bearing liabilities and the interest bearing assets will likely reprice at higher rates more quickly than interest-bearing liabilities. However, a declining interest rate environment would have a negative impact on Premier\u2019s results of operations.\nFixed rate loans (and adjustable rate loans that include a fixed rate for a specified period of time) increase Premier\u2019s exposure to interest rate risk in a rising rate environment because interest-bearing liabilities would be subject to repricing before assets become subject to repricing. Adjustable rate loans decrease the risks to a lender associated with changes in interest rates but involve other risks. As interest rates rise, the periodic payment by the borrower rises to the extent permitted by the terms of the loan, and the increased periodic payment increases the potential for default. At the same time, for secured loans, the marketability of the underlying collateral may be adversely affected by higher interest rates. In a declining interest rate environment, there is likely to be an increase in prepayment activity on loans as the borrowers refinance their loans at lower interest rates. Under these circumstances, Premier\u2019s results of operations could be negatively impacted. Adjustable rate loans that have an interest rate floor feature will exhibit the same characteristics as a fixed rate loan during the period market interest rates are below the floor. During this time and until the time market interest rates rise above the floor, Premier\u2019s exposure to interest rate risk in a rising rate environment is increased because interest-bearing liabilities would be subject to repricing without a change in the interest rate on adjustable rate loans.\n- 19 -\nPREMIER FINANCIAL BANCORP, INC.\nFORM 10-K\nDecember 31, 2018\nChanges in interest rates also can affect the value of loans, investments and other interest-rate sensitive assets and Premier\u2019s ability to realize gains on the sale or resolution of assets. This type of income can vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year based on a number of different factors, including the interest rate environment. An increase in interest rates that adversely affects the ability of borrowers to pay the principal or interest on loans may lead to an increase in non-performing assets and increased loan loss reserve requirements that could have a material adverse effect on Premier\u2019s results of operations.\nExtensive regulation and supervision\nPremier, primarily through the Affiliate Banks, is subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors\u2019 funds, federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole, not shareholders. These regulations affect Premier\u2019s lending practices, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy and growth, among other things. Premier is also subject to a number of federal laws, which, among other things, require it to lend to various sectors of the economy and population, maintain comprehensive programs relating to anti-money laundering and customer identification, maintain customer education programs to avoid excessive overdrafting, and establish and maintain comprehensive programs related to cybersecurity. Congress and federal regulatory agencies continually review banking laws, regulations and policies for possible changes. Changes to statutes, regulations or regulatory policies, including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes, regulations or policies, could affect Premier in substantial and unpredictable ways. Such changes could subject Premier to additional costs, limit the types of financial services and products it may offer and/or increase the ability of non-banks to offer competing financial services and products, among other things. Failure to comply with laws, regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties and/or reputation damage, along with corrective action plans required by regulatory agencies, any of which could have a material adverse effect on Premier\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. Premier and certain of its Affiliate Banks have in the past been subject to such corrective action plans. While Premier has policies and procedures designed to prevent any such violations, there can be no assurance that such violations will not occur. See the \u201cRegulatory Matters\u201d section in Item 1, \u201cBusiness\u201d.\n- 20 -\nPREMIER FINANCIAL BANCORP, INC.\nFORM 10-K\nDecember 31, 2018\nRegional economic changes in the Company\u2019s markets could adversely impact results from operations\nLike all banks, Premier is subject to the effects of any economic downturn, and in particular a significant decline in home values or reduced commercial development in Premier\u2019s markets could have a negative effect on results of operations. Premier\u2019s success depends primarily on the general economic conditions in the counties in which Premier conducts business, and in the West Virginia; southern Ohio; northern Kentucky; northern, western and south central Virginia, and the metro Washington, DC, Richmond, Virginia and Cincinnati, Ohio areas in general. Unlike larger banks that are more geographically diversified, Premier provides banking and financial services to customers primarily in the West Virginia counties of Barbour, Boone, Braxton, Calhoun, Clay, Doddridge, Gilmer, Greenbrier, Harrison, Jackson, Kanawha, Lewis, Lincoln, Logan, Monongalia, Roane, Taylor, Upshur, Webster, Wirt and Wood; the southern Ohio counties of Adams, Brown, Gallia, Lawrence and Scioto; the northern Kentucky counties of Boone, Campbell and Kenton in the Cincinnati, Ohio metro area; the Kentucky counties of Bracken, Fleming, Greenup, Henry, Lewis, Mason, Robertson and Shelby; the metro Washington DC area including the surrounding portions of northern Virginia and Maryland; the Richmond and Hampton metro areas of south central Virginia; and the Covington area of western Virginia. The local economic conditions in these market areas have a significant impact on Premier\u2019s ability to originate loans, the ability of the borrowers to repay these loans and the value of the collateral securing these loans. A decline in the general economic conditions caused by inflation or deflation, recession, government intervention or regulation, changes in energy and natural resource markets, international events, unemployment, government shutdown, furlough of government employees, or other factors beyond Premier\u2019s control would affect these local economic conditions and could adversely affect Premier\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, a significant decline in home values would likely lead to increased delinquencies and defaults in both the consumer home equity loan and residential real estate loan portfolios and result in increased losses in these portfolios. Likewise, a significant decline in commercial real estate occupancy rates or values would likely lead to increased delinquencies and defaults in commercial real estate secured loans and result in increased losses in these portfolios.\nPremier targets its business lending and marketing strategy for loans to serve primarily the banking and financial services needs of small to medium size businesses. These small to medium size businesses generally have fewer financial resources in terms of capital or borrowing capacity than larger entities. If general economic conditions negatively impact these businesses, Premier\u2019s results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected.\n- 21 -\nPREMIER FINANCIAL BANCORP, INC.\nFORM 10-K\nDecember 31, 2018\nChanges in energy and natural resource markets may increase credit risk in the loan portfolio\nPremier\u2019s success and growth in lending in the central West Virginia market area depend primarily on the local general economy which has been driven in the past by federal government programs to develop technology infrastructure and more recently by the drilling for natural gas in the Marcellus and Utica shale formations. Furthermore, Premier\u2019s success in the southern West Virginia market depends, in large part, on the local general economy which has been driven by significant employment by coal and other natural resource based businesses. While Premier\u2019s direct credit risk exposure to such industries is minimal, the success or failure of these industries may have an indirect effect on the local economic conditions in the central and southern West Virginia market areas, either individually or collectively, thus having a significant impact on Premier\u2019s loans, the ability of the borrowers to repay these loans, and the value of the collateral securing these loans, each of which could negatively affect the financial results of its banking operations.\nConcentration of commercial real estate and commercial business loans may increase credit risk in the loan portfolio\nCommercial real estate and commercial business loans generally expose a lender to greater risk of non-payment and loss than one- to four-family residential mortgage loans because repayment of the loans often depends on the successful business operations and the income stream of the commercial borrowers. Such loans typically involve larger loan balances to single borrowers or groups of related borrowers compared to one- to four-family residential mortgage loans. A significant decline in general economic conditions caused by inflation or deflation, recession, unemployment, federal government shutdown or partial shutdown, or other factors beyond Premier\u2019s control would impact these local economic conditions and could negatively affect the financial results of its banking operations.\nPremier\u2019s success in the metro Washington, D.C., Richmond, Virginia and Cincinnati, Ohio market areas depend primarily on the local general economic conditions in the area and lending to commercial customers. While the sources of economic activity in these metro markets are diverse, commercial loans in these market areas are generally larger in size than in Premier\u2019s other markets due to various factors such as higher real estate values and larger business operations. Also, many of the local borrowers have more than one commercial real estate or commercial business loan outstanding with Premier. Consequently, an adverse development with respect to one loan or one credit relationship can expose Premier to a significantly greater risk of loss compared to an adverse development with respect to a one- to four-family residential mortgage loan. The local economic conditions in these metropolitan areas have a significant impact on its loans, the ability of the borrowers to repay these loans and the value of the collateral securing these loans and could negatively affect the financial results of Premier\u2019s banking operations.\n- 22 -\nPREMIER FINANCIAL BANCORP, INC.\nFORM 10-K\nDecember 31, 2018\nAllowance for loan losses may be insufficient\nPremier, through the Affiliate Banks, maintains an allowance for loan losses based on, among other things, national and regional economic conditions, historical loss experience, evaluations of potential losses on identified problem loans and delinquency trends. Premier believes that its allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level adequate to absorb any probable incurred losses in its loan portfolio given the current information known to management. These determinations are based upon estimates that are inherently subjective, and their accuracy depends on the outcome of future events. Therefore, Premier cannot predict loan losses with certainty and ultimate losses may differ from current estimates. Depending on changes in economic, operating and other conditions, including changes in interest rates, which are generally beyond its control, Premier\u2019s actual losses could exceed its current allowance estimates. Premier\u2019s allowance may not be sufficient to cover all charge-offs in future periods. If charge-offs exceed Premier\u2019s allowance, its earnings would decrease. In addition, regulatory agencies review Premier\u2019s allowance for loan losses and may require additions to the allowance based upon their judgment about information available to them at the time of their examination. A required increase in Premier\u2019s allowance for loan losses could reduce its earnings.\nDividend payments by subsidiaries to Premier and by Premier to its shareholders can be restricted.\nThe Company\u2019s principal source of funds for dividend payments and its debt service obligations is dividends received from the subsidiary Banks. Banking regulations limit the amount of dividends that may be paid without prior approval of regulatory agencies. Under these regulations, the amount of dividends that may be paid in any calendar year is limited to the current year\u2019s net profits, as defined, combined with the retained net profits of the preceding two years, subject to the capital requirements and additional restrictions as discussed in Note 21 to the consolidated financial statements. During 2019 the Banks could, without prior approval, declare dividends of approximately $8.4 million plus any 2019 net profits retained to the date of the dividend declaration. Furthermore, one of the consequences of not meeting the newly implemented regulatory capital conservation buffer required of the Company and the subsidiary Banks includes restrictions on the payment of dividends.\nPremier is a separate and distinct legal entity from Premier\u2019s subsidiaries. Premier receives nearly all of its revenue from dividends from its subsidiary banks, which are limited by federal banking laws and regulations. These dividends also serve as the primary source of funds to pay dividends on Premier\u2019s common and preferred shares. The inability of Premier\u2019s subsidiary banks to pay sufficient dividends to Premier could have a material adverse effect on its business. Further discussion of Premier\u2019s ability to pay dividends can be found under the caption \u201cRegulatory Matters - Dividend Restrictions\u201d in Item 1 of this Form 10-K and Note 21 to the consolidated financial statements.\n- 23 -\nPREMIER FINANCIAL BANCORP, INC.\nFORM 10-K\nDecember 31, 2018\nThe extended disruption of vital infrastructure could negatively impact the company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition\nPremier\u2019s operations depend upon, among other things, its technological and physical infrastructure, including its equipment, facilities and access to the worldwide web via the internet. While disaster recovery procedures are in place, an extended disruption of its vital infrastructure by fire, power loss, natural disaster, telecommunications failure, computer hacking and viruses, denial of service attacks, terrorist activity or the domestic and foreign response to such activity, or other events outside of Premier\u2019s control, could have a material adverse impact either on the financial services industry as a whole, or on Premier\u2019s business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nDefaults by another larger financial institution could adversely affect financial markets generally.\nThe commercial soundness of many financial institutions may be closely interrelated as a result of relationships between the institutions. As a result, concerns about, or a default or threatened default by, one institution could lead to significant market-wide liquidity and credit problems, losses or defaults by other institutions. This is sometimes referred to as \u201csystemic risk\u201d. Premier\u2019s business could be adversely affected directly by the default of another institution or if the financial services industry experiences significant market-wide liquidity and credit problems.\nGreat Britain\u2019s exit from the European Union (\u201cBrexit\u201d) could adversely affect financial markets generally.\nThe complexity and inability of Britain and the European Union to reach a definitive agreement on how Brexit should occur could adversely affect financial markets generally. While Premier has no direct loans to or deposits from foreign entities, the uncertain impact of Brexit on British and European businesses, financial markets, and related businesses in the United States could also adversely affect financial markets generally. Similar to the \u201csystemic risk\u201d described above, the commercial soundness of many financial institutions may be closely interrelated as a result of relationships between the institutions. As a result, concerns about, or a default or threatened default by, one institution could lead to significant market-wide liquidity and credit problems, losses or defaults by other institutions. Premier\u2019s business could be adversely affected directly by the default of another institution or if the financial services industry experiences significant market-wide liquidity and credit problems.\n- 24 -\nPREMIER FINANCIAL BANCORP, INC.\nFORM 10-K\nDecember 31, 2018\nNew or revised tax, accounting and other laws, regulations, rules and standards could significantly impact strategic initiatives, results of operations and financial condition\nThe financial services industry is highly regulated and laws and regulations may sometimes impose significant limitations on operations. These limitations, and sources of potential liability for the violation of such laws and regulations, are described under the heading \u201cBusiness - Regulatory Matters\u201d above. These regulations, along with the existing tax and accounting laws, regulations, rules and standards, control the methods by which financial institutions conduct business; implement strategic initiatives, as well as past, present, and contemplated tax planning; and govern financial disclosures. These laws, regulations, rules, and standards are constantly evolving and may change significantly over time. The nature, extent, and timing of the adoption of significant new laws, regulations, rules or standards; changes in existing laws, regulations, rules or standards; or repeal of existing laws, regulations, rules or standards may have a material impact on Premier\u2019s results of operations and financial condition, the effects of which are impossible to predict at this time.\nLoss of large checking and money market deposit customers could increase cost of funds and have a negative effect on results of operations\nPremier has a number of large deposit customers that maintain balances in checking, savings, money market and repurchase agreement accounts at the Affiliate Banks. The ability to attract these types of deposits has a positive effect on Premier\u2019s net interest margin as they provide a relatively low cost of funds to Premier compared to certificates of deposits or borrowing advances. If these depositors were to withdraw these funds and the Affiliate Banks were not able to replace them with similar types of deposits, the cost of funds would increase and Premier\u2019s results of operation would be negatively impacted.\nClaims and litigation pertaining to fiduciary responsibility\nFrom time to time, shareholders or customers may make claims and take legal action pertaining to Premier\u2019s and the Affiliate Banks\u2019 performance of their fiduciary responsibilities. Defending such claims can impose a material expense on Premier. If such claims and legal actions are not resolved in a manner favorable to the Affiliate Banks they may result in financial liability and/or adversely affect the market perception of the Affiliate Banks and their products and services as well as impact customer demand for those products and services. Any financial liability or reputation damage could have a material adverse effect on Premier\u2019s business, which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.\n- 25 -\nPREMIER FINANCIAL BANCORP, INC.\nFORM 10-K\nDecember 31, 2018\nUnauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential customer information and cyber-security breaches could severely harm the Company\u2019s reputation and have a negative effect on results of operations.\nIn the normal course of business, the Affiliate Banks collect, process and retain sensitive and confidential customer information to both open deposit accounts and determine whether to approve a customer\u2019s request for a loan. Premier also relies upon a variety of computing platforms and networks over the internet for the purposes of data processing, communication and information exchange, including a variety of services provided by third-party vendors. Despite the security measures in place, Premier\u2019s facilities and systems, and those of Premier\u2019s third-party service providers, may be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, denial of service attacks, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors or other similar events. We are not able to anticipate or implement effective preventive measures against all security breaches of these types. If information security is breached, information can be lost or misappropriated resulting in financial loss or costs to Premier or damages to others. Any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential customer information, whether by Premier or by its vendors, could severely damage Premier\u2019s reputation, expose it to the risks of litigation and liability or disrupt the business operations of Premier which in turn, could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations.\nStrong competition within the Company\u2019s market areas may limit profitability\nPremier faces significant competition both in attracting deposits and in the origination of loans. Mortgage bankers, commercial banks, credit unions and other savings institutions, which have offices in the market areas of the Affiliate Banks, have historically provided most of the competition for the Affiliate Banks for deposits; however, each Affiliate Bank also competes with financial institutions that operate through internet banking operations throughout the continental United States. In addition, and particularly in times of high interest rates, each Affiliate Bank faces additional and significant competition for funds from money market and mutual funds, securities firms, commercial banks, credit unions and other savings institutions located in the same communities and those that operate through internet banking operations throughout the continental United States. Many competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than Premier and its Affiliate Banks. Moreover, credit unions do not pay federal or state income taxes and are subject to fewer regulatory constraints than community banks and as a result, they may enjoy a competitive advantage over Premier. The Affiliate Banks compete for loans principally on the basis of the interest rates and loan fees they charge, the types of loans they originate and the quality of services they provide to borrowers. This advantage places significant competitive pressure on the prices of loans and deposits.\n- 26 -\nPREMIER FINANCIAL BANCORP, INC.\nFORM 10-K\nDecember 31, 2018\nIntegration of current and future acquisitions may be more difficult than anticipated\nThe success of Premier\u2019s acquisition of First Bank, Bankshares or any future acquisitions will depend on a number of factors, including (but not limited to) Premier\u2019s ability to:\nInability to hire and retain qualified employees\nPremier\u2019s performance is largely dependent on the talents and efforts of highly skilled individuals and their ability to attract and retain customer relationships in a community bank environment. There is intense competition in the financial services industry for qualified employees. In addition, Premier faces increasing competition with businesses outside the financial services industry for the most highly skilled individuals. Premier\u2019s business could be adversely affected if it were unable to retain and motivate its existing key employees and management team. Furthermore, Premier\u2019s success may be impacted if it were unable to recruit replacement management and key employees in a reasonable amount of time.\nThe Company\u2019s expenses will increase as a result of increases in FDIC insurance premiums.\nThe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation imposes an assessment against institutions for deposit insurance. This assessment is based on the risk category of the institution and ranges from 1.5 to 40 basis points of the institution\u2019s assessment base. The assessment base for banks similar to those owned by Premier is defined as the most recent quarterly average total assets of the bank less the quarterly average tangible equity of the bank. Federal law requires that the designated reserve ratio for the deposit insurance fund to reach a minimum of 1.35% of estimated insured deposits by no later than September 30, 2020. If the risk category of either of the Affiliate Banks deteriorates or if the minimum designated reserve ratio is deemed to not be on target to meet the minimum by September 30, 2020, the Affiliate Banks\u2019 FDIC insurance premiums could increase.\n- 27 -\nPREMIER FINANCIAL BANCORP, INC.\nFORM 10-K\nDecember 31, 2018\nAdditional capital may not be available when needed or required by regulatory authorities\nPremier and the Affiliate Banks are required by federal and state regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support its operations. In addition, Premier may elect to raise additional capital to support its business or to finance acquisitions, if any, or it may otherwise elect or be required to raise additional capital. Premier\u2019s ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on conditions in the capital markets, economic conditions and a number of other factors, many of which are outside Premier\u2019s control and its financial performance. Accordingly, Premier may not be able to raise additional capital if needed or on acceptable terms. If Premier cannot raise additional capital when needed, it may have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nMarket volatility may adversely affect market price of common stock or investment security values\nThe capital and credit markets have experienced volatility and disruption in the past and for periods lasting more than a year. In some cases, the markets have produced downward pressure on stock prices and credit availability for certain issuers seemingly without regard to those issuers\u2019 underlying financial strength. Market volatility could contribute to the decline in the market value of certain security investments and other assets of Premier. If market disruption and volatility should occur, continue or worsen, Premier may experience an adverse effect, which may be material, on results of operations, capital or financial position.\nIssuance of preferred shares would impact net income available to common stockholders\nAdditional capital Premier may raise through the issuance of preferred stock may decrease net income available to common stockholders. Dividends declared and the accretion of any discount on the issuance of preferred shares reduces the net income available to Premier\u2019s common shareholders and earnings per common share. Preferred shares also receive preferential treatment in the event of Premier\u2019s liquidation, dissolution or winding up of its operations.\nFuture issuances of common shares or other securities may dilute the value of outstanding common shares, which may also adversely affect their market price\nIn many situations, Premier\u2019s Board of Directors has the authority, without any vote of its shareholders, to issue shares of authorized but unissued securities, including common shares, authorized and unissued shares under Premier\u2019s stock option plans and shares of Premier\u2019s preferred stock. In the future, Premier may issue additional securities, through public or private offerings, in order to raise additional capital, complete acquisitions, or compensate key employees. Any such issuance would dilute the percentage of ownership interest of existing shareholders and may dilute the per share value of the common stock.\n- 28 -\nPREMIER FINANCIAL BANCORP, INC.\nFORM 10-K\nDecember 31, 2018\nIf a subsidiary bank\u2019s current capital ratios decline below the regulatory threshold for an \u201cadequately capitalized\u201d institution, the bank will be considered \u201cundercapitalized\u201d which may have a material and adverse effect on Premier.\nThe Federal Deposit Insurance Act (FDIA) requires each federal banking agency to take prompt corrective action with respect to banks that do not meet the minimum capital requirements. Once a bank becomes undercapitalized, it is subject to various requirements and restrictions, including a prohibition of the payment of capital distributions and management fees, restrictions on growth of the bank\u2019s assets, and a requirement for prior regulatory approval of certain expansion proposals. In addition, an undercapitalized bank must file a capital restoration plan with its principal federal regulator. Furthermore, one of the consequences of not meeting the regulatory capital conservation buffer required of the Company and the subsidiary Banks includes restrictions on the payment of dividends.\nIf an undercapitalized bank fails in any material aspect to implement a plan approved by its regulator, the agency may impose additional restrictions on the bank. These include, among others, requiring the recapitalization or sale of the bank, restrictions with affiliates, and limiting the interest rates the bank may pay on deposits. Further, even after the bank has attained adequately capitalized status, the appropriate federal agency may, if it determines, after notice and hearing, that the bank is in an unsafe or unsound condition or has not corrected a deficiency from its most recent examination, treat the bank as if it were undercapitalized and subject the bank to the regulatory restrictions of such lower classification.\nIn addition to measures taken under the prompt corrective action provisions with respect to undercapitalized institutions, insured banks and their holding companies may be subject to potential enforcement actions by their regulators for unsafe and unsound practices in conducting their business or the violations of law or regulation, including the filing of false or misleading regulatory reports. Enforcement actions under this authority may include the issuance of cease and desist orders, the imposition of civil money penalties, the issuance of directives to increase capital, formal and informal agreements, or the removal and prohibition orders against \u201cinstitution-affiliates parties\u201d. Further, the Federal Reserve may bring an enforcement action against the bank holding company either to address the undercapitalization in the holding company or to require the holding company to implement measures to remediate undercapitalization in a subsidiary.", "PERMNO": 83547, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "PFBI"}
