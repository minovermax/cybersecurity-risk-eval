RISK FACTORS\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nOur Chemical and Climate Control Businesses and their customers are sensitive to adverse economic cycles.\nOur Chemical Business can be affected by cyclical factors such as inflation, currency exchange rates, global energy policy and costs, global market conditions and economic downturns in specific industries. Certain sales of our Chemical Business are sensitive to the level of activity in the agricultural, mining, automotive and housing industries. A substantial decline in the activity of our Chemical Business has in the past, and could in the future, have a material adverse effect on the results of our Chemical Business and on our operating results, liquidity and capital resources. Further, material economic changes that adversely affect our natural gas working interests or lower natural gas prices may require us to write down the carrying value of our natural gas working interests. Therefore, these changes in our Chemical Business could adversely impact our operating results, liquidity and financial condition.\nOur Climate Control Business also can be affected by cyclical factors, such as interest rates, inflation and economic downturns. Our Climate Control Business depends on sales to customers in the construction and renovation industries, which are particularly sensitive\nto these factors. A decline in the economic activity in the U.S. has in the past had, and could in the future have, a material adverse effect on us and our customers in the construction and renovation industries in which our Climate Control Business sells a substantial amount of its products. Such a decline could result in a decrease in revenues and profits, and an increase in bad debts that could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, financial condition and liquidity.\nWeather conditions adversely affect our Chemical Business and Climate Control Business.\nThe agricultural products produced and sold by our Chemical Business have been in the past, and could be in the future, materially affected by adverse weather conditions (such as excessive rain or drought) in the primary markets for our fertilizer and related agricultural products. Some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts and floods and other climatic events. These climate changes might also occur as the result of other phenomena that human activity is unable to influence, including changes in solar activity and volcanic activity. Regardless of the cause, if any of these unusual weather events occur during the primary seasons for sales of our agricultural products (March-June and September-November), this could have a material adverse effect on the agricultural sales of our Chemical Business and our financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, weather conditions, severe or otherwise, may adversely affect the construction, refurbishment and renovation of facilities that utilize our Climate Control products resulting in lower product order levels during those periods.\nOur estimates about the funds needed to complete the El Dorado Expansion may not be accurate, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nThe anticipated cost to complete the expansion of our El Dorado, Arkansas, chemical plant has increased significantly since the beginning of 2015, from our expectation of $485 million to $520 million total cost to our current estimate of $831 million to $855 million (including capitalized interest). Although we believe we have raised sufficient funding to complete the El Dorado Expansion, our current estimates of the amount of funding we need to complete the El Dorado Expansion may prove to be incorrect in the future because the costs may ultimately be higher than our current estimate or our operations may not provide the amount of cash flow we currently project, whether because of chemical plant interruptions, lower selling prices of our products or other events. Accordingly, we may learn in the future that more capital is needed and that we will have to undertake further financing activities or other actions. The past shortfall in cost estimates has had, and any possible future shortfall in cost estimates could have, a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nDespite continuing investment to upgrade and replace equipment on an ongoing basis, the age of facilities of our Chemical Business increases the risk for unplanned downtime, which may be significant.\nOur Chemical Business is comprised of operating units of various ages and levels of automated control. While we have continued to make significant annual capital improvements, potential age or control related issues have occurred in the past and may occur in the future, which could cause damage to the equipment and ancillary facilities. For example, during 2015, certain of our chemical facilities had planned and unplanned downtime as a result of certain maintenance and equipment issues, including our Pryor Facility that had a total of 70 days of downtime during the third quarter of 2015. As a result, we have experienced and may continue to experience additional downtime at our chemical facilities in the future.\nThe equipment required for the manufacture of our chemical products is specialized, and the time for replacement of such equipment can be lengthy, resulting in extended downtime in the affected unit. Although we use various reliability and inspection programs and maintain a significant inventory of spare equipment, which are intended to mitigate the extent of production losses, unplanned outages may still occur. As a result, these planned and unplanned downtime events at our chemical facilities have in the past and could in the future adversely affect our operating results, liquidity and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service our debt and may be required to take other actions to satisfy the obligations under our debt agreements or to redeem our preferred stock, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on our debt obligations and our redemption obligations for the Series E cumulative redeemable Class C preferred stock (\u201cSeries E Redeemable Preferred\u201d) depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which is subject to the risks previously described for our El Dorado Expansion, prevailing economic and competitive conditions, and certain financial, business and other factors, some of which may be beyond our control. We may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows sufficient to pay the principal and interest on our debt, including the $425 million principal amount of our 7.75% Senior Secured Notes and the $50 million principal amount of the 12% Senior Secured Notes (collectively, the \u201cSenior Secured Notes\u201d), or if and when applicable, the outstanding amount of the Working Capital Revolver Loan or to pay the cumulative dividends and redemption payment on the Series E Redeemable Preferred should the holder choose to redeem it.\nIf cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt, dividend or preferred stock redemption obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and will need to seek additional capital through the issuance of debt, the issuance of equity, asset sales or combination of the foregoing. If we are unsuccessful, we will need to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to dispose of other assets or operations, seek additional capital, or restructure or refinance debt or redeemable equity. These alternative measures may not be successful, may not be completed on economically attractive terms, or may not be adequate for us to meet our debt or preferred stock redemption obligations when due. Additionally, our debt agreements and the operating agreements associated with of our Series E Redeemable Preferred limit the use of the proceeds from many dispositions of assets or operations. As a result, we may not be permitted to use the proceeds from these dispositions to satisfy our debt or preferred stock redemption obligations.\nFurther, if we suffer or appear to suffer from a lack of available liquidity, the evaluation of our creditworthiness by counterparties and rating agencies and the willingness of third parties to do business with us could be materially and adversely affected. In particular, our credit ratings could be lowered, suspended or withdrawn entirely at any time by the rating agencies, if in each rating agency\u2019s judgment, circumstances warrant. Downgrades in our long-term debt ratings generally cause borrowing costs to increase and the potential pool of investors and funding sources to decrease and could trigger liquidity demands pursuant to the terms of contracts, leases or other agreements. Any future transactions by us, including the issuance of additional debt, the sale of any operating assets, or any other transaction to manage our liquidity, could result in temporary or permanent downgrades of our credit ratings.\nCurrent and future legislative or regulatory requirements affecting our Chemical Business may result in increased costs and decreased revenues, cash flows and liquidity or could have other negative effects on our Chemical Business.\nOur businesses are subject to numerous health, safety, security and environmental laws and regulations, primarily relating to our Chemical Business. The manufacture and distribution of chemical products are activities that entail health, safety and environmental risks and impose obligations under health, safety and environmental laws and regulations, many of which provide for substantial fines and potential criminal sanctions for violations. Although we believe we have established processes to monitor, review and manage our businesses to comply with the numerous health, safety and environmental laws and regulations, our Chemical Business in the past has been, and in the future may be, subject to fines, penalties and sanctions for violations and substantial expenditures for cleanup costs and other liabilities relating to the handling, manufacture, use, emission, discharge or disposal of effluents at or from the Chemical Business\u2019 facilities. Further, a number of our Chemical Business\u2019 facilities are dependent on environmental permits to operate, the loss or modification of which could have a material adverse effect on their operations and our results of operation and financial condition. These operating permits are subject to modification, renewal and revocation. In addition, third parties may contest our ability to receive or renew certain permits that we need to operate, which can lengthen the application process or even prevent us from obtaining necessary permits. We regularly monitor and review our operations, procedures and policies for compliance with permits, laws and regulations. Despite these compliance efforts, risk of noncompliance or permit interpretation is inherent in the operation of our businesses.\nThe trend in environmental regulation is to place more restrictions and limitations on activities that may affect the environment over time. As a result, there can be no assurance as to the amount or timing of future expenditures for environmental compliance or remediation, and actual future expenditures may be different from the amounts we currently anticipate. We try to anticipate future regulatory requirements that might be imposed and plan accordingly to remain in compliance with changing environmental laws and regulations and to minimize the costs of compliance.\nChanges to the production equipment at our chemical facilities that are required in order to comply with health, safety and environmental regulations may require substantial capital expenditures.\nExplosions and/or losses at other chemical facilities that we do not own (such as the explosion in West, Texas) could also result in new or additional legislation or regulatory changes, particularly relating to public health, safety or any of the products manufactured and/or sold by our Chemical Business or the inability on the part of our Chemical Business\u2019 customers to obtain or maintain insurance as to certain products manufactured and/or sold by our Chemical Business, which could have a negative effect on the revenues, cash flow and liquidity of our Chemical Business.\nIn summary, new or changed laws and regulations or the inability of the customers of our Chemical Business to obtain or maintain insurance in connection with any of our chemical products could have an adverse effect on our operating results, liquidity and financial condition.\nWe may be required to modify or expand our operating, sales and reporting procedures and to install additional equipment for our Chemical Business in order to comply with current and possible future government regulations.\nThe chemical industry in general, and producers and distributors of ammonia and AN specifically, are scrutinized by the government, industry and public on security issues. Under current and proposed regulations, we may be required to incur substantial additional costs relating to security at our chemical facilities and distribution centers, as well as in the transportation of our products. These costs could have a material effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. The cost of such regulatory changes, if\nsignificant enough, could lead some of our customers to choose other products to ammonia and AN, which would have a significant adverse effect on our Chemical Business.\n\u00b7\nIn order to comply with the \u201cSecure Handling of Ammonium Nitrate Act of 2007\u201d as enacted by the U.S. Congress, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (\u201cDHS\u201d) published a notice of the proposed rulemaking. This regulation proposes to require sellers, buyers, their agents and transporters of solid AN and certain solid mixtures containing AN to possess a valid registration issued by DHS, keep certain records, report the theft or unexplained loss of regulated materials, and comply with certain other new requirements. We and others affected by this proposal have submitted appropriate comments to DHS regarding the proposed regulation. It is possible that DHS could significantly revise the requirements currently being proposed. Depending on the provisions of the final regulation to be promulgated by DHS and on our ability to pass these costs to our customers, these requirements may have a negative effect on the profitability of our AN business and may result in fewer distributors who are willing to handle the product. The proposed rule did not promulgate in 2015 and DHS may be considering significant changes compared to the original proposed rule. Although we cannot predict the timing or content of any DHS regulation, we believe implementation of a final rule appears unlikely in 2016.\nOn August 1, 2013, U.S. President Obama issued an executive order addressing the safety and security of chemical facilities in response to recent incidents involving chemicals such as the April 2013 explosion at West, Texas. The President directed federal agencies to enhance existing regulations and make recommendations to the U.S. Congress to develop new laws that may affect our Chemical Business. For example, the EPA is expected to propose a revision to its Risk Management Program in March 2016. OSHA is likewise considering changes to its Process Safety Management standards. In addition, DHS, the EPA, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives updated a joint chemical advisory on the safe storage, handling, and management of AN. In January 2016 the U.S. Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board (\u201cCSB\u201d) released its final report on the West, Texas incident. The CSB report identifies several federal and state regulations and standards that could be strengthened to reduce the risk of a similar incident occurring in the future. While the CSB does not have authority to directly regulate our business, the findings in this report, and other activities taken in response to the West, Texas incident by federal, state, and local regulators may result in additional regulation of processes and products in our Chemical Business.\nProposed governmental laws and regulations relating to greenhouse gas and other air emissions may subject certain of our Chemical Business\u2019 facilities to significant new costs and restrictions on their operations and may reduce sales of our products.\nThe manufacturing facilities in our Chemical Business use significant amounts of electricity, natural gas and other raw materials necessary for the production of their chemical products that result, or could result, in certain greenhouse gas emissions into the environment. Federal and state legislatures and administrative agencies, including the EPA, are considering the scope and scale of greenhouse gas or other air emission regulation. Legislation and administrative actions are being considered that would regulate greenhouse gas emissions at some point in the future for our facilities, and existing and possible actions have already affected certain of our customers, leading to closure or rate reductions of certain facilities. The EPA has instituted a mandatory greenhouse gas reporting requirement that began in 2010, which affects all of our chemical manufacturing sites. Greenhouse gas regulation could: increase the price of the electricity and other energy sources purchased by our chemical facilities; increase costs for natural gas and other raw materials (such as ammonia); potentially restrict access to or the use of certain raw materials necessary to produce our chemical products; and require us to incur substantial expenditures to retrofit our chemical facilities to comply with the proposed new laws and regulations regulating greenhouse gas emissions, if adopted. Federal, state and local governments may also pass laws mandating the use of alternative energy sources, such as wind power and solar energy, which may increase the cost of energy use in certain of our chemical and other manufacturing operations. For instance, the EPA recently published a rule, known as the Clean Power Plan, to limit greenhouse gases from electric power plants. Judicial challenges have been filed, which seek a stay of the implementation of the rules. On February 9, 2016, the Supreme Court stayed the implementation of the Clean Power Plan while legal challenges to the rule proceed. Depending on the outcome of those challenges, and how various states choose to implement this rule, the Clean Power Plan could result in greater electric costs, more use of alternative energy sources, and a decreased demand for coal-generated electricity.\nThe Clean Power Plan is one of many recent developments aimed at limiting greenhouse gas emissions that could adversely affect our clients in the coal industry, and thus limit the market for some of our products. Enactment of laws or passage of regulations regarding emissions from the combustion of coal by the United States, states, or other countries could also result in electricity generators further switching from coal to other fuel sources or result in additional coal-fueled power plant closures. For example, the 2015 Paris climate summit agreement resulted in voluntary commitments by numerous countries to reduce their GHG emissions, and could result in additional firm commitments by various nations with respect to future GHG emissions. These commitments could further disfavor coal-fired generation, particularly in the medium- to long-term. In addition, the U.S. Department of the Interior recently announced a moratorium on issuing certain new coal leases on federal land while the Bureau of Land Management undertakes a programmatic review of the federal coal program. Pressure from advocacy groups and policies limiting available financing for the development of new coal-fueled power plants could also adversely affect the demand for coal in the future, and thus limit the market for some of our products.\nAs it relates to our Chemical Business\u2019 working interest in natural gas properties, legislative and regulatory proposals for restricting greenhouse gas or other air emissions or otherwise addressing climate change could require our Chemical Business to incur additional operating costs and could adversely affect demand for the natural gas that the operator of these wells intends to sell. For instance, the EPA has proposed New Source Performance Standards for methane and volatile organic compound emissions from certain activities in the oil and gas sector, as well as a new definition of oil and gas sources, and new draft Control Techniques Guidelines for reducing volatile organic compound emissions from existing oil and gas sources in certain ozone nonattainment areas. If the rules are adopted as proposed, these rules could impose new compliance costs and permitting burdens on natural gas production.\nIn addition, the EPA has recently lowered the national ambient air quality standard for ground level ozone, which could result in additional compliance requirements for natural gas operations in areas of the country that have failed to attain the new, lower standard. The EPA has not yet designated which areas of the country are out of attainment, and it will take the states several years to develop compliance plans for their non-attainment areas. It is difficult to predict how these and any other possible regulations, if and when adopted, will affect our businesses, operations, liquidity or financial results.\nThere is intense competition in the Chemical and Climate Control industries.\nSubstantially all of the markets in which we participate are highly competitive with respect to product quality, price, design innovations, distribution, service, warranties, reliability and efficiency. We compete with many companies, domestic and foreign, that have greater financial, marketing and other resources. Specifically, the overall nitrogen market is expected to be affected as a result of the number of announced and started nitrogen expansion projects in the U.S. Competitive factors could require us to reduce prices or increase spending on product development, marketing and sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.\nOur Chemical Business competes with many U.S. producers and producers in other countries, including state-owned and government-subsidized entities. Some competitors have greater total resources and are less dependent on earnings from chemical sales, which make them less vulnerable to industry downturns and better positioned to pursue new expansion and development opportunities. Our competitive position could suffer to the extent we are not able to expand our own resources sufficiently either through investments in new or existing operations or through acquisitions, joint ventures or partnerships. An inability to compete successfully could result in the loss of customers, which could adversely affect our sales and profitability.\nWe may pursue various transactions and initiatives to address our highly leveraged balance sheet and significant cash flow requirements.\nIf our existing financing sources are insufficient for our financing needs, or if we are unable to refinance debt and redemption obligations as they become due, we may be required to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures (including the El Dorado Expansion), dispose of assets or operations, seek additional capital, restructure or refinance debt, or undertake a combination of some or all of these. Any transactions and initiatives that we may pursue may have significant adverse effects on our business, capital structure, ownership, liquidity, credit ratings and results of operations. These measures may not be successful, may not produce the desired outcome if completed, may not be completed on economically attractive terms, and may not be adequate for us to fund the El Dorado Expansion and to meet our debt or redemption obligations when due. This could ultimately adversely affect us, our debtholders, and our shareholders in a material manner.\nA substantial portion of our sales are dependent upon a limited number of customers.\nFor 2015, seven customers of our Chemical Business accounted for approximately 52% of its net sales and 31% of our consolidated net sales. The loss of, or a material reduction in purchase levels by, one or more of these customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity if we are unable to replace a customer with other sales on substantially similar terms.\nCost and the lack of availability of raw materials could materially affect our profitability and liquidity.\nOur sales and profits are heavily affected by the costs and availability of primary raw materials. These primary raw materials are subject to considerable price volatility. Historically, when there have been rapid increases in the cost of these primary raw materials, we have sometimes been unable to timely increase our sales prices to cover all of the higher costs incurred. While we periodically enter into futures/forward contracts to economically hedge against price increases in certain of these raw materials, there can be no assurance that we will effectively manage against price fluctuations in those raw materials.\nSince we source certain of our raw materials and components on a global basis, we may experience long lead times in procuring those raw materials and components purchased overseas. In addition, certain of our raw materials and components are subject to tariff\ncontrols and other international trade barriers, which may increase the uncertainty of raw material and component availability and pricing volatility.\nAmmonia and natural gas represent the primary raw material feedstocks in the production of most of the products of the Chemical Business. Although our Chemical Business enters into contracts with certain customers that provide for the pass-through of raw material costs, we have a substantial amount of sales that do not provide for the pass-through of raw material costs. Also the spot sales prices of our agricultural products may not correlate to the ammonia and natural gas feedstock costs but rather reflect market conditions for similar and competing nitrogen sources. This lack of correlation can compromise our ability to recover our full cost to produce the products in this market. In addition, the Climate Control Business depends on raw materials such as copper and steel, which have shown considerable price volatility. As a result, in the future, we may not be able to pass along to all of our customers the full amount of any increases in raw material costs. Future price fluctuations in our raw materials may have an adverse effect on our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations.\nAs stated above, natural gas represents one of the primary raw materials in the production of our Chemical Business\u2019 products, and, as a result, we acquired natural gas working interests as an economic hedge against rising prices for natural gas. Our natural gas working interests may not be effective as an economic hedge under certain limited conditions.\nWe do not operate our natural gas working interest properties and have no, or very limited, ability to exercise influence over operations of these properties or their associated cost.\nAdditionally, we depend on certain vendors to deliver the primary raw materials and other key components that are required in the production of our products. Any disruption in the supply of the primary raw materials and other key components could result in lost production or delayed shipments. We have suspended in the past, and could suspend in the future, production at our chemical facilities due to, among other things, the high cost or lack of availability of such primary raw materials, which could adversely affect our competitiveness in the markets we serve. Accordingly, our financial condition, liquidity and results of operations could be materially affected in the future by the lack of availability of primary raw materials and other key components and increase costs relating to the purchase of raw materials or the production of our natural gas working interests.\nPotential increase of imported agricultural products.\nRussia and Ukraine both have substantial capacity to produce and export fertilizer grade AN. Producers in these countries also benefit from below-market prices for natural gas, due to government regulation and other factors. Fertilizer grade AN imports from Russia and Ukraine are currently subject to U.S. antidumping duty orders, which require these imports to be sold in the U.S. market at a fair value. Currently, imports of fertilizer grade AN from certain Russian producers are subject to an antidumping duty rate of 254% and all imports of fertilizer grade AN from Ukraine are subject to an antidumping duty rate of 156%. Since 2014, the duty rates for two Russian producers and exporters were reduced to zero following a U.S. Commerce Department (\u201cDOC\u201d) annual review of pricing by these entities. The antidumping orders that exist on the Ukrainian and Russian product have substantially restrained the volumes of these imports in the past, but the 2014 temporary duty elimination for certain exporters resulted in increased Russian imports in 2015. If DOC continues to assign zero duty rates to certain Russian exporters at the end of the current annual review, the volumes of Russian fertilizer grade AN exported to the U.S. may continue to increase, possibly priced below our current cost to produce fertilizer grade AN. Moreover, two federal government agencies will begin a \u201csunset review\u201d in 2016 to determine whether to continue the Russian antidumping duty order for another five years or terminate it. In addition, producers in China have substantial capacity to produce and export urea. Depending on various factors, including prevailing prices from other exporters, the price of coal, and the price of China\u2019s export tariff, higher volumes of urea from China could be imported into the U.S. at prices that have had and could have an adverse effect on the selling prices of other nitrogen products, including the nitrogen products we manufacture and sell.\nWe may have inadequate insurance.\nWhile we maintain liability, property and business interruption insurance, including certain coverage for environmental contamination, it is subject to coverage limits and policies that may exclude coverage for some types of damages (which may include warranty claims). Although there may currently be sources from which such coverage may be obtained, the coverage may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or the possible types of liabilities that may be incurred by us may not be covered by our insurance. In addition, our insurance carriers may not be able to meet their obligations under the policies, or the dollar amount of the liabilities may exceed our policy limits. Even a partially uninsured claim, if successful and of significant magnitude, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nFurthermore, we are subject to litigation for which we could be obligated to bear legal, settlement and other costs, which may be in excess of any available insurance coverage. While we maintain insurance, there can be no assurance that our insurance will prove to be adequate. If we are required to incur all or a portion of the costs arising out of any litigation or investigation as a result of inadequate insurance proceeds, if any, our business, results of operations, financial condition and liquidity could be materially\nadversely affected. For further discussion of our litigation, please see \u201cOther Pending, Threatened or Settled Litigation\u201d in Note 11 to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this report.\nLSB is a holding company and depends, in large part, on receiving funds from its subsidiaries to fund our indebtedness.\nBecause LSB is a holding company and operations are conducted through its subsidiaries, LSB\u2019s ability to meet its obligations depends, in large part, on the operating performance and cash flows of its subsidiaries and the ability of its subsidiaries to make distributions and pay dividends to LSB.\nOur substantial level of indebtedness, including dividend requirements relating to our preferred stock, could limit our financial and operating activities, and adversely affect our ability to incur additional debt to fund future needs.\nWe currently have a substantial amount of indebtedness and dividend requirements relating to our preferred stock. As a result, this level could, among other things:\n\u00b7\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to the payment of principal (primarily relating to 2019), interest and dividends, thereby reducing the funds available for operations and future business opportunities;\n\u00b7\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations, including our repurchase obligations;\n\u00b7\nlimit our ability to borrow additional money if needed for other purposes, including working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes, on satisfactory terms or at all;\n\u00b7\nlimit our ability to adjust to changing economic, business and competitive conditions;\n\u00b7\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage with competitors who may have less indebtedness or greater access to financing;\n\u00b7\nmake us more vulnerable to an increase in interest rates, a downturn in our operating performance or a decline in general economic conditions; and\n\u00b7\nmake us more susceptible to changes in credit ratings, which could affect our ability to obtain financing in the future and increase the cost of such financing.\nAny of the foregoing could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition, and liquidity.\nLoss of key personnel could negatively affect our business.\nWe believe that our performance has been and will continue to be dependent upon the efforts of our principal executive officers. We cannot promise that our principal executive officers will continue to be available. Although we have employment agreements with certain of our principal executive officers, including Jack E. Golsen, Daniel D. Greenwell, and Mark T. Behrman, we do not have employment agreements with all of our key personnel. The loss of some of our principal executive officers could have a material adverse effect on us. We believe that our future success will depend in large part on our continued ability to attract and retain highly skilled and qualified personnel.\nTerrorist attacks and other acts of violence or war, and natural disasters (such as hurricanes, pandemic health crises, etc.), have negatively affect and could negatively affect U.S. and foreign companies, the financial markets, the industries where we operate, our operations and our profitability.\nTerrorist attacks in the U.S and elsewhere and natural disasters (such as hurricanes or pandemic health crises) have in the past negatively affected, and can in the future negatively affect our operations. We cannot predict further terrorist attacks and natural disasters in the U.S. and elsewhere. These attacks or natural disasters have contributed to economic instability in the U.S. and elsewhere, and further acts of terrorism, violence, war or natural disasters could further affect the industries where we operate, our ability to purchase raw materials, our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, terrorist attacks and natural disasters may directly affect our physical facilities, especially our chemical facilities, or those of our suppliers or customers and could affect our sales, our production capability and our ability to deliver products to our customers. In the past, hurricanes affecting the Gulf Coast of the U.S. have negatively affected our operations and those of our customers. As previously noted, some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts and floods and other climatic events. If any such effects, whether anthropogenic or otherwise, were to occur in areas where we or our clients operate, they could have in adverse effect on our assets and operations. The consequences of any terrorist attacks or hostilities or natural disasters are unpredictable, and we may not be able to foresee events that could have an adverse effect on our operations.\nRisks associated with capital projects may prevent the completion of those projects on budget, on schedule or at all.\nWe are undertaking capital projects and may undertake additional capital projects in the future. Capital projects entail risks, including, but not limited to:\n\u00b7\nunanticipated cost increases;\n\u00b7\nunforeseen engineering or environmental problems;\n\u00b7\nwork stoppages;\n\u00b7\nweather interference;\n\u00b7\nunavailability of necessary equipment; and\n\u00b7\nunavailability of financing on acceptable terms.\nConstruction, equipment or staffing problems or difficulties in obtaining any of the requisite licenses, easements, permits and authorizations from regulatory authorities could increase the total cost and could delay or prevent the construction or completion of a capital project.\nIn addition, a capital project could be negatively affected if we are required to obtain additional debt or equity financing to complete a capital project or we are unable to obtain adequate sources of funding, such as the inability to obtain other debt or equity financing on acceptable terms or at all. Moreover, if we are able to complete a capital project, production levels at our facilities or general market conditions may not meet our expectations. As a result of these factors, our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nRisks generally associated with implementation of an enterprise resource planning (\u201cERP\u201d) system may adversely affect our business operation and the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.\nWe have begun to implement an ERP system, which, when completed, will handle the business and financial processes of our subsidiaries\u2019 operations and our corporate and administrative functions, such as:\n\u00b7\nfacilitating the process of purchasing, manufacturing and distributing inventories;\n\u00b7\nreceiving, processing, and shipping orders on a timely basis,\n\u00b7\nmanaging the accuracy of billings and collections for our customers;\n\u00b7\nprocessing payments to our suppliers;\n\u00b7\nmanaging the accuracy of payroll; and\n\u00b7\ngenerating financial transactions, information and reports.\nERP implementations are complex and time-consuming projects that involve substantial expenditures on system software and implementation activities that can continue for several years. ERP implementations also require transformation of business and financial processes in order to benefit from a new ERP system. Our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition may be adversely affected if we experience operating problems and cost overruns during the ERP implementation process or if the ERP system (and the associated process changes) does not generate the expected benefits. Additionally, if we do not effectively implement the ERP system as planned or if the system does not operate as intended, it could adversely affect our financial reporting.\nCyber security risks could adversely affect our business operations.\nAs we continue to increase our dependence on information technologies to conduct our operations, the risks associated with cyber security also increase. We rely on our ERP and other information systems, among other things, to manage our manufacturing, supply chain, accounting and financial functions. This risk not only applies to us, but also to third parties on whose systems we place significant reliance for the conduct of our business. We have implemented security procedures and measures in order to protect our information from being vulnerable to theft, loss, damage or interruption from a number of potential sources or events. Although we believe these measures and procedures are appropriate, we may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate, prevent, or recover from rapidly evolving types of cyber-attacks. Compromises to our information systems could have an adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nCertain of our stockholders control a significant amount of our voting stock, and their interests could conflict with interests of other stockholders.\nLSB Funding LLC (\u201cLSB Funding\u201d), our largest voting shareholder, an unrelated third party, owns one share of Series F redeemable Class C preferred stock (the \u201cSeries F Redeemable Preferred\u201d), which has voting rights with common stock equal to 19.4% of the outstanding shares of LSB\u2019s common stock as of February 19, 2016.\nJack E. Golsen, our Executive Chairman of our the Board of Directors (the \u201cBoard\u201d), members of his immediate family, including Barry H. Golsen, a member of our Board, entities owned by them, and trusts for which they possess voting or dispositive power as trustee (the \u201cGolsen Holders\u201d) owned as of February 19, 2016, an aggregate of 2,815,064 shares of our common stock and 1,020,000 shares of our voting preferred stock (1,000,000 of which shares have .875 votes per share, or 875,000 votes), which together vote as a class and represent approximately 15% of the voting power (prior to conversion of the shares of voting preferred) of our issued and outstanding voting securities as of that date. The series of preferred represented by the 20,000 shares of voting preferred is convertible into an aggregate of 666,666 shares of our common stock.\nPursuant to a Board Representation and Standstill Agreement entered into in connection with LSB Funding\u2019s purchase of preferred stock in December 2015, LSB Funding has the right to designate three directors on our Board, and the Golsen Holders have the right to appoint two directors, subject to reduction in each case in certain circumstances. This is in addition to their ability to vote generally in the election of directors. As a result, each of LSB Funding and the Golsen Holders have significant influence over the election of directors to our Board.\nThe interests of LSB Funding and the Golsen Holders may conflict with interests of other stockholders (as well as with each other). As a result of the voting power and board designation rights of LSB Funding and the Golsen Holders, the ability of other stockholders to influence our management and policies could be limited.\nOur debt agreements and our preferred stock contain covenants and restrictions that limit flexibility in operating our businesses. A breach of these covenants or restrictions could result in an event of default under one or more of our debt agreements or contracts at different entities within our capital structure, including as a result of cross acceleration or default provisions.\nOur debt agreements and our preferred stock contain various covenants and other restrictions that, among other things, limit flexibility in operating our businesses. A breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in a significant portion of our debt becoming due and payable or could result in significant contractual liability. Our ability to comply with certain of our covenants and restrictions can be affected by events beyond our control. These covenants and other restrictions limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u00b7\nincur additional debt or issue preferred shares;\n\u00b7\npay dividends on, repurchase or make distributions in respect of capital stock or make other restricted payments;\n\u00b7\nmake investments;\n\u00b7\nsell or transfer assets;\n\u00b7\ncreate liens on assets to secure debt;\n\u00b7\nconsolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u00b7\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u00b7\ndesignate subsidiaries as unrestricted subsidiaries, and\n\u00b7\nrepay, repurchase or modify certain subordinated and other material debt.\nThere are a number of important limitations and exceptions to these covenants and other restrictions.\nIn addition, certain failures to make payments on significant contract obligations when due constitute a cross-default of some of our debt instruments, including the note purchase agreement governing our 12% Senior Secured Notes (the \u201cSenior Secured Note Purchase Agreement\u201d) and the indenture governing our 7.75% Senior Secured Notes (the \u201cSenior Secured Notes Indenture\u201d). A breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in an event of default under one or more of our debt agreements at different entities within our capital structure, including as a result of cross acceleration or default provisions. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under one of these debt agreements, our lenders or noteholders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under that debt agreement to be immediately due and payable and/or terminate all commitments to extend further credit. Such actions by those lenders or noteholders could cause cross defaults or accelerations under our other debt. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders or noteholders could proceed against any collateral granted to them to secure such debt. In the case of a default\nunder debt that is guaranteed, holders of such debt could also seek to enforce the guarantees. If lenders or noteholders accelerate the repayment of all borrowings, we would likely not have sufficient assets and funds to repay those borrowings. Such occurrence could result in our or our applicable subsidiary going into bankruptcy, liquidation or insolvency.\nWe have not paid dividends on our outstanding common stock in many years.\nWe have not paid cash dividends on our outstanding common stock in many years, and we do not currently anticipate paying cash dividends on our outstanding common stock in the near future. Although our Board has not made a decision whether or not to pay dividends on our common stock in 2016, it is unlikely we will pay dividends on our common stock until we have repaid or refinanced our debt and our preferred stock. In addition, there are certain limitations contained in our loan and securities purchase agreements that may limit our ability to pay dividends on our outstanding common stock.\nFuture issuances or potential issuances of our common stock or preferred equity could adversely affect the price of our common stock and our ability to raise funds in new stock offerings and could dilute the percentage ownership or voting power of our common stockholders.\nFuture sales of substantial amounts of our common stock, preferred stock or equity-related securities in the public market, or the issuance of a substantial amount of our common stock as the result of the exercise of our outstanding warrants, the conversion of our outstanding convertible preferred stocks, or the perception that such sales or conversions could occur, could adversely affect prevailing trading prices of our common stock and could dilute the value of common stock held by our existing stockholders. No prediction can be made as to the effect, if any, that future sales of common stock, preferred stock, or equity-related securities, exercises of our warrants or conversions of, our outstanding preferred stocks into shares of common stock, or the availability of shares of common stock for future sale will have on the trading price of our common stock. Such future sales, exercises, or conversions could also significantly reduce the percentage ownership and voting power of our existing common stockholders.\nWe are subject to a variety of factors that could discourage other parties from attempting to acquire us.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides for a staggered Board and, except in limited circumstances, a two-thirds vote of outstanding voting shares to approve a merger, consolidation or sale of all, or substantially all, of our assets. In addition, we have entered into severance agreements with our executive officers and some of the executive officers of certain subsidiaries that provide, among other things, that if, within a specified period of time after the occurrence of a change in control of LSB, these officers are terminated, other than for cause, or the officer terminates his employment for good reason, the officer would be entitled to certain severance benefits. Certain of our preferred stock series and debt instruments also provide special rights in a change of control, including in some cases the ability to be repaid in full or redeemed.\nWe have authorized and unissued (including shares held in treasury) 51,603,779 shares of common stock and 4,019,999 shares of preferred stock as of December 31, 2015. These unissued shares could be used by our management to make it more difficult, and thereby discourage an attempt to acquire control of us.\nWe have adopted a preferred share purchase plan, which is designed to protect us against certain creeping acquisitions, open market purchases and certain mergers and other combinations with acquiring companies.\nThe foregoing provisions and agreements are designed to discourage a third party tender offer, proxy contest, or other attempts to acquire control of us and could have the effect of making it more difficult to remove incumbent management. In addition, LSB Funding and the Golsen Holders have significant voting power and rights to designate board representatives, all of which may further discourage a third party tender offer, proxy contest, or other attempts to acquire control of us.\nDelaware has adopted an anti-takeover law which, among other things, will delay for three years business combinations with acquirers of 15% or more of the outstanding voting stock of publicly-held companies (such as us), unless:\n\u00b7\nprior to such time the Board of the corporation approved the business combination that results in the stockholder becoming an invested stockholder;\n\u00b7\nthe acquirer owned at least 85% of the outstanding voting stock of such company prior to commencement of the transaction;\n\u00b7\ntwo-thirds of the stockholders, other than the acquirer, vote to approve the business combination after approval thereof by the Board; or\n\u00b7\nthe stockholders of the corporation amend its articles of incorporation or by-laws electing not to be governed by this provision\nSPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nCertain statements contained within this report may be deemed \u201cForward-Looking Statements\u201d within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 (as amended, the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d) and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act.
