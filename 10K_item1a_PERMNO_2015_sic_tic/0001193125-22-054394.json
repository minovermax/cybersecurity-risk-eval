As conditions fluctuate, governments have responded by adjusting their restrictions and guidelines accordingly. In light of variant strains of the virus and the continued rate of viral infections that exists as of the date of this filing, there remains uncertainty concerning the magnitude of the impact and duration of the COVID-19\npandemic. The full impact of the COVID-19\npandemic on our financial condition and results of operations will continue to depend on future developments, such as the ultimate duration and scope of the pandemic, its impact on our employees, customers and suppliers, potential subsequent waves of COVID-19\ninfection or potential new variants, the effectiveness and adoption of COVID-19\nvaccines and therapeutics, the broader implications of the macro-economic recovery on our business, and the extent to which normal economic and operating conditions are impacted. We intend to continue to actively monitor the evolution of the pandemic and may take further actions that alter our business operations as may be required by federal, state or local authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, suppliers and shareholders.\nCOVID-19\nrelated factors that have impacted us, or may negatively impact, sales, gross margin and other results of operations in the future include, but are not limited to: limitations on the ability of our suppliers to manufacture, or procure from manufacturers, the products we sell, or to meet delivery requirements and commitments; limitations on the ability of our employees to perform their work due to illness or other disruptions caused by the pandemic, including local, state, or federal orders requiring employees to remain at home; limitations on the ability of carriers to deliver our products to customers; limitations on the ability of our customers to conduct their businesses and purchase our products; and limitations on the ability of our customers to pay us on a timely basis.\nAs we cannot predict the duration or ultimate scope of the COVID-19\npandemic, the potential negative financial impact to our results of operations cannot be reasonably estimated but could be material and last for an extended period of time.\nSupplier Concentration\nThe Company\u2019s top ten suppliers accounted for 83% of our purchases during 2021, including 61% from Carrier, and 10% from Rheem. Carrier provides a diverse variety of brands of HVAC systems including, Carrier, Bryant, Payne, Tempstar, Heil, Comfortmaker and Grandaire, along with complimentary replacement parts. Rheem provides Rheem-brand HVAC systems along with complimentary replacement parts. Given the significant concentration of our supply chain, particularly with Carrier and Rheem, any significant interruption by any of the key manufacturers or a termination of a relationship could temporarily disrupt the operations of certain of our subsidiaries. Additionally, our operations are materially dependent upon the continued market acceptance and quality of these manufacturers\u2019 products and their ability to continue to manufacture\nproducts that are competitive and that comply with laws relating to environmental and efficiency standards. Our inability to obtain products from one or more of these manufacturers or a decline in market acceptance of these manufacturers\u2019 products could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity.\nMany HVAC equipment and component manufacturers, including Carrier and Rheem, source component parts from China and/or assemble a significant number of products for residential and light-commercial applications from Mexico. If any restrictions, including a potential increase in tariffs, are imposed related to such products sourced or assembled from Mexico and China, including as a result of amendments to existing trade agreements, and our product costs consequently increase, we would be required to raise our prices, which may result in cost inflation, the loss of customers, and harm to our business. In addition, COVID-19,\nwhich surfaced in Wuhan, China in December 2019, resulted in increased travel restrictions and extended shutdown of certain businesses in the region. The continuing impact of COVID-19\non our business will depend on future developments; however, closures in China and/or Mexico may disrupt the operations of certain of our suppliers, which could negatively impact our business.\nWe maintain trade name and distribution agreements with Carrier and Rheem that provide us distribution rights on an exclusive basis in specified territories. Such agreements are not subject to a stated term or expiration date.\nWe also maintain other distribution agreements with various other suppliers, either on an exclusive or non-exclusive\nbasis, for various terms ranging from one to ten years. Certain of the distribution agreements contain provisions that restrict or limit the sale of competitive products in the locations that sell such branded products. Other than where such location-level restrictions apply, we may distribute other manufacturers\u2019 lines of air conditioning or heating equipment in other locations in the same territories.\nRisks Inherent in Acquisitions\nAs part of our strategy, we intend to pursue additional acquisitions of complementary businesses, including through joint ventures and investments in unconsolidated entities. If we complete future acquisitions, including investments in unconsolidated entities, or enter into new joint ventures, we may be required to incur or assume additional debt and/or issue additional shares of our common stock as consideration, which will dilute our existing shareholders\u2019 ownership interest and may affect our results of operations. Growth through acquisitions involves a number of risks, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nthe ability to identify and consummate transactions with complementary acquisition candidates;\n\u2022\nthe successful operation and/or integration of acquired companies;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from other daily functions;\n\u2022\nissuance by us of equity securities that would dilute ownership of our existing shareholders;\n\u2022\nincurrence and/or assumption of significant debt and contingent liabilities; and\n\u2022\npossible loss of key employees and/or customer relationships of the acquired companies.\nIn addition, acquired companies and investments made in unconsolidated entities may have liabilities that we failed or were unable to discover while performing due diligence investigations. We cannot assure you that the indemnification, if any, granted to us by sellers of acquired companies or by joint venture partners will be sufficient in amount, scope, or duration to offset the possible liabilities associated with businesses or properties that we assume upon consummation of an acquisition or joint venture. Any such liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFailure to successfully manage the operational challenges and risks associated with, or resulting from, acquisitions could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity.\nCompetition\nWe operate in highly competitive environments. We compete with other distributors and several air conditioning and heating equipment manufacturers that distribute a significant portion of their products through their own distribution organizations in certain markets. Competition within any given geographic market is based upon product availability, customer service, price, and quality. Competitive pressures or other factors could cause our products or services to lose market acceptance or result in significant price erosion, all of which would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Fluctuations\nThe functional currency of our operations in Canada is the Canadian dollar, and the functional currency of our operations in Mexico is the U.S. dollar because the majority of our Mexican transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. Foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations may have an impact on transactions denominated in Canadian dollars and Mexican Pesos, and, therefore, could adversely affect our financial performance. Although we use foreign currency forward contracts to mitigate the impact of currency exchange rate movements, we do not currently hold any derivative contracts that hedge our foreign currency translational exposure.\nSeasonality\nSales of residential central air conditioners, heating equipment, and parts and supplies are seasonal, resulting in fluctuations in our revenue from quarter to quarter. Furthermore, profitability can be impacted favorably or unfavorably based on the severity or mildness of weather patterns during Summer or Winter selling seasons. Demand related to the residential central air conditioning replacement market is typically highest in the second and third quarters, and demand for heating equipment is usually highest in the first and fourth quarters. Demand related to the new construction sectors throughout most of the markets is fairly evenly distributed throughout the year and depends largely on housing completions and related weather and economic conditions.\nDependence on Key Personnel\nMuch of our success has depended on the skills and experience of senior management personnel. The loss of any of our executive officers or other key senior management personnel could harm our business. We must continuously recruit, retain, and motivate management and other employees to both maintain our current business and to execute our strategic initiatives. Our success has also depended on the contributions and abilities of our store employees upon whom we rely on to give customers a superior in-store\nexperience. Accordingly, our performance depends on our ability to recruit and retain high quality employees to work in and manage our stores. If we are unable to adequately recruit, retain, and motivate employees our projected growth and expansion, and our business and financial performance may be adversely affected.\nDecline in Economic Conditions\nWe rely predominantly on the credit markets and, to a lesser extent, on the capital markets to meet our financial commitments and short-term liquidity needs if internal funds are not available from our operations. Access to funds under our line of credit is dependent on the ability of the syndicate banks to meet their respective funding commitments. Disruptions in the credit and capital markets could adversely affect our ability to draw on our revolving credit agreement and may also adversely affect the determination of interest rates, particularly rates based on LIBOR, which is one of the base rates under our revolving credit agreement. On March 5, 2021, the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, confirmed that LIBOR will either cease to be provided by any administrator or will no longer be representative after June 30, 2023 for USD LIBOR reference rates. Our revolving credit agreement provides that it may be amended to replace LIBOR with an alternate benchmark rate. The impact of such an amendment cannot be entirely predicted but could result in an increase in the cost of our debt. Additionally, disruptions in the credit and capital markets could also result in increased borrowing costs and/or reduced borrowing capacity under our revolving credit agreement. Any long-term disruption could require us to take measures to conserve cash until the markets stabilize, or until alternative credit arrangements or other funding for our business needs can be arranged. Such measures could include reducing or eliminating dividend payments, deferring capital expenditures, and reducing or eliminating other discretionary uses of cash.\nA decline in economic conditions and lack of availability of business and consumer credit could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Any capital or credit market disruption could cause broader economic downturns, which may lead to reduced demand for our products and an increased incidence of customers\u2019 inability to pay their accounts. Further, bankruptcies or similar events by customers may cause us to incur increased levels of bad debt expense. Also, our suppliers may be negatively impacted by deteriorating economic conditions, causing disruption or delay of product availability. These events would adversely impact our results of operations, cash flows, and financial position. Additionally, if the conditions of the capital and credit markets adversely affect the financial institutions that have committed to extend us credit, they may be unable to fund borrowings under such commitments, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition, liquidity, and our ability to borrow funds for working capital, acquisitions, capital expenditures, and other corporate purposes.\nCybersecurity Risks\nIn addition to the disruptions that may occur from interruptions in our information technology systems, cybersecurity threats and sophisticated and targeted cyberattacks pose a risk to our information technology systems. We have established security policies, processes and defenses designed to help identify and protect against intentional and unintentional misappropriation\nor corruption of our information technology systems and information and disruption of our operations. Despite these efforts, our information technology systems may be damaged, disrupted or shut down due to attacks by hackers and other persons obtaining unauthorized access, malicious software, ransomware, computer viruses, undetected intrusion, hardware failures or other events, and in these circumstances our disaster recovery plans may be ineffective or inadequate. These breaches or intrusions could lead to business interruption, exposure of proprietary or confidential information, data corruption, damage to our reputation, exposure to legal and regulatory proceedings and other costs. Such events could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, we could be adversely affected if any of our significant customers or suppliers experiences any similar events that disrupt their business operations or damage their reputation.\nFailure to successfully manage the operational challenges and risks associated with, or resulting from, upgrades and conversions to newer versions of our information technology systems core to our operations could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity.\nWe maintain change management processes, monitoring practices, and protections of our information technology to reduce these risks and test our systems on an ongoing basis for potential threats. The Audit Committee is briefed on information security matters at least once a year. We carry cybersecurity insurance to help mitigate the financial exposure and related notification procedures in the event of intentional intrusion. There can be no assurance, however, that our efforts will prevent the risk of a security breach of our databases or systems that could adversely affect our business.\nInternational Risk\nOur international sales and operations, as well as sourcing of products from suppliers with international operations, are subject to various risks associated with changes in local laws, regulations, and policies, including those related to tariffs, trade restrictions and trade agreements, investments, taxation, capital controls, employment regulations, different liability standards, and limitations on the repatriation of funds due to foreign currency controls. Our international sales and operations, as well as sourcing of products from suppliers with international operations, are also sensitive to changes in foreign national priorities, including government budgets, as well as political and economic instability. In addition, closures in China and Mexico due to COVID-19\nmay disrupt the operations of certain of our suppliers, which could negatively impact our business. Unfavorable changes in any of the foregoing could adversely affect our results of operations or could cause a disruption in our supply chain for products sourced internationally. Additionally, failure to comply with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act could subject us to, among other things, penalties and legal expenses that could harm our reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nClass B Common Stock and Insider Ownership\nAs of December 31, 2021, our directors and executive officers and entities affiliated with them owned (i) Common stock representing 1% of the outstanding shares of Common stock and (ii) Class B common stock representing 84% of the outstanding shares of Class B common stock. These interests represent 54% of the aggregate combined voting power (including 52% beneficially owned by Albert H. Nahmad, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Aaron J. Nahmad, President, through shares owned by them and shares held by affiliated limited partnerships and various family trusts). Accordingly, our directors and executive officers collectively have the voting power to elect six members of our nine-person Board of Directors.\nOur Class B common stock is substantially identical to our Common stock except: (i) Common stock is entitled to one vote on all matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders, and each share of Class B common stock is entitled to ten votes; (ii) shareholders of Common stock are entitled to elect 25% of our Board of Directors (rounded up to the nearest whole number), and Class B shareholders are entitled to elect the balance of the Board of Directors; (iii) cash dividends may be paid on Common stock without paying a cash dividend on Class B common stock, and no cash dividend may be paid on Class B common stock unless at least an equal cash dividend is paid on Common stock; and (iv) Class B common stock is convertible at any time into Common stock on a one-for-one\nbasis at the option of the shareholder.\nFuture Sales\nWe are not restricted from issuing additional shares of our Common stock or Class B common stock (which we refer to together as common stock), including securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, our common stock or any substantially similar securities in the future. We may issue shares of our common stock or other securities in one or more registered or unregistered offerings, and we may also issue our securities in connection with investments or acquisitions. The number of shares of our common stock issued in connection with any of the foregoing may result in dilution to holders of our common stock.\nVolatility\nThe market price of our common stock may be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations. Securities markets worldwide experience significant price and volume fluctuations. This market volatility, as well as general economic, market or political conditions, could reduce the market price of shares of our common stock in spite of our operating performance. The trading price of our common stock may be adversely affected due to a number of factors, most of which we cannot predict or control, such as the following:\n\u2022\nfluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022\na decision by the Board of Directors to reduce or eliminate cash dividends on our common stock;\n\u2022\nchanges in recommendations or earnings estimates by securities analysts;\n\u2022\ngeneral market conditions in our industry or in the economy as a whole; and\n\u2022\npolitical instability, natural disasters, war and/or events of terrorism.\nTrading Liquidity\nThe trading market for our common stock is limited, and there can be no assurance that a more liquid trading market for our common stock will develop. There can be no assurance as to the liquidity of any market for our common stock, the ability of the holders of our common stock to sell any of their securities and the price at which the holders of our common stock will be able to sell such securities.\nPayment of Dividends\nThe amount of any future dividends that we will pay, if any, will depend upon a number of factors. Future dividends will be declared and paid at the sole discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend upon such factors as cash flow generated by operations, profitability, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects, and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors. The right of our Board of Directors to declare dividends, however, is subject to the availability of sufficient funds under Florida law to pay dividends. In addition, our ability to pay dividends depends on certain restrictions in our credit agreement.\nSecurities Analyst Research and Reports\nThe trading markets for our common stock rely in part on the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business or industry. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or our industry, or the stock of Carrier or any of our competitors, publish negative or unfavorable research about our business, the price of our stock could decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nGoodwill, Intangibles and Long-Lived Assets\nAt December 31, 2021, goodwill, intangibles, and long-lived assets represented approximately 36% of our total assets. The recoverability of goodwill, indefinite lived intangibles, and long-lived assets is evaluated at least annually and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. The identification and measurement of goodwill impairment involves the estimation of the fair value of our reporting unit and contains uncertainty because management must use judgment in determining appropriate assumptions to be used in the measurement of fair value. The estimates of fair value of our reporting unit, indefinite lived intangibles, and long-lived assets are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment and incorporates management\u2019s assumptions about expected future cash flows and contemplates other valuation techniques. Future cash flows can be affected by changes in the industry, a declining economic environment, or market conditions. We cannot assure you that we will not suffer material impairments to goodwill, intangibles, or long-lived assets in the future.\nRisks Related to Loss Contingencies\nWe carry general liability, comprehensive property damage, workers\u2019 compensation, health benefits, cybersecurity, and other insurance coverage that management considers adequate for the protection of its assets and operations at reasonable premiums. There can be no assurance that the coverage limits and related premiums of such policies will be adequate to cover claims, losses and expenses for lawsuits which have been, or may be, brought against us. A loss in excess of insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and/or profitability. Certain self-insurance risks for casualty insurance programs and health benefits are retained and reserves are established based on claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not yet reported. Assurance cannot be provided that actual claims will not exceed present estimates.\nExposure to catastrophic losses has been limited by maintaining excess and aggregate liability coverage and implementing stop-loss control programs. However, more frequent catastrophic weather events linked to climate change may impact the availability and cost of property and casualty insurance.", "PERMNO": 66376, "SIC": 5070, "TIC": "WSO"}
