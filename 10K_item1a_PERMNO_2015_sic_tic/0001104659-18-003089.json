{"cik": "722723", "company": "HANGER, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-01-19", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nSet forth below are certain risk factors that could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. You should carefully read the following risk factors, together with the consolidated financial statements, related notes and other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that contain risks and uncertainties. Please read the cautionary notice regarding forward-looking statements in Item 7. under the heading \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in connection with your consideration of the risk factors and other important factors that may affect future results described below.\nThe restatement of our previously issued consolidated financial statements was time-consuming and expensive and could expose us to additional risks that would adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nAs described in our 2014 Form 10-K, we restated our previously issued consolidated financial statements for the first two quarters in fiscal year 2014, for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012 and each of the quarters in fiscal year 2013. We also restated our financial results for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 (each unaudited), as summarized in Item 6. \u201cSelected Financial Data\u201d to our 2014 Form 10-K. The Restatement was time-consuming and expensive and could expose us to a number of additional risks that would adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows as well as investor confidence and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nIn particular, we incurred, and continue to incur, significant expense, including audit, legal, consulting and other professional fees, in connection with the Restatement and the ongoing remediation of material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. We have taken a number of steps that we have deemed appropriate and reasonable to strengthen our accounting function and reduce the risk of future restatements, including adding internal personnel and hiring outside consultants, as described in more detail in Item 9A. \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. To the extent these steps are not successful, we may need to incur additional time and expense to address accounting issues that could arise in the future. Our management\u2019s attention has also been, and may further be, diverted from the operation of our business as a result of the time and attention required to address the ongoing remediation of material weaknesses in our internal controls.\nWe are also subject to claims, investigations and proceedings arising out of the misstatements contained in our previously issued financial statements. For additional information regarding this litigation, see Item 3. \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting which could, if not remediated, adversely affect our ability to report our financial condition and results of operations in a timely and accurate manner, negatively impacting investor confidence and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), and is required to evaluate the effectiveness of these controls and procedures on a periodic basis and publicly disclose the results of these evaluations and related matters in accordance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Management has identified numerous material weaknesses that existed as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2016, including material weaknesses relating to the ineffectiveness of the control environment. See Item 9A. \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As a result of these material weaknesses, our management concluded that our internal controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2016.\nA \u201cmaterial weakness\u201d is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. We are actively engaged in developing and implementing remedial measures designed to address these material weaknesses. Our remedial measures are not complete and are ongoing. Although we are working to remedy the ineffectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, there can be no assurance as to when the remedial measures will be fully developed, the timing and effectiveness of our implementation of such remedial measures or the aggregate cost of implementation. Until our remedial measures are fully implemented, our management will continue to devote significant time and attention to these efforts. If we do not complete our remediation in a timely fashion, or at all, or if our remedial measures are inadequate, there will continue to be an increased risk that we will be unable to timely file\nfuture periodic reports with the SEC and that our future consolidated financial statements could contain misstatements that will be undetected. If we are unable to report our results in a timely and accurate manner, then we may not be able to comply with the applicable covenants in our credit agreements, and may be required to seek additional amendments or waivers under these credit agreements, which could adversely impact our liquidity and financial condition. Further and continued determinations that there are material weaknesses in the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting could reduce our ability to obtain financing or could increase the cost of any financing we obtain and require additional expenditures of both money and our management\u2019s time to comply with applicable requirements.\nAny failure to implement or maintain required new or improved controls, or any difficulties we encounter in their implementation, could result in additional material weaknesses or material misstatements in our consolidated financial statements. Any new misstatement could result in a further restatement of our consolidated financial statements, cause us to fail to meet timely our periodic reporting obligations with the SEC, cause us to violate debt covenants, reduce our ability to obtain financing or cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, leading to a decline in the value of our common stock. We cannot assure you that we will not discover additional weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting.\nFurthermore, as we grow our business, our disclosure controls and internal controls over financial reporting will become more complex, and we may require significantly more resources to ensure the effectiveness of these controls. If we are unable to continue upgrading our internal controls, reporting systems and IT in a timely and effective fashion, then we may require additional management time and attention and other resources to be devoted to assist in compliance with the disclosure and financial reporting requirements and other rules that apply to public companies, which could adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations.\nThe restatement of our previously issued financial results has resulted in private litigation and could result in private litigation judgments that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are subject to shareholder derivative litigation relating to certain of our previous public disclosures. For additional discussion of this litigation, see Item 3. \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our management has been and may be required in the future to devote significant time and attention to this litigation, and this and any additional matters that arise could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition as well as on our reputation. While we cannot estimate our potential exposure in these matters at this time, we have already incurred significant expense defending this litigation and expect to continue to need to incur significant expense in the defense.\nThe existence of the litigation may have an adverse effect on our reputation with referral sources and our patients themselves, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur failure to prepare and timely file our periodic reports with the SEC limits our access to the public markets to raise debt or equity capital, impacts our ability to obtain alternative financing and could have negative consequences under the terms of our existing credit agreements.\nWe have not made timely periodic reporting filings with the SEC since the filing of our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2014. We did not file our Annual Reports on Form 10-K for 2014, 2015 or 2016, or our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for 2015, 2016 or 2017, within the time frame required by the SEC. As a result of our late SEC filings, we are limited in our ability to access the public markets to raise debt or equity capital, which could prevent us from pursuing transactions or implementing business strategies that we believe would be beneficial to our business.\nAs disclosed in the 2014 Form 10-K, we entered into amendments to the Credit Agreement, dated as of June 17, 2013, among us, the lenders from time to time party thereto and Bank of America, N.A. (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d), that waived certain actual or potential defaults and amended various covenants and other provisions. We entered into the Sixth Amendment and Waiver, effective as of June 22, 2017, with respect to our Credit Agreement (the \u201cSixth Amendment and Waiver\u201d), which waives defaults and events of default under the Credit Agreement and also modifies certain of the terms and covenants contained in the Credit Agreement, including increasing the applicable interest rates, with some of the modifications terminating at such time as we meet various conditions. The Sixth Amendment also extended the deadline by which we must deliver to the Agent under the Credit Agreement our audited financial statements and related audit report for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, from August 15, 2017 to February 15, 2018. On August 1, 2016, we entered a Term B Credit Agreement that provides for a $280 million senior unsecured term loan facility under which all outstanding principal is due at\nmaturity on August 1, 2019 (the \u201cTerm B Credit Agreement,\u201d and together with the Credit Agreement the \u201cCredit Agreements\u201d) and all borrowings bear interest at a fixed rate per annum equal to 11.50% payable quarterly in arrears.\nWe entered into the Term B Amendment, effective as of June 23, 2017, with respect to our Term B Credit Agreement (the \u201cTerm B Amendment\u201d) which extended the deadline by which we must deliver to Wilmington Trust, National Association, as the Term B agent our audited financial statements, the related audit report and a consolidated budget for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2016, from August 15, 2017 to February 15, 2018. The Amendment also extends the deadline by which the Compliance Date must occur from August 15, 2017 until February 15, 2018.\nIf we fail to comply with the terms of our Credit Agreement as amended by the Fifth Amendment and Waiver and the Sixth Amendment and Waiver or the terms of our Term B Credit Agreement, as amended by the Term B Amendment, which include financial ratio covenants and the obligation to provide audited financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017 by March 31, 2018, or if we are unsuccessful at further amending or waiving the Credit Agreement when the existing amendments and waivers expire (if such further amendment and waivers become necessary), then we may be subject to numerous penalties, including but not limited to the acceleration of all of our debt outstanding pursuant to the Credit Agreements. In the event that the debt was to be accelerated, then we may need to seek alternative financing to satisfy our financial obligations. This alternative financing may not be available to us on terms that are favorable to us, or at all.\nIn addition, the Credit Agreement expires on June 17, 2018. At the time the Credit Agreement expires, we will need to seek a new credit agreement with current or new lenders to satisfy our ongoing liquidity needs and financial obligations. This new credit agreement may not be available to us at favorable terms or at all.\nSee Note N - \u201cLong-Term Debt\u201d to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the Credit Agreements and our long-term debt.\nWe have substantial indebtedness, and our failure to comply with the covenants and payment requirements of that indebtedness may subject us to increased interest expenses, lender consent and amendment costs or adverse financial consequences.\nAs of September 30, 2017, we had approximately $487.6 million in indebtedness. This current level of indebtedness is comprised of approximately $191.7 million of borrowings under our Credit Agreement, approximately $270.7 million of borrowings under our Term B Credit Agreement and approximately $25.2 million of indebtedness related to other financing obligations and seller notes. Under these Credit Agreements, we are required to comply with certain financial covenants and other provisions. In addition to other requirements, these provisions include requirements that we timely prepare our financial statements and timely receive audits on our annual financial statements, meet certain financial ratio requirements and timely pay interest and principal when due. Due to our material weaknesses and other factors, we did not file our 2014 annual financial statements until May 12, 2017. Additionally, we have failed in our compliance with certain of our financial covenants. These failures on our part have resulted in defaults under our debt agreements. To remedy these defaults, we have had to provide lenders with consent and amendment fees, have experienced increasing constraints on our ability to borrow under our debt agreements, have been required to pay higher interest costs and have been required to adhere to increased restrictions on the use of the funds we borrow. To the extent that we fail to meet our financial statement requirements in future periods, our operating trends do not enable us to meet our financial covenant requirements, we are unable to pay interest or principal when due or we are unable to meet other covenants and requirements contained within our Credit Agreements, we may default under one or both of our Credit Agreements. A default under one or both of these agreements could result in further increases in consent or amendment fees to lenders, further increases in interest costs, the imposition of additional constraints on borrowing by our lenders or potentially more serious liquidity constraints and adverse financial consequences, including reductions in the value of our common stock or the necessity of seeking protection from creditors under bankruptcy laws. See the \u201cLiquidity and Capital Resources\u201d section in this Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis for further discussion.\nAdditionally, our current Credit Agreements include variable interest rates. In the event that interest rates rise, we will be required to pay greater interest expenses, which will have an adverse effect on our income from operations and financial condition.\nTo remedy issues we may encounter with meeting our debt obligations, or for other purposes, we may find it necessary to seek further refinancing of our indebtedness, and may do so with debt instruments that are more costly than our existing instruments (and which will rank senior to our equity securities), or we may issue additional equity securities which may\ndilute the ownership interests or value of our existing shareholders. These actions may decrease the value of our equity securities.\nHealth care reform has initiated significant changes to the United States health care system and we expect to see further changes in the health care system in the future.\nVarious health care reform provisions became law upon enactment of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Pub. L. No. 111-148, on March 23, 2010 (the \u201cAffordable Care Act\u201d). The reforms contained in the Affordable Care Act have impacted our business. Continued political, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the health care industry in the United States to fundamental change. Further changes relating to the health care industry and in health care spending may adversely affect our revenue. We anticipate that Congress will continue to review and assess alternative health care delivery and payment systems and may in the future propose and adopt legislation effecting additional fundamental changes in the health care system. Although efforts at replacing the Affordable Care Act and overhauling the health care system have currently stalled in Congress, health care reform remains a priority for the Trump Administration and for many members of Congress. We cannot assure you as to the ultimate content, timing or effect of changes, nor is it possible at this time to estimate the impact of potential legislation on our business. However, although the specific reforms to the current health care system cannot be accurately predicted at this time, such changes could have a considerable impact on how health care is reimbursed, particularly on the coverage for certain types of services and on the reimbursement levels provided by government sources.\nChanges in government reimbursement levels could adversely affect our Patient Care segment\u2019s net revenue, cash flows and profitability.\nWe derived approximately 54.1%, 53.4% and 50.9% of our net revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, of our net revenue from reimbursements for O&P services and products from programs administered by Medicare, Medicaid and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. Each of these programs set reimbursement levels for the O&P services and products provided under their program. If these agencies reduce reimbursement levels for O&P services and products in the future, our net revenues could substantially decline. In addition, the percentage of our net revenues derived from these sources may increase as the portion of the U.S. population over age 65 continues to grow, making us more vulnerable to reimbursement reductions by these organizations. Reduced government reimbursement levels could result in reduced private payor reimbursement levels because fee schedules of certain third party payors are indexed to Medicare reimbursement levels. Furthermore, the health care industry is experiencing a trend towards cost containment as government and other third party payors seek to impose lower reimbursement rates and negotiate reduced contract rates with service providers. This trend could adversely affect our net revenues. For example, a number of states have reduced their Medicaid reimbursement rates for O&P services and products, or have reduced Medicaid eligibility, and others are in the process of reviewing Medicaid reimbursement policies generally, including for prosthetic and orthotic devices.\nMedicare provides for reimbursement for O&P products and services based on prices set forth in fee schedules for ten regional service areas. Medicare prices are adjusted each year based on the CPI-U unless Congress acts to change or eliminate the adjustment. The Medicare price (decreases)/increases for 2016, 2015, and 2014 were (0.4%), 1.5%, and 1.0%, respectively. The Affordable Care Act (\u201cACA\u201d) changed the Medicare inflation factors applicable to O&P (and other) suppliers. The annual updates for years subsequent to 2011 are based on the percentage increase in the CPI-U for the 12-months ended in June of the previous year. Section 3401(m) of the ACA required that for 2011 and each subsequent year, the fee schedule update factor based on the CPI-U for the 12-months ended in June of the previous year is to be adjusted by the annual change in economy-wide private nonfarm business multifactor productivity (the \u201cMFP Adjustment\u201d). The MFP Adjustment may result in the percentage increase being less than zero for a year and may result in payment rates for a year being less than such payment rates for the preceding year. Although the decrease in the Medicare O&P fee schedule for 2016 is not unprecedented, it is the first time that there has been a decrease since 2011, when the Productivity Adjustment was first introduced following the ACA. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (\u201cCMS\u201d) has not yet issued a final rule implementing these adjustments for years beyond 2011, but has indicated in a proposed rule that it will do so as part of the annual program instructions to the O&P fee schedule updates. See 75 Fed. Reg. 40040, 40122-25 (July 13, 2010). If the U.S. Congress were to legislate additional modifications to the Medicare fee schedules, our net revenues from Medicare and other payors could be adversely and materially affected.\nAlternative models of reimbursement for durable medical equipment, prosthetics, orthotics and supplies (\u201cDMEPOS\u201d) may also affect our business. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 requires that Medicare replace the current fee schedule payment methodology for certain DMEPOS items and services with \u201csingle\npayment amounts\u201d determined through a competitive bidding process, and CMS has issued regulations finalizing the methodology for adjusting fee schedule amounts for such items. See 79 Fed, Reg. 66120, 66123 (November 6, 2014). The types of DMEPOS subject to competitive bidding under the statute include: oxygen and oxygen equipment; continuous positive airway pressure devices, single and bi-level; standard manual and power wheelchairs, scooters and walkers; Group 2 complex rehabilitative power wheelchairs; hospital beds, commode chairs, patient lifts and seat lifts; support surfaces or pressure reducing mattresses and overlays; enteral nutrients, supplies and equipment; negative pressure wound therapy pumps; infusion pumps; transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation devices; standard nebulizers; and certain mail-order diabetic testing supplies. Under the DMEPOS Competitive Bidding Program, suppliers compete to submit bids for selected products, and the Medicare suppliers offering the best price, in addition to meeting applicable quality and financial standards, are awarded contracts to supply the designated products and services to Medicare beneficiaries in specified competitive bidding areas. Although our product offerings currently subject to competitive bidding do not comprise a significant portion of our business, it is possible that the DMEPOS Competitive Bidding Program may expand to include other types of products we offer, or that other payors will adopt similar models for reimbursement, which may negatively affect our net revenue.\nThe Budget Control Act of 2011 required, among other things, mandatory across-the-board reductions in Federal spending, or \u201csequestration\u201d. While delayed by the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, President Obama issued a sequestration order on March 1, 2013. For services provided on or after April 1, 2013, Medicare fee-for-service claim payments, including those for DMEPOS as well as claims under the DMEPOS Competitive Bidding Program, are reduced by 2 percent. On November 2, 2015, President Obama signed the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015 into law, which provided for two years of increases to discretionary spending to be offset by an additional year of Medicare sequestration, through 2025. This is a claims payment adjustment with limited impact on us; no permanent reductions in the Medicare DMEPOS fee schedule have been made as a result of sequestration, therefore additional reimbursements from Medicaid, the VA and commercial payors who use the Medicare fee schedule as a basis for reimbursement have not been impacted.\nCMS may also develop policies to limit Medicare coverage of specific products and services. Medical administrative contractors may issue local coverage determinations (\u201cLCD\u201d) that limit coverage for a particular item or service in their jurisdiction only. This can lead to state-by-state variation in Medicare coverage for some items and services. Any LCD that negatively impacts orthotic or prosthetic reimbursement would negatively affect our revenue.\nFinally, patients may continue to move to Medicare Advantage plans from traditional Medicare plans, which will change the nature of the reimbursement received by us from the traditional Medicare program and negatively affect our net revenue.\nIf the average rates that commercial payors pay us decline significantly, then it would have a material adverse effect on our net revenues, earnings and cash flows.\nWe derived approximately 39.2%, 39.6% and 41.4% of our net revenue for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, from reimbursements for O&P services and products for patients who have commercial payors as their primary payor. We continue to experience downward pressure on some of our commercial payment rates as a result of general conditions in the market, recent and future consolidations among commercial payors, increased focus on O&P services and products and other factors. There is no guarantee that commercial payment rates will not be materially lower in the future, particularly given the fluctuations in government reimbursement rates.\nWe are continuously in the process of negotiating new agreements and renegotiating agreements that are up for renewal with commercial payors, who tend to be aggressive in their negotiations with us. Sometimes many significant agreements are up for renewal or being renegotiated at the same time. In the event that our continual negotiations result in overall commercial rate reductions in excess of overall commercial rate increases, the cumulative effect could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. Consolidations in the commercial payor market have significantly increased the negotiating leverage of commercial payors. Our negotiations with payors are also influenced by competitive pressures, and we may experience decreased contracted rates with commercial payors or experience decreases in patient volume as our negotiations with commercial payors continue. If the average rates that commercial payors pay us decline significantly, or if we see a decline in commercial patients, it would have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows.\nChanges in government reimbursement levels could adversely affect our Products & Services segment\u2019s net revenues, cash flows and profitability.\nIn addition to the risks to our Patient Care segment businesses discussed previously, changes in government reimbursement levels could also adversely affect the net revenues, cash flows and profitability of the businesses in our Products & Services\nsegment. In particular, a significant majority of our therapeutic services sales involve devices and related services provided to SNFs and similar businesses. Reductions in government reimbursement levels to SNFs have caused, and could continue to cause, such SNFs to reduce or cancel their use of our therapeutic service devices and modalities, negatively impacting net revenues, cash flows and profitability. For example, in July 2011 CMS announced an across the board reduction of approximately 11% in SNF reimbursement levels, which negatively impacted the demand for our devices and treatment modalities. Although CMS has announced increases in SNF reimbursement levels in the years since (the agency announced an increase of 1.3% for FY 2014, 2.0% for FY 2015, 1.4% for FY 2016, 2.4% for FY 2017, and 1.0% for FY 2018), we cannot predict whether any other changes to reimbursement levels will be implemented, or if implemented what form any changes might take. Further, the Department of Health & Human Services Office of Inspector General (\u201cOIG\u201d) has indicated concerns with the Medicare payment system for SNFs and has suggested that the payment system needs to be reevaluated. OIG\u2019s specific concerns relate to issues such as Medicare payments that exceed SNFs\u2019 costs, how Medicare pays for therapy based primarily on the volume of services rather than beneficiary characteristics, and the high error rate for SNF billing. Concerns such as these may result in further changes to SNF reimbursement levels and processes, even if they do not directly relate to O&P services.\nWe depend on reimbursements by third party payors, as well as payments by individuals, which could lead to delays and uncertainties in the reimbursement process.\nWe receive a substantial portion of our payments for health care services on a fee for service basis from third party payors, including Medicare and Medicaid, private insurers and managed care organizations. We estimate that we have received approximately 93.3%, 93.0% and 92.3% of our net revenues from such third party payors during 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We estimate that such amounts included approximately 30.5%, 30.3% and 29.4% from Medicare in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively, 14.8%, and 14.2% and 12.8% from Medicaid programs in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively. In addition, we estimate net revenues from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (\u201cVA\u201d) were 8.8%, 8.9% and 8.7% in 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.\nThe reimbursement process is complex and can involve lengthy delays. Third party payors continue their efforts to control expenditures for health care, including proposals to revise reimbursement policies. While we recognize revenue when health care services are provided, there can be delays before we receive payment. In addition, third party payors may disallow, in whole or in part, requests for reimbursement based on determinations that certain amounts are not reimbursable under plan coverage, that services provided were not medically necessary or that additional supporting documentation is necessary. Retroactive adjustments may change amounts realized from third party payors. Third party payors may require pre-authorizations for certain services and/or devices, which may result in a delay in our ability to provide services or to provide services at all. Additionally, we may see an increase in bundled payment models, which can result in delays before we receive payment or no payment at all for certain services.\nChanges in government reimbursement levels and policies such as those described above may also contribute to uncertainties surrounding the reimbursement process. We are subject to governmental audits of our reimbursement claims under Medicare, Medicaid, the VA and other governmental programs and may be required to repay these agencies if found that we were incorrectly reimbursed. Delays and uncertainties in the reimbursement process may adversely affect accounts receivable, increase the overall costs of collection and cause us to incur additional borrowing costs.\nWe also may not be paid with respect to co-payments and deductibles that are the patient\u2019s financial responsibility. Many of the plans offered on the state health insurance exchanges have high deductibles and require coinsurance that patients cannot afford to pay. Amounts not covered by third party payors are the obligations of individual patients from whom we may not receive whole or partial payment. We also may not receive whole or partial payments from uninsured and underinsured individuals. In such an event, our earnings and cash flow would be adversely affected, potentially affecting our ability to maintain our restrictive debt covenant ratios and meet our financial obligations.\nAdditionally, employer based plans and other individual plans are increasingly relying on \u201chigh deductible\u201d plan designs. As their participation in health plans with these high deductible designs increases, our patients will face greater financial burdens and participatory costs that may affect their decisions regarding the timing of their replacement of their devices. Due to cost considerations, they may seek to repair or refurbish their existing devices and delay the purchase of new replacement devices, which will adversely affect our revenues and our profitability.\nThe risks associated with third party payors, co-payments and deductibles and the inability to monitor and manage accounts receivable successfully could still have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of\noperations. Furthermore, our collection policies or our provisions for allowances for Medicare, Medicaid and contractual discounts and doubtful accounts receivable may not be adequate.\nDue to constraints in the growth of our rates of reimbursement, we may face cost pressures that adversely affect our profitability.\nDue to increased pressures on governmental and commercial payors to seek ways of reducing the costs of care, those payors have and may continue to seek ways to reduce growth in the rate of our reimbursement for the services we provide. This constraint in the rate of growth in reimbursement may adversely affect our profitability as we experience increases in the wages, materials and other costs necessary to the conduct of our business. These cost increases may adversely affect our profitability and our profit margins.\nGiven the complexities and demands related to reimbursement, we may fail to adequately provide the staffing and systems necessary to ensure we effectively manage our reimbursement processes.\nThe nature of our business requires that we are effective in the assessment of patient eligibility, the process of pre-authorization, the recordation and collection of provider documentation, the timely and complete submission of claims for reimbursement, the application of cash receipts to patient accounts, the timely response to payor denials and the conduct of collection activities. If we fail to provide adequate or qualified staffing, we could incur reductions in the amount of reimbursement we receive for the O&P services that we provide.\nWe face periodic reviews, audits and investigations under our contracts with federal and state government agencies, and these audits could have adverse findings that may negatively impact our business.\nWe contract with various federal and state governmental agencies to provide O&P services. Pursuant to these contracts, we are subject to various governmental reviews, audits and investigations to verify our compliance with the contracts and applicable laws and regulations. Any adverse review, audit or investigation could result in:\n\u00b7 refunding of amounts we have been paid pursuant to our government contracts;\n\u00b7 imposition of fines, penalties and other sanctions on us;\n\u00b7 loss of our right to participate in various federal programs;\n\u00b7 damage to our reputation in various markets; or\n\u00b7 material and/or adverse effects on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn recent years we have seen a significant increase in Medicare audits, including RAC audits, CERT audits and MAC prepayment audits. In addition, ZPICs are responsible for the identification of suspected fraud through medical record review. Medicare has also recently implemented the new TPE prepayment audit. We believe that Medicare audits, inquiries and investigations will continue to occur from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Medicare audits could have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations, particularly if we are unsuccessful at final adjudication.\nConsolidation of manufacturers within the O&P industry may adversely affect our business by increasing prices we pay for certain devices and components.\nWe depend on a limited number of manufacturers who supply us with certain key devices and components used in the prostheses we provide to our patients, particularly with respect to high technology components. These manufacturers are subject to a consolidation trend within the O&P industry. To the extent this trend continues, consolidation amongst certain manufacturers could result in a sole or limited source for certain high technology devices and components used in the devices we provide to patients. Any such consolidation could require us to pay increased prices for such devices and components, which could significantly reduce our gross margin and profitability and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to numerous federal, state and local governmental regulations, noncompliance with which could result in significant penalties that could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nA failure by us to comply with the numerous federal, state and/or local health care and other governmental regulations to which we are subject, including the regulations discussed under \u201cGovernment Regulation\u201d in Item 1. \u201cBusiness\u201d above, could result in significant penalties and adverse consequences, including exclusion from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWithin our Products & Services segment, we provide certain equipment and consultative services to SNFs, who, due to reimbursement pressures, may choose to discontinue our services or seek alternative arrangements for the provision of this equipment.\nApproximately $57.4 million of our net revenue in 2016 related to recurring revenues derived from providing therapeutic equipment and related consultative services to SNFs. SNFs have been experiencing reimbursement pressures which could adversely impact our business with them. To reduce costs, these facilities could choose to forgo our services, or seek alternative arrangements for the provision of the equipment we provide them, thereby reducing our revenue, earnings and could adversely impact the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets.\nCompleting the implementation of NextGen, our comprehensive clinic management system, could interfere with our patient care clinic operations and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on our IT infrastructure to achieve our business objectives. Beginning in late 2013, we commenced the roll-out of a new patient management and electronic health record system in our patient care clinics. In the third quarter of 2014, we halted the roll-out due to the negative impact the roll-out had on revenue cycle management. We have revised, updated and reduced the amount of customizations made to the system, which we now refer to as NextGen. We have also substantially improved our revenue cycle management function, and are currently in the process of completing the roll-out of NextGen, and anticipate the roll-out to continue through the first half of 2019. Any disruptions, delays or complications in the implementation process, or any deficiencies in the design, operation or expected performance of the NextGen system, could result in higher than expected implementation costs, the diversion of management\u2019s and other employees\u2019 attention from the day-to-day operations of our patient care clinics, including scheduling patient visits, and other disruptions to our patient care business. Any of these consequences could have an adverse impact on our revenue or costs, billing and related accounts receivable collections, all of which impacts cash flow and could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nTo address our business needs and weaknesses in financial controls, we will likely be required to upgrade certain of our operational and financial systems in future years. If we fail in the selection or implementation of such systems, or fail to maintain our existing systems, our business and financial results could be adversely affected.\nWe are highly dependent on our ability to procure materials and componentry, manage our inventories, support our patient encounters and to otherwise support the administrative requirements associated with our human resource, financial and other needs. We may not have sufficient financial capacity to implement such systems, or may fail in our selection and implementation of such systems. The failure to implement systems in a timely manner may adversely affect our ability to establish an effective control environment. If we are delayed in the implementation of systems, and existing systems are not adequately maintained, we could experience adverse interruptions in our ability to operate, or experience excessive costs associated with the remediation of consequential systems issues. Additionally, our failure to correctly select and implement systems could cause operational disruptions, delays, duplicative operating costs or other financial burdens which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nOur products and services face the risk of technological obsolescence, which, if realized, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe medical device industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological change. There can be no assurance that third parties will not succeed in developing and marketing technologies, products or services that are more effective than ours or that would render our products and services obsolete or noncompetitive. Additionally, new surgical procedures and medications could be developed for diabetes, trauma associated with accidents or physical injury, tumors, infection or musculoskeletal disorders of the back, extremities or joints that would replace or reduce the importance of our prosthetic and orthotic products and services. Accordingly, our success will depend upon our ability to respond to future medical and technological changes that may impact the demand for our prosthetic and orthotic products and services.\nOur failure to economically procure necessary components and to conduct timely and effective inventories of the materials and components we use in our business could result in an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business involves the use of materials and componentry we acquire from third party manufacturers. If manufacturers critical to our business substantially increase the cost of the components they sell to us, then our inability to acquire the necessary materials and components on a cost effective basis may adversely affect revenues and earnings. Additionally, to successfully perform our business, it is necessary that we conduct timely and thorough inventories of our raw materials and Work in Process (\u201cWIP\u201d). The conduct of these inventories are costly and time consuming. If we encounter issues in their conduct, given that our clinicians oversee the inventory processes which occur in our clinic locations, remedial procedures can disrupt our ability to see and treat patients, and thereby adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nOur common stock was delisted from the NYSE and moved to the OTC, affecting the trading of our common stock and reputation.\nOur common stock was delisted from the NYSE in February 2016 as a result of our failure to file our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014 within the extended compliance period required by the NYSE. After the delisting, our common stock began trading on the OTC. There can be no assurance whether or when our common stock will be relisted for trading on the NYSE or another national securities exchange. Our shareholders may continue to face material adverse consequences as a result of our trading on the OTC rather than a national securities exchange, including, but not limited to, a decrease in the price of our common stock, increased volatility, decreased trading activity or liquidity, a lack of analyst research and a further decline in institutional holders whose charters do not allow them to hold securities in unlisted companies. In addition, the delisting from the NYSE may have had and may continue to have a negative impact on our reputation and, as a consequence, our business and the price of our common stock.\nIf we are unable to retain our senior management and key employees, then our business and results of operations and financial position could be harmed.\nOur ability to maintain our competitive position is largely dependent on the services of our senior management, clinicians and other key employees. Although we have employment agreements with our senior management, these agreements do not prevent those individuals from ceasing their employment with us at any time. Additionally, adverse publicity and increased demands associated with the Restatement and associated litigation and regulatory investigations could increase our key employee retention risks. If we are unable to retain existing senior management, clinicians and other key employees, or to attract other such qualified employees on terms satisfactory to us, then our business could be adversely affected.\nOur non-compete agreements and other restrictive covenants involving clinicians may not be enforceable.\nWe have contracts with clinicians in many states. Some of these contracts include provisions preventing these clinicians from competing with us both during and after the term of our relationship with them. The law governing non-compete agreements and other forms of restrictive covenants varies from state to state. Some states are reluctant to strictly enforce non-compete agreements and restrictive covenants applicable to health care providers. There can be no assurance that our non-compete agreements related to affiliated clinicians will not be successfully challenged as unenforceable in certain states. In such event, we would be unable to prevent former affiliated clinicians from competing with us, potentially resulting in the loss of some of our patients, reducing our revenues and earnings.\nCyber-attacks, system security risks, data breaches and other technology failures could adversely affect our ability to conduct business, our results of operations and our financial position.\nA technology failure could occur and potentially disrupt our business, damage our reputation and adversely affect our profitability. Our information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) systems are subject to the risk of computer viruses or other malicious codes, unauthorized access or cyber-attacks. The administrative and technical controls and other preventive actions that we take to reduce the risk of cyber incidents and protect our IT systems may be insufficient to prevent physical and electronic break-ins, cyber-attacks or other security breaches to our computer systems. In addition, disruptions or breaches could occur as a result of natural disasters, man-made disasters, epidemic/pandemic, industrial accident, blackout, criminal activity, technological changes or events, terrorism or other unanticipated events beyond our control. While we have insurance intended to provide coverage from certain losses related to such incidents and a variety of preventative security measures such as risk management, information protection, disaster recovery and business continuity plans, we cannot predict the method or\noutcome of every possible cyber incident or ensure that we have protected ourselves against every possible cyber threat in light of the varied and increasingly complex breaches faced by companies on a regular basis. Unanticipated problems with our systems or recovery plans could have a material adverse impact on our ability to conduct business, our results of operations and our financial position.\nA cybersecurity incident could cause a violation of HIPAA and other privacy laws and regulations or result in a loss of confidential data.\nA cyber-attack that bypasses our IT security systems causing an IT security breach, loss of protected health information or other data subject to privacy laws, loss of proprietary business information, or a material disruption of our IT business systems, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, our future results of operations, as well as our reputation, could be adversely impacted by theft, destruction, loss, or misappropriation of protected health information, other confidential data or proprietary business information.\nInsurance coverage for some of our losses may be inadequate and may be subject to the credit risk of commercial insurance companies.\nSome of our insurance coverage is through various third-party insurers. To the extent we hold policies to cover certain groups of claims or rely on insurance coverage obtained by third parties to cover such claims, but either we or such third parties did not obtain sufficient insurance limits, did not buy an extended reporting period policy, where applicable, or the issuing insurance company is unable or unwilling to pay such claims, we may be responsible for those losses. Furthermore, for our losses that are insured or reinsured through commercial insurance companies, we are subject to the \u201ccredit risk\u201d of those insurance companies. While we believe our commercial insurance company providers currently are creditworthy, there can be no assurance that such insurance companies will remain so in the future.\nWe have made and may continue to make acquisitions, which could divert the attention of management and which may not be integrated successfully into our existing business. We may not find suitable acquisitions in the future, which could adversely affect our ability to penetrate new markets and achieve our growth objectives.\nIn past years we have pursued, and may continue to pursue, acquisitions to increase our market penetration, enter new geographic markets and expand the scope of services we provide. We cannot assure that we will identify suitable acquisition candidates, acquisitions will be completed on acceptable terms or at all, our due diligence process will uncover all potential liabilities or issues affecting our integration process, we will not incur breakup, termination or similar fees and expenses, or we will be able to integrate successfully the operations of any acquired business. Furthermore, acquisitions in new geographic markets and services may require us to comply with new and unfamiliar legal and regulatory requirements, which could impose substantial obligations on us and our management, cause us to expend additional time and resources and increase our exposure to penalties or fines for noncompliance with such requirements. The acquisitions could be of significant size and involve operations in multiple jurisdictions. The acquisition and integration of another business could divert management attention from other business activities. This diversion, together with other difficulties we may incur in integrating an acquired business, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we may incur debt to finance acquisitions. Such borrowings may not be available on terms as favorable to us as our current borrowing terms and may increase our leverage.\nIn order to remain competitive, we are required to make capital expenditures relating to our leaseholds and our equipment.\nA substantial portion of our capital expenditure requirements relate to maintaining and upgrading the appearance and function of our patient care clinic and satellite locations. If we do not maintain our facilities, their relative appearance to that of our competitors could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain patients. In addition, changing competitive conditions or the emergence of any significant advances in O&P technology could require us to invest significant capital in additional equipment or capacity in order to remain competitive. If we are unable to fund any such investment or otherwise fail to invest in such items, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights that are material to our business or to defend successfully against intellectual property infringement claims by third parties.\nOur ability to compete effectively depends in part upon our intellectual property rights, including but not limited to our trademarks and copyrights, and our proprietary technology. Our use of contractual provisions, confidentiality procedures and agreements, and trademark, copyright, unfair competition, trade secret and other laws to protect our intellectual property rights and proprietary technology may not be adequate. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and protect our proprietary technology, or to defend against claims by third parties that the conduct of our businesses or our use of intellectual property infringes upon such third-party\u2019s intellectual property rights. Any intellectual property litigation or claims brought against us, whether or not meritorious, could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources, and there can be no assurances that favorable final outcomes will be obtained in all cases. The terms of any settlement or judgment may require us to pay substantial amounts to the other party or cease exercising our rights in such intellectual property, including ceasing the use of certain trademarks used by us to distinguish our services from those of others or ceasing the exercise of our rights in copyrightable works. In addition, we may have to seek a license to continue practices found to be in violation of a third-party\u2019s rights, which may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected as a result.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly. Among the factors that could affect our stock price are:\n\u00b7 industry or general market conditions;\n\u00b7 domestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance;\n\u00b7 changes in our referral sources\u2019 or customers\u2019 preferences;\n\u00b7 new regulatory pronouncements and changes in regulatory guidelines;\n\u00b7 lawsuits, enforcement actions and other claims by third parties or governmental authorities;\n\u00b7 actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly operating results;\n\u00b7 changes in securities analysts\u2019 estimates of our financial performance or lack of research and reports by industry analysts;\n\u00b7 action by institutional shareholders or other large shareholders, including future sales of our common stock;\n\u00b7 speculation in the press or investment community;\n\u00b7 investor perception of us and our industry;\n\u00b7 changes in market valuations or earnings of similar companies;\n\u00b7 announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions or strategic partnerships;\n\u00b7 any future sales of our common stock or other securities;\n\u00b7 additions or departures of key personnel; and\n\u00b7 ability to get current and file future filings timely.\nThe stock markets have experienced extreme volatility in recent years that has been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. In the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, class action litigation has often been instituted against such company. Any litigation of this type brought against us could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which would harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish misleading or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will depend in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business, especially after our stock is no longer traded on the OTC and is once again traded on a national securities exchange. If one or more analysts downgrade our stock or publishes misleading or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock and, consequently, your ability to achieve a return on your investment will depend on appreciation in the price of our common stock.\nWe do not intend to declare and pay dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. We currently intend to invest our future earnings, if any, to fund our growth, to develop our business, and to potentially fund future share repurchases. Therefore, you are not likely to receive any dividends on your common stock for the foreseeable future, and the success of an investment in shares of our common stock will depend upon any future appreciation in their value. There is no guarantee that shares of our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which shareholders have purchased their shares.\nDisruptions in our disaster recovery systems, management continuity planning or information systems could limit our ability to operate our business effectively, or adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur IT systems facilitate our ability to conduct our business. While we have disaster recovery systems and business continuity plans in place, any disruptions in our disaster recovery systems or the failure of these systems to operate as expected could, depending on the magnitude of the problem, adversely affect our operating results by limiting our capacity to effectively monitor and control our operations. Despite our implementation of a variety of security measures, our technology systems could be subject to physical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering. In addition, in the event that a significant number of our management personnel were unavailable in the event of a disaster, our ability to effectively conduct business could be adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 10051, "SIC": 8093, "TIC": "HNGR"}
