{"cik": "1549848", "company": "Hi-Crush Partners LP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-02-20", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nThere are many factors that may affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and investments in us. Security holders and potential investors in our securities should carefully consider the risk factors set forth below, as well as the discussion of other factors that could affect us or investments in us included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If one or more of these risks were to materialize, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. These known material risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in any written or oral forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf.\nRisks Inherent in Our Business\nOur business and financial performance depends on well completion activity in the oil and natural gas industry.\nDemand for frac sand is materially dependent on the levels of activity in oil and natural gas exploration, development and production, and more specifically, the number of oil and natural gas wells completed in geological formations where proppants are used in hydraulic fracturing treatments and the amount of frac sand customarily used in the completion of such wells.\nIndustry conditions that impact the activity levels of oil and natural gas producers are influenced by numerous factors over which we have no control, including:\n\u2022\ncommodity prices;\n\u2022\nthe cost of producing and delivering oil and natural gas;\n\u2022\nworldwide political, military, and economic conditions;\n\u2022\ngovernmental regulations, including the policies of governments regarding the exploration for and production and development of their oil and natural gas reserves;\n\u2022\nglobal weather conditions and natural disasters;\n\u2022\ndevelopment of alternative energy sources; and\n\u2022\nstockholder activism or activities by non-governmental organizations to restrict the exploration, development and production of oil and natural gas.\nA prolonged reduction in oil and natural gas prices would generally depress the level of oil and natural gas exploration, development, production and well completion activity, which could result in a corresponding decline in the demand for the frac sand we produce and deliver. In addition, any future decreases in the rate at which oil and natural gas reserves are developed, whether due to increased governmental regulation, limitations on exploration and production activity or other factors, could have a material adverse effect on our business, even in a stronger oil and natural gas price environment. If there is a decrease in the demand for frac sand, we may be unable to sell or deliver volumes, or be forced to reduce our sales prices, any of which would reduce the amount of cash we generate.\nOur operations are subject to operating risks that are often beyond our control and could adversely affect production levels and costs, and such risks may not be covered by insurance.\nOur operations are subject to risks normally encountered in the commercial silica industry, some of which are beyond our control including the following:\n\u2022\nthe volume of frac sand we are able to buy and sell;\n\u2022\nthe price at which we are able to buy and sell frac sand;\n\u2022\ndemand and pricing for our integrated logistics solutions;\n\u2022\nthe pace of adoption of our integrated logistics solutions;\n\u2022\nthe amount of frac sand we are able to timely deliver at the wellsite, which could be adversely affected by, among other things, logistics constraints, weather, or other delays at the wellsite or transloading facility;\n\u2022\nchanges in prevailing economic conditions, including the extent of changes in crude oil, natural gas and other commodity prices;\n\u2022\nthe amount of frac sand we are able to excavate and process, which could be adversely affected by, among other things, operating difficulties, cave-ins, pit wall failures, rock falls and unusual or unfavorable geologic conditions;\n\u2022\nchanges in the price and availability of natural gas or electricity;\n\u2022\ninability to obtain necessary equipment or replacement parts;\n\u2022\nchanges in the railroad infrastructure, price, capacity and availability, including the potential for rail line disruptions;\n\u2022\nchanges in the road infrastructure, including the potential for trucking and other transportation disruptions;\n\u2022\nchanges in the price and availability of transportation;\n\u2022\nextensive regulation of trucking services;\n\u2022\nvolatility of fuel prices;\n\u2022\navailability of or failure of our contractors, partners and service providers to provide services at the agreed-upon levels or times;\n\u2022\nfailure to maintain safe work sites at our facilities or by third parties at their work sites;\n\u2022\ninclement or hazardous weather conditions, including flooding, and the physical impacts of climate change;\n\u2022\nenvironmental hazards, such as leaks and spills as well as unauthorized discharges of fluids or other pollutants into the surface and subsurface environment;\n\u2022\nindustrial and transportation related accidents;\n\u2022\nfires, explosions or other accidents;\n\u2022\ndifficulty collecting receivables;\n\u2022\ninability of our customers to take delivery;\n\u2022\ndifficulty or inability in obtaining, maintaining and renewing permits, including environmental permits or other licenses and approvals such as mining or water rights;\n\u2022\nfacility shutdowns or restrictions in operations in response to environmental regulatory actions including but not limited to actions related to endangered species;\n\u2022\nsystemic design or engineering flaws in the equipment we use to provide logistics services;\n\u2022\nchanges in laws and regulations (or the interpretation or enforcement thereof) related to the mining and hydraulic fracturing industries, silica dust exposure or the environment;\n\u2022\nthe outcome of litigation, claims or assessments, including unasserted claims;\n\u2022\nchallenges to or infringement upon our intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nlabor disputes and disputes with our third-party contractors;\n\u2022\ninability to attract and retain key personnel;\n\u2022\ncyber security breaches of our systems and information technology;\n\u2022\nour ability to borrow funds and access capital markets;\n\u2022\nchanges in the foreign currency exchange rates in the countries that we conduct business; and\n\u2022\nchanges in the political environment of the geographical areas in which we and our customers operate.\nOur future performance will depend on our ability to succeed in competitive markets, and on our ability to appropriately react to potential fluctuations in the demand for and supply of frac sand.\nWe operate in a highly competitive market that is characterized by a small number of large, national companies and a larger number of small, regional or local companies in the production, distribution and logistics of frac sand. Competition in the industry is based on price, reliability of supply, transportation capabilities, product quality, performance and sand characteristics.\nWe compete with large, national companies such as U.S. Silica Holdings, Inc., Covia Holdings Corporation, and others. Our competitors may have greater financial and other resources than we do, may develop technology superior to ours or may have production and distribution facilities or last mile delivery solutions that are significantly advantaged over ours. Should the demand for hydraulic fracturing services decrease, prices in the frac sand market could materially decrease as competitors may sell frac sand at below market prices. In addition, E&P's and other providers of hydraulic fracturing services could compete directly with us, which may negatively impact pricing and demand for our frac sand and related services. Because the markets for our products and logistic services are typically local, we also compete with smaller regional or local companies. If demand for hydraulic fracturing services decreases and the supply of frac sand available in the market increases, prices in the frac sand market could continue to materially decrease Furthermore, our competitors may choose to consolidate, which could provide them with greater financial and other resources than us. We may not be able to compete successfully against our competitors in the future, and competition could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may be adversely affected by decreased demand for raw frac sand due to the development of either effective alternative proppants or new processes to replace hydraulic fracturing.\nRaw frac sand is a proppant used in the completion and re-completion of oil and natural gas wells to stimulate and maintain oil and natural gas production through the process of hydraulic fracturing. Raw frac sand is the most commonly used proppant and is less expensive than other proppants, such as resin-coated sand and manufactured ceramics. A significant shift in demand from frac sand, including from the types of raw frac sand product that we produce and sell to other proppants, or the development of new processes to replace hydraulic fracturing altogether, could cause a decline in the demand for the frac sand we produce and result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe majority of our sales are generated under contracts with companies in the oil and natural gas industry. The loss of a contract or customer, a significant reduction in purchases by any customer, our customers' failure to comply with contract terms, or our inability to renegotiate, renew or replace our existing contracts on favorable terms could, individually or in the aggregate, adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs of January 1, 2019, we have contracted to sell raw frac sand under long-term supply agreements to customers with remaining terms ranging from 15 to 72 months. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we generated 87% of our revenues from sales of frac sand to customers with whom we had long-term contracts. A substantial portion of our logistics services are provided to customers with whom we have long-term agreements as defined in a MSA and related work orders. The MSA and related work orders are typically separate from any sand supply contract we may have with the same customer.\nSome of our customers have exited or could exit the business, or have been or could be acquired by other companies that purchase the same products and logistic services we provide from other third-party providers. Our current customers also may seek to acquire frac sand or logistic services from other providers that offer more competitive pricing or capture and develop their own sources of frac sand. The loss of a customer or contract, or a reduction in the amount of frac sand or logistic services purchased by any customer, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur customers may fail to comply with the terms of their existing contracts. Our enforcement of specific contract terms may be limited by market dynamics and other factors. A customer's failure to comply with contract terms or our limited enforcement thereof could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUpon the expiration of our current contracts, our customers may not continue to purchase the same levels of our frac sand or logistics services due to a variety of reasons. In addition, we may choose to renegotiate our existing contracts on less favorable terms or at reduced volumes in order to preserve relationships with our customers. Upon the expiration of our current contract terms, we may be unable to renew our existing contracts or enter into new contracts on terms favorable to us, or at all. Any renegotiation of our contracts on less favorable terms, or inability to enter into new contracts on economically acceptable terms upon the expiration of our current contracts, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur long-term contracts may preclude us from mitigating the effect of increased operational costs during the term of our long-term contracts, even though certain volumes under certain of our long-term contracts are subject to annual fixed price escalators or other pricing adjustment mechanisms.\nThe pricing arrangements under our long-term supply contracts we have may negatively impact our results of operations. If our operational costs increase during the terms of our long-term supply contracts, we may not be able to pass any of those increased costs to our customers. If we are unable to otherwise mitigate these increased operational costs, our net income and available cash for distributions could decline. Additionally, in periods with increasing prices, our sales may not keep pace with market prices.\nWe are subject to the credit risk of our customers, and any material nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe are subject to the risk of loss resulting from nonpayment or nonperformance by our customers, whose operations are concentrated in a single industry, the global oil and natural gas industry. In particular, as a result of volatility in oil and natural gas prices and ongoing uncertainty of the global economic environment our customers may not be able to fulfill their existing commitments or access financing necessary to fund their current or future obligations. Our credit procedures and policies may not be adequate to fully eliminate customer credit risk. If we fail to adequately assess the creditworthiness of existing or future customers or unanticipated deterioration in their creditworthiness, any resulting increase in nonpayment or nonperformance by them and our inability to re-market or otherwise sell the volumes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have outstanding Senior Notes and have entered into an ABL Credit Facility which contain restrictions that may restrict our business and financing activities.\nOur Senior Notes and ABL Credit Facility place financial restrictions and operating restrictions on our business, which may limit our flexibility to respond to opportunities and may harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe operating and financial restrictions and covenants in our Senior Notes and ABL Credit Facility restrict, and any other future financing agreements that we may enter into could restrict, our ability to finance future operations or capital needs, to engage in, expand or pursue our business activities or to make distributions to our unitholders. Additionally, our Senior Notes and ABL Credit Facility restrict our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\nincur liens on property;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments;\n\u2022\nenter into a merger, consolidate or acquire capital in or assets of other entities;\n\u2022\nsell assets;\n\u2022\nmake restricted payments; and\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates.\nOur compliance with these provisions may materially adversely affect our ability to react to changes in market conditions, take advantage of business opportunities we believe to be desirable, obtain future financing, fund needed capital expenditures, finance acquisitions, equipment purchases and development expenditures, or withstand a future downturn in our business.\nOur ability to comply with any such restrictions and covenants is uncertain and will be affected by the levels of cash flow from our operations and events or circumstances beyond our control. If market or other economic conditions deteriorate, our ability to comply with these restrictions or covenants may be impaired. If we violate any of the restrictions or covenants in the Senior Notes or ABL Credit Facility, a significant portion of our indebtedness may become immediately due and payable and our lenders\u2019 commitment to make further loans to us may terminate. We may not have, or be able to obtain, sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments. Even if we could obtain alternative financing, that financing may not be on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us. If we are unable to repay amounts borrowed, the holders of the debt could initiate a bankruptcy proceeding or liquidation proceeding against the collateral. In addition, our obligations under our Senior Notes or ABL Credit Facility are secured by substantially all of our assets and if we are unable to repay our indebtedness as required under these facilities, the lenders could seek to foreclose on our assets.\nOur long-term Senior Notes debt is currently rated by Moody's Investors Service Inc. (\"Moody's\") and Standard and Poor\u2019s (\"S&P\"). As of February 14, 2019, the credit rating of the Partnership\u2019s Senior Notes was B3 from Moody\u2019s and B- from Standard and Poor\u2019s. Any future downgrades in our credit ratings could negatively impact the cost of raising capital, and a downgrade could also adversely affect our ability to effectively execute aspects of our strategy and to access capital in the public markets.\nIncreases in interest rates could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nWe have exposure to increases in interest rates under our ABL Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2018, we had no borrowings outstanding under our ABL Credit Facility. To the extent there are any outstanding borrowings under the ABL Credit Facility, changes in applicable interest rates would not affect the ABL Credit Facility\u2019s fair market value, but could adversely affect our future results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, the ABL Credit Facility uses LIBOR as a benchmark for establishing the interest rate. LIBOR is the subject of recent proposals for reform. In July 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. LIBOR may disappear entirely or may perform differently than in the past. The consequences with respect to LIBOR cannot be predicted but could result in an increase in the cost of our variable interest rate under the ABL Credit Facility.\nWe may be required to make substantial capital expenditures to maintain, develop and increase our asset base. The inability to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms, or at all, could have an adverse effect on our growth and profitability.\nAlthough we have used a significant amount of our cash reserves and cash generated from our operations to fund the development and expansion of our asset base, we may depend on the availability of credit to fund future capital expenditures. Our ability to obtain bank financing or to access the capital markets for future equity or debt offerings may be limited by our financial condition at the time of any such financing or offering, the restrictions and covenants contained in our Senior Notes, ABL Credit Facility or other future debt agreements, adverse market conditions or other contingencies and uncertainties that are beyond our control. Our failure to obtain the funds necessary to maintain, develop and increase our asset base could adversely impact our growth and profitability.\nEven if we are able to obtain financing or access the capital markets, incurring additional debt may significantly increase our interest expense and financial leverage, and our level of indebtedness could restrict our ability to fund future development and acquisition activities. In addition, the issuance of additional equity interests may result in dilution to our existing unitholders.\nOur expansion or modification of existing assets, or the construction of new assets, may not result in revenue increases and may be subject to regulatory, environmental, political, legal and economic risks, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe construction of new facilities, additions or modifications to our existing facilities, or equipment may require the expenditure of significant amounts of capital. If we undertake these projects, they may not be completed on schedule or at the budgeted cost or at all. Moreover, upon the expenditure of future funds on a particular project, our revenues may not increase immediately, or as anticipated, or at all. For instance, we may construct new facilities over an extended period of time and will not receive any material increases in revenues until the projects are completed. Moreover, we may expend capital to capture anticipated future growth in a location in which such growth does not materialize. Since we are not engaged in the hydraulic fracturing process, we may be unable to accurately predict the extent of well completion activity to take place in future periods. To the extent we rely on estimates of future levels of well completion activity in any decision to construct facilities, such estimates may prove to be inaccurate because there are numerous uncertainties inherent in forecasting levels of well completion activity. In addition, our assets may be subject to numerous regulatory, environmental, political and legal uncertainties which could negatively impact our ability to capture anticipated economic benefits. Our expansion or modification of existing or new assets may not be able to attract enough throughput to achieve our expected investment return, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nAny adverse developments at our production facilities could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAny adverse development at our production facilities due to catastrophic events or weather, or any other event that would cause us to curtail, suspend or terminate operations at the production facilities, could result in us being unable to meet our contracted sand deliveries to our customers. If we are unable to deliver contracted volumes within the required time frame, or otherwise arrange for delivery from a third party, we could be required to pay make-whole payments to our customers that could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. If we are unable to provide supply from our production facilities, any reduction in the amount of frac sand available for our purchase from third parties could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nInaccuracies in estimates of volumes and qualities of our sand reserves could result in lower than expected sales and higher than expected production costs.\nJohn T. Boyd, our independent reserve engineers, prepared estimates of our reserves based on engineering, economic and geological data assembled and analyzed by our engineers and geologists. However, frac sand reserve estimates are by nature imprecise and depend to some extent on statistical inferences drawn from available data, which may prove unreliable. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities and qualities of reserves and non-reserve frac sand deposits and costs to mine recoverable reserves, including many factors beyond our control. Estimates of economically recoverable frac sand reserves necessarily depend on a number of factors and assumptions, all of which may vary considerably from actual results, such as:\n\u2022\ngeological and mining conditions and/or effects from prior mining that may not be fully identified by available data or that may differ from experience;\n\u2022\nassumptions concerning future prices of frac sand, operating costs, mining technology improvements, development costs and reclamation costs; and\n\u2022\nassumptions concerning future effects of regulation, including the issuance of required permits and taxes by governmental agencies.\nAny inaccuracy in John T. Boyd\u2019s estimates related to our frac sand reserves and non-reserve frac sand deposits could result in lower than expected sales and higher than expected costs. For example, John T. Boyd\u2019s estimates of our proven reserves assume that our revenue and cost structure will remain relatively constant over the life of our reserves. If these assumptions prove to be inaccurate, some or all of our reserves may not be economically mineable, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows. In addition, we pay a fixed price per ton of sand excavated regardless of the quality of the frac sand, and our current customer contracts require us to deliver frac sand that meets certain specifications. If John T. Boyd\u2019s estimates of the quality of our reserves, including the volumes of the various specifications of those reserves, prove to be inaccurate, we may incur significantly higher excavation costs without corresponding increases in revenues, we may not be able to meet our contractual obligations, or our facilities may have a shorter than expected reserve life, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nOur operations are dependent on our rights and ability to mine our properties and on our having received or renewed the required permits and approvals from governmental authorities and other third parties.\nWe hold numerous governmental, environmental, mining, and other permits, water rights, and approvals authorizing operations at our production facilities in Wisconsin and Texas as well as our terminal facilities. For our extraction and processing, the permitting process is subject to federal, state and local authority. For example, on the federal level, a Mine Identification Request (MSHA Form 7000-51) must be filed and obtained before mining commences. If wetlands are implicated, a Corps Wetland Permit is required. At the state level, a series of permits and approvals are required related to air quality, wetlands, water quality (waste water, stormwater), grading permits, endangered species, archaeological assessments, and high capacity wells in addition to others depending upon site-specific factors and operational detail. At the local level, zoning, building, stormwater, erosion control, wellhead protection, road usage and access, among other matters are all regulated and require permitting or approval to some degree. Additionally a non-metallic mining reclamation permit is required for our Wisconsin production facilities while an Aggregate Production Operations permit is required for our Texas production facilities. A decision by a governmental agency or other third party to deny or delay issuing a new or renewed permit or approval, or to revoke or substantially modify an existing permit or approval, whether for development of new facilities or expansion of existing facilities, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to continue operations.\nTitle to, and the area of, mineral properties and water rights may also be disputed. Mineral properties sometimes contain claims or transfer histories that examiners cannot verify. Legal challenges successfully claiming that we do not have title to our property or lack appropriate water rights could cause us to lose any rights to explore, develop, and extract minerals, without compensation for our prior expenditures relating to such property. Our business may suffer a material adverse effect in the event we have title deficiencies.\nIn some instances, we have received access rights or easements from third parties, which allow for a more efficient operation than would exist without the access or easement. A third party could take legal action to restrict or suspend the access or easement, and any such action could be materially adverse to our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nLaws and regulations relating to hydraulic fracturing could increase our costs of doing business and result in additional operating restrictions, delays or cancellations in completion of new oil and natural gas wells by our customers, which could cause a decline in the demand for our frac sand and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAlthough we do not directly engage in hydraulic fracturing activities, our customers purchase our frac sand for use in their hydraulic fracturing activities. Increased regulation of hydraulic fracturing may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. The federal Safe Drinking Water Act (\"SDWA\") regulates the underground injection of substances through the Underground Injection Control Program (\"UIC Program\"). Currently, with the exception of certain hydraulic fracturing activities involving the use of diesel, hydraulic fracturing is exempt from federal regulation under the UIC Program, and the hydraulic fracturing process is typically regulated by state or local governmental authorities. However, the practice of hydraulic fracturing has become a contentious subject, attracting considerable public attention and continues to undergo political and regulatory scrutiny. From time to time, Congress has considered legislation to provide for federal regulation of hydraulic fracturing under the SDWA and to require disclosure of the chemicals used in the hydraulic fracturing process but no comprehensive hydraulic fracturing legislation at the federal level has been implemented, to date.\nThere is also the potential for increased federal regulations governing various environmental aspects of hydraulic fracturing and the oil and natural gas production industry. In recent years, the EPA has finalized rules to limit air emissions from the hydraulic fracturing of certain oil and natural gas wells and to regulate other sources of air emissions from production operations. The EPA also finalized wastewater effluent guidelines for unconventional oil and natural gas operations. Likewise, the Bureau of Land Management (\"BLM\") finalized rules increasing compliance and disclosure obligations for hydraulic fracturing operations but those final rules were subsequently rescinded by the BLM and are currently the subject of pending litigation. Although the BLM rules have been rescinded or delayed, they are the subject of litigation that could result in the rules becoming effective. Further, the EPA, BLM, or other federal agencies could promulgate new, amended, or replacement rules for hydraulic fracturing and oil and natural gas operations.\nAs noted previously under Item 1, \"Business-Environmental and Occupational Safety and Health Regulation-Environmental Matters\", the RCRA and comparable state statutes regulate the generation, transportation, treatment, storage, disposal and clean-up of hazardous and, in some circumstances, non-hazardous wastes. From time to time various environmental groups have challenged the EPA\u2019s exclusion of certain oil and natural gas wastes from regulation as hazardous wastes under RCRA. For example, pursuant to a consent decree issued by a federal district court, the EPA is required to propose by no later than March 15, 2019 a rulemaking for revision of certain RCRA Subtitle D regulations that could result in such oil and natural gas wastes being regulated as hazardous wastes, or sign a determination that revision of those RCRA regulations is unnecessary. A loss of the RCRA exclusion for drilling fluids, produced waters and related wastes, if EPA were to eliminate the exclusion, could increase our costs to manage and dispose of the wastes we generate as well as increase our customers\u2019 waste management costs, which could result in a decrease of those customers' drilling activity, either of which developments could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial performance.\nIn addition to federal laws and regulations, various state and local governments have implemented, or are considering, increased regulatory oversight of hydraulic fracturing through additional permitting requirements, operational restrictions, disclosure requirements, and temporary or permanent bans on hydraulic fracturing in certain areas such as environmentally sensitive watersheds. Local governments also may seek to adopt ordinances to regulate or severely restrict the time, place and manner of hydraulic fracturing activities within their jurisdictions. Moreover, non-governmental organizations may seek to restrict hydraulic fracturing, such as was the case in Colorado where certain interest groups therein have unsuccessfully pursued ballot initiatives in recent general election cycles that, had they been successful, would have revised the state constitution or state statutes in a manner that would have made exploration and production activities in the state more difficult or expensive in the future, including, for example, by increasing mandatory setbacks of oil and natural gas operations from certain occupied structures and environmentally-sensitive or recreational areas.\nThe adoption of new or more stringent laws or regulations at the federal, state and local levels imposing reporting obligations on, or otherwise limiting or delaying, the hydraulic fracturing process could make it more difficult to complete oil and natural gas wells, increase our customers\u2019 costs of compliance and doing business, and otherwise adversely affect the hydraulic oil and natural gas fracturing services they perform, which could negatively impact demand for our frac sand. In addition, heightened political, regulatory, and public scrutiny of hydraulic fracturing practices could expose us or our customers to increased legal and regulatory proceedings, which could be time-consuming, costly, or result in substantial legal liability or significant reputational harm. We could be directly affected by adverse litigation involving us, or indirectly affected if the cost of compliance limits the ability of our customers to operate. Such costs and scrutiny could directly or indirectly, through reduced demand for our frac sand, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA facility closure or long-term idling entails substantial costs, and if we close our production facilities sooner than anticipated, our results of operations may be adversely affected.\nThe Augusta facility was temporarily idled from October 2015 until production resumed in September 2016 and the Whitehall facility was temporarily idled during the second quarter of 2016 and resumed production in March 2017. In September 2018, the Partnership temporarily idled dry plant operations at the Whitehall facility. In January 2019, the Partnership resumed operations at the Whitehall facility and temporarily idled the Augusta facility.\nIf we idle our production facilities for a long period of time or close a facility sooner than expected, sales will decline unless we are able to acquire and develop additional facilities, which may not be possible. The closure of a production facility would involve significant fixed closure costs, including accelerated employment legacy costs, severance-related obligations, reclamation and other environmental costs and the costs of terminating long-term obligations, including energy contracts and equipment leases. We accrue for the costs of reclaiming open pits, stockpiles, non-saleable sand, ponds, roads and other mining support areas over the estimated mining life of our property. We base our assumptions regarding the life of our production facilities on detailed studies that we perform from time to time, but our studies and assumptions may not prove to be accurate. If we were to reduce the estimated life of our production facilities, the fixed facility closure costs would be applied to a shorter period of production, which would increase production costs per ton produced and could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nApplicable statutes and regulations require that mining property be reclaimed following a mine closure in accordance with specified standards and an approved reclamation plan. The plan addresses matters such as removal of facilities and equipment, regrading, minimizing or preventing erosion and limiting the potential for sediment run-off into surface waters other forms of water pollution, re-vegetation and post-mining land use. We are required to post a surety bond or other form of financial assurance equal to the cost of reclamation as set forth in the approved reclamation plan. The establishment of the final mine closure reclamation liability is based on permit requirements and requires various estimates and assumptions, principally associated with reclamation costs and production levels. If our accruals for expected reclamation and other costs associated with facility closures for which we will be responsible were later determined to be insufficient, our business, results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected.\nGiven the nature of our frac sand mining and processing operations, we face a material risk of liability, delays and increased cash costs of production from environmental and industrial accidents as well as due to operational breakdowns.\nOur business involves significant risks and hazards, including environmental hazards, industrial accidents, and breakdowns of equipment and machinery. Our business is exposed to hazards associated with frac sand mining, processing and the related storage, handling and transportation of raw materials, products and wastes. Furthermore, during operational breakdowns, the relevant facility may not be fully operational within the anticipated timeframe, which could result in further business losses. The occurrence of any of these or other hazards could delay production, suspend operations, increase repair, maintenance or medical costs and, due to the integration of our facilities, could have an adverse effect on the productivity and profitability of a particular facility or on our business as a whole. Incidents of this nature have occurred in the past and may happen again in the future. We have insurance policies for industrial, environmental and other accidents, but such policies are limited by their terms and may not cover certain risks in their entirety or at all.\nOur production process consumes large amounts of natural gas and electricity. An increase in the price or a significant interruption in the supply of these or any other energy sources could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nEnergy costs, primarily natural gas and electricity, represented 2% of our total sales and 10% of our total production costs during the year ended December 31, 2018. Natural gas is the primary fuel source used for drying in the frac sand production process and, as such, our profitability is impacted by the price and availability of natural gas we purchase from third parties. Because we have not contracted for the provision of natural gas on a fixed-price basis, our costs and profitability will be impacted by fluctuations in prices for natural gas. The price and supply of natural gas are unpredictable and can fluctuate significantly based on international, political and economic circumstances, as well as other events outside our control, such as changes in supply and demand due to weather conditions, actions by OPEC and other oil and natural gas producers, regional production patterns and environmental concerns. In addition, potential climate change regulations or carbon or emissions taxes could result in higher production costs for energy, which may be passed on to us in whole or in part. The price of natural gas has been extremely volatile over the last several years. In order to manage this risk, we may hedge natural gas prices through the use of derivative financial instruments, such as forwards, swaps and futures. However, these measures carry risk (including nonperformance by counterparties) and do not in any event entirely eliminate the risk of decreased margins as a result of natural gas price increases. A significant increase in the price of energy that is not recovered through an increase in the price of our products or covered through hedging arrangements or an extended interruption in the supply of natural gas or electricity to our production facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\nSeasonal and severe weather conditions could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nOur business could be materially adversely affected by seasonal and severe weather conditions. Severe weather conditions may affect our customers\u2019 operations, thus reducing their need for our products or ability to take delivery of our product at the terminal or the wellsite, or impact our operations by resulting in weather-related damage to our facilities and equipment and impact our customers\u2019 ability to take delivery of our products at our plant site. Additionally, some scientists have concluded that increasing concentrations of GHGs in the atmosphere may produce climate changes that have significant physical effects, such as increased frequency and severity of storms, droughts, and floods and other climate events. Any weather-related interference with our operations could force us to delay or curtail services and potentially breach our contractual obligations to deliver minimum volumes or result in a loss of productivity and an increase in our operating costs.\nIn addition, severe winter weather conditions impact our Wisconsin operations by causing us to halt our excavation and wet plant related production activities during the winter months. During non-winter months, we excavate and process excess sand to build a sufficient washed sand stockpile that feeds the dry plant. Unexpected winter conditions (e.g., if winter conditions come earlier than expected or last longer than expected) may result in us not having a sufficient sand stockpile to supply feedstock for our dry plant during winter months, which could result in us being unable to meet our contracted sand deliveries during such time and lead to a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operation and reputation.\nOur cash flow fluctuates on a seasonal basis.\nOur cash flow is affected by a variety of factors, including weather conditions and seasonal periods. Seasonal fluctuations in weather impact the production levels at our wet processing plant and the level of completion activity in-basin. While our sales and finished product production levels are contracted annually and expected to be fulfilled evenly throughout the year, varying levels of wet plant production and in-basin demand can lead to cash flows fluctuating through the year. For example, our mining and wet sand processing activities at our Wisconsin facilities are limited to non-winter months and while the wet processing plant is not operating, we will perform annual maintenance activities, the majority of which are expensed. As a consequence of the seasonality we may experience lower cash costs and higher expense in the first and fourth quarter of each calendar year.\nDiminished access to water may adversely affect our operations.\nThe excavation and processing activities in which we engage require significant amounts of water, of which we seek to recycle a significant percentage in our operating process. As a result, securing water rights and water access to sufficient volumes of water is necessary for the operation of our processing facilities. If future excavation and processing activities are located in an area that is water-constrained, there may be additional costs associated with securing sufficient water access. We have obtained water rights that we currently use to service the activities on our properties, and we plan to obtain all required water rights to service other properties we may develop or acquire in the future. However, the amount of water that we are entitled to use pursuant to our water rights must be determined by the appropriate regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Such regulatory authorities may amend the regulations regarding such water rights, increase the cost of maintaining such water rights or eliminate our current water rights, and we may be unable to retain all or a portion of such water rights. These new regulations, which could also affect local municipalities and other industrial operations, could have a material adverse effect on our operating costs if implemented. Such changes in laws, regulations or government policy and related interpretations pertaining to water rights may alter the environment in which we do business, which may have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, one or more water discharge permits may be required to properly dispose of water, including wastewater and stormwater at our processing sites. The water discharge permitting process is also subject to regulatory discretion, and any inability or delay in obtaining the necessary permits could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to maintain effective quality control systems at our facilities and operations could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nThe performance and quality of our products and logistic services are critical to the success of our business. These factors depend significantly on the effectiveness of our quality control systems, which, in turn, depends on a number of factors, including the design of our quality control systems, our quality-training program and our ability to ensure that our employees adhere to our quality control policies and guidelines. Any significant failure or deterioration of our quality control systems or adherence to our training in implementing such systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation.\nIf we are unable to make acquisitions on economically acceptable terms or unable to successfully integrate the businesses we acquire, our future growth could be limited, and any acquisitions we make may reduce, rather than increase, our cash generated from operations on a per unit basis.\nA portion of our strategy to grow our business and return capital to unitholders is dependent on our ability to make acquisitions that result in an increase in our cash available for distribution per unit or unit repurchases. If we are unable to make acquisitions because we are unable to identify attractive acquisition candidates or negotiate acceptable acquisition agreements, we are unable to obtain financing for these acquisitions on economically acceptable terms or we are outbid by competitors, our future growth and ability to increase distributions may be limited. Furthermore, even if we do consummate acquisitions that we believe will be accretive, they may in fact result in a decrease in our cash available for distribution per unit or unit repurchases. Any acquisition involves potential risks, some of which are beyond our control, including, among other things:\n\u2022\ninaccurate assumptions about revenues and costs, including synergies;\n\u2022\ninability to successfully integrate the businesses we acquire;\n\u2022\ninability to hire, train or retain qualified personnel to manage and operate our business and newly acquired assets;\n\u2022\nthe assumption of unknown liabilities, including environmental liabilities;\n\u2022\nlimitations on rights to indemnity from the seller;\n\u2022\nmistaken assumptions about the overall costs of equity or debt;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u2022\nunforeseen difficulties operating in new product areas or new geographic areas; and\n\u2022\ncustomer or key employee losses at the acquired businesses.\nIf we consummate any future acquisitions, our capitalization and results of operations may change significantly, and unitholders will not have the opportunity to evaluate the economic, financial and other relevant information that we will consider in determining the application of these funds and other resources.\nOur business may suffer if we lose, or are unable to attract and retain, key personnel.\nWe depend to a large extent on the services of our senior management team and other key personnel. Members of our senior management and other key employees have extensive experience and expertise in the frac sand and logistics services business, as well as substantial experience and relationships with participants in the exploration and production and oilfield services industries. Competition for management and key personnel is intense, and the pool of qualified candidates is limited. The loss of any of these individuals or the failure to attract additional personnel, as needed, could have a material adverse effect on our operations and could lead to higher labor costs or the use of less-qualified personnel. In addition, if any of our executives or other key employees were to join a competitor or form a competing company, we could lose customers, suppliers, know-how and key personnel. Our success will be dependent on our ability to continue to attract, employ and retain highly skilled personnel.\nA shortage of skilled labor together with rising labor costs in the industry may further increase operating costs, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nEfficient sand production and delivery requires skilled laborers, preferably with several years of experience and proficiency in multiple tasks. Our operations also utilize third-party contractors. There may be a shortage of skilled labor required throughout our operations in various locations. If the shortage of experienced skilled labor continues or worsens, we may find it difficult to retain or replace third-party contractors, and we may be unable to retain, attract and hire or train the necessary number of skilled laborers to perform our own operations. In either event, there could be an adverse impact on our labor productivity and costs and our ability to conduct operations.\nWe do not own the land on which the majority of our terminal facilities are located, which could disrupt our operations.\nWe do not own the land on which the majority of our terminals are located and instead own leasehold interests and rights-of-way for the operation of these facilities. Upon expiration, termination or other lapse of our current leasehold terms, we may be unable to renew our existing leases or rights-of-way on terms favorable to us, or at all. Any renegotiation on less favorable terms or inability to enter into new leases on economically acceptable terms upon the expiration, termination or other lapse of our current leases or rights-of-way could cause us to cease operations on the affected land, increase costs related to continuing operations elsewhere and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFluctuations in transportation costs and the availability or reliability of rail transportation could reduce revenues by causing us to reduce our production or by impairing the ability of our customers to take delivery.\nTransportation costs represent a significant portion of the total delivered cost of frac sand for our customers and, as a result, the cost of transportation is a critical factor in a customer\u2019s purchasing decision. Disruption of transportation services due to shortages of rail cars or trucks, weather-related problems, flooding, drought, accidents, mechanical difficulties, strikes, lockouts, bottlenecks or other events could temporarily impair our ability to supply our customers through our logistics network of rail-based terminals, or our last mile operations or, if our customers are not using our transportation services, the ability of our customers to take delivery of frac sand. Accordingly, if there are disruptions of the rail transportation or trucking services utilized by ourselves or our customers, our business could be adversely affected.\nIncreases in the price of diesel fuel may adversely affect our results of operations.\nDiesel fuel costs and rail fuel surcharges generally fluctuate with increasing and decreasing world crude oil prices, and accordingly are subject to political, economic and market factors that are outside of our control. Our operations are dependent on earthmoving equipment, railcars and tractor trailers, and diesel fuel costs are a significant component of the operating expense of these vehicles. We contract with a third party to excavate raw frac sand, deliver the raw frac sand to our processing facility and move the sand from our wet plant to our dry plant, and pay a fixed price per ton of sand delivered to our wet plant, subject to a fuel surcharge based on the price of diesel fuel. Rail transportation and trucking rates are generally subject to varying fuel surcharges based on the price of diesel fuel. Accordingly, increased diesel fuel costs could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nWe face distribution and logistics challenges in our business.\nAs oil and natural gas prices fluctuate, our customers may shift their focus back and forth between different resource plays, some of which can be located in geographic areas that do not have well-developed transportation and distribution infrastructure systems. Transportation and logistics operating expenses comprise a significant portion of our total delivered cost of sales. Therefore, serving our customers in these less-developed areas presents distribution and other operational challenges that may affect our sales and negatively impact our operating costs. Disruptions in transportation services, including shortages of railcars or trucks, or a lack of developed infrastructure, could affect our ability to timely and cost effectively deliver to our customers and could provide a competitive advantage to competitors located in closer proximity to our customers. Additionally, increases in the price of transportation costs, including freight charges, fuel surcharges, terminal switch fees and demurrage costs, excess railcars or trucking rates could negatively impact operating costs if we are unable to pass those increased costs along to our customers. Failure to find long-term solutions to these logistics challenges could adversely affect our ability to respond quickly to the needs of our customers or result in additional increased costs, and thus could negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nThe amount of cash we have available for return of capital to holders of our units depends primarily on our cash flow and not solely on profitability, which may prevent us from making cash distributions during periods when we record net income.\nThe amount of cash we have available for distribution depends primarily upon our cash flow, including cash flow from reserves and working capital or other borrowings, and not solely on profitability, which will be affected by non-cash items. As a result, we may pay cash distributions during periods when we record net losses for financial accounting purposes and may not pay cash distributions during periods when we record net income.\nIn addition, the actual amount of cash we will have available for distribution will depend on other factors, some of which are beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nthe level of capital expenditures we make;\n\u2022\nour debt service requirements and other liabilities;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in our working capital needs;\n\u2022\nthe cost of acquisitions;\n\u2022\nthe amount of unit repurchases we make;\n\u2022\nour ability to borrow funds and access capital markets;\n\u2022\nrestrictions contained in debt agreements to which we are a party; and\n\u2022\nthe amount of cash reserves established by our general partner.\nOur operations are subject to operational hazards and unforeseen interruptions for which we may not be adequately insured.\nOur operations are exposed to potential natural disasters, including blizzards, tornadoes, storms, floods and earthquakes. If any of these events were to occur, we could incur substantial losses because of personal injury or loss of life, severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment, and pollution or other environmental damage resulting in curtailment or suspension of our operations.\nWe believe we carry adequate insurance, but we may not be fully insured against all risks incident to our business, including the risk of our operations being interrupted due to severe weather and natural disasters. Furthermore, we may be unable to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at reasonable rates. As a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain of our insurance policies could increase. In addition, sub-limits have been imposed for certain risks. In some instances, certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. If we were to incur a significant liability for which we are not fully insured, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash available for distribution to unitholders.\nA terrorist attack or armed conflict could harm our business.\nTerrorist activities, anti-terrorist efforts and other armed conflicts involving the United States could adversely affect the United States and global economies and could prevent us from meeting financial and other obligations. We could experience loss of business, delays or defaults in payments from payors or disruptions of fuel supplies and markets if pipelines, production facilities, processing plants or refineries are direct targets or indirect casualties of an act of terror or war. Additionally, destructive forms of protest and opposition by extremists and other disruptions, including acts of sabotage or eco-terrorism, against oil and natural gas development and production activities could potentially result in damage or injury to persons, property or the environment or lead to extended interruptions of our or our clients\u2019 operations. Such activities could reduce the overall demand for oil and natural gas, which, in turn, could also reduce the demand for our frac sand. Terrorist activities and the threat of potential terrorist activities and any resulting economic downturn could adversely affect our results of operations, impair our ability to raise capital or otherwise adversely impact our ability to realize certain business strategies.\nWe are subject to cyber security risks. A cyber incident could occur and result in information theft, data corruption, operational disruption and/or financial loss.\nThe oil and natural gas industry has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct certain processing activities. For example, we depend on digital technologies to perform many of our services and to process and record financial and operating data. In addition, in the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data, including our proprietary business information and personally identifiable information of our employees in our data centers and on our networks. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is important to our operations. At the same time, cyber incidents, including deliberate attacks, have increased. The U.S. government has issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of cyber security threats. Our technologies, systems and networks, and those of our vendors, suppliers and other business partners, may become the target of cyber attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of proprietary and other information, or other disruption of business operations. In addition, certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance, may remain undetected for an extended period. Our systems and insurance coverage for protecting against cyber security risks may not be sufficient. As cyber incidents continue to evolve, we will likely be required to expand additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any vulnerability to cyber incidents. The audit committee is responsible for cyber oversight.\nRisks Related to Environmental, Mining and Other Regulation\nWe and our customers are subject to extensive environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations that impose, and will continue to impose, significant costs and liabilities. In addition, future new or amended legal requirements, or more stringent interpretation or enforcement of existing requirements, could increase those costs and liabilities, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe are subject to extensive federal, state, and local environmental and occupational health and safety laws and regulations governing the mining and mineral processing industry, including among other things, those relating to health and safety aspects of our operations, environmental permitting and licensing, air emissions and water discharges, water pollution and soil and groundwater contamination, waste management, hazardous materials, land use, remediation, reclamation and restoration of properties, wildlife protection, and natural resources. These laws and regulations, and the permits implemented thereunder have had, and will continue to have, a significant effect on our business. Environmental laws may impose substantial penalties for noncompliance, and certain of these laws, such as CERCLA, may impose strict, retroactive, and joint and several liability for the removal or remediation of releases of hazardous substances or property contamination, regardless of whether we or third parties were responsible for such release and even if our conduct was lawful at the time it occurred. Additionally, we may incur liability associated with releases of materials into the environment or for injuries to persons or damages to properties and natural resources, and such liability may potentially impair our ability to conduct our operations. Future environmental laws and regulations could restrict our ability to expand our facilities or extract our mineral deposits or could require us to acquire costly equipment or to incur other significant expenses in connection with our business. Moreover, new laws and regulations, amendment of existing laws and regulations, reinterpretation of legal requirements or increased governmental enforcement that relate to environmental requirements and the costs associated with complying with such requirements, could have a material adverse effect on us.\nAny failure by us to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations may cause governmental authorities to take actions that could adversely impact our operations and financial condition, including:\n\u2022\nissuance of sanctions, including administrative, civil and criminal penalties;\n\u2022\ndenial, modification, or revocation of permits or other authorizations;\n\u2022\nimposition of injunctive obligations or other limitations on our operations, including cessation of operations; and\n\u2022\nrequirements to perform site investigatory, remedial, or other corrective actions.\nAny such regulations could require us to modify existing permits or obtain new permits, implement additional pollution control technology, curtail operations, increase significantly our operating costs, or impose additional operating restrictions among our customers that reduce demand for our products and services.\nWe may not be able to comply with any new or amended environmental or worker health and safety laws and regulations, and any such new or amended laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results by requiring us to modify our operations or equipment or shut down our facilities. Additionally, our customers may not be able to comply with new or amended environmental or worker health and safety laws and regulations, which could cause our customers to curtail or cease their operations that could significantly reduce the need for our products and services. We cannot at this time reasonably estimate our costs of compliance or the timing of any costs associated with any new or amended environmental or worker health and safety laws and regulations, or any material adverse effect that any such standards will have on our customers and, consequently, on our operations.\nSilica-related legislation, health issues and litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation or results of operations.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations relating to human exposure to crystalline silica. Several federal and state regulatory authorities, including MSHA and OSHA, may continue to propose and implement changes in their regulations regarding workplace exposure to crystalline silica, such as permissible exposure limits and required controls and personal protective equipment. For example, in 2016, OSHA published a final rule that established a more stringent permissible exposure limit for exposure to respirable crystalline silica and provided other provisions to protect employees, such as requirements for exposure assessments, methods for controlling exposure, respiratory protection, medical surveillance, hazard communication, and recording. Compliance with most aspects of the 2016 rule relating to hydraulic fracturing was required by June 2018, and the 2016 rule further requires compliance with engineering control obligations to limit exposures to respirable crystalline silica in connection with hydraulic fracturing activities by June 2021. While compliance with the requirements of the 2016 rule may result in significant operating costs or capital expenditures, we do not expect such compliance will have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. In the event and to the extent that additional legal requirements with respect to limiting human exposure to crystalline silica are adopted in the future, we may not be able to comply with such new legal requirements, and any such new requirements could have a material adverse effect on our operating results by requiring us to modify or cease our operations.\nIn addition, the inhalation of respirable crystalline silica is associated with the lung disease silicosis. There is recent evidence of an association between crystalline silica exposure or silicosis and lung cancer and a possible association with other diseases, including immune system disorders such as scleroderma. These health risks have been, and may continue to be, a significant issue confronting the frac sand industry. Concerns over silicosis and other potential adverse health effects, as well as concerns regarding potential liability from the use of frac sand, may have the effect of discouraging our customers\u2019 use of our frac sand. The actual or perceived health risks of mining, processing and handling frac sand could materially and adversely affect frac sand producers, including us, through reduced use of frac sand, the threat of product liability or employee lawsuits, increased scrutiny by federal, state and local regulatory authorities of us and our customers or reduced financing sources available to the frac sand industry.\nWe are subject to the MSH Act and the OSH Act, both of which impose stringent health and safety standards on numerous aspects of our operations.\nOur operations are subject to the MSH Act, as amended by the Mine Improvement and New Emergency Response Act of 2006 as well as the OSH Act, including but not limited to the OSHA rule imposing more stringent requirements regarding respirable crystalline silica that was published in 2016 and most of which requirements became effective in June 2018. The MSH Act and the OSH Act impose stringent health and safety standards on numerous aspects of our operations inclusive of mineral extraction and processing operations, transportation and transloading of silica and delivery of silica sand to wellsites. These standards include, the training of personnel, operating procedures, operating and safety equipment, and other matters. Our failure to comply with such standards, or changes in such standards or the reinterpretation or more stringent enforcement thereof, could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition or otherwise impose significant restrictions on our ability to conduct operations.\nWe and our customers are subject to other extensive regulations, including plant and wildlife protection and reclamation regulation, that impose, and will continue to impose, significant costs and liabilities. In addition, future regulations, or more stringent enforcement of existing regulations, could increase those costs and liabilities, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nIn addition to the regulatory matters described above in other risk factors, we and our customers are subject to other extensive laws and regulations on matters such as plant and wildlife protection, wetlands protection, reclamation and restoration activities at mining properties after mining is completed, the discharge of materials into the environment, and the effects that mining and hydraulic fracturing have on groundwater quality and availability. Our future success depends, among other things, on the quantity and quality of our frac sand deposits, our ability to extract these deposits profitably, and our customers being able to operate their businesses as they currently do.\nIn order to obtain permits and renewals of permits with respect to these other regulatory matters in the future, we may be required to prepare and present data to governmental authorities pertaining to the potential adverse impact that any proposed excavation or production activities, individually or in the aggregate, may have on the environment. Certain approval procedures may require preparation of archaeological surveys, endangered species studies, and other studies to assess the environmental impact of new sites or the expansion of existing sites. Compliance with these regulatory requirements is expensive and significantly lengthens the time needed to develop a site. Finally, obtaining or renewing required permits is sometimes hindered due to community opposition and other factors beyond our control. The denial of a permit essential to our operations or the imposition of conditions with which it is not practicable or feasible to comply could impair or prevent our ability to develop or expand a site. Significant opposition to a permit by neighboring property owners, members of the public, or other third parties, or delay in the environmental review and permitting process also could delay or impair our ability to develop or expand a site. New legal requirements, including those related to the protection of the environment, could be adopted that could materially adversely affect our mining operations (including our ability to extract or the pace of extraction of mineral deposits), our cost structure, or our customers\u2019 ability to use our frac sand. Such current or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business and we may not be able to obtain or renew permits in the future.\nOur customers may be subject to climate change legislation or regulations restricting emissions of GHGs that could result in increased operating costs and reduced demand for the products and services we provide.\nClimate change continues to attract considerable public, political and scientific attention. As a result, numerous proposals have been made and are likely to continue to be made at the international, national, regional and state levels of government to monitor and limit emissions of GHGs. These efforts have included consideration by states or groupings of states of cap-and-trade programs, carbon taxes, GHG reporting and tracking programs, and regulations that directly limit GHG emissions from certain sources.\nIn the United States, no comprehensive climate change legislation has been implemented at the federal level, to date. However, in the absence of federal GHG-limiting legislation, the EPA has determined that GHG emissions present a danger to public health and the environment and has adopted rules under authority of the federal Clean Air Act that, among other things, directly regulate emissions of methane, a GHG, from oil and natural gas operations. EPA\u2019s New Source Performance Standards require certain new, modified, or reconstructed facilities in the oil and natural gas sector to reduce these methane gas, and volatile organic compound emissions. Furthermore, EPA has established Potential for Significant Deterioration (\"PSD\") construction and Title V operating permit reviews for GHG emissions from certain large stationary sources that emit certain principal, or \"criteria,\" pollutants. Those sources subject to PSD permitting would be required to meet \"best available control technology\" standards for those GHG emissions. Internationally, in April 2016, the United States joined other countries in entering into a United Nations-sponsored non-binding agreement negotiated in Paris, France (\"Paris Agreement\") for nations to limit their GHG emissions through individually-determined emission reduction goals every five years beginning in 2020. However, in August 2017, the U.S. State Department informed the United Nations of the United States\u2019 intention to withdraw from this Paris Agreement, which provides for a four-year exit process beginning when it took effect in November 2016.\nThe adoption and implementation of any federal or state legislation or regulations or international agreements that require reporting of GHGs or otherwise restrict emissions of GHGs from our or our customers\u2019 equipment and operations could require us or our customers to incur increased operating costs, acquire emissions allowances or comply with new regulatory or reporting requirements, including the imposition of a carbon tax. Moreover, such new legislation or regulatory programs could also materially and adversely affect demand for the oil and natural gas our customers produce, which may reduce demand for our frac sand products and services. Any one or more of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Notwithstanding potential risks related to climate change, the International Energy Agency estimates that oil and gas will continue to represent a major share of global energy use through 2040, and other private sector studies project continued growth in demand for the next two decades. However, recent activism directed at shifting funding away from companies with energy-related assets could result in limitations or restrictions on certain sources of funding for the energy sector.\nOur inability to acquire, maintain or renew financial assurances related to the reclamation and restoration of mining property could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are generally obligated to restore property in accordance with regulatory standards and our approved reclamation plan following the completion of mining activities at the property. We are required under federal, state, and local laws to maintain financial assurances, such as surety bonds, to secure such obligations. The inability to acquire, maintain or renew such assurances, as required by federal, state, and local laws, could subject us to fines and penalties as well as the revocation of our operating permits. Such inability could result from a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe lack of availability, higher expense, or unreasonable terms of such financial assurances;\n\u2022\nthe ability of current and future financial assurance counterparties to increase required collateral; and\n\u2022\nthe exercise by financial assurance counterparties of any rights to refuse to renew the financial assurance instruments.\nOur inability to acquire, maintain, or renew necessary financial assurances related to the reclamation and restoration of mining property could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to our Structure\nFailure to complete, or significant delays in completing, the Conversion could negatively affect the trading prices of units and the future business and financial results of the Partnership. Additionally, if the Conversion is not completed, our unitholders will continue to be required to pay taxes on their share of our taxable income whether or not they receive any cash distributions from us.\nCompletion of the Conversion is not assured and is subject to risks, including the risk that approval of the proposed Conversion by the unitholders is not obtained. If the Conversion is not completed, or if there are significant delays in completing the Conversion, the trading prices of units and the future business and financial results of the Partnership could be negatively affected, and the Partnership will be subject to several risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nnegative reactions from the financial markets, including declines in the prices of common units due to the fact that current prices may reflect a market assumption that the Conversion will be completed; and\n\u2022\nthe attention of management of the Partnership will have been diverted to the Conversion rather than its own operations and pursuit of other opportunities that could have been beneficial to the Partnership.\nAdditionally, if the Conversion is not completed, the Partnership will continue to be treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes and our unitholders will continue to be required to pay any U.S. federal income taxes and, in some cases, state and local income taxes on their share of our taxable income whether or not they receive any cash distributions from us. Further, if the Partnership continues to be treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the suspension or distribution of the Partnership\u2019s cash distribution will increase the ratio of the Partnership\u2019s allocable taxable income to cash distributions. As a result, our unitholders may not receive cash distributions from us equal to their share of our taxable income or even equal to the actual tax liability that results from that income. A description of the material U.S. federal income tax consequences of the Conversion is included in the preliminary proxy statement filed by the Partnership with the SEC on February 5, 2019.\nThe board of directors of our general partner may modify or revoke our cash distribution policy at any time at its discretion. Our partnership agreement does not require us to pay any distributions at all.\nThe board of directors of our general partner has adopted a cash distribution policy pursuant to which we intend to make quarterly distributions on our units to the extent we have sufficient cash after the establishment of cash reserves and the payment of our expenses, including payments to our general partner and its affiliates. However, the board may change such policy at any time at its discretion. In January 2019, the board suspended the distribution.\nIn addition, our partnership agreement does not require us to pay any distributions at all. Accordingly, investors are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the permanence of such a policy in making an investment decision. Any modification or revocation of our cash distribution policy could substantially reduce or eliminate the amounts of distributions to our unitholders. The amount of distributions we make, if any, and the decision to make any distribution at all will be determined by the board of directors of our general partner, whose interests may differ from those of our common unitholders. Our general partner has limited duties to our unitholders, which may permit it to favor its own interests to the detriment of our common unitholders.\nWe may distribute a significant portion of our cash available for distribution to our partners, which could limit our ability to grow and make acquisitions.\nWe may distribute most of our cash available for distribution, which may cause our growth to proceed at a slower pace than that of businesses that reinvest their cash to expand ongoing operations. To the extent we issue additional units in connection with any acquisitions or expansion capital expenditures, the payment of distributions on those additional units may increase the risk that we will be unable to maintain or increase our per unit distribution level. There are no limitations in our partnership agreement on our ability to issue additional units, including units ranking senior to the common units. The incurrence of additional commercial borrowings or other debt to finance our growth strategy would result in increased interest expense, which, in turn, may impact the cash that we have available to distribute to our unitholders.\nOur general partner intends to limit its liability regarding our obligations.\nOur general partner intends to limit its liability under contractual arrangements between us and third parties so that the counterparties to such arrangements have recourse only against our assets, and not against our general partner or its assets. Our general partner may therefore cause us to incur indebtedness or other obligations that are nonrecourse to our general partner. Our partnership agreement provides that any action taken by our general partner to limit its liability is not a breach of our general partner\u2019s duties, even if we could have obtained more favorable terms without the limitation on liability. In addition, we are obligated to reimburse or indemnify our general partner to the extent that it incurs obligations on our behalf. Any such reimbursement or indemnification payments would reduce the amount of cash otherwise available for distribution to our unitholders.\nOur partnership agreement replaces our general partner\u2019s fiduciary duties to holders of our units.\nOur partnership agreement contains provisions that eliminate and replace the fiduciary standards to which our general partner would otherwise be held by state fiduciary duty law. For example, our partnership agreement permits our general partner to make a number of decisions in its individual capacity, as opposed to in its capacity as our general partner, or otherwise free of fiduciary duties to us and our unitholders. This entitles our general partner to consider only the interests and factors that it desires and relieves it of any duty or obligation to give any consideration to any interest of, or factors affecting, us, our affiliates or our limited partners. Examples of decisions that our general partner may make in its individual capacity include:\n\u2022\nhow to allocate business opportunities among us and its affiliates;\n\u2022\nhow to exercise its voting rights with respect to the units it owns; and\n\u2022\nwhether or not to consent to any merger or consolidation of the partnership or amendment to the partnership agreement.\nBy purchasing a common unit, a unitholder is treated as having consented to the provisions in the partnership agreement, including the provisions discussed above.\nOur partnership agreement restricts the remedies available to holders of our units for actions taken by our general partner that might otherwise constitute breaches of fiduciary duty.\nOur partnership agreement contains provisions that restrict the remedies available to unitholders for actions taken by our general partner that might otherwise constitute breaches of fiduciary duty under state fiduciary duty law. For example, our partnership agreement provides that:\n\u2022\nwhenever our general partner makes a determination or takes, or declines to take, any other action in its capacity as our general partner, our general partner is required to make such determination, or take or decline to take such other action, in good faith, and will not be subject to any other or different standard imposed by our partnership agreement, Delaware law, or any other law, rule or regulation, or at equity;\n\u2022\nour general partner will not have any liability to us or our unitholders for decisions made in its capacity as a general partner so long as it acted in good faith, meaning that it believed that the decision was in the best interest of our partnership;\n\u2022\nour general partner and its officers and directors will not be liable for monetary damages to us or our limited partners resulting from any act or omission unless there has been a final and non-appealable judgment entered by a court of competent jurisdiction determining that our general partner or its officers and directors, as the case may be, acted in bad faith or, in the case of a criminal matter, acted with knowledge that the conduct was criminal; and\n\u2022\nour general partner will not be in breach of its obligations under the partnership agreement or its duties to us or our limited partners if a transaction with an affiliate or the resolution of a conflict of interest is:\n(1)\napproved by the conflicts committee of the board of directors of our general partner, although our general partner is not obligated to seek such approval; or\n(2)\napproved by the vote of a majority of the outstanding common units, excluding any common units owned by our general partner and its affiliates.\nIn connection with a situation involving a transaction with an affiliate or a conflict of interest, any determination by our general partner must be made in good faith. If an affiliate transaction or the resolution of a conflict of interest is not approved by our common unitholders or the conflicts committee then it will be presumed that, in making its decision, taking any action or failing to act, the board of directors of our general partner acted in good faith, and in any proceeding brought by or on behalf of any limited partner or the partnership, the person bringing or prosecuting such proceeding will have the burden of overcoming such presumption.\nEven if holders of our common units are dissatisfied, they have limited ability to remove our general partner.\nIf our unitholders are dissatisfied with the performance of our general partner, they have limited ability to remove our general partner. The vote of the holders of at least 66 2/3% of all outstanding units voting together as a single class is required to remove our general partner.\nOur general partner interest or the control of our general partner may be transferred to a third party without unitholder consent.\nOur general partner may transfer its general partner interest to a third party in a merger or in a sale of all or substantially all of its assets without the consent of our unitholders. Furthermore, our partnership agreement does not restrict the ability of the members of our general partner to transfer their respective membership interests in our general partner to a third party. The new members of our general partner would then be in a position to replace the board of directors and executive officers of our general partner with their own designees and thereby exert significant control over the decisions taken by the board of directors and executive officers of our general partner. This effectively permits a \"change of control\" without the vote or consent of the unitholders.\nWe may issue additional units without unitholder approval, which would dilute existing unitholder ownership interests.\nOur partnership agreement does not limit the number of additional limited partner interests we may issue at any time without the approval of our unitholders. The issuance of additional common units or other equity interests of equal or senior rank will have the following effects:\n\u2022\nour existing unitholders\u2019 proportionate ownership interest in us will decrease;\n\u2022\nthe amount of cash available for distribution on each unit may decrease;\n\u2022\nthe ratio of taxable income to distributions may increase;\n\u2022\nthe relative voting strength of each previously outstanding unit may be diminished; and\n\u2022\nthe market price of the common units may decline.\nThere are no limitations in our partnership agreement on our ability to issue units ranking senior to the common units.\nIn accordance with Delaware law and the provisions of our partnership agreement, we may issue additional partnership interests that are senior to the common units in right of distribution, liquidation and voting. The issuance by us of units of senior rank may (i) reduce or eliminate the amount of cash available for distribution to our common unitholders; (ii) diminish the relative voting strength of the total common units outstanding as a class; or (iii) subordinate the claims of the common unitholders to our assets in the event of our liquidation.\nOur partnership agreement restricts the voting rights of unitholders owning 20% or more of our common units.\nOur partnership agreement restricts unitholders\u2019 voting rights by providing that any units held by a person or group that owns 20% or more of any class of units then outstanding, other than our general partner and its affiliates, their transferees and persons who acquired such units with the prior approval of the board of directors of our general partner, cannot vote on any matter.\nYour liability may not be limited if a court finds that unitholder action constitutes control of our business.\nA general partner of a partnership generally has unlimited liability for the obligations of the partnership, except for those contractual obligations of the partnership that are expressly made without recourse to the general partner. Our partnership is organized under Delaware law, and we conduct business in a number of other states. The limitations on the liability of holders of limited partner interests for the obligations of a limited partnership have not been clearly established in some jurisdictions. You could be liable for our obligations as if you were a general partner if a court or government agency were to determine that:\n\u2022\nwe were conducting business in a state but had not complied with that particular state\u2019s partnership statute; or\n\u2022\nyour right to act with other unitholders to remove or replace the general partner, to approve some amendments to our partnership agreement or to take other actions under our partnership agreement constitute \"control\" of our business.\nUnitholders may have liability to repay distributions and in certain circumstances may be personally liable for the obligations of the partnership.\nUnder certain circumstances, unitholders may have to repay amounts wrongfully returned or distributed to them. Under Section 17-607 of the Delaware Revised Uniform Limited Partnership Act, or the Delaware Act, we may not make a distribution to our unitholders if the distribution would cause our liabilities to exceed the fair value of our assets. Delaware law provides that for a period of three years from the date of the impermissible distribution, limited partners who received the distribution and who knew at the time of the distribution that it violated Delaware law will be liable to the limited partnership for the distribution amount. Liabilities to partners on account of their partnership interests and liabilities that are non-recourse to the partnership are not counted for purposes of determining whether a distribution is permitted.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, current and potential unitholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our units.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports, prevent fraud and operate successfully as a public company. If we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud, our reputation and operating results would be harmed. We cannot be certain that our efforts to develop and maintain our internal controls will be successful, that we will be able to maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future or that we will be able to comply with our obligations under Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. Any failure to develop or maintain effective internal controls, or difficulties encountered in implementing or improving our internal controls, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. Ineffective internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which would likely have a negative effect on the trading price of our units.\nThe New York Stock Exchange does not require a publicly-traded partnership like us to comply with certain of its corporate governance requirements.\nOur common units are listed on the NYSE under the symbol \"HCLP.\" Because we are a publicly-traded partnership, the NYSE does not require us to have a majority of independent directors on our general partner\u2019s board of directors or to establish a compensation committee or a nominating and corporate governance committee. Accordingly, unitholders do not have the same protections afforded to certain corporations that are subject to all of the NYSE corporate governance requirements.\nTax Risks to Common Unitholders\nOur tax treatment depends on our status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, as well as not being subject to a material amount of entity-level taxation by individual states. If the Internal Revenue Service (the \"IRS\") were to treat us as a corporation for federal income tax purposes or we were to become subject to material additional amounts of entity-level taxation for state tax purposes, then our cash available for distribution to you could be substantially reduced.\nThe anticipated after-tax economic benefit of an investment in our common units depends largely on us being treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes.\nDespite the fact that we are organized as a limited partnership under Delaware law, as a publicly traded partnership we may be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes unless 90% or more of our gross income in each year consists of certain identified types of \"qualifying income\" as defined by Section 7704 of the Internal Revenue Code (the \"Qualifying Income Exception\"). In addition to qualifying income, like many other publicly traded partnerships, we also generate ancillary income that may not be considered qualifying income. We have historically satisfied, and believe we currently satisfy, the Qualifying Income Exception to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. Although we monitor our level of gross income that may not be considered qualifying income closely and attempt to manage our operations to ensure compliance with the Qualifying Income Exception, during periods of weak demand and low prices for frac sand, the sale of which generates qualifying income, we may not be able to continue to meet the Qualifying Income Exception. To the extent we become aware that we may not generate or have not generated sufficient qualifying income with respect to a period, we can and would take action to preserve our treatment as a partnership for federal income tax purposes, including seeking relief from the IRS. Section 7704(e) of the Internal Revenue Code provides for the possibility of relief upon, among other things, a determination by the IRS that such failure to meet the Qualifying Income Exception was inadvertent.\nIf we were treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes, we would pay federal income tax on our taxable income at the corporate tax rate and would likely pay state income tax at varying rates. Distributions to you would generally be taxed again as corporate distributions, and no income, gains, losses, deductions or credits would flow through to you. Because a tax would be imposed upon us as a corporation, our cash available for distribution to you would be substantially reduced. Therefore, treatment of us as a corporation would result in a material reduction in the anticipated cash flow and after-tax return to the unitholders, likely causing a substantial reduction in the value of our common units. At the state level, several states have been evaluating ways to subject partnerships to entity-level taxation through the imposition of state income, franchise or other forms of taxation. We currently own assets and conduct business in several states that impose a margin or franchise tax. In the future, we may expand our operations. Imposition of a similar tax on us in other jurisdictions that we may expand to could substantially reduce our cash available for distribution to our unitholders.\nThe tax treatment of publicly traded partnerships or an investment in our units could be subject to potential legislative, judicial or administrative changes or differing interpretations, possibly applied on a retroactive basis.\nThe present federal income tax treatment of publicly-traded partnerships, including us, or an investment in our common units may be modified by administrative, legislative or judicial changes or differing interpretations at any time. From time to time, members of the U.S. Congress have proposed and considered substantive changes to the existing federal income tax laws that would affect publicly traded partnerships, including a prior legislative proposal that would have eliminated the Qualifying Income Exception upon which we rely for our treatment as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. In addition, the Treasury Department has issued, and in the future may issue, regulations interpreting those laws that affect publicly traded partnerships. Although there are no current legislative or administrative proposals, there can be no assurance that there will not be further changes to U.S. federal income tax laws or the Treasury Department\u2019s interpretation of the qualifying income rules in a manner that could impact our ability to qualify as a publicly traded partnership in the future.\nAny modification to the federal income tax laws may be applied retroactively and could make it more difficult or impossible for us to meet the Qualifying Income Exception. We are unable to predict whether any changes or other proposals will ultimately be enacted. Any future legislation could negatively impact the value of an investment in our common units. You are urged to consult with your own tax advisor with respect to the status of regulatory or administrative developments and proposals and their potential effect on your investment in our common units.\nOur unitholders are required to pay taxes on their share of our income even if they do not receive any cash distributions from us.\nOur unitholders are required to pay any federal income taxes and, in some cases, state and local income taxes on their share of our taxable income whether or not they receive any cash distributions from us. During periods in which the Partnership suspends or suppresses cash distributions or reinvests cash in its business, the ratio of the of the Partnership\u2019s allocable taxable income to cash distributions will increase. As a result, our unitholders may not receive cash distributions from us equal to their share of our taxable income or even equal to the actual tax liability that results from that income. Additionally, if we sell assets and use the proceeds to repay existing debt or fund capital expenditures, you may be allocated taxable income and gain resulting from the sale and our cash available for distribution would not increase. Similarly, taking advantage of opportunities to reduce our existing debt, such as debt exchanges, debt repurchases, or modifications of our existing debt could result in \"cancellation of indebtedness income\" being allocated to our unitholders as taxable income without any increase in our cash available for distribution.\nTax gain or loss on the disposition of our common units could be more or less than expected.\nIf our unitholders sell their common units, they will recognize a gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized and their tax basis in those common units. Because distributions in excess of their allocable share of our net taxable income result in a decrease in their tax basis in their common units, the amount, if any, of such prior excess distributions with respect to the units they sell will, in effect, become taxable income to them if they sell such units at a price greater than their tax basis in those units, even if the price they receive is less than their original cost. In addition, because the amount realized includes a unitholder\u2019s share of our nonrecourse liabilities, if they sell their units, they may incur a tax liability in excess of the amount of cash they receive from the sale.\nA substantial portion of the amount realized from a sale of our units by our unitholders, whether or not representing gain, may be taxed as ordinary income to our unitholders due to potential recapture items, including depreciation recapture. Thus, our unitholders may recognize both ordinary income and capital loss from the sale of units if the amount realized on a sale of such units is less than such unitholder\u2019s adjusted basis in the units. Net capital loss may only offset capital gains and, in the case of individuals, up to $3,000 of ordinary income per year. In the taxable period in which a unitholder sells its units, such unitholder may recognize ordinary income from our allocations of income and gain to such unitholder prior to the sale and from recapture items that generally cannot be offset by any capital loss recognized upon the sale of units.\nUnitholders may be subject to limitation on their ability to deduct interest expense incurred by us.\nIn general, we are entitled to a deduction for interest paid or accrued on indebtedness properly allocable to our trade or business during our taxable year. However, under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, our deduction for \"business interest\" is limited to the sum of our business interest income and 30% of our \"adjusted taxable income.\" For the purposes of this limitation, our adjusted taxable income is computed without regard to any business interest expense or business interest income, and in the case of taxable years beginning before January 1, 2022, any deduction allowable for depreciation, amortization, or depletion.\nTax-exempt entities face unique tax issues from owning our common units that may result in adverse tax consequences to them.\nInvestment in our common units by tax-exempt entities, such as employee benefit plans and individual retirement accounts (\"IRAs\") raises issues unique to them. For example, virtually all of our income allocated to organizations that are exempt from federal income tax, including IRAs and other retirement plans, will be unrelated business taxable income and will be taxable to them. With respect to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, subject to the proposed aggregation rules for certain similarly situated businesses or activities issued by the Treasury Department, a tax-exempt entity with more than one unrelated trade or business (including by attribution from investment in a partnership such as ours) is required to compute the unrelated business taxable income of such tax exempt entity separately with respect to each such trade or business (including for purposes of determining any net operating loss deduction). As a result, for years beginning after December 31, 2017, it may not be possible for tax-exempt entities to utilize losses from an investment in our partnership to offset unrelated business taxable income from another unrelated trade or business and vice versa. Tax-exempt entities should consult a tax advisor before investing in our common units.\nNon-U.S. Unitholders will be subject to U.S. taxes and withholding with respect to their income and gain from owning our units.\nNon-U.S. unitholders are generally taxed and subject to income tax filing requirements by the United States on income effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business (\"effectively connected income\"). Income allocated to our unitholders and any gain from the sale of our units will generally be considered to be \"effectively connected\" with a U.S. trade or business. As a result, distributions to a Non-U.S. unitholder will be subject to withholding at the highest applicable effective tax rate and a Non-U.S. unitholder who sells or otherwise disposes of a unit will also be subject to U.S. federal income tax on the gain realized from the sale or disposition of that unit.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act imposes a withholding obligation of 10% of the amount realized upon a Non-U.S. unitholder\u2019s sale or exchange of an interest in a partnership that is engaged in a U.S. trade or business. However, due to challenges of administering a withholding obligation applicable to open market trading and other complications, the IRS has temporarily suspended the application of this withholding rule to open market transfers of interests in publicly traded partnerships pending promulgation of regulations or other guidance that resolves the challenges. It is not clear if or when such regulations or other guidance will be issued. Non-U.S. unitholders should consult a tax advisor before investing in our common units.\nIf the IRS makes audit adjustments to our income tax returns for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, it (and some states) may assess and collect any taxes (including any applicable penalties and interest) resulting from such audit adjustments directly from us, in which case our cash available for distribution to our unitholders might be substantially reduced.\nPursuant to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2015, for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, if the IRS makes audit adjustments to our income tax returns, it (and some states) may assess and collect any taxes (including any applicable penalties and interest) resulting from such audit adjustments directly from us. To the extent possible under the new rules, our general partner may elect to either pay the taxes (including any applicable penalties and interest) directly to the IRS or, if we are eligible, issue a revised information statement to each unitholder and former unitholder with respect to an audited and adjusted return. Although our general partner may elect to have our unitholders and former unitholders take such audit adjustment into account and pay any resulting taxes (including applicable penalties or interest) in accordance with their interests in us during the tax year under audit, there can be no assurance that such election will be practical, permissible or effective in all circumstances. As a result, our current unitholders may bear some or all of the tax liability resulting from such audit adjustment, even if such unitholders did not own units in us during the tax year under audit. If, as a result of any such audit adjustment, we are required to make payments of taxes, penalties and interest, our cash available for distribution to our unitholders might be substantially reduced. These rules are not applicable for tax years beginning on or prior to December 31, 2017.\nIf the IRS contests the federal income tax positions we take, the market for our common units may be adversely impacted, and the costs of any such contest will reduce our cash available for distribution to our unitholders.\nWe have not requested a ruling from the IRS with respect to our treatment as a partnership for federal income tax purposes. The IRS may adopt positions that differ from the positions we take. It may be necessary to resort to administrative or court proceedings to sustain some or all of the positions we take. A court may not agree with some or all of the positions we take. Any contest with the IRS may materially and adversely impact the market for our common units and the price at which they trade. Moreover, the costs of any contest between us and the IRS will result in a reduction in our cash available for distribution to our unitholders and thus will be borne indirectly by our unitholders.\nWe treat each purchaser of our common units as having the same tax benefits without regard to the common units actually purchased. The IRS may challenge this treatment, which could adversely affect the value of our common units.\nBecause we cannot match transferors and transferees of common units, we have adopted certain methods for allocating depreciation and amortization deductions that may not conform to all aspects of existing Treasury Regulations. A successful IRS challenge to the use of these methods could adversely affect the amount of tax benefits available to our unitholders. It also could affect the timing of these tax benefits or the amount of gain from any sale of common units and could have a negative impact on the value of our common units or result in audit adjustments to a unitholder's tax returns.\nWe generally prorate our items of income, gain, loss and deduction between transferors and transferees of our units each month based upon the ownership of our units on the first day of each month, instead of on the basis of the date a particular unit is transferred. The IRS may challenge this treatment, which could change the allocation of items of income, gain, loss and deduction among our unitholders.\nWe generally prorate our items of income, gain, loss and deduction between transferors and transferees of our common units each month based upon the ownership of our common units on the first day of each month (the \"Allocation Date\"), instead of on the basis of the date a particular common unit is transferred. Similarly, we generally allocate (i) certain deductions for depreciation of capital additions, (ii) gain or loss realized on a sale or other disposition of our assets, and (iii) in the discretion of the general partner, any other extraordinary item of income, gain, loss or deduction based upon ownership on the Allocation Date. Treasury Regulations allow a similar monthly simplifying convention, but such regulations do not specifically authorize all aspects of our proration method. If the IRS were to challenge our proration method, we may be required to change the allocation of items of income, gain, loss, and deduction among our unitholders.\nA unitholder whose common units are the subject of a securities loan (e.g., a loan to a \"short seller\" to cover a short sale of common units) may be considered as having disposed of those common units. If so, such unitholder would no longer be treated for federal income tax purposes as a partner with respect to those common units during the period of the loan and may recognize gain or loss from the disposition.\nBecause there are no specific rules governing the U.S. federal income tax consequence of loaning a partnership interest, a unitholder whose common units are the subject of a securities loan may be considered to have disposed of the loaned units. In that case, such unitholder may no longer be treated for federal income tax purposes as a partner with respect to those common units during the period of the loan to the short seller and the unitholder may recognize gain or loss from such disposition. Moreover, during the period of the loan, any of our income, gain, loss or deduction with respect to those common units may not be reportable by the unitholder and any cash distributions received by the unitholder as to those common units could be fully taxable as ordinary income. Unitholders desiring to assure their status as partners and avoid the risk of gain recognition from a securities loan are urged to consult a tax advisor to determine whether it is advisable to modify any applicable brokerage account agreements to prohibit their brokers from borrowing their common units.\nWe have adopted certain valuation methodologies in determining a unitholder\u2019s allocations of income, gain, loss and deduction. The IRS may challenge these methodologies or the resulting allocations, which could adversely affect the value of our common units.\nIn determining the items of income, gain, loss and deduction allocable to our unitholders, we must routinely determine the fair market value of our assets. Although we may, from time to time, consult with professional appraisers regarding valuation matters, we make many fair market value estimates using a methodology based on the market value of our common units as a means to measure the fair market value of our assets. The IRS may challenge these valuation methods and the resulting allocations of income, gain, loss and deduction.\nA successful IRS challenge to these methods or allocations could adversely affect the timing or amount of taxable income or loss being allocated to our unitholders. It also could affect the amount of gain recognized from the sale of our common units, have a negative impact on the value of our common units or result in audit adjustments to our unitholders\u2019 tax returns without the benefit of additional deductions.\nOur unitholders will likely be subject to state and local taxes and income tax return filing requirements in jurisdictions where they do not live as a result of investing in our common units.\nIn addition to federal income taxes, our unitholders may be subject to other taxes, including foreign, state and local taxes, unincorporated business taxes and estate, inheritance or intangible taxes that are imposed by the various jurisdictions in which we conduct business or own property now or in the future, even if they do not live in any of those jurisdictions. Our unitholders will likely be required to file foreign, state and local income tax returns and pay state and local income taxes in some or all of these various jurisdictions. Further, our unitholders may be subject to penalties for failure to comply with those requirements.\nWe currently own assets and conduct business in multiple states that currently impose a personal income tax on individuals, corporations, and other entities. As we make acquisitions or expand our business, we may own assets or conduct business in additional states or foreign jurisdictions that impose a personal income tax. It is our unitholders' responsibility to file all federal, foreign, state and local tax returns and pay any such taxes due in these jurisdictions. Unitholders should consult with their own tax advisors regarding the filing of such tax returns, the payment of such taxes, and the deductibility of any taxes paid.", "PERMNO": 13544, "SIC": 1400, "TIC": "HCRSQ"}
