{"cik": "891293", "company": "CTI BIOPHARMA CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-17", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThis report contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. The occurrence of any of the risks described below and elsewhere in this document could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, operating results or prospects and the trading price of our securities. Additional risks and uncertainties that we do not presently know or that we currently deem immaterial may also harm our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects and the trading price of our securities.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe expect to continue to incur net losses, and we may never achieve profitability.\nWe were incorporated in 1991 and have incurred a net operating loss every year since our formation. As of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $2.3 billion, and we expect to continue to incur net losses. As part of our business plan, we will need to continue to conduct research, development, testing and regulatory compliance activities with respect to our compounds and ensure the procurement of manufacturing and drug supply services, the costs of which, together with projected general and administrative expenses, is expected to result in operating losses for the foreseeable future. There can be no assurances that we will ever achieve profitability.\nOur prospects are dependent on the successful development, regulatory approval and commercialization of pacritinib and we may be unsuccessful in such efforts.\nOur business and future success depends on our ability to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval for and commercialize pacritinib. Pacritinib is our sole product candidate in active development and has not yet received regulatory approval.\nObtaining regulatory approval requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and without additional financing, we lack sufficient resources to pursue the development of pacritinib. We currently have no commitments or arrangements for any significant additional financing to fund the development and commercial launch of pacritinib, and we will need to seek additional funding, which may not be available or may not be available on favorable terms. We could also seek another collaborative partnership for the development and commercialization of pacritinib, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all. If we partner pacritinib, we may have to relinquish valuable economic rights and would potentially forgo additional economic benefits that could be realized if we continued the development and commercialization activities alone. Even if pacritinib receives approval from regulatory authorities for one or more indications, we would need to incur significant expenses to support the commercialization and launch of pacritinib, which investment may never be realized if sales are insufficient.\nOur business could be adversely affected by the effects of health epidemics, including the recent COVID-19 global pandemic, in regions where third parties for which we rely, as in Clinical Research Organizations, or CROs, have clinical trial sites or other business operations and may result in significant disruptions to our clinical trials, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur business has been adversely affected and may continue to be adversely affected by the effects of health epidemics, including the ongoing worldwide COVID-19 pandemic, in regions where we have clinical trial sites or other business operations and has resulted in and may continue to result in significant disruptions to our clinical trials. On January 30, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced a global health emergency because of a new strain of novel coronavirus originating in Wuhan, China and the risks to the international community as the virus spreads globally beyond its point of origin. In March 2020, the WHO declared the coronavirus outbreak a pandemic, which virus has spread throughout the world, including to geographies where we are conducting the PACIFICA Phase 3 trial and the PRE-VENT Phase 3 trial. Further, the President of the United States declared the COVID-19 pandemic a national emergency. Similarly, numerous states have declared a state of emergency related to the spread of COVID-19 and/or issued executive orders directing all individuals living in their respective states to stay at their place of residence for an indefinite period of time (subject to certain exceptions to facilitate authorized necessary activities) to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. These states and others have repeated and may continue to repeat these mitigation steps in the future. The spread of this pandemic has caused significant volatility and uncertainty in U.S. and international markets. This has resulted in an economic downturn and may disrupt our business and delay our clinical trials and timelines.\nQuarantines, shelter-in-place and similar government orders have been enacted in each of the geographies in which we are conducting our clinical trials and such orders, shutdowns or other restrictions on the conduct of business operations could\ncontinue to remain in place for extended periods of time or subsequently reinstated, thereby further affecting our clinical trials. The patient populations that are eligible for our clinical trials are immune-compromised and are at higher risk for becoming infected with COVID-19. As COVID-19 affects the parts of the world where we are conducting our clinical trials, and the patients involved with these clinical trials become infected with COVID-19, we may have more adverse events and deaths in our clinical trials as a result.\nWe have faced and may continue to face difficulties enrolling patients in our clinical trials as the patient populations that are eligible for our clinical trials are impacted by COVID-19. Patient enrollment may be further delayed due to the diversion of healthcare resources, such as hospitals serving as our clinical trial sites and hospital staff supporting the conduct of our clinical trials, away from the conduct of clinical trials, toward the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAdditionally, if our clinical trial patients are unable to travel to our clinical trial sites as a result of quarantines or other restrictions resulting from COVID-19, we may experience higher drop-out rates or delays in our clinical trials. Similarly, we may struggle to recruit and retain patients and principal investigators and site staff who, as healthcare providers, may have heightened exposure to COVID-19. Any such delays in enrollment hinder our ability to obtain clinical data on the schedule we currently predict.\nTravel restrictions continue to be implemented throughout the world in an effort to contain COVID-19, and several countries have expanded screenings of travelers.\nWe may experience additional disruptions due to the COVID-19 pandemic that could severely impact our business and clinical trials, including:\n\u2022evidence from the PRE-VENT Phase 3 trial showing increased adverse events in trial participants, which could affect the safety profile and/or acceptability of our application to the FDA;\n\u2022delays in clinical sites receiving the supplies and materials needed to conduct our clinical trials, including interruption in global shipping that may affect the transport of clinical trial materials;\n\u2022changes in local regulations as part of a response to the COVID-19 pandemic which may require us to change the ways in which our clinical trials are conducted, which may result in unexpected costs, or to discontinue the clinical trials altogether;\n\u2022interruption of key clinical trial activities, such as clinical trial site monitoring, due to limitations on travel imposed or recommended by federal or state governments, employers and others, or interruption of clinical trial subject visits and study procedures, the occurrence of which could affect the integrity of clinical trial data;\n\u2022delays in necessary interactions with local regulators, ethics committees, and other important agencies and contractors due to limitations in employee resources or forced furlough of government employees;\n\u2022limitations in employee resources that would otherwise be focused on the conduct of our clinical trials, including because of sickness of employees or their families or the desire of employees to avoid contact with large groups of people;\n\u2022refusal of the FDA to accept data from clinical trials in affected geographies; and\n\u2022interruption or delays to our sourced discovery and clinical activities.\nThe spread of COVID-19, which has caused a broad impact globally, may materially affect us economically. While the potential economic impact brought by, and the duration of, COVID-19 may be difficult to assess or predict, a widespread pandemic could result in significant disruption of global financial markets, reducing our ability to access capital, which could in the future negatively affect our liquidity. In addition, a recession or market correction resulting from the spread of COVID-19 could materially affect our business and the value of our common stock.\nThe global pandemic of COVID-19 continues to rapidly evolve. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or a similar health epidemic is highly uncertain and subject to change. We do not yet know the full extent of potential delays or impacts on our business, our clinical trials, healthcare systems or the global economy as a whole. However, any one or a combination of these events could have an adverse effect on the operation of and results from our clinical trials, which could prevent or delay us from obtaining approval for pacritinib.\nWe face direct and intense competition from our competitors in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, and we may not compete successfully against them.\nCompetition in the oncology market is intense and is accentuated by the rapid pace of technological and product development. We anticipate that we will face increased competition in the future as new companies enter the market. Our competitors in the United States and elsewhere are numerous and include, among others, major multinational pharmaceutical companies, specialized biotechnology companies and universities and other research institutions. Specifically, if we are successful in bringing pacritinib to market for indications such as MF, AML, MDS, CMML, or CLL, pacritinib may face competition from the currently approved JAK1/JAK2 inhibitors, Jakafi\u00ae / Jakavi\u00ae (ruxolitinib) and Inrebic\u00ae (fedratinib). In August 2019, Celgene (which was subsequently acquired by Bristol Myers Squibb) announced FDA approval of Inrebic\u00ae for the treatment of adult patients with intermediate-2 or high-risk primary or secondary (post-polycythemia vera or post-essential thrombocythemia) myelofibrosis, and in February 2021 Bristol Myers Squibb announced the European Commission approval of Inrebic\u00ae. Pacritinib may also face competition from momelotinib, which Sierra Oncology acquired from Gilead. In June 2019, Sierra Oncology announced that momelotinib was granted fast track designation by the FDA and launched a Phase 3 clinical trial in November 2019. In addition, if we are successful in bringing pacritinib to market as a treatment to prevent progression to acute respiratory distress syndrome, or ARDS, and medical ventilation, we expect to face competition from numerous other companies that are currently pursuing clinical development programs for COVID-19 and related conditions.\nIn addition to the specific competitive factors discussed above, new anti-cancer drugs or drugs for the treatment of COVID-19 that may be under development or developed and marketed in the future could compete with our various compounds.\nMany of our competitors, particularly multinational pharmaceutical companies, either alone or together with their collaborators, have substantially greater financial and technical resources and substantially larger development and marketing teams than us, as well as significantly greater experience than we do in developing, commercializing, manufacturing, marketing and selling products. As a result, products of our competitors might come to market sooner or might prove to be more effective, less expensive, have fewer side effects or be easier to administer than ours. In any such case, sales of any potential future product would likely suffer and we might never recoup the significant investments we have made and will continue to make to develop and market these compounds.\nEven if pacritinib or other compounds we may develop are successful in clinical trials and receive regulatory approvals, we or our collaboration partners may not be able to successfully commercialize them.\nThe development and ongoing clinical trials for pacritinib and other compounds we may develop may not be successful and, even if they are, the resulting products may never be successfully developed into commercial products or gain market acceptance among physicians, patients, healthcare payors or the medical community. Even if we are successful in our clinical trials and in obtaining other regulatory approvals, our products may not reach or remain in the market for a number of reasons including ineffectiveness, harmful side effects, difficulty in scaling manufacturing, political and legislative changes, or competition from other existing or future alternatives. In addition, we currently have limited commercialization expertise, including sales, marketing or distribution capabilities. Advancing pacritinib through Phase 3 development and regulatory approval will require us to begin commercialization preparation activities and incur related expenses before we obtain final trial results and know whether PACIFICA or PRE-VENT will support regulatory approval. If we are unable to adequately prepare the market for the potential future commercialization of pacritinib, we may not be able to generate product revenue once marketing authorization is obtained.\nIf we are unable or decide not to establish internal sales, marketing and distribution capabilities, we will pursue collaborative arrangements regarding the sales and marketing of our products, however, there can be no assurance that we will be able to establish or maintain such collaborative arrangements on commercially reasonable terms, or if we are able to do so, that they will have effective sales forces. Any revenue we receive will depend upon the efforts of such third parties, which may not be successful. We may have little or no control over the marketing and sales efforts of such third parties and our revenue from product sales may be lower than if we had commercialized our product candidates ourselves. We also face competition in our search for third parties to assist us with the sales and marketing efforts of our product candidates.\nPacritinib or other compounds we may develop may cause undesirable side effects or have other properties that could halt their development, prevent their regulatory approval, limit their commercial potential or result in significant negative consequences.\nIt is possible that the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities may not agree with our assessment of the safety profile of pacritinib or other compounds we may develop in the future. Undesirable side effects caused by pacritinib could cause us, institutional review boards, our CROs, the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or discontinue development and could result in a clinical hold on any clinical trial, or the denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities for any or all targeted indications. This, in turn, could prevent us from commercializing pacritinib and generating revenues from its sale. In addition, if pacritinib or other compounds we may develop in the future cause serious or unexpected side effects or are associated with other safety risks after receiving marketing approval, a number of potential significant negative consequences could result.\nWe will need to raise additional funds to operate our business, but additional funds may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. Any inability to raise required capital when needed could harm our liquidity, financial condition, business, operating results and prospects.\nWe have substantial operating expenses associated with the development of pacritinib, and we have significant contractual payment obligations. In addition, we believe that our present financial resources will only be sufficient to fund our operations into the second quarter of 2021. This raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern and we will need to raise substantial additional capital in the near term in order to fund our operations through and beyond the second quarter of 2021 and to continue as a going concern thereafter. See Note 1 to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on our assessment. Uncertainty regarding our ability to continue as a going concern could also have a material and adverse impact on the price of our common stock, which could negatively impact our ability to raise sufficient funds for the development and commercialization of pacritinib and continue as a going concern. In addition, cash forecasts and capital requirements are subject to change as a result of a variety of risks and uncertainties. Developments in and expenses associated with our clinical trials and other research and development activities may consume capital resources earlier than planned. Due to these and other factors, any forecast for the period for which we will have sufficient resources to fund our operations, as well as any other operational or business projection we have disclosed, or may disclose, may fail.\nWe will need to acquire additional funds in order to develop our business, continue the development and prepare for the potential commercialization of pacritinib. We may seek to raise such capital through public or private equity financings, partnerships, collaborations, joint ventures, disposition of assets, debt financings or restructurings, bank borrowings or other sources of financing. However, our ability to raise capital is subject to a number of risks, uncertainties, constraints and consequences.\nFor these and other reasons, additional funding may not be available on favorable terms or at all. If we raise additional funds by issuing equity or equity-linked securities, our stockholders may experience dilution. If we fail to obtain additional capital when needed, we may be required to delay, scale back or eliminate some or all of our research and development programs, reduce our general and administrative expenses, be unable to attract and retain highly qualified personnel, refrain from making our contractually required payments when due (including debt payments) and/or be forced to cease operations, liquidate our assets and possibly seek bankruptcy protection. Any of these consequences could harm our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nWe are dependent on third-party service providers for a number of critical operational activities. Any failure or delay in these undertakings by third parties could harm our business.\nOur business is dependent on the performance by third parties of their responsibilities under contractual relationships. In particular, we rely heavily on third parties for the manufacture and testing of our compounds. We do not have internal analytical laboratory or manufacturing facilities to allow the testing or production of our compounds in compliance with Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP, and current Good Manufacturing Practices, or cGMP. As a result, we rely on third parties to supply us in a timely manner with manufactured products or product candidates. We may not be able to adequately manage and oversee the manufacturers we choose, they may not perform as agreed or they may terminate their agreements with us. In particular, we depend on third-party manufacturers to conduct their operations in compliance with GLP and cGMP or similar standards imposed by U.S. and/or applicable foreign regulatory authorities, including the FDA and EMA. Any of these regulatory authorities may take action against a contract manufacturer who violates GLP and cGMP. Failure of our manufacturers to comply with FDA, EMA or other applicable regulations may cause us to curtail or stop the manufacture of such products until we obtain regulatory compliance, and could subject us to penalties.\nWe may not be able to obtain sufficient quantities of our compounds if we are unable to secure manufacturers when needed, or if our designated manufacturers do not have the capacity or otherwise fail to manufacture compounds according to our schedule and specifications or fail to comply with cGMP regulations. In particular, in connection with the transition\nof the manufacturing of drug supply to successor vendors, we could face logistical, scaling or other challenges that may adversely affect supply. Furthermore, in order to ultimately obtain and maintain applicable regulatory approvals, any manufacturers we utilize are required to consistently produce the respective compounds in commercial quantities and of specified quality or execute fill-finish services on a repeated basis and document their ability to do so, which is referred to as process validation. Even if our compound manufacturing processes obtain regulatory approval and sufficient supply is available to complete clinical trials necessary for regulatory approval, there are no guarantees we will be able to supply the quantities necessary to effect a commercial launch of the applicable drug, or once launched, to satisfy ongoing demand. Any shortage could also impair our ability to deliver contractually required supply quantities to applicable collaborators, as well as to complete any additional planned clinical trials.\nWe also rely on third-party service providers for certain warehousing, transportation, sales, order processing, distribution and cash collection services. With regard to the distribution of our compounds, we depend on third-party distributors to act in accordance with Good Distribution Practices, or GDP, and the distribution process and facilities are subject to continuing regulation by applicable regulatory authorities with respect to the distribution and storage of products.\nIn addition, we depend on medical institutions and CROs (together with their respective agents) to conduct clinical trials and associated activities in compliance with Good Clinical Practices, or GCP, and in accordance with our timelines, expectations and requirements. To the extent any such third parties are delayed in achieving or fail to meet our clinical trial enrollment expectations, fail to conduct our trials in accordance with GCP or study protocol or otherwise take actions outside of our control or without our consent, our business may be harmed. Furthermore, we conduct clinical trials in foreign countries, subjecting us to additional risks and challenges, including as a result of the engagement of foreign medical institutions and foreign CROs, who may be less experienced with regard to regulatory matters applicable to us and may have different standards of medical care.\nWith regard to certain of the foregoing clinical trial operations and stages in the manufacturing and distribution chain of our compounds, we rely on single vendors. In the event pacritinib is approved, we will initially have only one commercial supplier for pacritinib. The use of single vendors for core operational activities, such as clinical trial operations, manufacturing and distribution, and the resulting lack of diversification, exposes us to the risk of a material interruption in service related to these single, outside vendors. As a result, our exposure to this concentration risk could harm our business.\nWe are party to a loan and security agreement that contains operating and financial covenants that may restrict our business and financing activities and we may be required to repay the outstanding indebtedness in an event of default, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn November 2017, we entered into a loan and security agreement with Silicon Valley Bank, which was amended in May 2018, the proceeds of which were partially used to repay in full all outstanding indebtedness under a prior loan and security agreement.\nBorrowings under this loan and security agreement are secured by substantially all of our assets except intellectual property and subject to certain other exceptions. The loan and security agreement restricts our ability to take various actions, and we are required under our loan agreement and security agreement to comply with various affirmative covenants, which may restrict our ability to finance our operations, engage in business activities or expand or fully pursue our business strategies. A breach of any of these restrictions or covenants could result in a default under the loan and security agreement, which could cause all of the outstanding indebtedness under the facility to become immediately due and payable.\nIf we are unable to recruit, retain, integrate and motivate senior management, other key personnel and directors, or if such persons are unable to perform effectively, our business could suffer.\nOur future success depends, in part, on our ability to continue to attract and retain senior management, other key personnel and directors to enable the execution of our business plan and to identify and pursue new opportunities. Additionally, our productivity and the quality of our operations are dependent on our ability to integrate and train our new personnel quickly and effectively.\nIf we are unable to continue to provide directors and officers sufficient liability insurance at affordable rates or at all, or if directors and officers perceive our ability to do so in the future to be limited, it may become increasingly more difficult to attract and retain management and qualified directors to serve on our Board of Directors.\nThe loss of the services of senior management, other key personnel or directors and/or the inability to timely attract or integrate such persons could significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our development and strategic objectives and may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe may encounter difficulties in managing our expected growth and in expanding our operations successfully.\nAdvancing our lead product candidate, pacritinib, through the product development and, if approved, commercialization process will require us to develop or expand our development, regulatory, manufacturing, medical affairs, marketing and sales capabilities or contract with third parties to provide these capabilities for us. We must also successfully integrate the employees and operations related to the development of pacritinib. Maintaining additional relationships and managing our future growth will impose significant added responsibilities on members of our management. We must be able to manage our development efforts and clinical trials effectively, hire, train and integrate additional management, development, medical affairs, administrative and sales and marketing personnel, improve our managerial, development, operational and finance systems, and expand our facilities, all of which may impose a strain on our administrative and operational infrastructure. Our future financial performance will depend, in part, on our ability to manage this growth effectively. We may not be able to accomplish these tasks; which failure could prevent us from successfully developing and commercializing pacritinib.\nIf we are unable to in-license or acquire additional product candidates, our future product portfolio and potential profitability could be harmed.\nOne component of our business strategy is the in-licensing and acquisition of drug compounds developed by other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies or academic research laboratories, such as pacritinib. Competition for new promising compounds and commercial products can be intense. If we are not able to identify future in-licensing or acquisition opportunities and enter into arrangements on acceptable terms, our future product portfolio and potential profitability could be harmed.\nWe may owe additional amounts for VAT related to our operations in Europe.\nOur European operations are subject to the Value Added Tax, or VAT, which is usually applied to all goods and services purchased and sold throughout Europe. We historically carried out research and development activities in Italy and incurred value added tax, or VAT, from Italian suppliers on the acquisition of goods and services in Italy. This VAT should be considered as an input VAT credit. We treated the majority of our sales made in Italy without output VAT (on the basis that the supplies should be considered outside the scope of Italian VAT). This resulted in the value of input VAT exceeding the value of output VAT, and accordingly we submitted a refund claim for the VAT. The Italian Tax Authority, or the ITA, has challenged the treatment of the sales transactions and claimed that the sales transactions made by us should have been subject to output VAT.\nFurther information pertaining to these cases can be found in Part II, Item 8, \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Note 14. Commitments and Contingencies\" and is incorporated by reference herein. If the final decision of the Italian Supreme Court is unfavorable to us, or if, in the interim, the ITA were to make a demand for payment and we were to be unsuccessful in suspending collection efforts, we may be requested to pay to the ITA an amount up to \u20ac4.3 million, or approximately $5.3 million converted using the currency exchange rate as of December 31, 2020, including interest and penalties for the period lapsed between the date in which the assessments were issued and the date of effective payment.\nWe are currently subject to certain regulatory and legal proceedings, and may in the future be subject to additional proceedings and/or allegations of wrong-doing, which could harm our financial condition and operating results.\nWe are currently, and may in the future be, subject to regulatory matters and legal claims, including possible securities, derivative, consumer protection and other types of proceedings pursued by individuals, entities or regulatory bodies. See Part II, Item 8, \"Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements - Note 14. Commitments and Contingencies \" regarding the regulatory matters and legal claims in which we are currently involved. Litigation and regulatory proceedings are subject to inherent uncertainties, and we have had and may in the future have unfavorable rulings and settlements. Adverse outcomes may result in significant monetary damages and penalties or injunctive relief against us. It is possible that our financial condition and operating results could be harmed in any period in which the effect of an unfavorable final outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable. If an unfavorable ruling were to occur in any of the legal proceedings we are or may be subject to, our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects could be harmed. The ultimate outcome of litigation and other claims is subject to inherent uncertainties, and our view of these matters may change in the future.\nIn addition, our insurance is subject to high deductibles and there is no guarantee that the insurance will cover any specific claim that we currently face or may face in the future, or that it will be adequate to cover all potential liabilities and damages. In the event of negative publicity resulting from allegations of wrong-doing and/or an adverse outcome under any currently pending or future lawsuit, our business could be materially harmed.\nOur net operating losses may not be available to reduce future income tax liability.\nWe have substantial tax loss carryforwards for U.S. federal income tax purposes, but our ability to use such carryforwards to offset future income or tax liability is limited under section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, as a result of prior changes in the stock ownership of our company. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change net operating loss carryforwards, or other pre-change tax attributes, to offset U.S. federal and state taxable income and taxes may be subject to limitations. Moreover, future changes in the ownership of our stock, including those resulting from issuance of shares of our common stock upon exercise of outstanding warrants, may further limit our ability to use our net operating losses.\nWe could be subject to additional income tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and certain foreign jurisdictions. We use significant judgment in evaluating our worldwide income-tax provision. During the ordinary course of business, we conduct many transactions for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are subject to audit in various jurisdictions, and such jurisdictions may assess additional income tax against us. Although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income-tax provisions and accruals. The results of an audit or litigation could have a material effect on our operating results or cash flows in the period or periods for which that determination is made.\nWe may be subject to claims relating to improper handling, storage or disposal of hazardous materials.\nOur research and development activities involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, chemicals and various radioactive compounds. We are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations, both internationally and domestically, governing the use, manufacture, storage, handlings, treatment, transportation and disposal of such materials and certain waste products and employee safety and health matters. In the event of such an accident, we could be held liable for any damages that result and any such liability not covered by insurance could exceed our resources.\nIf we or the third parties upon whom we depend are adversely affected by natural disasters or other events, our business continuity and disaster recovery plans may not adequately protect us from such interruptions.\nOur headquarters are located in Seattle, Washington. Any unplanned event, such as flood, fire, explosion, earthquake, tsunami, extreme weather condition, power shortage, power outage, telecommunication failure, or other natural or man-made accidents or incidents could disrupt our operations. If a natural disaster or other event occurred that prevented us from using all or a significant portion of our headquarters, that damaged critical infrastructure, such as the manufacturing facilities of our third-party contract manufacturers, or that otherwise disrupted operations, it may be difficult or, in certain cases, impossible for us to continue our business for a substantial period of time. We may not carry sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate us for all losses that may occur. The disaster recovery and business continuity plans we have in place may not be adequate in the event of a serious disaster or similar event. We may incur substantial expenses as a result of a natural disaster or other event, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, and we could potentially lose valuable data and other items. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe will incur a variety of costs for, and may never realize the anticipated benefits of, acquisitions, collaborations or other strategic transactions.\nWe evaluate and undertake acquisitions, collaborations and other strategic transactions from time to time. The process of negotiating these transactions, as well as integrating any acquisitions and implementing any strategic alliances, may result in operating difficulties and expenditures. In addition, these transactions may require significant management attention that would otherwise be available for ongoing development of our business, whether or not any such transaction is ever consummated. These undertakings could also result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities and/or amortization expenses related to intangible assets, and we may never realize the anticipated benefits.\nRisks Related to the Development, Clinical Testing and Regulatory Approval of Our Product Candidates\nThe regulatory approval process for pacritinib has been subject to delay and uncertainty. While the dose-exploration trial for pacritinib has been completed, further registration of clinical trials for pacritinib could be subject to further delay or we could be prevented from further studying pacritinib or seeking its commercialization, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAlthough the independent data monitoring committee, or IDMC, completed its fourth and final interim safety review in May 2019 and recommended that the PAC203 Phase 2 trial continue without modification, we cannot be certain that the PACIFICA Phase 3 trial will be sufficient for regulatory approval. Even if the current primary endpoint of the PACIFICA Phase 3 trial is achieved, the FDA may determine that the benefit/risk profile of pacritinib at the dose selected for the PACIFICA Phase 3 trial does not support approval based on the results of such trial, previously identified FDA concerns regarding safety and dosing limitations of pacritinib, including FDA concerns identified in connection with our previous PERSIST-1 and 2 trials, or otherwise. We also cannot be certain of the anticipated timing of the results from the PACIFICA Phase 3 trial. The FDA may request additional information regarding pacritinib or require us to pursue new clinical safety trials with changes to, among other things, protocol, study design or sample size, which could cause significant delays in completion of these studies.\nAdditionally, in July 2019 we announced an expanded access program, or EAP, for pacritinib for patients in the PAC203 Phase 2 trial. Patients who receive access to unapproved drugs through compassionate use or EAPs have life-threatening illnesses and generally have exhausted all other available therapies. In April 2020 we announced the initiation of PRE-VENT, a Phase 3 trial evaluating pacritinib in hospitalized patients with severe COVID-19.The risk for serious adverse events, including those which may be unrelated to pacritinib, in these patient populations is high and could have a negative impact on the safety profile of pacritinib, which could cause significant delays or impair our ability to obtain regulatory approval for pacritinib.\nThe submission of new marketing applications, complying with any additional requests for information from the FDA or EMA or making any changes to study design or sample size may be time-consuming, expensive and delay or prevent our ability to continue to study pacritinib. If we are unable to adequately address any previous or further recommendations, concerns, requests, or objections in a manner satisfactory to the FDA or EMA, as applicable, in a timely manner, or at all, we could be delayed or prevented from seeking commercialization of pacritinib.\nWe may amend the clinical protocols for our product candidates. The protocol amendment process requires review and approval by several review bodies, who may not accept the amendments in the form submitted, or at all, which may delay our planned enhancements to the clinical development program and/or limit or change the type of information we may gather from our studies.\nIn early October 2019, we received correspondence from the FDA asking us to consider incorporating change in TSS at week 24 as a co-primary endpoint for the PACIFICA Phase 3 trial. In January 2020, we reached agreement on an accelerated approval pathway for pacritinib. In March 2020, we submitted an amended PACIFICA pivotal Phase 3 trial protocol to allow for the primary analysis of SVR rates on the first 168 patients, with an end-of-study analysis of TSS and OS following the full enrollment of 348 patients. Such a change to the trial protocol will require an increase in the number of patients evaluated over the course of the trial, as well as the costs and time required to complete the trial. Making any changes to clinical protocols is time-consuming and expensive and may delay or prevent our ability to continue to study pacritinib. If our changes to the trial design do not adequately address any previous or further recommendations, concerns, requests, or objections in a manner satisfactory to the FDA or EMA, as applicable, in a timely manner, or at all, we could be delayed or prevented from seeking commercialization of pacritinib.\nIf development and commercialization collaborations we enter into are not successful, or if we are unable to enter into additional collaborations, we may not be able to effectively develop and/or commercialize our compounds, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nHistorically, we have entered into development and commercialization collaborations to help advance the development of our product candidates. We evaluate collaboration opportunities from time to time and if we enter into such collaborations in the future, our business may become increasingly dependent on the success of such collaborations. Additionally, if we do not successfully enter into additional collaborations when needed, we may be unable to further develop and commercialize the applicable compounds, generate revenues to sustain or grow our business or achieve profitability, which would harm our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects.\nCompounds that appear promising in research and development may fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of applicable regulatory authorities, and top-line or preliminary clinical trial data reports may ultimately differ from actual results, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nCompounds that appear promising in research and development may fail to reach later stages of development.\nIn addition, from time to time, we report top-line data for clinical trials. Top-line results may differ from future results, or different conclusions or considerations may qualify such results once existing data have been more fully evaluated. In addition, third parties, including regulatory agencies, may not accept or agree with our assumptions, estimations, calculations or analyses or may interpret or weigh the importance of data differently, which could impact the value of the particular program, the approvability or commercialization of the particular compound and our business in general.\nIf the development of pacritinib is delayed or fails, or if top-line or preliminary clinical trial data reported differ from actual results, our development costs may increase and the ability to commercialize pacritinib may be harmed, which could harm our business, financial condition, operating results or prospects.\nIf we encounter difficulties enrolling patients in our clinical trials, our clinical development activities could be delayed or otherwise adversely affected.\nWe may experience difficulties in patient enrollment in our clinical trials for a variety of reasons. The timely completion of clinical trials in accordance with their protocols depends, among other things, on our ability to enroll a sufficient number of patients who remain in the trial until its conclusion. Additionally, our clinical trials compete with other clinical trials for similar product candidates. This competition reduces the number and types of patients and qualified clinical investigators available to us. Since the number of qualified clinical investigators is limited, we expect to conduct some of our clinical trials at the same clinical trial sites that some of our competitors use, which will reduce the number of patients who are available for our clinical trials in such clinical trial site. We may also encounter difficulties finding a clinical trial site at which to conduct our trials. Moreover, because our product candidates are experimental, potential patients and their doctors may be inclined to use conventional therapies rather than enroll patients in any one of our clinical trials.\nDelays in patient enrollment may result in increased costs or affect the timing or outcome of our planned clinical trials, which could prevent completion of these clinical trials and adversely affect our ability to advance the development of pacritinib or other compounds we may develop.\nWe may be required to suspend, repeat or terminate clinical trials if they are not conducted in accordance with regulatory requirements, the results are negative or inconclusive, or the trials are not well-designed.\nRegulatory agencies, IRBs or data safety monitoring boards may at any time recommend the temporary or permanent discontinuation of our clinical trials or request that we cease using investigators in the clinical trials if they believe that the clinical trials are not being conducted in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements, or that they present an unacceptable safety risk to participants. Clinical trials must be conducted in accordance with GCPs or other applicable foreign regulatory authority guidelines. In addition, clinical trials must be conducted with product candidates produced in accordance with applicable cGMPs. Clinical trial data may be rejected by the FDA or foreign regulatory authorities or clinical trials may be suspended by the FDA, foreign regulatory authorities, or us for various reasons.\nIf we elect or are forced to suspend or terminate a clinical trial of any of our current or future product candidates, the commercial prospects for that product will be harmed and our ability to generate product revenue from that product may be delayed or eliminated. Furthermore, any of these events could prevent us or our partners from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product and could substantially increase the costs of commercializing our product candidates and impair our ability to generate revenue from the commercialization of these products either by us or by our collaboration partners.\nIf we are unable to expedite the regulatory approval process for pacritinib in our clinical trials, we may be required to pursue strategic alternatives for the development of pacritinib and/or our company, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe FDA may grant accelerated approval to a product designed to treat a serious or life-threatening condition that provides meaningful therapeutic benefit over available therapies upon a determination that the product has an effect on a surrogate endpoint or intermediate clinical endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit. A surrogate endpoint under an accelerated approval pathway may be used in cases in which the advantage of a new drug over available therapy\nmay not be a direct therapeutic advantage, but is a clinically important improvement from a patient and public health perspective. Even if a product candidate is granted accelerated approval based on a surrogate endpoint, such accelerated approval is contingent on the sponsor\u2019s agreement to conduct one or more post-approval confirmatory trials that demonstrate a clinical benefit. Moreover, the FDA may withdraw approval of a product candidate or indication approved under the accelerated approval pathway for a variety of reasons.\nIn January 2020, we reached agreement on an accelerated approval pathway for pacritinib and in September 2020, we reached an agreement with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, to submit a New Drug Application, or NDA, for the potential accelerated approval of pacritinib as a treatment for myelofibrosis patients with severe thrombocytopenia. In October 2020, we commenced our rolling NDA submission. The NDA is based on the available data from our completed Phase 3 PERSIST-1 and PERSIST-2 trials and the Phase 2 PAC203 dose-ranging trial. Completion of the NDA submission is anticipated in the first quarter of 2021.\nWe or any collaboration partners we may work with may not obtain or maintain the regulatory approvals required to develop or commercialize pacritinib or any other compounds we may develop in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to rigorous and extensive regulation by the FDA in the United States and by comparable agencies in other jurisdictions, including the EMA in the European Union. Pacritinib is currently in clinical development. Pacritinib may not be marketed in the United States until it has been approved by the FDA and may not be marketed in other jurisdictions until it has received approval from the appropriate foreign regulatory agencies, and requires development and extensive clinical investigation before submission of any regulatory application for marketing approval. Obtaining regulatory approval requires substantial time, effort and financial resources, and we may not be able to obtain approval of pacritinib or any other product candidate on a timely basis, or at all. Preclinical and clinical data can be interpreted in different ways, which could delay, limit or preclude regulatory approval. The FDA, the EMA and other foreign regulatory agencies can delay, limit or deny approval of a compound for many reasons. In particular, if pacritinib is not approved at all or quickly enough to provide net revenues to defray our operating expenses, our business, financial condition, operating results and prospects could be harmed.\nDisruptions at government agencies could negatively affect the review of our regulatory submissions.\nThe ability of the FDA to review and clear or approve regulatory submissions can be affected by a variety of factors. Disruptions at the FDA and other agencies may also slow the time necessary for new drugs, medical devices, and biologics or modifications to cleared or approved drugs, medical devices, and biologics to be reviewed and/or approved by necessary government agencies, which would adversely affect our business. For example, over the last several years, the U.S. government has shut down several times and certain regulatory agencies, such as the FDA, have had to furlough critical FDA employees and stop critical activities.\nSeparately, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the FDA postponed certain of its manufacturing facility inspections. If a prolonged government shutdown occurs, or if global health concerns continue to impact the FDA or other regulatory authorities, it could significantly impact the ability of the FDA or other regulatory authorities to timely review and process our regulatory submissions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe pharmaceutical business is subject to increasing government price controls and other restrictions on pricing, reimbursement and access to drugs, which could adversely affect our future revenues and profitability.\nTo the extent our products are developed, commercialized and introduced to market, they may not be considered cost-effective and third-party or government reimbursement might not be available or sufficient. Globally, governmental and other third-party payors are becoming increasingly aggressive in attempting to contain health care costs by strictly controlling, directly or indirectly, pricing and reimbursement and, in some cases, limiting or denying coverage altogether on the basis of a variety of justifications, and we expect pressures on pricing and reimbursement from both governments and private payors inside and outside the United States to continue.\nPost-approval or authorization regulatory reviews and obligations often result in significant expense and marketing limitations, and any failure to satisfy such ongoing obligations could negatively affect our business.\nEven if a product receives regulatory approval or authorization, as applicable, we are and will continue to be subject to numerous regulations and statutes regulating the manner of obtaining reimbursement for and selling the product. Regulatory authorities may also impose new restrictions on continued product marketing or may require the withdrawal of a product from the market if adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency are discovered following approval.\nAny other failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in warning or untitled letters from the FDA, which could negatively affect our business, financial condition, operating results or prospects.\nWe may be subject to fines, penalties, injunctions and other sanctions if we are deemed to be promoting the use of our products for non-FDA-approved, or off-label, uses.\nOur business and future growth depend on the development, ultimate sale and use of products that are subject to FDA, EMA and or other regulatory agencies regulation, clearance and approval. Under the FDCA and other laws, we are prohibited from promoting our products for off-label uses, or uses not approved by the FDA. We may also be subject to various federal and state physician payment transparency laws, including the federal Physician Payments Sunshine Act. This means that in the United States, we may not make claims about the safety or effectiveness of our products and may not proactively discuss or provide information on the uses of our products that are not approved by the FDA, unless otherwise allowed by the FDA by policy or other guidance.\nIf our promotional activities are found to be in violation of applicable law or if we agree to a settlement in connection with an enforcement action, we would likely face significant fines and penalties and would likely be required to substantially change our sales, promotion, grant and educational activities.\nWe are subject to numerous laws and regulations related to health care fraud and abuse, false claims, anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, such as the U.S. Anti-Kickback Statute and the FCPA, in which violations of these laws could result in substantial penalties and prosecution.\nIn the United States, we are subject to various state and federal fraud and abuse laws, including, without limitation, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the federal False Claims Act. There are similar laws in other countries. These laws may impact, among other things, the sales, marketing and education programs for our products. Any allegation, investigation, or violation of these domestic health care fraud and abuse laws could result in government or internal investigations, significant diversion of resources, exclusion from government health care reimbursement programs and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, significant fines, penalties, or other financial consequences, any of which may ultimately have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFor our sales and operations outside the United States, we are similarly subject to various heavily-enforced anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, such as the FCPA, as amended, U.K. Bribery Act, and similar laws around the world. We face significant risks if we, which includes our third parties, fail to comply with the FCPA and other anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws.\nWe leverage various third parties to sell our products and conduct our business abroad. We, our commercial partners and our other third-party intermediaries, including collaborators and licensees, may have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or state-owned or affiliated entities and may be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of these third-party business partners and intermediaries, our employees, representatives, contractors, partners, collaborators, licensees and agents, even if we do not explicitly authorize such activities.\nAny violation of the FCPA, other applicable anti-bribery, anti-corruption laws, and anti-money laundering laws could result in whistleblower complaints, adverse media coverage, investigations, loss of export privileges, severe criminal or civil sanctions and, in the case of the FCPA, suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracts, which could have a material and adverse effect on our reputation, business, operating results and prospects. In addition, responding to any enforcement action or related investigation may result in a materially significant diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources and significant defense costs and other professional fees.\nOur employees, collaborators and other personnel may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, which could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nWe are exposed to the risk of fraud or other misconduct by our employees, collaborators, vendors, principal investigators, consultants and commercial partners. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional failures to comply with the regulations of the FDA, EMA and other regulators, providing inaccurate or misleading information to the FDA, EMA and other regulators, failure to comply with data privacy and security and healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations in the United States and abroad, reporting inaccurate financial information or clinical data or failing to disclose unauthorized activities to us.\nVarious laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Any misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and cause serious harm to our reputation. We have adopted a code of conduct applicable to all of our employees, officers, directors, agents and representatives, including consultants, but it is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent misconduct may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws and regulations.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf any of our license agreements for intellectual property underlying our product candidates are terminated, we may lose the right to develop or market that product candidate.\nWe have acquired or licensed intellectual property from third parties, including patent applications and patents relating to pacritinib. Some of our product development programs depend on our ability to maintain rights under license agreements relating to this licensed intellectual property. Each licensor of this intellectual property has the power to terminate its agreement with us if we fail to meet our obligations under that agreement. If we default under any of these agreements, we may lose our right to market and sell any products based on the intellectual property licensed under these agreements and may be forced to cease operations, liquidate our assets and possibly seek bankruptcy protection. Bankruptcy may result in the termination of these agreements.\nWe hold rights under numerous patents that we have acquired or licensed or that protect inventions originating from our research and development, and the expiration of any of these patents would enable our competitors to use the inventions that are the subject of such patents in competition with us.\nWe dedicate significant resources to protecting our intellectual property, which is important to our business. We have filed numerous patent applications in the United States and various other countries seeking protection of inventions originating from our research and development, and we have also obtained rights to various patents and patent applications under licenses with third parties and through acquisitions. We have pending patent applications or issued patents in the United States and foreign countries directed to pacritinib and other product candidates. Patents for the individual products extend for varying periods according to the date of the patent filing or grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained.\nIn addition to our patent rights, we rely, to the extent possible, trade secret and contractual protections for our know-how and other unpatented technology. Ultimately, to the extent any of our product candidates are not protected by patent rights our competitors would be free to use inventions embodied in our product candidates to which they have access to compete with us.\nIf we fail to adequately protect our intellectual property, our competitive position and the potential for long-term success could be harmed.\nDevelopment and protection of our intellectual property are critical to our business. If we do not adequately protect our intellectual property, competitors may be able to practice our technologies, including the inventions embodied in our product candidates.\nThe U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or PTO, has not established a consistent policy regarding the breadth of claims that it will allow in pharmaceutical and biotechnology patents. Patent applications in which we have rights may never issue as patents, and the claims of any issued patents may not afford meaningful protection for our product candidates or technologies. In addition, patents issued to us or our licensors may be challenged and subsequently narrowed, invalidated, circumvented or found unenforceable. Litigation, interference or derivation proceedings or other governmental proceedings that we may become involved in with respect to our patent rights or our proprietary technologies or the proprietary technologies of others could result in substantial cost to us.\nWe also rely upon trade secrets to protect our proprietary know-how and continuing technological innovation to enable us to remain competitive. Third parties may independently develop such know-how or innovations or otherwise obtain access to such know-how or technology. While we require our employees, consultants, corporate partners and other third parties with access to our proprietary information to enter into confidentiality agreements, these agreements may not be honored and may be difficult to enforce.\nPatent litigation is widespread in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry, and any patent litigation in which we become involved could harm our business.\nWe may not be able to successfully challenge the validity of third-party patents and could be required to pay substantial damages, possibly including treble damages, for past infringement and attorneys\u2019 fees if it is ultimately determined that our products infringe such patents. Further, we may be prohibited from selling our products before we obtain a license, which, if available at all, may require us to pay substantial royalties.\nMoreover, third parties may challenge the patents that have been issued or licensed to us. There can be no assurance that our product candidates or technologies will not be found in the future to infringe upon the rights of others or be infringed upon by others. In such a case, others may assert infringement claims against us, and should we be found to infringe upon their patents, or otherwise impermissibly utilize their intellectual property, we might be forced to pay damages, potentially including treble damages. In addition to any damages we might have to pay, we may be required to obtain licenses from the holders of this intellectual property, enter into royalty agreements or redesign our compounds so as not to utilize this intellectual property, each of which may prove to be uneconomical or otherwise impossible. Conversely, we may not always be able to successfully pursue our claims against others that infringe upon our technology and the technology exclusively licensed from any third parties. Thus, the proprietary nature of our technology or technology licensed by us may not provide adequate protection against competitors.\nFurthermore, our employees may be subject to claims that we or these employees have used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of the former employers. If we are unsuccessful in our defense of such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose the right to use valuable intellectual property rights relating to our product candidates or technologies. A loss of key research personnel work product could hamper or prevent our ability to commercialize certain potential products, which could severely harm our business. Even if such claims against us are without merit, or if we challenge the validity of issued patents that are asserted against us, lawsuits in which such claims could be asserted or challenges could be made take significant time, may, even if resolved in our favor, be expensive and divert management attention from other business activities requiring attention. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of any litigation relating to intellectual property could limit our ability to continue our operations.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting, enforcing and defending patents on our product or product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our or our licensors\u2019 intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States can be less extensive than those in the United States. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States. Consequently, we and our licensors may not be able to prevent third parties from practicing our and our licensors\u2019 inventions in all countries outside the United States, or from selling or importing products made using our and our licensors\u2019 inventions in and into the United States or other jurisdictions. Competitors may use our and our licensors\u2019 technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we and our licensors have patent protection, but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States. These products may compete with our product and product candidates and our and our licensors\u2019 patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe market price of shares of our common stock is extremely volatile, which may affect our ability to raise capital in the future and may subject the value of your investment in our securities to sudden decreases.\nThe market price for securities of biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, including ours, historically has been highly volatile, and the market from time to time has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that are unrelated to the operating performance of such companies. For example, during the 12-month period ended March 10, 2021, our stock price ranged from a low of $0.62 to a high of $4.03. Fluctuations in the market price or liquidity of our common stock may harm the value of your investment in our common stock. The Nasdaq Stock Market, or the Nasdaq, and biopharmaceutical companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. In addition, broad market and industry factors may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nWe may not be able to maintain our listing on the Nasdaq, or trading on the Nasdaq may otherwise be halted or suspended, which may negatively impact the price of our common stock.\nWe have in the past and may in the future fail to comply with the Nasdaq requirements. If our common stock ceases to be listed for trading on the Nasdaq for any reason, it may harm our stock price, increase the volatility of our stock price, decrease the level of trading activity and make it more difficult for investors to buy or sell shares of our common stock. Our failure to maintain a listing on the Nasdaq may constitute an event of default under our loan and security agreement and any future indebtedness, which would accelerate the maturity date of such debt or trigger other obligations. In addition, certain institutional investors that are not permitted to own securities of non-listed companies may be required to sell their shares adversely affecting the market price of our common stock. If we are not listed on the Nasdaq, our ability to raise capital will be adversely impacted. Additionally, for so long as our non-affiliate public float does not exceed $75 million, the amount of securities that we may sell pursuant to registration statements on Form S-3 will be limited to the equivalent of one-third of our public float, which will limit our ability to file or use shelf registration statements on Form S-3 and further limit our ability to raise capital. We have relied significantly on shelf registration statements on Form S-3 for most of our financings in recent years, so any such limitations may harm our ability to raise the capital we need.\nFuture financing, strategic and other activities may require us to increase the number of authorized shares in our certificate of incorporation. An inability to secure requisite stockholder approval for such increases could materially and adversely impact our ability to fund our operations.\nAt our 2020 annual meeting of stockholders, we sought and received approval of an amendment to our certificate of incorporation to increase the total number of authorized shares and the total number of authorized shares of our common stock and we may seek approval to increase the number of authorized shares again in the future. Without future additional increases in the number of authorized shares, we may be constrained in our ability to raise capital when needed, and may lose important business opportunities, which could adversely affect our financial performance, growth and ability to continue our operations. Even if we obtain approval to further increase the number of authorized shares, we are required under the Nasdaq Marketplace Rules to obtain stockholder approval for certain issuances of additional equity securities. However, we might not be successful in obtaining the required stockholder approval for any future issuance that requires stockholder approval pursuant to applicable rules and regulations. If we are unable to obtain financing or our financing options are limited due to stockholder approval difficulties, such failure may harm our ability to continue operations.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents, under Delaware law and in other applicable instruments could make removal of incumbent management or an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of deterring or delaying attempts by our stockholders to remove or replace management, to commence proxy contests or to effect changes in control. In addition, as a Delaware corporation, we are subject to Delaware\u2019s anti-takeover statute, which imposes restrictions on some transactions between a corporation and certain interested stockholders. Our shareholder rights plan expired pursuant to its terms on December 2, 2018, and was not replaced; however, the Board may, subject to its fiduciary duties under applicable law, choose to implement a similar plan in the future. Likewise, because our principal executive offices are located in Washington, the anti-takeover provisions of the Washington Business Corporation Act may apply to us under certain circumstances now or in the future. These provisions could also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company.\nIf we fail to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results, which could adversely affect our investors' confidence, our business and the trading prices of our securities.\nIf we fail to maintain the adequacy of our internal controls, we may be unable to provide financial information in a timely and reliable manner within the time periods required for our financial reporting under SEC rules and regulations. Internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements or omissions in our financial statements because of their inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error, the circumvention or overriding of controls or fraud. We implemented a reduction in force in 2018, which may result in changes to our internal controls over financial reporting. The changes could relate to different employees performing internal control activities than those who have previously performed those activities or revisions to our actual control activities as we evaluate the appropriate internal control structure after our workforce reduction. A changing internal control environment increases the risk that our system of internal controls is not designed effectively or that internal control activities will not occur as designed. The occurrence of or failure to remediate a significant deficiency material weakness may adversely affect our reputation and business and the market price of shares of our common stock.\nRaising additional capital could cause you to incur dilution and could cause the market price of our common stock to fall.\nAs of December 31, 2020, options to purchase 15,595,933 shares of our common stock with a weighted-average exercise price of $2.09 per share were outstanding. The exercise of any of these options would result in dilution to current stockholders. Further, because we will need to raise additional capital to fund our operations and clinical development programs, we may in the future sell substantial amounts of common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common stock. Pursuant to our equity incentive plans, our compensation committee is authorized to grant equity-based incentive awards to our employees, directors and consultants. Future option grants and issuances of common stock under our share-based compensation plans may have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nThese future issuances of common stock or common stock-related securities, together with the exercise of outstanding options and any additional shares of common stock issued in connection with acquisitions, if any, may result in further dilution to our existing stockholders, and new investors could gain rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research reports about our business, or if they issue an adverse opinion about our business, the market price of our common stock and the trading volume of our common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If too few securities or industry analysts cover our company, the market price of our common stock would likely be negatively impacted. If securities and industry analysts who cover us downgrade our common stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the market price of our common stock would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our common stock could decrease, which might cause the market price of our common stock and the trading volume of our common stock to decline.", "PERMNO": 84604, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "CTIC"}
