{"cik": "889348", "company": "CPI AEROSTRUCTURES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-08-25", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIn addition to other risks and uncertainties described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the following material risk factors should be carefully considered in evaluating our business because such factors may have a significant impact on our business, operating results, liquidity and financial condition. As a result of the risk factors set forth below, actual results did and could continue to differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements.\nRisks Related to the Restatement of our Prior Period Consolidated Financial Statements and Material Weaknesses in our Internal Control\nWe have restated our consolidated financial statements for several prior periods, which has affected and may continue to affect investor confidence, our stock price, our ability to raise capital in the future, and our reputation with our customers, which has resulted and may continue to result in stockholder litigation and may reduce customer confidence in our ability to complete new contract opportunities.\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K includes restated consolidated financial statements as of and for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018. The restatement of our consolidated financial statements primarily reflects the correction of certain errors relating to our recognition of revenue, which errors resulted from an incorrect application of U.S. GAAP, as described in more detail elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Such restatement has had and may continue to have the effect of eroding investor confidence in the Company and our financial reporting and accounting practices and processes, has negatively impacted and may continue to negatively impact the trading price of our common stock, has resulted and may continue to result in stockholder litigation, may make it more difficult for us to raise capital on acceptable terms, if at all, and may negatively impact our reputation with our customers and cause customers to place new orders with other companies.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, which did and could continue to, if not remediated, adversely affect our ability to report our financial condition and results of operations in a timely and accurate manner.\nWe have concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2018 or December 31, 2019 due to the existence of material weaknesses in such controls, and we have also concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2019 due to material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, all as described in Part II, Item 9A, \u201cControls and Procedures\u201d of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Although we have initiated remediation measures to address the identified weaknesses, we cannot provide assurance that our remediation efforts will be adequate to allow us to conclude that such controls will be effective in the future. We also cannot assure you that additional material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will not arise or be identified in the future, either with respect to the Non-Reliance Periods or other periods. Management previously identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting in February 2019 in connection with the failure to identify, in a timely manner, the miscoding of an invoice in the Company\u2019s records and the resulting overstatement of revenue in the Company\u2019s Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the nine months ended September 30, 2018, by $927,257. We reviewed our financial closing process and identified corrective action to remediate the prior operating effectiveness of controls and, while we believe the implementation of the new control procedures was successful, we cannot assure you that our remediation of the revenue recognition error with respect to the Non-Reliance Periods will be similarly successful.\nWe intend to continue our remediation activities and to continue to improve our overall control environment and our operational and financial systems and infrastructure, as well as to continue to train, retain and manage our personnel who are essential to effective internal control. In doing so, we will continue to incur expenses and expend management\u2019s time on compliance-related issues. However, we cannot ensure that the steps that we have taken or will take will successfully remediate the errors. If we are unable to successfully complete our remediation efforts or favorably assess the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, our operating results, financial position, ability to accurately report our financial results and timely file our SEC reports, and our stock price could be adversely affected. Additionally, beginning in the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company and WMI are now operating as a consolidated entity, and the Company is using inventory valuation and cost collection software not previously required to be used. While we are confident in the accuracy of our December 31, 2019 inventory value using the new functionality of the current software and that controls over the valuation of inventory will be improved, there can be no assurance that these controls will be adequate to address all potential valuation issues that may arise in the future relating to the use of the new software, and new internal control may need to be developed.\nMoreover, because of the inherent limitations of any control system, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected and corrected on a timely basis, or at all. If we are unable to provide reliable and timely financial reports in the future, our business and reputation may be further harmed. Restated financial statements and failures in internal control may also cause us to fail to meet reporting obligations, negatively affect investor and customer confidence in our management and the accuracy of our financial statements and disclosures, result in events of default under our banking agreements, or result in adverse publicity and concerns from investors and customers, any of which could have a negative effect on the price of our common stock, subject us to regulatory investigations and penalties or additional stockholder litigation, and have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition.\nThe restatement of our consolidated financial statements for the Non-Reliance Periods has diverted, and our ongoing efforts to remediate our internal control may continue to divert management from the operation of our business. The absence of timely and accurate financial information has hindered and may in the future hinder our ability to effectively manage our business.\nThe restatement of our consolidated financial statements for the Non-Reliance Periods has diverted, and our ongoing efforts to remediate our internal control may continue to divert management from the operation of our business. The Board of Directors, members of management, and our accounting and other staff have spent significant time on the restatement and remediation and will continue to spend significant time on remediation of internal control over our financial reporting. These resources have been, and will likely continue to be, diverted from the strategic and day-to-day management of our business and may have an adverse effect on our ability to accomplish our strategic objectives.\nWe face litigation and regulatory action relating to the restatement of the Non-Reliance Period consolidated financial statements.\nOur Company and certain of our current and former executive officers and directors are defendants in litigation arising out of the errors in and restatements of our financial statements. Please see Part I, Item 3, \u201cLegal Proceedings.\u201d These proceedings may result in significant expenses and the diversion of management attention from our business. We cannot ensure that additional litigation or other claims by shareholders will not be brought in the future arising out of the same subject matter.\nAdditionally, the Company received a letter and subpoena from the SEC Division of Enforcement seeking the production of documents in connection with a non-public fact-finding inquiry relating to, among other things, the errors in and restatements of our financial statements, our October 16, 2018 equity offering, and the recent separation of our former Chief Financial Officers. The SEC letter states that the investigation and subpoena do not mean that the SEC has concluded that the Company or anyone else has violated the federal securities laws. We intend to fully cooperate with the SEC staff. However, we cannot predict the length, scope, or results of the investigation or the impact, if any, of the investigation on our results of operations. Please see Part I, Item 3, \u201cLegal Proceedings.\u201d We may also be subject to further examinations, investigations, proceedings and orders by regulatory authorities, including a cease and desist order, suspension of trading of our securities, delisting of our securities and/or the assessment of possible civil monetary penalties. Any such further actions could be expensive and damaging to our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant expenses related to the restatement and remediation of deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures, and any resulting litigation.\nWe have devoted and expect to continue to devote substantial internal and external resources towards remediation efforts relating to the restatement of our financial statements for the Non-Reliance Periods, the management review process and other efforts to implement effective internal control. Because of these efforts, we have incurred and expect that we will continue to incur significant fees and expenses for legal, accounting, financial and other consulting and professional services, as well as the implementation and maintenance of systems and processes that will need to be updated, supplemented or replaced. As described in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we have taken a number of steps in order to strengthen our accounting function so as to allow us to be able to provide timely and accurate financial reporting. However, we cannot assure you that these steps will be successful. To the extent these steps are not successful, we could be required to incur significant additional time and expense. The expenses we are incurring in this regard, as well as the substantial time devoted by our management towards identifying and addressing the internal control deficiencies, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe were in violation of various covenants under our credit facility with BankUnited as of March 31, 2018 through September 30, 2019, due to the errors in our Non-Reliance Periods consolidated financial statements as well as December 31, 2019. BankUnited has waived the covenant violation as of December 31, 2019, and has amended certain financial covenants, but there can be no assurance that we will not fall out of compliance with the amended covenants in the future.\nThe errors in our consolidated financial statements for the Non-Reliance Periods and our internal control material weaknesses caused us to be in violation of certain of the covenants under our credit facility (the \u201cBankUnited Facility\u201d) with BankUnited, N.A. as senior lender and administrative agent as of and after March 31, 2018. We have entered into an amendment to the BankUnited Facility, which includes, among other things, a waiver of the covenant violations and certain amendments to the financial covenants going forward; however, we cannot assure you that we will not violate the amended banking covenants in the future. BankUnited has agreed to waive each covenant violation under the Credit Agreement in connection with the previously disclosed errors in our financial statements for the Non-Reliance Periods and to prospectively waive the covenant violation for late delivery of our financial statements for the first three quarters of 2020. BankUnited agreed not to test our compliance with the financial covenants under the Credit Agreement for the first half of 2020. Financial covenant testing will resume for the quarter ending September 30, 2020. If we fall out of compliance with our banking covenants, BankUnited, N.A. may declare a default under the BankUnited Facility and, among other remedies, could declare the full amount of the BankUnited Facility immediately due and payable and could foreclose against our collateral. If this were to occur, we may be unable to secure outside financing, if needed, to fund ongoing operations and for other capital needs. Any sources of financing that may be available to us could also be at higher costs and require us to satisfy more restrictive covenants, which could limit or restrict our operations, cash flows and earnings. We cannot ensure that additional financing would be available to us, or be sufficient or available on satisfactory terms.\nWe are currently ineligible to use our existing shelf registration statement on Form S-3 or file a new registration statement on Form S-3 to register the offer and sale of securities, which could adversely affect our ability to raise future capital.\nWe did not file our Annual Report for the year ended December 31, 2019 or our Quarterly Report for the three months ended March 31, 2020 within the respective timeframes required by the SEC. We will regain status as a current filer when we file our Quarterly Report for the three months ended March 31, 2020. However, we will not be considered a timely filer and will not be eligible to offer and sell securities using our existing shelf registration statement on Form S-3 or file a new short-form registration statement on Form S-3 to register the offer and sale of our securities until twelve full calendar months from the date we regain status as a current filer. If we wish to register the offer and sale of our securities to the public prior to such time, we will be required to use the long-form registration statement, Form S-1, which may increase both our transaction costs and the amount of time required to complete the transaction. This may adversely affect our ability to raise funds, if we choose to do so.\nIf our common stock is delisted from the NYSE American exchange, our business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price could be adversely affected, and the liquidity of our stock and our ability to obtain financing could be impaired.\nOn April 17, 2020, we received a notice from NYSE Regulation, Inc. stating that, because we failed to file restated financial statements for the Non-Reliance Periods on or before April 14, 2020, we were not in compliance with the NYSE American exchange\u2019s continued listing standards under the timely filing criteria included in Section 1007 of the NYSE American Company Guide (\u201cCompany Guide\u201d). In accordance with Section 1007 of the Company Guide, we have six months from April 15, 2020, or until October 15, 2020, to file restated financial statements for the Non-Reliance Periods. This Annual Report on Form 10-K, along with the amended Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q/A which we filed prior to this Annual Report, constitute such filing and, accordingly, as of the date of this filing we should regain compliance. However, there can be no assurance that we will maintain such compliance or that we will not be delinquent in the future. Any such further delinquency could result in the delisting of our common stock from the NYSE American exchange, which would adversely affect our ability to attract new investors, decrease the liquidity of our outstanding shares of common stock, reduce our flexibility to raise additional capital, reduce the price at which our common stock trades, and increase the transaction costs inherent in trading such shares with overall negative effects for our stockholders.\nRisks Related to COVID-19\nThe impact of the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic on our operations, supply chain, and customers has impacted and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nIt is possible that the continued spread of COVID-19 could cause disruption in our supply chain or significantly increase the costs required to meet our contractual commitments, cause delay, or limit the ability of, the U.S. Government and other customers to perform, including making timely payments to us, negotiating contracts, performing quality inspections, accepting delivery of finished products, and cause other unpredictable events. The disruption of air travel has impacted demand for the commercial air industry. Commercial aircraft manufacturers are reducing production rates due to fewer expected aircraft deliveries and, as a result, may reduce demand for our products. There have been and may continue to be changes in our government and commercial customers\u2019 priorities and practices, as our customers confront competing budget priorities and more limited resources. These changes may impact current and future programs, procurements, and funding decisions, which in turn could impact our results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic could also impact our liquidity. Slower production schedules, potential inability of our customers to make timely payments to us, and similar factors could impact our cash flows. A period of generating lower cash from operations could adversely affect our financial position. We are currently considering a range of options, including progress payments from our customers and longer payment terms to our suppliers; however, we may not be successful in these efforts. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our cash flow will determine whether we need to obtain additional funding, which could be difficult to obtain. Due to uncertainty related to COVID-19 and its impact on us and the aerospace industry, and the volatility in the capital markets in general, access to financing may be reduced and we may have difficulty obtaining financing on terms acceptable to us or at all.\nThe extent to which COVID-19 affects our operations will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain, including the duration of the outbreak, new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the coronavirus and the actions to contain the coronavirus or address its impact, among others. For instance, although the Company has been classified as an \u201cessential business\u201d by New York State and is exempt from the state\u2019s mandate that all non-essential New York businesses close, the Company\u2019s accounting staff and outside advisors have been working modified hours and remotely due to social distancing protocols and concern over their safety and the safety of others since on or about March 19, 2020. Access to records, the inability to perform tasks efficiently, and IT connectivity issues, along with similar measures taken by the Company\u2019s outside advisors, have hindered and may continue to hinder timely preparation of our financial statements. Additionally, even though our facility remains open, we have experienced and may continue to experience additional operating costs due to social distancing, securing personal protective equipment, and sanitizing workspaces, worker absences, and lower productivity. If significant portions of our workforce or our suppliers\u2019 workforces are unable to work effectively, including because of illness, quarantines, government actions, facility closure or other restrictions in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, our operations will likely be impacted. We may be unable to perform fully on our contracts and our costs may increase as a result of the COVID-19 outbreak. These cost increases may not be fully recoverable or adequately covered by insurance. In addition, the impact on our accounting staff and outside advisors may hamper our efforts to comply with our filing obligations with the SEC.\nWe continue to monitor the situation, to assess further possible implications to our business, supply chain and customers, and to take actions in an effort to mitigate adverse consequences. We cannot at this time predict the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, but it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nIf we do not meet the standards for forgiveness of our PPP Loan, we may be required to repay the loan over a period of two years.\nOn April 10, 2020, we entered into a loan with BNB Bank as the lender (\u201cLender\u201d) in an aggregate principal amount of $4,795,000 (\u201cPPP Loan\u201d) pursuant to the Paycheck Protection Program under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (\u201cCARES\u201d) Act. The PPP Loan is evidenced by a promissory note (\u201cNote\u201d). Subject to the terms of the Note, the PPP Loan bears interest at a fixed rate of one percent (1%) per annum, with the first six months of interest deferred, has an initial term of two years, and is unsecured and guaranteed by the Small Business Administration. The Company may apply to the Lender for forgiveness of the PPP Loan, with the amount which may be forgiven equal to the sum of payroll costs, covered rent and mortgage obligations, and covered utility payments incurred by the Company during the 24-week period beginning on April 10, 2020, calculated in accordance with the terms of the CARES Act, as modified by the Paycheck Protection Flexibility Act. While we expect to meet the standards for full forgiveness of the PPP Loan, there can be no assurance that we will meet such standards.\nRisks Related to our Business\nWe depend on government contracts for a significant portion of our revenues.\nWe are a supplier, either directly or as a subcontractor, to the U.S. Government and its agencies. We depend on government contracts for a significant portion of our business. If we are suspended or barred from contracting with the U.S. Government, if our reputation or relationship with individual federal agencies were impaired, whether due to the restatement and errors in the Non-Reliance Period financial statements or otherwise, or if the U.S. Government otherwise ceased doing business with us or significantly decreased the amount of business it does with us, our business, prospects, financial condition and operating results would be materially adversely affected.\nWe face risks relating to government contracts.\nThe funding of U.S. Government programs is subject to congressional budget authorization and appropriation processes. For many programs, the U.S. Congress appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis even though a program may extend over several fiscal years. Consequently, programs are often only partially funded initially and additional funds are committed only as Congress makes further appropriations. Appropriations are driven by numerous factors, including geopolitical events, macroeconomic conditions, the ability of the U.S. Government to enact relevant legislation, such as appropriations bills and continuing resolutions, and the threat or existence of a government shutdown. U.S. Government appropriations for our programs and for defense spending generally may be impacted or delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic as governmental priorities and finances change. We cannot predict the extent to which total funding and/or funding for individual programs will be included, increased or reduced in budgets approved by Congress or be included in the scope of separate supplemental appropriations. In the event that appropriations for any of our programs becomes unavailable, or is reduced or delayed, our contract or subcontract under such program may be terminated or adjusted by the U.S. Government, which could have a material adverse effect on our future sales under such program, and on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe also cannot predict the impact of potential changes in priorities due to military transformation and planning and/or the nature of war-related activity on existing, follow-on or replacement programs. A shift of government priorities to programs in which we do not participate and/or reductions in funding for or the termination of programs in which we do participate, unless offset by other programs and opportunities, could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, the U.S. Government generally has the ability to terminate contracts, completely or in part, without prior notice, for convenience or for default based on performance. In the event of termination for the U.S. Government\u2019s convenience, contractors are generally protected by provisions covering reimbursement for costs incurred on the contracts and profit on those costs but not the anticipated profit that would have been earned had the contract been completed. Termination by the U.S. Government of a contract for convenience could also result in the cancellation of future work on that program. Termination by the U.S. Government of a contract due to our default could require us to pay for re-procurement costs in excess of the original contract price, net of the value of work accepted from the original contract. Termination of a contract due to our default may expose us to liability and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for contracts. Additionally, we are a subcontractor on some U.S. Government contracts. In these arrangements, the U.S. Government could terminate the prime contract for convenience or otherwise, without regard to our performance as a subcontractor. We can give no assurance that we would be awarded new U.S. Government contracts to offset the revenues lost as a result of the termination of any of our U.S. Government contracts.\nWe have risks associated with competing in the bidding process for contracts.\nWe obtain many of our contracts through a competitive bidding process. In the bidding process, we face the following risks:\n\u2022 we must bid on programs in advance of their completion, which may result in unforeseen technological difficulties or cost overruns;\n\u2022 we must devote substantial time and effort to prepare bids and proposals for competitively awarded contracts that may not be awarded to us; and\n\u2022 awarded contracts may not generate sales sufficient to result in profitability.\nFurther consolidation in the aerospace industry could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nThe aerospace and defense industry is experiencing significant consolidation, including among our customers, competitors and suppliers. While we believe we have positioned our Company to take advantage of opportunities to market to a broad customer base, which we believe will reduce the potential impact of industry consolidation, we cannot assure you that industry consolidation will not impact our business. Consolidation among our customers may result in delays in the awarding of new contracts and losses of existing business. Consolidation among our competitors may result in larger competitors with greater resources and market share, which could adversely affect our ability to compete successfully. Consolidation among our suppliers may result in fewer sources of supply and increased cost to us.\nWe are subject to strict governmental regulations relating to the environment, which could result in fines and remediation expense in the event of non-compliance.\nWe are required to comply with extensive and frequently changing environmental regulations at the federal, state and local levels. Among other things, these regulatory bodies impose restrictions to control air, soil and water pollution, to protect against occupational exposure to chemicals, including health and safety risks, and to require notification or reporting of the storage, use and release of certain hazardous substances into the environment. This extensive regulatory framework imposes significant compliance burdens and risks on us. In addition, these regulations may impose liability for the cost of removal or remediation of certain hazardous substances released on or in our facilities without regard to whether we knew of, or caused, the release of such substances. Furthermore, we are required to provide a place of employment that is free from recognized and preventable hazards that are likely to cause serious physical harm to employees, provide notice to employees regarding the presence of hazardous chemicals and to train employees in the use of such substances. Our operations require the use of a limited amount of chemicals and other materials for painting and cleaning that are classified under applicable laws as hazardous chemicals and substances. If we are found not to comply with any of these rules, regulations or permits, we may be subject to fines, remediation expenses and the obligation to change our business practice, any of which could result in substantial costs that would adversely affect our business operations and financial condition.\nWe may be subject to fines and disqualification for non-compliance with Federal Aviation Administration (\u201cFAA\u201d) regulations.\nWe are subject to regulation by the FAA under the provisions of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, as amended. The FAA prescribes standards and licensing requirements for aircraft and aircraft components. We are subject to inspections by the FAA and may be subjected to fines and other penalties (including orders to cease production) for noncompliance with FAA regulations. Our failure to comply with applicable regulations could result in the termination of or our disqualification from some of our contracts, which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.\nIf our subcontractors or suppliers fail to perform their contractual obligations, our contract performance and our ability to obtain future business and our profitability could be materially and adversely impacted.\nMost of our contracts involve subcontracts with other companies upon which we rely to perform a portion of the services that we must provide to our customers. There is a risk that we may have disputes with our subcontractors, including disputes regarding the quality and timeliness of work performed by the subcontractor, customer concerns about the subcontract, our failure to extend existing task orders or issue new task orders under a subcontract, or our hiring of personnel of a subcontractor. A failure by one or more of our subcontractors to satisfactorily provide on a timely basis the agreed-upon supplies or perform the agreed-upon services may materially and adversely affect our ability to perform our obligations as the prime contractor. Subcontractor performance deficiencies could result in a customer eliminating our ability to progress bill or terminating our contract for default. A prohibition on progress billing may have an adverse effect upon our cash flow and profitability and a default termination could expose us to liability and have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and orders. In addition, a delay in our ability to obtain components and equipment parts from our suppliers may affect our ability to meet our customers\u2019 needs and may have a material adverse effect upon our profitability. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has impacted, and continues to impact, our supply chain, as described above.\nDue to fixed contract pricing, increasing contract costs exposes us to reduced profitability and the potential loss of future business.\nOperating margin is adversely affected when contract costs that cannot be billed to customers are incurred. This cost growth can occur if estimates to complete a contract increase due to technical challenges or if initial estimates used for calculating the contract price were incorrect. The cost estimation process requires significant judgment and expertise. Reasons for cost growth may include unavailability and productivity of labor, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed, the effect of change orders, the availability of materials, the effect of any delays in performance, availability and timing of funding from the customer, natural disasters, pandemics, and the inability to recover any claims included in the estimates to complete. A significant increase in cost estimates on one or more programs could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.\nWe use estimates when accounting for contracts. Changes in estimates in connection with the restatement of the Non-Reliance Period financial statements have affected our profitability and our overall financial position.\nWe primarily recognize revenue from our contracts over the contractual period pursuant to ASC 606. Pursuant to ASC 606, revenue and gross profit are recognized as work is performed based on the relationship between actual costs incurred and total estimated costs at the completion of the contract. Recognized revenues that will not be billed under the terms of the contract until a later date are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as an asset captioned \u201cContract assets.\u201d Contracts where billings to date have exceeded recognized revenues are recorded on our consolidated balance sheet as a liability captioned \u201cContract liabilities.\u201d Changes to the original estimates may be required during the term of the contract. Estimates are reviewed monthly and the effect of any change in the estimated gross margin percentage for a contract is reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period the change becomes known. ASC 606 requires the use of considerable estimates in determining revenues and profits and in assigning the amounts to accounting periods. As a result, there can be a significant disparity between earnings (both for accounting and taxes) as reported and actual cash received by us during any reporting period.\nIn connection with the errors we identified in the Non-Reliance Period financial statements and the resulting restatement of such financial statements, we were required to make changes to the original estimates on certain of our contracts. When comparing periods, such changes resulted in net adjustments to gross profits of $94,415 and $198,548 for the years ending December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. See \u201cFavorable/Unfavorable Adjustments to Gross Profit\u201d within Item 7, \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation\u201d. We continually evaluate all of the issues related to the assumptions, risks and uncertainties inherent with the application of ASC 606; however, there is no assurance that our estimates will be accurate. If our estimates are not accurate or a contract is terminated, we will be forced to adjust revenue in later periods. Furthermore, even if our estimates are accurate, we may have a shortfall in our cash flow and we may need to borrow money to pay for costs until the reported earnings materialize to actual cash receipts.\nIf the contracts associated with our backlog were terminated, our financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nThe maximum contract value specified under each contract that we enter into is not necessarily indicative of the revenues that we will realize under that contract. Because we may not receive the full amount we expect under a contract, we may not accurately estimate our backlog because the earnings of revenues on programs included in backlog may never occur or may change. Cancellations of pending contracts or terminations or reductions of contracts in progress would have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations.\nOn April 29, 2020, the Company received a letter from Triumph Group stating that due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it had received a significant schedule change from its customer, Gulfstream Aerospace, and requested that we immediately stop work on the contract we have to produce certain fixed leading edge assemblies on the wing of the G650 business jet. In May 2020, Triumph Group cancelled nearly all open orders with the Company, decreasing our G650 leading edge backlog by $3.6 million. On May 27, 2020, Triumph Group announced it had reached an agreement in principle to sell the G650 wing program to Gulfstream Aerospace. On June 12, 2020, the Company received a joint communication from Gulfstream Aerospace and Triumph Group that stated Gulfstream\u2019s intention at the conclusion of the transaction is to continue to purchase G650 wing components from the Company. However, we are unable to predict when the transaction between Gulfstream and Triumph Group will close or when Gulfstream will begin purchasing G650 wing components from us, if at all. Further, even if Gulfstream does purchase G650 wing components from us, if such purchases are not made in the amounts and in the timeframe that we originally projected, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe may be unable to attract and retain personnel who are key to our operations.\nOur success, among other things, is dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified senior officers and engineers. Competition for key personnel is intense. Our ability to attract and retain senior officers and experienced, top rate engineers is dependent on a number of factors, including prevailing market conditions and compensation packages offered by companies competing for the same talent and our reputation in the industry. If our reputation is adversely affected, for instance due to the errors in the Non-Reliance Period financial statements or due to our handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, we may be unable to recruit, hire, and retain talented personnel. The inability to hire and retain these persons may adversely affect our production operations and other aspects of our business.\nWe are subject to the cyclical nature of the commercial aerospace industry, and any future downturn in the commercial aerospace industry or general economic conditions, including related to COVID-19, could adversely impact the demand for our products.\nOur business may be affected by certain characteristics and trends of the commercial aerospace industry or general economic conditions that affect our customers, such as fluctuations in the aerospace industry\u2019s business cycle, varying fuel and labor costs, intense price competition and regulatory scrutiny, certain trends, including a possible decrease in aviation activity and a decrease in outsourcing by aircraft manufacturers or the failure of projected market growth to materialize or continue. In the event that these characteristics and trends adversely affect customers in the commercial aerospace industry, they may reduce the overall demand for our products. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly impacted, and continues to impact, the commercial aerospace industry, as described above.\nWe incur risks associated with new programs.\nNew programs with new technologies typically carry risks associated with design changes, development of new production tools, increased capital and funding commitments, ability to meet customer specifications, delivery schedules and unique contractual requirements, supplier performance, ability of the customer to meet its contractual obligations to us, and our ability to accurately estimate costs associated with such programs. In addition, any new program may not generate sufficient demand or may experience technological problems or significant delays in the regulatory or other certification or manufacturing and delivery schedule. If we were unable to perform our obligations under new programs to the customer\u2019s satisfaction, if we were unable to manufacture products at our estimated costs, or if a new program in which we had made a significant investment was terminated or experienced weak demand, delays or technological problems, then our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. This risk includes the potential for default, quality problems, or inability to meet specifications, as well as our inability to negotiate final pricing for program changes, and could result in low margin or forward loss contracts, and the risk of having to write-off contract assets if they were deemed to be unrecoverable. In addition, beginning new work on existing programs also carries risk associated with the transfer of technology, knowledge and tooling.\nIn order to perform on new programs, we may be required to expend up-front costs which may not have been negotiated in our selling price. Additionally, we may have made margin assumptions related to those costs, that in the case of significant program delays and/or program cancellations, or if we are not successful in negotiating favorable margin on scope changes, could cause us to bear impairment charges which may be material, for costs that are not recoverable. Such charges and the loss of up-front costs could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity.\nWe are presently classified as a small business and the loss of our small business status may adversely affect our ability to compete for government contracts.\nWe are presently classified as a small business under certain of the codes under the North American Industry Classification Systems (\u201cNAICS\u201d) industry and product specific codes that are regulated in the United States by the Small Business Administration. We are not considered a small business under all NAICS codes. While we do not presently derive a substantial portion of our business from contracts that are set-aside for small businesses, we are able to bid on small business set-aside contracts as well as contracts that are open to non-small business entities. As the NAICS codes are periodically revised, it is possible that we may lose our status as a small business. The loss of small business status would adversely affect our eligibility for special small business programs and limit our ability to collaborate with other business entities which are seeking to team with small business entities as may be required under a specific contract.\nCyber security attacks, internal system or service failures may adversely impact our business and operations.\nAny system or service disruptions, including those caused by projects to improve our information technology systems, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated, could disrupt our business and impair our ability to effectively provide products and related services to our customers and could have a material adverse effect on our business. We could also be subject to systems failures, including network, software or hardware failures, whether caused by us, third-party service providers, intruders or hackers, computer viruses, natural disasters, power shortages or terrorist attacks. Cyber security threats are evolving and include, but are not limited to, malicious software, phishing and other unauthorized attempts to gain access to sensitive, confidential or otherwise protected information related to us or our products, customers or suppliers, or other acts that could lead to disruptions in our business. The COVID-19 pandemic has forced many of our non-manufacturing employees to shift to work-from-home arrangements, which increases our vulnerability to email phishing, social engineering or \u201chacking\u201d through our remote networks, and similar cyber-attacks aimed at employees working remotely. Because the techniques used by cyber-attackers to access or sabotage networks change frequently and may not be recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these tactics. Any such failures to prevent or mitigate cyber-attacks could cause loss of data and interruptions or delays in our business, cause us to incur remediation costs or subject us to claims and damage our reputation. In addition, the failure or disruption of our communications or utilities could cause us to interrupt or suspend our operations or otherwise adversely affect our business. Although we utilize various procedures and controls to monitor and mitigate the risk of these threats, including contracting with an outside cyber security firm to provide constant monitoring of our systems, and training our employees to recognize attacks, there can be no assurance that these procedures and controls will be sufficient. Our property and business interruption insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur as a result of any system or operational failure or disruption which would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. Moreover, expenditures incurred in implementing cyber security and other procedures and controls could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur financial results may be adversely impacted by the failure to successfully execute or integrate acquisitions and joint ventures.\nThe Company may evaluate potential acquisitions or joint ventures that align with our strategic objectives. The success of such activity depends, in part, upon our ability to identify suitable sellers or business partners, perform effective assessments prior to contract execution, negotiate contract terms, and, if applicable, obtain customer and government approval. These activities may present certain financial, managerial, staffing and talent, and operational risks, including diversion of management\u2019s attention from existing core businesses, difficulties integrating or separating businesses from existing operations, and challenges presented by acquisitions or joint ventures which may not achieve sales levels and profitability that justify the investments made. If the acquisitions or joint ventures are not successfully implemented or completed, there could be a negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur working capital dispute with Air Industries relating to the WMI Acquisition could adversely affect our business.\nIn December 2018 we completed the WMI Acquisition pursuant to the terms of a Stock Purchase Agreement dated as of March 21, 2018 (as amended, the \u201cSPA\u201d) with Air Industries Group (\u201cAir Industries\u201d). Pursuant to the SPA, as consideration for the acquisition, we paid to Air Industries an aggregate of $7.9 million, of which $2 million was placed in escrow at closing to be applied against post-closing working capital adjustments and indemnification obligations of Air Industries. The escrowed funds are governed by the terms of the SPA and an escrow agreement entered into between the Company and Air Industries on December 20, 2018 (\u201cEscrow Agreement\u201d). In accordance with the terms of the SPA, the Company calculated a post-closing working capital adjustment, to which Air Industries formally objected. Pursuant to the terms of the SPA, the Company and Air Industries then submitted the working capital adjustment to BDO USA, LLP (\u201cBDO\u201d) for binding resolution. On September 3, 2019, BDO resolved the dispute in favor of the Company. In accordance with the SPA and the Escrow Agreement, following BDO\u2019s resolution, Air Industries was required to join the Company in instructing the escrow agent to release the entire escrow fund to the Company and to pay the Company an additional $2,145,870 representing the excess of the working capital adjustment amount above the escrow amount, for a total post-closing adjustment of $4,145,870. Air Industries has failed to do so.\nOn September 27, 2019, the Company filed a notice of motion in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, against Air Industries seeking, among other things, an order of specific performance requiring Air Industries to comply with its obligations under the SPA and Escrow Agreement and a judgment against Air Industries in the amount of approximately $4.1 million. Air Industries subsequently agreed to release approximately $619,000 from escrow to us, but the remaining $3.5 million is still subject to dispute. We cannot assure you that the working capital dispute will be decided in our favor or, if it is decided in our favor, that we will recover the full $3.5 million from Air Industries. Failure to recoup such sum may adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Further, the litigation with Air Industries has diverted and may continue to divert, management\u2019s attention from our day-to-day operations.\nOur ability to utilize our tax benefits could be substantially limited if we fail to generate sufficient income or if we experience an \u201cownership change.\u201d\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had approximately $93 million of gross net operating losses (\u201cNOLs\u201d) for federal tax purposes and approximately $38.6 million of post-apportionment NOLs for state tax purposes. As a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 and the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act of 2020, NOLs arising before January 1, 2018, and NOLs arising after January 1, 2018, are subject to different rules. Our pre-2018 NOLs totaled approximately $78.8 million; these NOLs will expire in varying amounts from 2030 through 2039, if not utilized, and can offset 100% of future taxable income for regular tax purposes. Our NOLs arising in 2018, 2019 and 2020 can generally be carried back five years, carried forward indefinitely and can offset 100% of future taxable income for tax years before January 1, 2021 and up to 80% of future taxable income for tax years after December 31, 2020. Any NOLs arising on or after January 1, 2021, cannot be carried back, can generally be carried forward indefinitely and can offset up to 80% of future taxable income.\nOur ability to fully recognize the benefits from our NOLs is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient income prior to their expiration. In addition, our NOL carryforwards may be limited if we experience an ownership change as defined by Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (\u201cSection 382\u201d). In general, an ownership change under Section 382 occurs if 5% shareholders increase their collective ownership of the aggregate amount of our outstanding shares by more than 50 percentage points over a relevant lookback period. The equity securities we sold in October 2018 may trigger an ownership change under Section 382 which could significantly limit our ability to utilize our tax benefits. See Note 13 to the financial statements filed with this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information. The sale of additional equity securities may trigger an ownership change under Section 382 which will significantly limit our ability to utilize our tax benefits. In order to avoid limitations imposed by Section 382, we may be limited in the amount of additional equity securities we are able to sell to raise capital.", "PERMNO": 77900, "SIC": 3728, "TIC": "CVU"}
