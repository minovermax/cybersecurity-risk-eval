RISK FACTORS\nRisks related to our Operations\nThe loss or interruption of supply from our key parts suppliers could limit our ability to distribute our products.\nWe purchase certain products from various suppliers, some of which are located outside of the United States. Any loss or interruption of supply from our key parts suppliers may require us to find new suppliers. The number of suppliers for certain electronic components is limited. We could experience delays while we seek new suppliers and could have difficulty finding new suppliers, which would substantially impair our operating results and business.\nThe gaming business is heavily regulated and we depend on our ability to obtain/maintain regulatory approvals.\nNearly all of the jurisdictions in the United States require licenses, permits, documentation of qualification, including evidence of financial stability, and other forms of approval for distributors of gaming equipment and supplies and for their key personnel. The revocation or denial of a license in a particular jurisdiction could adversely affect our ability to obtain or maintain licenses in other jurisdictions. In addition, laws and regulations applicable to our business could be changed or repealed. These changes could affect our business and results of operations.\nIntense competition in our industry could impair our ability to grow and achieve profitability.\nWe may not be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors. The market for our products and services is intensely competitive and constantly attracts new competitors even as others leave the industry due to low barriers to entry to our business. Some of our competitors are large companies with greater financial, marketing and product development resources. In addition, new competitors may enter our key markets. This may place us at a disadvantage in responding to our competitors\u2019 pricing strategies, technological advances and other initiatives.\nThe current economic conditions might cause sales to decline without warning making it difficult to reduce costs fast enough to maintain profitability.\nOur customers\u2019 business (and their customers\u2019 business) might decline more than we or our customers are forecasting making it difficult for us to reduce our expenses as fast as our sales decline. We could experience periods where the sales decline occurs so rapidly that we are unprofitable for a period of time\nWe are substantially dependent on key personnel.\nFor the foreseeable future, our success will depend largely on the continued services of our President and Interim Chief Executive Officer, Anthony Tomasello, as well as certain of the other key executives because of their collective industry knowledge, marketing skills and relationships with suppliers and customers. Should any of these individuals leave us, we could have difficulty replacing them with qualified individuals and it could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations.\nOur results of operations could vary as a result of the methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies.\nThe methods, estimates, and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies have a significant impact on our results of operations (see \u201cCritical Accounting Policies\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of this report). Such methods, estimates, and judgments are, by their nature, subject to substantial risks, uncertainties, and assumptions, and factors may arise over time that lead us to change our methods, estimates, and judgments. Changes in those methods, estimates, and judgments could significantly affect our results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nThe market price for our shares is susceptible to significant changes in market price.\nHistorically, the volume of trading of our shares has been relatively low. As a result, larger than average buy or sell orders on a given day, or news about us or the gaming industry, has had and may in the future have a significant impact on the trading price for our shares.\nOur common stock is considered a \u201cpenny stock\u201d and is subject to the penny stock rules.\nOur common stock currently trades over-the-counter on the OTCQB. Since our common stock continues to trade below $5.00 per share, our common stock is considered a \u201cpenny stock\u201d and is subject to the Securities and Exchange Commission rules and regulations which impose limitations upon the manner in which our shares can be publicly traded. These regulations require the delivery, prior to any transaction involving a penny stock, of a disclosure schedule explaining the penny stock market and the associated risks. Under these regulations, certain brokers who recommend such securities to persons other than established customers or certain accredited investors must make a special written suitability determination regarding such a purchaser and receive such purchaser\u2019s written agreement to a transaction prior to sale. These regulations may have the effect of limiting the trading activity of our common stock and reducing the liquidity of an investment in our common stock.\nWe do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future.\nAny payment of cash dividends in the future will depend upon our earnings (if any), financial condition and capital requirements. We do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, any potential investor who anticipates the need for current dividends from its investment should not purchase any of our securities.", "PERMNO": 63829, "SIC": 5090, "TIC": "AGNUQ"}
