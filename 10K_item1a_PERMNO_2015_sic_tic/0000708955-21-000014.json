Risk Factors.\nThe risks listed here are not the only risks we face. Additional risks that are not presently known, or that we presently deem to be immaterial, also could have a material effect on our financial condition, results of operations, business and prospects. (See also \u201cItem 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d for certain forward looking statements.)\nRisks Related to Economic and Market Conditions\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is adversely affecting us and our customers, employees, and third-party service providers, and the adverse impacts on our business, financial position, results of operations, and prospects could be significant.\nCOVID-19 has negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted global supply chains, lowered equity market valuations, created significant volatility and disruption in financial markets, increased unemployment levels and decreased consumer confidence, generally. In addition, the pandemic has resulted in temporary closures of many businesses and the institution of social distancing and sheltering in place requirements in many states and communities. The pandemic could influence the recognition of credit losses in our loan portfolios and increase our allowance for credit losses, particularly as businesses remain closed and as more customers are expected to draw on their lines of credit or seek additional loans to help finance their businesses. Furthermore, the pandemic could affect the stability of our deposit base as well as our capital and liquidity position, impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans, impair the value of collateral securing loans, result in lost revenue and cause us to incur additional expenses. Similarly, because of changing economic and market conditions affecting issuers, we may be required to recognize other-than-temporary impairments in future periods on the securities we hold as well as reductions in other comprehensive income.\nThe extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our capital, liquidity, and other financial positions and on our business, results of operations, and prospects will depend on a number of evolving factors, including:\n\u2022The duration, extent, and severity of the pandemic. COVID-19 has not been contained and could affect significantly more households and businesses. The duration and severity of the pandemic continue to be impossible to predict.\n\u2022The response of governmental and nongovernmental authorities. Many of the actions taken by authorities have been directed at curtailing personal and business activity to contain COVID-19 while simultaneously deploying fiscal-and monetary-policy measures to assist in mitigating the adverse effects on individuals and businesses. These actions are not consistent across jurisdictions but, in general, have been rapidly expanding in scope and intensity.\n\u2022The effect on our customers, counterparties, employees, and third-party service providers. COVID-19 and its associated consequences and uncertainties may affect individuals, households, and businesses differently and unevenly. In the near-term if not longer, however, our credit, operational, and other risks are generally expected to increase.\n\u2022The effect on economies and markets. Whether the actions of governmental and nongovernmental authorities will be successful in mitigating the adverse effects of COVID-19 is unclear. National, regional, and local economies and markets could suffer lasting disruptions.\n\u2022The success of hardship relief efforts to bridge the gap to reopening the economy. The U.S. government has implemented programs to directly compensate individuals and grant or loan money to businesses in an effort to provide funding while the economy is shut down. Many banks, including the Bank, have implemented hardship relief programs that include payment deferral and short-term funding options. The success of these programs could mute the effect on the Company's credit losses, which may be difficult to determine.\nThe duration of these business interruptions and related impacts on our business and operations, which will depend on future developments, are highly uncertain and cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. The pandemic could cause us to experience higher credit losses in our lending portfolio, impairment of our goodwill and other financial assets, reduced demand for our products and services, and other negative impacts on our financial position, results of operations, and prospects. You should consider that the effects of COVID-19 could be particularly pronounced with respect to certain of our lending portfolios:\n\u2022Commercial real estate-retail, including retail shopping centers, due to declining interest in such spaces by their users and declining interest in visiting large shared spaces. As of December 31, 2020, the retail portion of our ICRE portfolio was $875.2 million, or 8.8% of our loan portfolio.\n\u2022Residential real estate, due to customers' potential loss of income. As of December 31, 2020, this portfolio was $1.0 billion, or 10.1% of our loan portfolio.\n\u2022Franchise, which primarily includes quick service and casual dining, due to stay at home orders and requirements that restaurants provide carry-out only service. As of December 31, 2020, this portfolio was $423.8 million, or 4.3% of our loan portfolio.\n\u2022Hospitality, including hotel and motel lending, due to travel limitations implemented by governments and businesses as well as declining interest in travel generally. As of December 31, 2020, this portfolio was $433.0 million, or 4.4% of our loan portfolio.\nThe cumulative effects of COVID-19 and the measures implemented by governments to combat the pandemic on mortgaged properties may cause borrowers to be unable to meet their payment obligations under mortgage loans that we hold and may result in significant losses.\nThe extent to which COVID-19 impacts our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on future developments, which are uncertain and difficult to predict. Even after COVID-19 has subsided, we may continue to experience materially adverse impacts to our business as a result of the virus's global economic impact, including the availability of credit, adverse impacts on our liquidity and any recession that has occurred or may occur in the future.\nThere are no comparable recent events that provide guidance as to the effect the spread of COVID-19 as a global pandemic may have, and, as a result, the ultimate impact of the outbreak is highly uncertain and subject to change. The effects could have a material impact on our results of operations and heighten many of the other risk factors identified below.\nWeakness in the economy and in the real estate market, including specific weakness within our geographic footprint, may affect us, including requiring us to record additional loan loss provision or to charge off loans.\nFirst Financial\u2019s success depends, in part, on economic and political conditions, local and national, as well as governmental fiscal and monetary policies. Conditions such as inflation, recession, unemployment, changes in interest rates, fiscal and monetary policy and other factors beyond First Financial\u2019s control, especially in light of COVID-19, may affect its deposit levels and composition, demand for loans, the ability of borrowers to repay their loans and the value of the collateral securing the loans it makes. Economic turmoil in different regions of the world affect the economy and stock prices in the United States, which can affect First Financial\u2019s earnings and capital and the ability of its customers to repay loans. Due to First Financial's volume of real estate loans, declining real estate values could affect the value of property used as collateral as well as First Financial\u2019s ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure.\nIf the strength of the United States economy in general and the strength of the local economies in which we conduct operations decline, this could result in, among other things, a deterioration of credit quality or a reduced demand for credit, including a\nresultant effect on our loan portfolio and allowance for credit losses. These factors could also result in higher delinquencies and greater charge-offs in future periods, which would materially affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThere is no assurance that our non-impaired loans will not become impaired or that our impaired loans will not suffer further deterioration in value. The fluctuations in national, regional and local economic conditions, including those related to local residential, commercial real estate and construction markets, may result in increased charge-offs and, consequently, reduce our net income. These fluctuations are not predictable, cannot be controlled and may have a material impact on our operations and financial condition even if other favorable events occur.\nWeakness in the real estate market, including the secondary market for residential mortgage loans, could affect us.\nDisruptions in the secondary market for residential mortgage loans limit the market for and liquidity of many mortgage loans. The effects of mortgage market challenges, combined with reductions in residential real estate market prices and reduced levels of home sales, could affect the value of collateral securing mortgage loans that we hold, mortgage loan originations and profits on sales of mortgage loans. Such conditions could result in higher losses or charge-offs in our mortgage loan portfolio and other lines of business. Declines in real estate values, home sale volumes, financial stress on borrowers as a result of job losses, interest rate resets on adjustable rate mortgage loans or other factors could have further effects on borrowers that could result in higher delinquencies and greater charge-offs in future periods, which would affect our financial condition or results of operations. Additionally, declines in real estate values might affect the creditworthiness of state and local governments, resulting in decreased profitability or credit losses from loans made to such governments. A decline in home values or overall economic weakness could also have an impact upon the value of real estate or other assets which we own upon foreclosing a loan and our ability to realize value on such assets.\nChanges in market interest rates or capital markets could affect our revenues and expenses, the value of assets and obligations, and the availability and cost of capital or liquidity.\nGiven our business mix, and the fact that most of our assets and liabilities are financial in nature, we tend to be sensitive to market interest rate movements and the performance of the financial markets. Our primary source of income is net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income generated by our interest-earning assets (consisting primarily of loans and, to a lesser extent, securities) and the interest expense generated by our interest-bearing liabilities. Prevailing economic conditions, fiscal and monetary policies and the policies of various regulatory agencies all affect market rates of interest and the availability and cost of credit, which, in turn, significantly affect financial institutions\u2019 net interest income. If the interest we pay on deposits and other borrowings increases at a faster rate than increases in the interest we receive on loans and investments, net interest income, and, therefore, our earnings, could be affected. Earnings could also be affected if the interest we receive on loans and other investments falls more quickly than the interest we pay on deposits and other borrowings.\nIn addition to the general impact of the economy, changes in interest rates or in valuations in the debt or equity markets could directly impact us in one or more of the following ways:\n\u2022the yield on earning assets and rates paid on interest bearing liabilities may change in disproportionate ways;\n\u2022the value of certain balance sheet and off-balance sheet financial instruments or the value of equity investments that we hold could decline;\n\u2022the value of assets for which we provide processing services could decline;\n\u2022the demand for loans and refinancings may decline, which could negatively impact income related to loan originations; or\n\u2022to the extent we access capital markets to raise funds to support our business, such changes could affect the cost of such funds or the ability to raise such funds.\nAlthough we have implemented procedures we believe will reduce the potential effects of changes in interest rates on our results of operations, these procedures may not always be successful. In addition, any substantial or prolonged change in market interest rates could affect our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity.\nWe may be impacted by the transition from LIBOR as a reference rate.\nThe London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) is used extensively in the United States and globally as a reference rate for various commercial and financial contracts, including adjustable rate mortgages, corporate debt, interest rate swaps and other derivatives. In November 2020, the Federal Reserve Board issued a statement supporting the release of a proposal and supervisory statements designed to provide a clear end date for U.S. Dollar LIBOR (USD LIBOR), and the federal banking\nagencies issued a release encouraging banks to stop entering into USD LIBOR contracts by the end of 2021, noting that most legacy contracts will mature prior to the date LIBOR ceases to be issued. It is uncertain at this time the extent to which those entering into financial contracts will transition to any other particular benchmark. Other benchmarks may perform differently than LIBOR or other alternative benchmarks or have other consequences that cannot currently be anticipated. It is also uncertain what will happen with instruments that rely on LIBOR for future interest rate adjustments and which remain outstanding when LIBOR ceases to exist.\nThe Federal Reserve Board, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of large financial institutions, is considering replacing USD LIBOR with a new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements, backed by United States Treasury securities, otherwise known as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR). SOFR is observed and backward looking, which stands in contrast with LIBOR under the current methodology, which is an estimated forward-looking rate and relies, to some degree, on the expert judgment of submitting panel members. Given that SOFR is a secured rate backed by government securities, it will be a rate that does not take into account bank credit risk (as is the case with LIBOR). SOFR is therefore likely to be lower than LIBOR and is less likely to correlate with the funding costs of financial institutions. The extent to which SOFR attains traction as a LIBOR replacement tool is not known, although transactions using SOFR have been completed, including by Fannie Mae. Both Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac ceased accepting adjustable rate mortgages tied to LIBOR and began accepting mortgages based on SOFR in 2020, and many issuers are now utilizing SOFR.\nFirst Financial has established a working group to manage the LIBOR transition process. The working group has identified all LIBOR-related contracts and determined which will require amended language to incorporate a substitute reference rate. The working group has also developed and implemented flexible language regarding reference rates for all new loan products and agreements. First Financial continues to consider a replacement index for 2021 and beyond.\nUntil this replacement rate is identified and all agreements have been addressed, we will continue to have a significant number of loans, derivative contracts, borrowings and other financial instruments with attributes that are directly or indirectly dependent on LIBOR. The transition from LIBOR could create considerable costs and additional risk for us. Since proposed alternative rates are calculated differently, payments under contracts referencing new rates will differ from those referencing LIBOR. The transition will change our market risk profiles, requiring changes to risk and pricing models, valuation tools, product design and hedging strategies. Further, our failure to adequately manage this transition process with our customers could impact our reputation. Although we are currently unable to assess what the ultimate impact of the transition from LIBOR will be, any market-wide transition away from LIBOR could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDeclining values of real estate, increases in unemployment, insurance market disruptions and the related effects on local economies may increase our credit losses, which would negatively affect our financial results.\nWe offer a variety of secured loans, including commercial lines of credit, commercial term loans, real estate, construction, home equity, consumer and other loans. Many of our loans are secured by real estate (both residential and commercial) within our market area. A major change in the real estate market, such as deterioration in the value of collateral, or in the local or national economy, could affect our customers' ability to pay these loans, which in turn could impact our results of operations and financial condition. Additionally, increases in unemployment also may affect the ability of certain clients to repay loans and the financial results of commercial clients in localities with higher unemployment, may result in loan defaults and foreclosures and may impair the value of our collateral. This is especially relevant in light of the impact COVID-19 has had on national and local economies. Loan defaults and foreclosures are unavoidable in the banking industry, and we try to limit our exposure to this risk by monitoring carefully our extensions of credit. Additionally, a concentration of natural disasters or a significant disruption in the insurance market could impact the risk relating to our insurance lending business. We cannot fully eliminate credit risk, and as a result, credit losses may increase in the future.\nOur financial instruments carried at fair value expose us to certain market risks.\nWe maintain an available-for-sale investment securities portfolio, which includes assets with various types of instruments and maturities. At times, we also maintain certain assets that are classified and accounted for as trading assets. The changes in fair value of available-for-sale securities are recognized in shareholders' equity as a component of other comprehensive income. The changes in fair value of financial instruments classified as trading assets are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. The fair value of financial instruments carried at fair value is exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates and market liquidity. We manage the market risks associated with these instruments through broad asset/liability management strategies. Changes in the market values of these financial instruments could have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations. We may classify additional financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value in the future.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWhen we loan money, commit to loan money or enter into a letter of credit or other contract with a counterparty, we incur credit risk, or the risk of loss if our borrowers do not repay their loans or our counterparties fail to perform according to the terms of their contracts.\nAs lending is one of our primary business activities, the credit quality of our portfolio can have a significant impact on our earnings. We estimate and establish reserves for credit risks and probable incurred credit losses inherent in our loan portfolio. This process, which is critical to our financial results and condition, requires difficult, subjective and complex judgments, including reviews of economic conditions and how these economic conditions might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans. As is the case with any such assessments, there is always the chance that we will fail to identify the proper factors or that we will fail to accurately estimate the impacts of factors that we identify. In addition, large loans, letters of credit and contracts with individual counterparties in our portfolio magnify the credit risk that we face, as the impact of large borrowers and counterparties not repaying their loans or performing according to the terms of their contracts has a disproportionately significant impact on our credit losses and reserves.\nThe information that we use in managing our credit risk may be inaccurate or incomplete, which may result in an increased risk of default and otherwise have an effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with clients and counterparties, we may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of clients and counterparties, including financial statements and other financial information. We also may rely on representations of clients and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and, with respect to financial statements, on reports of independent auditors. Although we regularly review our credit exposure to specific clients and counterparties and to specific industries that we believe may present credit concerns, default risk may arise from events or circumstances that are difficult to detect, such as fraud. Moreover, such circumstances, including fraud, may become more likely to occur or be detected in periods of general economic uncertainty. We may also fail to receive full information with respect to the risks of a counterparty. In addition, in cases where we have extended credit against collateral, we may find that we are under-secured, for example, as a result of sudden declines in market values that reduce the value of collateral or due to fraud with respect to such collateral. If such events or circumstances were to occur, it could result in a potential loss of revenue and have an effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur allowance for credit losses may prove to be insufficient to absorb losses in our loan portfolio.\nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses to provide for loans in our portfolio that may not be repaid in their entirety. We believe that our allowance for credit losses is maintained at a level adequate to absorb expected losses over the life of the life of the loans in the loan portfolio as of the corresponding balance sheet date. However, our allowance for credit losses may not be sufficient to cover actual loan losses, and future provision for credit losses could materially affect our operating results. The accounting measurements related to the allowance for credit losses require significant estimates which are subject to uncertainty and change related to new information and changing circumstances. Management estimates the allowance using relevant available information from both internal and external sources, relating to past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Historical credit loss experience paired with economic forecasts provide the basis for the quantitatively modeled estimation of expected credit losses. First Financial adjusts its quantitative model, as necessary, to reflect conditions not already considered by the quantitative model. Our estimates of the risk of loss and amount of loss on any loan are complicated by the significant uncertainties surrounding our borrowers\u2019 abilities to successfully execute their business models through changing economic environments, competitive challenges and other factors. Because of the degree of uncertainty and susceptibility of these factors to change, our actual losses may vary from our current estimates.\nIn addition, bank regulators periodically review our allowance for credit losses and may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs. Moreover, the FASB has changed its requirements for establishing the allowance for credit losses. The new accounting guidance requires banks to record, at the time of origination, credit losses expected throughout the life of the asset on loans, leases and held-to-maturity debt securities, as opposed to the previous practice of recording losses when it was probable that a loss event had occurred. We adopted the CECL accounting guidance in 2020 and recognized a one-time cumulative effect adjustment to our allowance for credit losses and retained earnings as of January 1, 2020. Concurrent with the enactment of the CARES Act, federal bank regulatory agencies issued an interim final rule that delays the estimated impact on regulatory capital resulting from the adoption of CECL. The interim final rule provided banking organizations that implemented CECL prior to the end of 2020 the option to delay for two years the estimated impact\nof CECL on regulatory capital relative to regulatory capital determined under the prior incurred loss methodology, followed by a three-year transition period to phase out the aggregate amount of capital benefit provided during the initial two-year delay.\nWe adopted CECL in the first quarter of 2020, including the regulatory phase-in. As a result, credit loss allowances, including reserves for unfunded commitments, increased $73.7 million on January 1, 2020, resulting in a corresponding decrease in retained earnings and a delayed impact to regulatory capital. CECL implementation poses operational risk, including the failure to properly transition internal processes or systems, which could lead to errors, financial misstatements or operational losses. As a result of CECL, our financial results may be negatively affected as soon as weak or deteriorating economic conditions are forecasted and alter our expectations for credit losses. In addition, we incurred a significant provision expense of $70.6 million during 2020, primarily as a result of COVID-19, and may incur significant provision expense for credit losses in future periods as well.\nProjections for new business initiatives and strategies may prove inaccurate.\nThe introduction, implementation, withdrawal, success and timing of business initiatives and strategies, including, but not limited to, the opening of new banking centers or entering into new product lines, may be less successful or may be different than anticipated, which could affect our business. The Bank makes certain projections and develops plans and strategies for its banking and financial products. If we do not accurately determine demand for our banking and financial products, it could result in us incurring significant expenses without the anticipated increases in revenue, which could result in a material effect on the Bank\u2019s business.\nWe may be required to repurchase mortgage loans or indemnify mortgage loan purchasers as a result of breaches of representations and warranties, borrower fraud, or certain borrower defaults, which could harm our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition.\nWhen we sell mortgage loans, whether as whole loans or pursuant to a securitization, we are required to make customary representations and warranties to the purchaser about the mortgage loans and the manner in which they were originated. Our whole loan sale agreements require us to repurchase or substitute mortgage loans in the event we breach any of these representations or warranties. In addition, we may be required to repurchase mortgage loans as a result of borrower fraud. While we have taken steps to enhance our underwriting policies and procedures, there can be no assurance that these steps will be effective or reduce risk associated with loans sold in the past. If the level of repurchase and indemnity activity becomes material, our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition may be affected.\nCompetition in the financial services industry is intense and could result in our losing business or experiencing reduced margins.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry that could become even more competitive as a result of legislative, regulatory and technological changes, and continued consolidation. We face aggressive competition from other domestic and foreign lending institutions as well as from numerous other providers of financial services. The ability of non-banking financial institutions to provide services previously limited to commercial banks has intensified competition. Because non-banking financial institutions are not subject to the same regulatory restrictions as banks and bank holding companies, they can often operate with greater flexibility and lower cost structures. Securities firms and insurance companies that elect to become financial holding companies may acquire banks and other financial institutions. The OCC has also announced that it will accept applications for national bank charters from non-depository financial technology companies engaged in banking activities. These developments may significantly change the competitive environment in which we conduct business. Some of our competitors have greater financial resources and/or face fewer regulatory constraints. Credit unions that compete with us have advantages that allow them to price products and services more competitively. As a result of these various sources of competition, we could lose business to competitors or be forced to price products and services on less advantageous terms to retain or attract clients, either of which would affect our profitability.\nThe principal bases for competition are pricing (including the interest rates charged on loans or paid on interest bearing deposits), product structure, the range of products and services offered, and the quality of customer service (including convenience and responsiveness to customer needs and concerns). The ability to access and use technology is an increasingly important competitive factor in the financial services industry, and it is a critically important component to customer satisfaction as it affects our ability to deliver the right products and services.\nFailure to adequately address the competitive pressures we face could make it harder for us to attract and retain customers across our businesses. Similarly, meeting these competitive pressures could require us to incur significant additional expense, to reevaluate the number of branches through which we serve our customers, or to accept risk beyond what we would otherwise view as desirable under the circumstances. In addition, competitive pressure to increase rates on deposits or decrease rates on loans could reduce our net interest margin with a resulting negative impact on our net interest income.\nClients could pursue alternatives to bank deposits, causing us to lose a relatively inexpensive source of funding.\nChecking and savings account balances and other forms of client deposits could decrease if clients perceive alternative investments as providing superior expected returns. When clients move money out of bank deposits in favor of alternative investments, we can lose a relatively inexpensive source of funds, increasing our funding costs.\nConsumers may decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions, or deposit funds electronically with banks having no branches within our market area, which could affect net income.\nTechnology and other changes allow parties to complete financial transactions without banks. For example, consumers can pay bills and transfer funds directly without banks. Consumers can also shop for higher deposit interest rates at banks across the country, which may offer higher rates because they have few or no physical branches and open deposit accounts electronically. This process could result in the loss of fee income, as well as the loss of client deposits, in addition to increasing our funding costs.\nOur wealth management business subjects us to a variety of investment and market risks.\nAt December 31, 2020, we had $3.0 billion in assets under management. A sharp decline in the stock market could negatively impact the amount of assets under management and thus subject our earnings to additional risks and uncertainties.\nOur foreign exchange business is largely dependent upon a small number of large clients and volatility in the markets.\nIn August 2019, First Financial acquired Bannockburn, which is engaged in various foreign exchange market activities. Bannockburn\u2019s business model relies, to some extent, upon a small number of large clients engaged in foreign currency transactions. The loss of one or more of these large client would adversely affect the revenue derived from Bannockburn. Additionally, foreign currency transactions increase as volatility in the market increases. Sustained periods of stability in the financial markets could adversely affect Bannockburn\u2019s revenue.\nNegative public opinion could damage our reputation and impact business operations and revenues.\nAs a financial institution, our earnings and capital are subject to risks associated with negative public opinion. Negative public opinion could result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities, including lending practices, the failure of any product or service sold by us to meet our clients\u2019 expectations or applicable regulatory requirements, corporate governance and acquisitions, social media and other marketing activities, or from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to any of the foregoing. Negative public opinion could affect our ability to attract and/or retain clients, could expose us to litigation and regulatory action, and could have a material adverse effect on our stock price or result in heightened volatility. Negative public opinion could also affect our ability to borrow funds in the unsecured wholesale debt markets.\nWe rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure, creating risks of failures by such companies and cybersecurity incidents involving our customers\u2019 information.\nThird parties provide key components of our business infrastructure, such as processing and Internet connections and network access. These vendors also provide services that support our operations, including the storage and processing of sensitive consumer and business customer data, as well as our sales efforts. Any disruption in such services provided by these third parties or any failure of these third parties to handle current or higher volumes could affect our ability to deliver products and services to clients and to efficiently and effectively conduct our business. Technological or financial difficulties of a third-party service provider could affect our business to the extent those difficulties result in the interruption or discontinuation of services provided by that party. Further, the operations of our third-party vendors could fail or otherwise become delayed as a result of COVD-19.\nA cybersecurity breach of a vendor's system may result in theft of our data or disruption of business processes. A material breach of customer data security at a service provider's site may negatively impact our business reputation and cause a loss of customers, result in increased expense to contain the event and/or require that we provide credit monitoring services for affected customers, result in regulatory fines and sanctions, and may result in litigation. We may experience liability to our customers for losses arising from a breach of a vendor's data security system. We rely on our outsourced service providers to implement and maintain prudent cybersecurity controls. Furthermore, we may not be insured against all types of losses as a result of third-party failures, and our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all losses resulting from system failures or other disruptions. Failures in our business infrastructure could interrupt the operations or increase the costs of doing business.\nWe rely on our systems, employees and certain counterparties, and certain failures could affect our operations.\nWe are exposed to many types of operational risk, including the risk of fraud by employees and outsiders, clerical and record-keeping errors, and computer/telecommunications systems malfunctions. Our businesses are dependent on our ability to process a large number of increasingly complex transactions. If any of our financial, accounting or other data processing systems fail or have other significant shortcomings, we could be affected. We depend on internal systems and outsourced technology to support these data storage and processing operations. Our inability to use or access these information systems at critical points in time could unfavorably impact the timeliness and efficiency of our business operations. In recent years, some banks have experienced denial of service attacks in which individuals or organizations flood the bank's website with extraordinarily high volumes of traffic, with the goal and effect of disrupting the ability of the bank to process transactions.\nAdditionally, we could be affected if one of our employees causes a significant operational break-down or failure, either as a result of human error or where an individual purposefully sabotages or fraudulently manipulates our operations or systems. We are also at risk of an impact on our systems and operations from natural disasters, terrorism and international hostilities. Such events can also impact power or communications systems operated by others on which we rely.\nMisconduct by employees could include fraudulent, improper or unauthorized activities on behalf of clients or improper use of confidential information. We may not be able to prevent employee errors or misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect this type of activity might not be effective in all cases. Employee errors or misconduct could subject us to civil claims for negligence or regulatory enforcement actions, including fines and restrictions on our business.\nIn addition, there have been instances where financial institutions have been victims of fraudulent activity in which criminals pose as customers to initiate wire and automated clearinghouse transactions out of customer accounts. The breach of the systems of a credit bureau in 2019 presents additional threats as criminals now have more information about a larger portion of our country's population than past breaches have involved, which could be used by criminals to pose as customers initiating transfers of money from customer accounts. Although we have policies and procedures in place to verify the authenticity of our customers, we cannot assure that such policies and procedures will prevent all fraudulent transfers. Such activity can result in financial liability and harm to our reputation.\nUnauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential client or customer information, whether through a breach of our computer systems or otherwise, or other breaches in the security of our systems could harm our business.\nAs part of our business, we collect, process and retain sensitive and confidential client and customer information on behalf of our subsidiaries and other third parties. Despite the security measures we have in place, our facilities and systems, and those of our third-party service providers, may be vulnerable to security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, theft of information, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors, or other similar events. If information security is breached, information can be lost or misappropriated, resulting in financial loss or costs to us or damages to others. Our systems can be rendered inoperable, resulting in our inability to provide service to our customers. Any security breach involving the misappropriation, loss, destruction or unauthorized disclosure of confidential customer information, whether by us or by our vendors, could severely damage our reputation, expose us to the risk of litigation and liability, disrupt our operations and have a material effect on our business.\nCybersecurity risk management programs are expensive to maintain and will not protect us from all risks associated with maintaining the security of customer data and our proprietary data from external and internal intrusions, disaster recovery and failures in the controls used by our vendors. Employee error or misconduct may result in failure to implement policies and procedures designed to avoid risks. Moreover, as technology and cyberattacks change over time, we must continually monitor and change systems to guard against new threats. We may not know of and be able to guard against a new threat until after an attack has occurred. Congress and the legislatures of states in which we operate regularly consider legislation that would impose more stringent data privacy requirements.\nAny of these occurrences could result in our diminished ability to operate one or more of our businesses, potential liability to clients, reputational damage and regulatory intervention in the form of requirements, restrictions and penalties, which could affect us.\nWe may not pay dividends on our common shares.\nHolders of our common shares are only entitled to receive such dividends as our Board of Directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments. Although we have historically declared cash dividends on our common shares, we are not required to do so and may reduce or eliminate our common share dividend in the future. Additionally, our funds to pay dividends on common shares are dependent upon dividends paid to us by the Bank, which are subject to regulatory restrictions in certain circumstances. A reduction in our dividend rate could affect the market price of our common shares.\nOur liquidity is dependent upon our ability to receive dividends from our subsidiaries, which accounts for most of our revenue and could affect our ability to pay dividends, and we may be unable to enhance liquidity from other sources.\nWe are a separate and distinct legal entity from our subsidiaries, notably the Bank. We receive substantially all of our revenue from dividends from our subsidiaries. These dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on our common shares and interest and principal on outstanding debt. Various federal and/or state laws and regulations limit or restrict the amount of dividends that the Bank and certain of our non-bank subsidiaries may pay us. Additionally, if our subsidiaries\u2019 earnings are not sufficient to make dividend payments to us while maintaining adequate capital levels, we may not be able to make dividend payments to our common shareholders. As of December 31, 2020, the Bank had $198.0 million available to pay dividends to First Financial without prior regulatory approval.\nTo enhance liquidity, we may borrow under credit facilities or from other sources. Turbulence in the capital and credit markets may cause many lenders and institutional investors to reduce or cease to provide funding to borrowers and, as a result, we may not be able to further increase liquidity through additional borrowings.\nLimitations on our ability to receive dividends from our subsidiaries or an inability to increase liquidity through additional borrowings, or inability to maintain, renew or replace existing credit facilities, could have a material effect on our liquidity and on our ability to pay dividends on our common shares and interest and principal on our debt.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had indebtedness of $942.8 million.\nDisruptions in our ability to access capital markets on desirable terms may affect our capital resources, liquidity and business.\nWe depend on wholesale capital markets to provide us with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet our commitments and business needs, and to accommodate the transaction and cash management needs of our clients. Other sources of funding available to us, and upon which we rely as regular components of our liquidity risk management strategy, include inter-bank borrowings, repurchase agreements and borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank system. Any occurrence that may limit our access to these sources on acceptable or desirable terms, such as a decline in the confidence of debt purchasers, a downgrade in our credit rating, or a downgrade in the credit rating of our depositors or counterparties participating in the capital markets, may affect our capital costs and our ability to raise capital and, in turn, our liquidity.\nIn addition, prior debt offerings could potentially have important consequences to us and our debt and equity investors, including:\n\u2022requiring a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make interest payments;\n\u2022making it more difficult to satisfy debt service and other obligations;\n\u2022increasing the risk of a future credit ratings downgrade of our debt, which could increase future debt costs and limit the future availability of debt financing;\n\u2022increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n\u2022reducing the cash flow available to fund capital expenditures and other corporate purposes and to grow our business;\n\u2022limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry;\n\u2022placing us at a competitive disadvantage relative to our competitors that may not be as highly leveraged with debt; and\n\u2022limiting our ability to borrow additional funds as needed or take advantage of business opportunities as they arise, pay cash dividends or repurchase securities.\nWe are continuing to evaluate these risks on an ongoing basis.\nSignificant or sustained declines in our current market capitalization could impact the carrying value of our goodwill.\nNumerous facts and circumstances are considered when evaluating the carrying value of our goodwill. One of those considerations is our market capitalization, evaluated over a reasonable period of time, in relation to the aggregate estimated fair value of the reporting unit. While this comparison provides some relative market information regarding the estimated fair value of our reporting unit, it is not determinative and needs to be evaluated in the context of the current economic and political environment. However, significant and/or sustained declines in First Financial\u2019s market capitalization, especially in relation to First Financial\u2019s book value, could be an indication of potential impairment of goodwill.\nOther considerations include forecasts of revenues and expenses derived from internal management projections for a period of five years, changes in working capital estimates, company specific discount rate derived from a rate build up approach, externally sourced bank peer group market multiples and externally sourced bank peer group change in control premium, all of which are highly subjective and require significant management judgment. Changes in these key assumptions could materially affect our estimate of the reporting unit fair value and could affect our conclusion regarding the existence of potential impairment.\nA reduction in our credit rating could affect us or the holders of our securities.\nThe credit rating agencies assessing our creditworthiness regularly evaluate the Company, and credit ratings are based on a number of factors, including our financial strength and ability to generate earnings, as well as factors not entirely within our control, including changes in rating methodologies and conditions affecting the financial services industry and the economy. There can be no assurance that we will maintain our current credit rating. A downgrade of the credit rating of the Company could affect our access to liquidity and capital, and could significantly increase our cost of funds, trigger additional collateral or funding requirements and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to us or purchase our securities. This could affect our growth, profitability and financial condition, including liquidity.\nPotential acquisitions may disrupt our business and dilute shareholder value, and we may not be able to successfully consummate or integrate such acquisitions.\nAcquiring other banks, businesses, or branches involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions, including, among other things:\n\u2022potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the target company;\n\u2022exposure to potential asset quality issues of the target company;\n\u2022difficulty and expense of integrating the operations and personnel of the target company;\n\u2022difficulty or added costs in the wind-down of non-strategic operations;\n\u2022potential disruption to our business;\n\u2022potential diversion of our management\u2019s time and attention;\n\u2022the possible loss of key employees and customers of the target company;\n\u2022difficulty in estimating the value (including goodwill) of the target company;\n\u2022difficulty in receiving appropriate regulatory approval for any proposed transaction; and\n\u2022potential changes in banking, or tax laws or regulations or accounting rules that may affect the target company.\nWe regularly evaluate merger and acquisition opportunities and conduct due diligence activities related to possible transactions with other financial institutions and financial services companies. Acquisitions could involve the payment of a premium over book and market values, and, therefore, dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share may occur in connection with any such transaction. Furthermore, any difficulty integrating businesses acquired as a result of a merger or acquisition and the failure to realize the expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence, and/or other projected benefits from an acquisition could have an impact on our liquidity, results of operations and financial condition and any such integration could divert management\u2019s time and attention from managing our company in an effective manner.\nAny merger or acquisition opportunity that we decide to pursue will ultimately be subject to regulatory approval or other closing conditions. We may expend substantial time and resources pursuing potential acquisitions which may not be\nconsummated because regulatory approval or other closing requirements are not satisfied. Additionally, the banking regulators and applicable laws and regulations may restrict our ability to engage in acquisitions under certain circumstances.\nOur accounting policies and processes are critical to how we report our financial condition and results of operations. They require management to make estimates about matters that are uncertain.\nAccounting policies and processes are fundamental to how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. Management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting policies and processes so they comply with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States (GAAP).\nManagement has identified certain accounting policies as being critical because they require management\u2019s judgment to ascertain the valuations of assets, liabilities, commitments and contingencies. A variety of factors could affect the ultimate valuation that is made when recording income, recognizing an expense, recovering an asset, valuing an asset or liability, or reducing a liability. We have established detailed policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure these critical accounting estimates and judgments are well controlled and applied consistently. In addition, our policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. Because of the uncertainty surrounding our judgments and the estimates pertaining to these matters, we cannot guarantee that we will not be required to adjust accounting policies or re-state prior period financial statements.\nSee the \u201cCritical Accounting Policies\u201d in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 1- Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, in our 2020 Annual Report (included within Exhibit 13 to this Form 10-K) for more information.\nChanges in our accounting policies or in accounting standards could materially affect how we report our financial results and condition.\nFrom time to time, the FASB and SEC change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. These changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, we could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively, resulting in us restating prior period financial statements.\nIn June 2016, FASB issued CECL. CECL was expected to result in earlier recognition of credit losses and required consideration of not only past and current events but also reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect collectability. The Bank became subject to the new standard in the first quarter of 2020. Concurrent with the enactment of the CARES Act, federal banking agencies issued an interim final rule that delays the estimated impact on regulatory capital resulting from the adoption of CECL. The interim final rule provided banking organizations that implemented CECL prior to the end of 2020 the option to delay for two years the estimated impact of CECL on regulatory capital relative to regulatory capital determined under the prior incurred loss methodology, followed by a three-year transition period to phase out the aggregate amount of capital benefit provided during the initial two-year delay. The CECL standard requires financial institutions to determine periodic estimates of lifetime expected credit losses on loans and recognize the expected credit losses as allowances for credit losses. See Note 2 - Accounting Standards Recently Adopted or Issued and Note 6 - Allowance for Credit Losses in the Company's Form 10-K for further information regarding the Company's adoption of CECL and the corresponding allowance for credit losses.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures are designed to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) is accurately accumulated and communicated to management, and recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC\u2019s rules and forms. We believe that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of management's system of controls are met.\nThese inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision making can be faulty, that alternative reasoned judgments can be drawn, or that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the controls. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in management's system of controls, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nOur revenues derived from investment securities may be volatile and subject to a variety of risks.\nWe generally maintain investment securities and trading positions in the fixed income markets. Unrealized gains and losses associated with our investment portfolio and mark to market gains and losses associated with our investment portfolio are affected by many factors, including our credit position, interest rate volatility and volatility in capital markets, among other economic factors. Our return on such investments could experience volatility, and such volatility may affect our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, accounting regulations may require us to record a charge prior to the actual realization of a loss when market valuations of such securities are impaired and such impairment is considered to be other than temporary.\nRisks Related to the Legal and Regulatory Environment\nIf our regulators deem it appropriate, they can take regulatory actions that could impact our ability to compete for new business, constrain our ability to fund our liquidity needs and increase the cost of our services.\nFirst Financial and its subsidiaries are subject to the supervision and regulation of various state and federal regulators, including the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC, the SEC, the CFPB, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, and the ODFI. As such, we are subject to a wide variety of laws and regulations. As part of their supervisory process, which includes periodic examinations and continuous monitoring, the regulators have the authority to impose restrictions or conditions on our activities and the manner in which we operate our business. These actions could impact the Company and the Bank in a variety of ways, including subjecting us to fines, restricting our ability to pay dividends, precluding mergers or acquisitions, limiting our ability to offer certain products or services, or imposing additional capital, operating, or oversight requirements.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWeaknesses of other financial institutions could affect us.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be affected by the actions and lack of commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, and counterparty relationships, among others. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry in general, have led to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions in the future. A default, or threatened default, of a large institution could negatively impact the entire financial system, and could expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due us. There is no assurance that any such losses would not affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nMaintaining or increasing market share depends on market acceptance and regulatory approval of new products and services.\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to adapt products and services to evolving industry standards. There is increasing pressure to provide products and services at lower prices, which can reduce net interest income and noninterest income from fee-based products and services. In addition, the widespread adoption of new technologies could require us to make substantial capital expenditures to modify or adapt existing products and services or develop new products and services. We may not be successful in introducing new products and services in response to industry trends or developments in technology or those new products may not achieve market acceptance. As a result, we could lose business, be forced to price products and services on less advantageous terms to retain or attract clients, or be subject to increased costs.\nThe fiscal and monetary policies of the United States government and its agencies could have an effect on our earnings.\nThe Federal Reserve Board regulates the supply of money and credit in the United States. Its policies determine in large part the cost of funds for lending and investing and the returns earned on those loans and investments, both of which affect the net interest margin. The resultant changes in interest rates can also materially affect the value of certain financial assets we hold, such as debt securities. The policies of the Federal Reserve Board can also affect borrowers, potentially increasing the risk that they may fail to repay their loans. Changes in Federal Reserve Board policies are beyond our control and difficult to predict; consequently, the impact of these changes on our activities and results of operations is difficult to predict.\nChanges in tax laws could affect our performance.\nWe are subject to extensive federal, state and local taxes, including income, excise, sales/use, payroll, property, franchise, withholding and ad valorem taxes. Changes to our tax liability could have a material effect on our results of operations. In addition, our customers are subject to a wide variety of federal, state and local taxes. Changes in taxes paid by our customers may affect their ability to purchase homes or consumer products, which could affect their demand for our loans and deposit products. In addition, such negative effects on our customers could result in defaults on the loans we have made and decrease the value of mortgage-backed securities in which we have invested.", "PERMNO": 35685, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "FFBC"}
