RISK FACTORS\nThe business and financial results of PNMR, PNM, and TNMP are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond their control, including those set forth below and in MD&A, Note 16, and Note 17. For other factors that may cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated in any forward-looking statement contained in this report, see Disclosure Regarding Forward Looking Statements in Item 1. Business. TNMP provides transmission and distribution services to REPs that provide electric service to consumers in TNMP\u2019s service territories. References to customers in the risk factors discussed below also encompass the customers of these REPs who are the ultimate consumers of electricity transmitted and distributed through TNMP\u2019s facilities.\nRegulatory Factors\nThe profitability of PNMR\u2019s utilities depends on being able to recover their costs through regulated rates and earn a fair return on invested capital, including investments in its generating plants. Without timely cost recovery, including recovery of undepreciated investments and other costs associated with abandoning generation facilities, and the opportunity to earn a fair return on capital investments, PNMR\u2019s liquidity and results of operations could be negatively impacted. Further, PNM and TNMP are in a period of significant capital expenditures. While increased capital investments and other costs are placing upward pressure on rates charged to customers, energy efficiency initiatives and other factors are placing downward pressure on customer usage. The combination of these matters could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations and cash flows.\nThe rates PNM charges its customers are regulated by the NMPRC and FERC. TNMP is regulated by the PUCT. The Company is in a period requiring significant capital investment and is projecting total construction expenditures for the years 2021-2025 to be $4.0 billion. See Note 14. PNM and TNMP anticipate a trend toward increasing costs, for which they will have to seek regulatory recovery. These costs include or are related to costs of asset construction for generation, transmission, and distribution systems necessary to provide electric service, including new transmission resources, as well as the cost to remove and retire existing assets, environmental compliance expenditures, regulatory mandates to acquire power from renewable resources, increased regulation related to nuclear safety, increased costs related to cybersecurity, increased interest costs to finance capital investments, and depreciation.\nAt the same time costs are increasing, there are factors placing downward pressure on the demand for power, thereby reducing customer usage. These factors include changing customer behaviors, including increased emphasis on energy efficiency measures and utilization of alternative sources of power, rate design that is not driven by economics, which could influence customer behavior, unfavorable economic conditions, reduced new sources of demand, and unpredictable weather patterns.\nThe combination of costs increasing relatively rapidly and the technologies and behaviors that are reducing energy consumption places upward pressure on the per unit prices that must be charged to recover costs. This upward pressure on unit prices could result in additional efforts by customers to reduce consumption through alternative measures. Without timely cost\nA - 12\nrecovery and the authorization to earn a reasonable return on invested capital, the Company\u2019s liquidity and results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nUnder New Mexico law, utilities may propose the use of a FTY in establishing rates. As with any forward-looking financial information, a FTY presents challenges that are inherent in the forecasting process. Forecasts of both operating and capital expenditures necessitate reliance on many assumptions concerning future conditions and operating results. Accordingly, if rate requests based on a FTY cannot be successfully supported, cash flows and results of operations may be negatively impacted. This could result from not being able to withstand challenges from regulators and intervenors regarding the utility\u2019s capability to make reasonable forecasts.\nAs discussed in Note 17, in August 2015, PNM filed an application (the \u201cNM 2015 Rate Case\u201d) with the NMPRC for a general rate increase, which included a request to recover certain costs related to environmental upgrades at SJGS and for the purchase of certain interests in PVNGS. The NMPRC disallowed recovery of certain capital investments made by PNM in SJGS and PVNGS. PNM filed an appeal of these disallowances at the NM Supreme Court which were ultimately unsuccessful and remanded to the NMPRC. On January 8, 2020, the NMPRC issued its order in response to the NM Supreme Court\u2019s remand. The NMPRC reaffirmed its decisions in the NM 2015 Rate Case except for the decision to permanently disallow recovery of certain future decommissioning costs related to PVNGS. The NMPRC indicated that PNM\u2019s ability to recover these costs will be addressed in a future proceeding and closed the NM 2015 Rate Case docket.\nIn December 2016, PNM filed a request for a general increase in rates of $99.2 million (the \u201cNM 2016 Rate Case\u201d). In January 2018, the NMPRC issued an order approving a comprehensive settlement stipulation allowing for an increase in annual non-fuel retail rates of $10.3 million. The NMPRC\u2019s order also included a partial disallowance of PNM\u2019s share of certain environmental upgrades and other investments in Four Corners and deferred further consideration of the prudency of PNM\u2019s continued participation in Four Corners to PNM\u2019s next general rate case filing. On December 29, 2020, Sierra Club filed a motion asking the NMPRC to re-open the NM 2016 Rate Case for the limited purpose of conducting a prudence review of certain Four Corners investments that were deferred at the conclusion of the case. On February 10, 2021, the NMPRC rejected Sierra Club\u2019s motion to re-open the NM 2016 Rate Case and stated that issues on whether the terms of the ETA provide an opportunity for consideration of prudence for Four Corners undepreciated investments included in a financing order or what effects the rates approved in the NM 2016 Rate Case may have on determining energy transition cost should be considered in the Four Corners Abandonment Application.\nOn January 8, 2021, PNM filed the Four Corners Abandonment Application, which seeks NMPRC approval to exit PNM\u2019s 13% share of Four Corners as of December 31, 2024, and issuance of approximately $300 million of energy transition bonds as provided by the ETA. On January 26, 2021, Sierra Club filed a motion in the Four Corners Abandonment Application requesting that the NMPRC order PNM to file supplemental testimony addressing the prudence of Four Corners investments or alternatively that the NMPRC dismiss the Four Corners Application and that PNM may refile after the prudence issue is resolved. In addition, on January 28, 2021, NEE and CFRE filed a motion requesting that the NMPRC dismiss the application, stating that PNM is requesting the NMPRC act contrary to the ETA by using the NTEC transaction as a means of complying with the RPS, that the sale of 200 MW to NTEC is a net detriment to public interest and that none of the costs incurred by PNM in connection with the application or the proposed sale were reasonable or prudent for purpose of recovery. On February 26, 2021, the Hearing Examiner issued an order on the sufficiency of the Four Corners Application requiring PNM to file an amended application with supplemental testimony addressing the prudence of its investment in Four Corners by March 15, 2021. The order also established that the nine-month period for review of the amended application shall start on the date of PNM\u2019s filing of the amended application and run through December 15, 2021. See additional discussion of the ETA and PNM\u2019s Four Corners Abandonment Application in Notes 16 and 17.\nAs discussed in Note 16, on July 1, 2019, PNM filed the SJGS Abandonment Application seeking approval to retire PNM\u2019s share of SJGS after the existing coal supply and participation agreements end in June 2022, for approval of replacement resources, and for the issuance of energy transition bonds, as provided by the ETA. PNM\u2019s application proposed several replacement resource scenarios including PNM\u2019s recommended replacement scenario as well as three other replacement resource scenarios that would place a greater amount of resources in the San Juan area, or result in no new fossil-fueled generating facilities, or no battery storage facilities being added to PNM\u2019s portfolio. The SJGS Abandonment Application included a request to issue up to $361 million of energy transition bonds (the \u201cSecuritized Bonds\u201d).\nOn July 10, 2019, the NMPRC issued an order requiring the SJGS Abandonment Application be considered in two proceedings: one addressing SJGS abandonment and related financing, and the other addressing replacement resources. As discussed in Note 17, after multiple filings and proceedings, in January 2020, the NM Supreme Court issued an order requiring the NMPRC to apply the ETA to all aspects of PNM\u2019s SJGS Abandonment Application and indicating that any previous NMPRC orders inconsistent with the Court\u2019s ruling should be vacated.\nAs discussed in Note 17, on April 1, 2020, the NMPRC unanimously approved the Hearing Examiners\u2019 recommended decisions regarding the abandonment of SJGS and the related securitized financing under the ETA. On April 10, 2020, CFRE and NEE filed a notice of appeal with the NM Supreme Court of the NMPRC\u2019s approval of PNM\u2019s request to issue securitized financing under the ETA. The NM Supreme Court granted motions to intervene filed by PNM, WRA, CCAE, and the Sierra\nA - 13\nClub. On May 8, 2020, CFRE and NEE filed a joint statement of issues with the NM Supreme Court which asserts that the NMPRC improperly applied the ETA and that the ETA violates the New Mexico Constitution. On June 19, 2020, WRA filed a motion to dismiss CFRE and NEE\u2019s constitutional challenges to the ETA on the ground that the New Mexico Constitution provides that only New Mexico district courts have original jurisdiction over the claims. On July 24, 2020, the NM Supreme Court issued an order denying WRA\u2019s motion to dismiss. On August 17, 2020, the appellants filed a Brief in Chief and on October 5, 2020, PNM, WRA, CCAE, and Sierra Club filed Answer Briefs. PNM cannot predict the outcome of this matter.\nOn January 29, 2021 PNM filed its 2020 IRP addressing the 20-year planning period, from 2020 through 2040. The plan focuses on a carbon-free electricity portfolio by 2040 that would eliminate coal at the end of 2024. This includes replacing the power from San Juan with a mix of approved carbon-free resources and the plan to exit Four Corners at the end of 2024. The plan highlights the need for additional investments in a diverse set of resources, including renewables to supply carbon-free power, energy storage to balance supply and demand, and efficiency and other demand-side resources to mitigate load growth.\nOn June 11, 2020. PNM provided notices to the lessors and the NMPRC that PNM will return the leased assets under both its PVNGS Unit 1 and Unit 2 leases upon expiration of the leases in January 2023 and 2024. PNM issued an RFP for replacement power resources on June 25, 2020. PNM intends to file for the abandonment and approval of replacement resources for its share of PVNGS leased capacity with the NMPRC in 2021.\nAn adverse decision of the NMPRC regarding PNM\u2019s ability to recover certain PVNGS decommissioning costs, PNM\u2019s Four Corners Abandonment Application, or the decision made by PNM to return certain leased interests in PVNGS could negatively impact PNM\u2019s financial position, results of operation, and cash flows. Likewise, if the NMPRC does not authorize appropriate recovery of any undepreciated generating resources at the time those resources cease to be used to provide service to New Mexico ratepayers, including required future investments, and does not authorize recovery of the costs of obtaining power to replace those resources, PNM\u2019s financial position, results of operation, and cash flows could be negatively impacted.\nThe inability to operate generation resources prior to their planned retirement dates, or the NMPRC\u2019s denial, modification or delay of PNM\u2019s applications for replacement resources, would require PNM to obtain power from other sources in order to serve the needs of its customers. There can be no assurance the NMPRC will allow PNM to recover undepreciated investments in retired facilities through rates charged to customers, that adequate sources of replacement power would be available, that adequate transmission capabilities would be available to bring that power into PNM\u2019s service territory, or whether the cost of obtaining those resources would be economical. Any such events would negatively impact PNM\u2019s financial position, results of operation, and cash flows unless the NMPRC authorized the collection from customers of any un-recovered costs related to the retired facilities, as well as costs of obtaining replacement power.\nIt is also possible that unsatisfactory outcomes of these matters, the financial impact of climate change regulation or legislation, other environmental regulations, the result of litigation, the adequacy and timeliness of cost recovery mechanisms, and other business considerations, could jeopardize the economic viability of certain generating facilities or the ability or willingness of individual participants to continue their participation through the periods currently contemplated in the agreements governing those facilities.\nPNM currently recovers the cost of fuel for its generation facilities through its FPPAC. A coal supply contract for SJGS, which expires on June 30, 2022, became effective on January 31, 2016. In December 2013, a new fifteen-year coal supply contract for Four Corners beginning in July 2016 was executed. In connection with its exit from Four Corners discussed, and subject to approval of its Four Corners Abandonment Application discussed in Note 17, PNM will be relieved of its obligations under the coal supply agreement after December 31, 2024. The contracts provide for pricing adjustments over their terms based on economic indices. Although PNM believes substantially all costs under coal supply arrangements would continue to be recovered through the FPPAC, there can be no assurance that full recovery will continue to be allowed.\nPNMR has counterparty credit risk in connection with financial support that was provided to facilitate the coal supply arrangement for SJGS. Adverse developments from these factors could have a negative impact on the business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows of PNM and PNMR.\nPNMR has an arrangement with a bank under which the bank has issued $30.3 million of letters of credit in favor of sureties in order for the sureties to post reclamation bonds that are required under the miner\u2019s operating permit. The Company\u2019s financial position, results of operation, and cash flows could be negatively impacted in the event the current mine operator were to not provide sufficient quantities of coal at sufficient quality for PNM to operate SJGS, or if the current mine operator were to default on its obligations to reclaim the San Juan mine and PNMR is required to perform under the letter of credit support agreement.\nA - 14\nPNMR\u2019s utilities are subject to numerous comprehensive federal, state, tribal, and local environmental laws and regulations, including those related to climate change, which may impose significant compliance costs and may significantly limit or affect their operations and financial results.\nCompliance with federal, state, tribal, and local environmental laws and regulations, including those addressing climate change, air quality, CCRs, discharges of wastewater originating from fly ash and bottom ash handling facilities, cooling water, effluent, and other matters, may result in increased capital, operating, and other costs, particularly with regard to enforcement efforts focused on power plant emission control obligations. These costs could include remediation, containment, civil liability, and monitoring expenses. The Company cannot predict how it would be affected if existing environmental laws and regulations were to be repealed, revised, or reinterpreted, or if new environmental laws or regulations were to be adopted. See Note 16 and the Climate Change Issues subsection of the Other Issues Facing the Company section of MD&A.\nUnder the Obama Administration, EPA\u2019s Clean Power Plan required states to develop and implement plans to ensure compliance with emissions guidelines that would limit GHG from existing power plants. Individual states would develop and implement plans to ensure compliance with the proposed standards. The Trump Administration repealed the Clean Power Plan and promulgated the ACE Rule, which required states to set performance standards consistent with the EPA\u2019s determination of \u201cbest system of emission reduction\u201d technology. On January 19, 2021, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia vacated and remanded the ACE Rule. EPA will now act on remand, and it is unclear what next steps the agency will take. In November 2020, the Trump Administration officially withdrew from the Paris Agreement on climate change. On January 20, 2021, President Biden signed an executive order to rejoin the Paris Agreement and will develop new nationally determined contributions to GHG reductions. That same day, President Biden also signed an executive order requiring a review of environmental regulations issued under the Trump Administration. Also, on January 19, 2021, the day before inauguration of President Biden, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit issued an opinion vacating and remanding the ACE Rule. Therefore, PNMR is dealing with an uncertain regulatory and policy environment. Under the Biden Administration, EPA and other federal agencies will seek to expand climate change regulations and work to aggressively reduce GHG emissions. Many state agencies, environmental advocacy groups, and other organizations will continue to focus on decarbonization with enhanced attention on GHG from fossil-fueled generation facilities. See discussion above and Note 17, regarding PNM\u2019s abandonment applications and the ETA. PNM currently depends on fossil-fueled generation for a significant portion of its electricity. As discussed under Climate Change Issues, this type of generation could be subject to future EPA or state regulations requiring GHG reductions. The anticipated expansion of federal and state regulations could result in additional operating restrictions on facilities and increased generation and compliance costs.\nCCRs from the operation of SJGS are currently being used in the reclamation of a surface coal mine. These CCRs consist of fly ash, bottom ash, and gypsum. Any new regulation that would affect the reclamation process, including any future decision regarding classification of CCRs as hazardous waste, could significantly increase the costs of the disposal of CCRs and the costs of mine reclamation. In addition, PNM would incur additional costs to the extent the rule requires the closure or modification of CCR units at Four Corners or the construction of new CCR units beyond those already anticipated or requires corrective action to address releases from CCR disposal units at the site. See Note 16.\nA regulatory body may identify a site requiring environmental cleanup, including cleanup related to catastrophic events such as hurricanes or wildfires, and designate PNM or TNMP as a responsible party. There is also uncertainty in quantifying exposure under environmental laws that impose joint and several liability on all potentially responsible parties. Failure to comply with environmental laws and regulations, even if such non-compliance is caused by factors beyond PNM\u2019s or TNMP\u2019s control, may result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and fines.\nBART determinations have been made for both SJGS and Four Corners under the program to address regional haze in the \u201cfour corners\u201d area. Those determinations require facilities to reduce the levels of visibility-impairing emissions, including NOx. Significant capital expenditures have been made at SJGS and at Four Corners for the installation of control technology, resulting in operating cost increases. The final guidance document for how states are to address the second implementation period (\u201c2nd Planning Period\u201d) of the Regional Haze rule was issued on August 20, 2019. In accordance with that guidance and EPA\u2019s revised regional haze rule, states must submit Regional Haze SIPs by July 2021. NMED is currently preparing its next regional haze SIP and has notified PNM that it will not be required to submit a regional haze four-factor analysis for SJGS since PNM will retire its share of SJGS in 2022. The agency may ask for some documentation of PNM\u2019s plans as the state moves closer to filing their SIP and setting the schedule for hearings on regional haze.\nIf PNM fails to timely obtain, maintain or comply with any required environmental regulatory approval, operations at affected facilities could be suspended or could subject PNM to additional expenses and potential penalties. Failure to comply with applicable environmental laws and regulations also could result in civil liability arising out of government enforcement actions or private claims. In addition, PNMR and its operating subsidiaries may underestimate the costs of environmental compliance, liabilities, and litigation due to the uncertainty inherent in these matters. Although there is uncertainty about the timing and form of the implementation of EPA\u2019s regulations regarding climate change, CCRs, power plant emissions, changes to the ambient air quality standards, and other environmental issues, the promulgation and implementation of such regulations could have a material impact on operations. The Company is unable to estimate these costs due to the many uncertainties\nA - 15\nassociated with, among other things, the nature and extent of future regulations and changes in existing regulations, including the changes in regulatory policy under the Biden Administration. Timely regulatory recovery of costs associated with any environmental-related regulations would be needed to maintain a strong financial and operational profile. The above factors could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.\nPNMR, PNM, and TNMP are subject to complex government regulation unrelated to the environment, which may have a negative impact on their businesses, financial position and results of operations.\nTo operate their businesses, PNMR, PNM, and TNMP are required to have numerous permits and approvals from a variety of regulatory agencies. Regulatory bodies with jurisdiction over the utilities include the NMPRC, NMED, PUCT, TCEQ, ERCOT, FERC, NRC, EPA, and NERC. Oversight by these agencies covers many aspects of the Company\u2019s utility operations including, but not limited to: location, construction, and operation of facilities; the purchase of power under long-term contracts; conditions of service; the issuance of securities; and rates charged to customers. FERC has issued a number of rules pertaining to preventing undue discrimination in transmission services and electric reliability standards. The significant level of regulation imposes restrictions on the operations of the Company and causes the incurrence of substantial compliance costs. PNMR and its subsidiaries are unable to predict the impact on their business and operating results from future actions of any agency regulating the Company. Changes in existing regulations or the adoption of new ones could result in additional expenses and/or changes in business operations. Failure to comply with any applicable rules, regulations or decisions may lead to customer refunds, fines, penalties, and other payments, which could materially and adversely affect the results of operations and financial condition of PNMR and its subsidiaries.\nOperational Factors\nCustomer electricity usage could be reduced by increases in prices charged and other factors. This could result in underutilization of PNM\u2019s generating capacity, as well as underutilization of the capacities of PNM\u2019s and TNMP\u2019s transmission and distribution systems. Should this occur, operating and capital costs might not be fully recovered, and financial performance could be negatively impacted.\nA number of factors influence customers\u2019 electricity usage. These factors include but are not limited to rates charged by PNM and TNMP, rates charged by REPs utilizing TNMP\u2019s facilities to deliver power, energy efficiency initiatives, availability and cost of alternative sources of power, and national, regional, or local economic conditions.\nThese factors and others may prompt customers to institute additional energy efficiency measures or take other actions that would result in lower energy consumption. If customers bypass or underutilize PNM\u2019s and TNMP\u2019s facilities through self-generation, renewable, or other energy resources, technological change, or other measures, revenues would be negatively impacted.\nPNM\u2019s and TNMP\u2019s service territories include several military bases and federally funded national laboratories, as well as large industrial customers that have significant direct and indirect impacts on the local economies where they operate. The Company does not directly provide service to any of the military bases or national laboratories but does provide service to large industrial customers. The Company\u2019s business could be hurt from the impacts on the local economies associated with these customer groups as well as directly from the large industrial customers for a number of reasons including federally-mandated base closures, significant curtailment of the activities at the bases or national laboratories, and closure of industrial facilities or significant curtailment of their activities.\nAnother factor that could negatively impact the Company is that proposals are periodically advanced in various localities to municipalize, or otherwise take over PNM\u2019s facilities, which PNM believes would require state legislative action to implement, or to establish new municipal utilities in areas currently served by PNM. If any such initiative is successful, the result could be a material reduction in the usage of the facilities, a reduction in rate base, and reduced earnings.\nShould any of the above factors result in facilities being underutilized, the Company\u2019s financial position, operational results, and cash flows could be significantly impacted.\nAdvances in technology could make electric generating facilities less competitive.\nResearch and development activities are ongoing for new technologies that produce power or reduce power consumption. These technologies include renewable energy, customer-oriented generation, energy storage, and energy efficiency. PNM generates power at central station power plants to achieve economies of scale and produce power at a cost that is competitive with rates established through the regulatory process. There are distributed generation technologies that produce power, including fuel cells, microturbines, wind turbines, and solar cells, which have become increasingly cost competitive. These advances in technology have reduced the costs of these alternative methods of producing power to a level that is competitive with that of central station power production. In addition, advances made in the capabilities of energy storage have further decreased power production and peak usage through the dispatch of more battery systems. These technological advances have resulted in demand reduction that negatively impact revenue and/or result in underutilized assets that have been\nA - 16\nbuilt to serve peak usage. In addition, certain federal, state, or local requirements that regulated utilities such as PNM are required to follow could result in third parties being able to provide electricity from similar generation technologies to consumers at prices lower than PNM is able to offer. As these technologies become more cost competitive or can be used by third-parties to supply power at lower prices than PNM is able to offer, PNM\u2019s energy sales and/or regulated returns could be eroded, and the value of its generating facilities could be reduced. Advances in technology could also change the channels through which electric customers purchase or use power, which could reduce the Company\u2019s sales and revenues or increase expenses. These advances can also create more uncertainty in load shapes and forecasts, which could have implications for generation and system planning.\nCosts of decommissioning, remediation, and restoration of nuclear and fossil-fueled power plants, as well as reclamation of related coal mines, could exceed the estimates of PNMR and PNM as well as the amounts PNM recovers from its ratepayers, which could negatively impact results of operations and liquidity.\nPNM has interests in a nuclear power plant, two coal-fired power plants, and several natural gas-fired power plants and is obligated to pay its share of the costs to decommission these facilities. PNM is also obligated to pay for its share of the costs of reclamation of the mines that supply coal to the coal-fired power plants. Likewise, other owners or participants are responsible for their shares of the decommissioning and reclamation obligations and it is important to PNM that those parties fulfill their obligations. Rates charged by PNM to its customers, as approved by the NMPRC, include a provision for recovery of certain costs of decommissioning, remediation, reclamation, and restoration. The NMPRC has established a cap on the amount of costs for the final reclamation of the surface coal mines that may be recovered from customers. PNM records estimated liabilities for its share of the legal obligations for decommissioning and reclamation. These estimates include many assumptions about future events and are inherently imprecise. In the event the costs to decommission the facilities or to reclaim the mines serving the plants exceed current estimates, or if amounts are not approved for recovery by the NMPRC, results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nThe costs of decommissioning any nuclear power plant are substantial. PNM is responsible for all decommissioning obligations related to its entire interest in PVNGS, including portions under lease both during and after termination of the leases. PNM maintains trust funds designed to provide adequate financial resources for decommissioning PVNGS and for reclamation of the coal mines serving SJGS and Four Corners at the end of their expected lives. However, if the PVNGS units are decommissioned before their planned date or the coal mines are shut down sooner than expected, these funds may prove to be insufficient.\nThe financial performance of PNMR, PNM, and TNMP may be adversely affected if power plants and transmission and distribution systems do not operate reliably and efficiently.\nThe Company\u2019s financial performance depends on the successful operation of PNM\u2019s generation assets, as well as the transmission and distribution systems of PNM and TNMP. PNM\u2019s recent abandonment applications for SJGS and Four Corners will increase PNM\u2019s dependency on other generation resources, including renewable resources, gas-fired facilities, and PVNGS, and will reduce PNM\u2019s flexibility in managing those resources. Unscheduled or longer than expected maintenance outages, breakdown or failure of equipment or processes due to aging infrastructure, temporary or permanent shutdowns to achieve environmental compliance, other performance problems with the generation assets, severe weather conditions, accidents and other catastrophic events, acts of war or terrorism, cybersecurity attacks, wildfires, disruptions in the supply, quality, and delivery of fuel and water supplies, and other factors could result in PNM\u2019s load requirements being larger than available system generation capacity. Unplanned outages of generating units and extensions of scheduled outages occur from time to time and are an inherent risk of the Company\u2019s business. If these were to occur, PNM would be required to purchase electricity in either the wholesale market or spot market at the then-current market price. There can be no assurance that sufficient electricity would be available at reasonable prices, or available at all. The failure of transmission or distribution facilities may also affect PNM\u2019s and TNMP\u2019s ability to deliver power. These potential generation, distribution, and transmission problems, and any service interruptions related to them, could result in lost revenues and additional costs.\nPNMR, PNM, and TNMP are subject to information security breaches and risks of unauthorized access to their information and operational technology systems as well as physical threats to assets.\nThe Company faces the risk of physical and cybersecurity attacks, both threatened and actual, against generation facilities, transmission and distribution infrastructure, information technology systems, and network infrastructure, which could negatively impact the ability of the Company to generate, transport, and deliver power, or otherwise operate facilities in the most efficient manner or at all.\nThe utility industry in which the Company operates is a highly regulated industry that requires the continued operation of sophisticated information technology systems and network infrastructure, some of which are deemed to be critical infrastructure under NERC guidelines. Certain of the Company\u2019s systems are interconnected with external networks. In the regular course of business, the utilities handle a range of sensitive security and customer information. PNM and TNMP are subject to the rules of various agencies concerning safeguarding and maintaining the confidentiality of this information. Despite steps the Company may take to detect, mitigate and/or eliminate threats and respond to security incidents, the\nA - 17\ntechniques used by those who wish to obtain unauthorized access, and possibly disable or sabotage systems and/or abscond with information and data, change frequently and the Company may not be able to protect against all such actions.\nIn the event a capable party attempts to disrupt the generation, transmission, or distribution systems in the U.S., the Company\u2019s computer and operating systems could be subject to physical or cybersecurity attack. Further, the Company\u2019s use of technologies manufactured by third parties may be subject to espionage activities, and cyber attack of the third party resulting in losses outside of the control of the company. Although the Company has implemented security measures to identify, prevent, detect, respond to, and recover from cyber and physical security events and supply chain disruptions, critical infrastructure, including information and operational technology systems, are vulnerable to disability, failures, or unauthorized access, which could occur as a result of malicious compromise, employee error, and/or employee misconduct or supply compromise. A successful physical or cybersecurity attack or other similar failure of the systems could impact the reliability of PNM\u2019s generation and PNM\u2019s and TNMP\u2019s transmission and distribution systems, including the possible unauthorized shutdown of facilities. Such an event could lead to disruptions of business operations, including the Company\u2019s ability to generate, transport, and deliver power to serve customers, to bill customers, and to process other financial information. A breach of the Company\u2019s information systems could also lead to the loss and destruction of confidential and proprietary data, personally identifiable information, trade secrets, intellectual property and supplier data, and could disrupt business operations which could harm the Company\u2019s reputation and financial results, as well as potential increased regulatory oversight, litigation, fines, and other remedial action. The costs incurred to investigate and remediate a physical or cybersecurity attack could be significant. A significant physical or cybersecurity attack on the Company\u2019s critical infrastructure could have an adverse impact on the operations, reputation and financial condition of PNMR, PNM, and TNMP.\nThere are inherent risks in the ownership and operation of nuclear facilities.\nPNM has a 10.2% undivided interest in PVNGS, including interests in Units 1 and 2 held under leases. PVNGS represents 14.3% of PNM\u2019s total generating capacity as of December 31, 2020. PVNGS is subject to environmental, health, and financial risks including but not limited to the ability to obtain adequate supplies of nuclear fuel and water, the ability to dispose of spent nuclear fuel, decommissioning of the plant (see above), securing the facilities against possible terrorist attacks, and unscheduled outages due to equipment failures.\nThe NRC has broad authority under federal law to impose licensing and safety-related requirements for the operation of nuclear generation facilities. Events at nuclear facilities of other operators or which impact the industry generally may lead the NRC to impose additional requirements and regulations on all nuclear generation facilities, including PVNGS. A major incident at a nuclear facility anywhere in the world could cause the NRC to limit or prohibit the operation or licensing of any domestic nuclear unit and to promulgate new regulations that could require significant capital expenditures and/or increase operating costs.\nIn the event of noncompliance with its requirements, the NRC has the authority to impose a progressively increasing inspection regime that could ultimately result in the shutdown of a unit, civil penalties, or both, depending upon the NRC\u2019s assessment of the severity of the situation, until compliance is achieved. Increased costs resulting from penalties, a heightened level of scrutiny, and/or implementation of plans to achieve compliance with NRC requirements could adversely affect the financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows of PNMR and PNM. Although PNM has no reason to anticipate a serious nuclear incident at PVNGS, if an incident did occur, it could materially and adversely affect PNM\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nPNM has external insurance coverage to minimize its financial exposure to some risks. However, it is possible that liabilities associated with nuclear operations could exceed the amount of insurance coverage. See Note 16.\nPeak demand for power could exceed forecasted supply capacity, resulting in increased costs for purchasing capacity in the market or building additional generation facilities and/or battery storage facilities.\nPNM is obligated to supply power to retail customers. As PNM continues to complete the significant transition in generation resources necessary to achieve 100% carbon emission-free generation by 2040, there are certain potential deliverability and cost risks associated with this transition. These risks are in three main areas, including 1) risk of completion of replacement resources prior to planned generation unit retirements, 2) increasing levels of renewable generation presenting risks of uncertainty and variability that will be further compounded as neighboring systems transition towards increasing levels of renewable resources, and 3) risks for mitigating possible resource volatility through a shrinking energy market.\nAt peak times, power demand could exceed PNM\u2019s forecasted available generation capacity, particularly if PNM\u2019s power plants are not performing as anticipated and additional resources are not approved as PNM transitions its system. Competitive market forces or adverse regulatory actions may require PNM to purchase capacity and energy from the market or build additional resources to meet customers\u2019 energy needs in an expedited manner. If that occurs, PNM may see opposition to recovery of these additional costs and could experience a lag between when costs are incurred and when regulators permit recovery in customers\u2019 rates. These situations could have negative impacts on results of operations and cash flows.\nA - 18\nThe impact of wildfires could negatively affect PNM\u2019s and TNMP\u2019s results of operations.\nPNM and TNMP have large networks of electric transmission and distribution facilities. Weather conditions in the U.S. Southwest region and Texas vary and could contribute to wildfires in or near PNM\u2019s and TNMP\u2019s service territories. PNM and TNMP take proactive steps to mitigate wildfire risk. However, wildfire risk is always present and PNM and TNMP could be held liable for damages incurred as a result of wildfires caused, or allegedly caused, by their transmission and distribution systems. In addition, wildfires could cause damage to PNM\u2019s and TNMP\u2019s assets that could result in loss of service to customers or make it difficult to supply power in sufficient quantities to meet customer needs. These events could have negative impacts on the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nDifficulties in obtaining permits and rights-of-way could negatively impact PNM\u2019s results of operations\nPNM\u2019s ability to execute planned operational activities and projects may be inhibited by difficulties in obtaining permits and rights-of-way and other delays. Many of PNM\u2019s transmission and distribution lines cross federal, state, and tribal lands. The Company can experience significant delays in obtaining approvals for new infrastructure, as well as renewals of existing rights-of-way and access for critical maintenance, including vegetation management on these lands. The environmental regulations governing siting and permitting on federal, state, and tribal lands are complex, involve multiple agencies, and include a public process. Any of these risk factors could result in higher costs, delays, or the inability to complete planned projects.\nGeneral Economic and Weather Factors\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 and its impact on business and economic conditions could negatively affect the Company's business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, and the trading value of PNMR's common stock and the Company's debt securities.\nThe scale and scope of the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, the resulting global pandemic, and the impact on the economy and financial markets could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, and access to the capital markets. The Company provides critical electric services and has implemented business continuity and emergency response plans to continue to provide these services to its customers and to support the Company\u2019s operations. The Company is also working to ensure the health and safety of its employees is not compromised. These measures include precautions with regard to employee and facility hygiene, travel limitations, directing our employees to work remotely whenever possible, and protocols for required work within customer premises to protect our employees, customers and the public. We are also working with our suppliers to understand and mitigate the potential impacts to our supply chain and have taken steps to ensure the integrity of our information systems.\nHowever, there is no assurance that the continued spread of COVID-19 and efforts to contain the virus will not adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition, cash flows, ability to access the capital markets, and the trading value of the Company's common stock and debt securities. The continued spread of COVID-19 and related efforts to contain the virus could adversely impact the Company by:\n\u2022reducing usage and/or demand for electricity by our customers in New Mexico and Texas;\n\u2022reducing the availability and productivity of our employees;\n\u2022increasing costs as a result of our emergency measures, including costs to ensure the security of our information systems and delayed payments from our customers and uncollectable accounts;\n\u2022causing delays and disruptions in the availability of and timely delivery of materials and components used in our operations;\n\u2022causing delays and disruptions in the supply chain resulting in disruptions in the commercial operation dates of certain projects;\n\u2022causing a deterioration in the credit quality of our counterparties, including power purchase agreement providers, contractors or retail customers, that could result in credit losses;\n\u2022causing impairments of goodwill or long-lived assets and adversely impacting the Company\u2019s ability to develop, construct and operate facilities;\n\u2022impacting the Company\u2019s ability to meet the requirements of the covenants in our existing credit facilities, including covenants regarding debt to capitalization;\n\u2022causing a deterioration in our financial metrics or the business environment that impacts our credit ratings;\n\u2022decreasing the value of our investment securities held in trusts for pension and other postretirement benefits, and for nuclear and coal mine decommissioning, which could lead to increased funding requirements;\n\u2022impacting our liquidity position and cost of and ability to access funds from financial institutions and capital markets;\n\u2022receiving unfavorable regulatory treatment in recovery of deferred costs including bad debt expense incurred during the Governor of New Mexico\u2019s emergency executive order; and\n\u2022causing other unpredictable events.\nA - 19\nGeneral economic conditions of the nation and/or specific areas can affect the Company\u2019s customers and suppliers. Economic recession or downturn may result in decreased consumption by customers and increased bad debt expense, and could also negatively impact suppliers, all of which could negatively affect the Company.\nEconomic activity in the service territories of PNMR subsidiaries is a key factor in their performance. Decreased economic activity can lead to declines in energy consumption, which could adversely affect future revenues, earnings, and growth. Higher unemployment rates, both in the Company\u2019s service territories and nationwide, could result in commercial customers ceasing operations and lower levels of income for residential customers. These customers might then be unable to pay their bills on time, which could increase bad debt expense and negatively impact results of operations and cash flows. Economic conditions also impact the supply and/or cost of commodities and materials needed to construct or acquire utility assets or make necessary repairs.\nThe operating results of PNMR and its operating subsidiaries are seasonal and are affected by weather conditions, including regional drought.\nElectric generation, transmission, and distribution are generally seasonal businesses that vary with the demand for power. With power consumption typically peaking during the hot summer months, revenues traditionally peak during that period. As a result, quarterly operating results of PNMR and its operating subsidiaries vary throughout the year. In addition, PNMR and its operating subsidiaries have historically had lower revenues resulting in lower earnings when weather conditions are milder. Unusually mild weather in the future could reduce the revenues, net earnings, and cash flows of the Company.\nDrought conditions in New Mexico, especially in the \u201cfour corners\u201d region, where SJGS and Four Corners are located, may affect the water supply for PNM\u2019s generating plants. If inadequate precipitation occurs in the watershed that supplies that region, PNM may have to decrease generation at these plants. This would require PNM to purchase power to serve customers and/or reduce the ability to sell excess power on the wholesale market and reduce revenues. Drought conditions or actions taken by the court system, regulators, or legislators could limit PNM\u2019s supply of water, which would adversely impact PNM\u2019s business. Although SJGS and Four Corners participate in voluntary shortage sharing agreements with tribes and other water users in the \u201cfour corners\u201d region, PNM cannot be certain these contracts will be enforceable in the event of a major drought or that it will be able to renew these contracts in the future.\nTNMP\u2019s service areas are exposed to extreme weather, including high winds, drought, flooding, ice storms, and periodic hurricanes. Extreme weather conditions, particularly high winds and severe thunderstorms, also occur periodically in PNM\u2019s service areas. These severe weather events can physically damage facilities owned by TNMP and PNM. Any such occurrence both disrupts the ability to deliver energy and increases costs. Extreme weather can also reduce customers\u2019 usage and demand for energy or could result in the Company incurring obligations to third parties related to such events. These factors could negatively impact results of operations and cash flows.\nIn mid-February 2021, Texas experienced a severe winter storm delivering the coldest temperatures in 100 years for many parts of the state. On February 15, 2021, ERCOT declared its highest state of emergency, an Emergency Energy Alert Level 3 (EEA3), due to exceptionally high electric demand exceeding supply amid the arctic temperatures. Ultimately, the ERCOT market was not able to deliver sufficient generation load to the grid resulting in significant, statewide outages as ERCOT directed transmission operators to curtail thousands of firm load megawatts. TNMP complied with ERCOT directives to curtail the delivery of electricity in its service territory and did not experience significant outages on its system outside of the ERCOT directed curtailments. Additionally, the PUCT issued an order directing ERCOT to ensure that firm load that is being shed in EEA3 is accounted for in ERCOT\u2019s scarcity pricing signals. Energy prices across the ERCOT system eventually were cleared at the system-wide offer cap of $9,000 per MWh. In response to the severe winter weather, the Governor of Texas issued a Declaration of a State of Disaster for all counties in Texas. In addition, to assist in the recovery from the emergency conditions, the PUCT issued an order that placed a temporary moratorium on customer disconnections due to non-payment for transmission and distribution utilities. The moratorium remains in effect until otherwise ordered by the PUCT. Consequently, the duration of the severe winter storm and high energy costs potentially pose a financial hardship to REPs in the ERCOT region. TNMP has regulatory authorization to defer bad debt expense from REPs to a regulatory asset and seek recovery in a general rate case. On February 19, 2021 the Texas Attorney General issued civil investigation demands to ERCOT and 11 power companies in Texas related to power outages, emergency plans, energy pricing and other factors associated with the severe weather storm. TNMP intends to fully cooperate with all regulatory directives and inquiries with the PUCT, the Texas Attorney General and any other regulatory agencies.\nRisks relating to the proposed Merger with Avangrid\nThere is no assurance when or if the proposed Merger will be completed.\nCompletion of the proposed Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of a number of conditions as set forth in the Merger Agreement, including regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions. There can be no assurance that the conditions to completion of the proposed Merger will be satisfied or waived or that other events will not intervene to delay or result in the failure to close the proposed Merger. In addition, each of Avangrid and PNMR may unilaterally terminate the\nA - 20\nMerger Agreement under certain circumstances, and Avangrid and PNMR may agree at any time to terminate the Merger Agreement, even if PNMR shareholders have already approved the Merger Agreement.\nAvangrid and PNMR may be unable to obtain the regulatory approvals required to complete the proposed Merger.\nIn addition to other conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement, completion of the proposed Merger remains conditioned upon the receipt of various state and U.S. federal regulatory approvals, including, but not limited to, approval by NMPRC, PUCT, FERC, NRC and the FCC. Avangrid and PNMR have made various filings and submissions and will pursue all required consents, orders and approvals in accordance with the Merger Agreement. These consents, orders and approvals may impose requirements, limitations or costs or place restrictions, and if such consents, orders and approvals require an extended period of time to be obtained, such extended period of time could increase the chance that an event occurs that constitutes a material adverse effect with respect to PNMR and thereby may allow Avangrid not to complete the proposed Merger. Such extended period of time also may increase the chance that other adverse effects with respect to PNMR could occur, such as the loss of key personnel. Further, no assurance can be given that the required consents, orders and approvals will be obtained or that the required conditions to closing will be satisfied.\nThe announcement and pendency of the proposed Merger, during which PNMR is subject to certain operating restrictions, could have an adverse effect on PNMR\u2019s businesses, results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nThe announcement and pendency of the proposed Merger could disrupt PNMR\u2019s businesses, and uncertainty about the effect of the Merger may have an adverse effect on PNMR. These uncertainties could disrupt the business of PNMR and cause suppliers, vendors, partners and others that deal with PNMR to defer entering into contracts with PNMR or making other decisions concerning PNMR or seek to change or cancel existing business relationships with PNMR. In addition, PNMR\u2019s employees may experience uncertainty regarding their roles after the Merger. For example, employees may depart either before the completion of the Merger because of such uncertainty and issues relating to the difficulty of coordination or a desire not to remain following the Merger; and the pendency of the Merger may adversely affect PNMR\u2019s ability to retain, recruit and motivate key personnel. Additionally, the Merger requires PNMR to obtain Avangrid\u2019s consent prior to taking certain specified actions while the Merger is pending. These restrictions may prevent PNMR from pursuing otherwise attractive business opportunities or other capital structure alternatives and making other changes to its business or executing certain of its business strategies prior to the completion of the Merger. Further, the Merger may give rise to potential liabilities, including as a result of pending and future shareholder lawsuits relating to the Merger. Any of these matters could adversely affect the businesses of, or harm the results of operations, financial condition or cash flows of PNMR.\nPNMR will incur substantial transaction fees and costs in connection with the proposed Merger.\nPNMR has incurred and expects to incur additional material non-recurring expenses in connection with the proposed Merger and completion of the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Further, even if the proposed Merger is not completed, PNMR will need to pay certain costs relating to the proposed Merger incurred prior to the date the proposed Merger was abandoned, such as legal, accounting, financial advisory, filing and printing fees.\nThe termination of the Merger Agreement could negatively impact PNMR.\nIf the Merger is not completed for any reason, the ongoing businesses of PNMR may be adversely affected and, without realizing any of the anticipated benefits of having completed the Merger, PNMR would be subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022PNMR may experience negative reactions from the financial markets, including a decline of its stock price (which may reflect a market assumption that the Merger will be completed);\n\u2022PNMR may experience negative reactions from its customers, regulators and employees;\n\u2022PNMR may be required to pay certain costs relating to the Merger, whether or not the Merger is completed; and\n\u2022Matters relating to the Merger will have required substantial commitments of time and resources by PNMR management, which would otherwise have been devoted to day-to-day operations and other opportunities that may have been beneficial to PNMR as an independent company.\nIf the Merger Agreement is terminated and the Board seeks another merger, business combination or other transaction, PNMR shareholders cannot be certain that PNMR will be able to find a party willing to offer equivalent or more attractive consideration than the consideration PNMR shareholders would receive in the Merger. If the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances specified in the Merger Agreement, PNMR may be required to pay Avangrid a termination fee of $130.0 million, depending on the circumstances surrounding the termination. Additionally, PNMR may be required to reimburse Avangrid for its reasonable and documented out-of-pocket transaction fees and expenses, up to an amount of $10.0 million, with any such reimbursable expenses previously paid by PNMR to Avangrid credited and offset against PNMR\u2019s payment of the termination fee.\nA - 21\nLitigation instituted against PNMR and members of the Board challenging the proposed Merger, and adverse judgments in these lawsuits may prevent the proposed Merger from becoming effective within the expected timeframe or at all.\nPNMR and members of the Board have been named as defendants in proceedings challenging the proposed Merger. If the plaintiffs in any of these actions seek a preliminary or permanent injunction and are successful in obtaining one, the parties may be prevented from completing the proposed Merger in the expected timeframe, if at all. Even if the plaintiffs in these actions are not successful in obtaining an injunction, they may nevertheless continue the action and seek damages after the transaction has closed. In addition, the costs of defending against such claims could adversely affect the financial condition of PNMR and such actions could adversely affect the reputation of PNMR and members of its boards of directors or management. See Note 16.\nThe Merger Agreement contains provisions that could discourage a potential alternative acquirer that might be willing to pay more to acquire PNMR.\nThe Merger Agreement contains customary \u201cno shop\u201d provisions which state that we will not solicit or facilitate proposals regarding a merger or similar transaction with another party except in certain limited circumstances. While the Board may withdraw or change its recommendation regarding the Merger Agreement in response to an unsolicited third-party proposal to acquire PNMR that the Board determines to be superior to the Merger, there are restrictions on its ability to do so, and in certain circumstances, PNM may also be required to pay Avangrid a termination fee. These provisions could discourage a potential third-party acquirer from considering or proposing an alternative acquisition, even if it were prepared to pay consideration with a higher value than that proposed to be paid in the Merger.\nFinancial Factors\nPNMR may be unable to meet its ongoing and future financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock if its subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends or distributions to PNMR.\nPNMR is a holding company and has no operations of its own. PNMR\u2019s ability to meet its financial obligations and to pay dividends on its common stock primarily depends on the net earnings and cash flows of PNM and TNMP and their capacity to pay upstream dividends or distributions. Prior to providing funds to PNMR, PNM and TNMP have financial and regulatory obligations that must be satisfied, including among others, debt service and, in the case of PNM, preferred stock dividends.\nThe NMPRC has placed certain restrictions on the ability of PNM to pay dividends to PNMR, including that PNM cannot pay dividends that cause its debt rating to fall below investment grade. The NMPRC has also restricted PNM from paying dividends in any year, as determined on a rolling four-quarter basis, in excess of net earnings without prior NMPRC approval. PNM is permitted to pay dividends to PNMR from prior equity contributions made by PNMR. Additionally, PNMR\u2019s financing agreements generally include a covenant to maintain a debt-to-capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70%, and PNM and TNMP\u2019s financing arrangements generally include a covenant to maintain debt-to-capitalization ratios that do not exceed 65%. PNM also has various financial covenants that limit the transfer of assets, through dividends or other means and the Federal Power Act imposes certain restrictions on dividends paid by public utilities, including that dividends cannot be paid from paid-in capital.\nFurther, the ability of PNMR to declare dividends depends upon the extent to which cash flows will support dividends, the Company\u2019s financial circumstances and performance, economic conditions in the U.S. and in the Company\u2019s service areas, future growth plans and the related capital requirements, and other business considerations. Declaration of dividends may also be affected by decisions of the NMPRC, FERC, and PUCT in various regulatory cases currently pending or that may be docketed in the future, including the outcome of appeals of those decisions, conditions imposed by the NMPRC, PUCT, or Federal Power Act, and the effect of federal regulatory decisions and legislative acts.\nDisruption in the credit and capital markets may impact the Company\u2019s strategy and ability to raise capital.\nAs discussed in MD&A - Liquidity and Capital Resources, PNMR and its subsidiaries rely on access to both short-term and longer-term capital markets as sources of liquidity for any capital requirements not satisfied by cash flow from operations. In general, the Company relies on its short-term credit facilities as the initial source to finance construction expenditures. This results in increased borrowings under the facilities over time. The Company is currently projecting total construction expenditures for the years 2021-2025 to be $4.0 billion. If PNMR or its operating subsidiaries are not able to access capital at competitive rates, or at all, PNMR\u2019s ability to finance capital requirements and implement its strategy will be limited. Disruptions in the credit markets, which could negatively impact the Company\u2019s access to capital, could be caused by an economic recession, declines in the health of the banking sector generally or the failure of specific banks who are parties to the Company\u2019s credit facilities, deterioration in the overall health of the utility industry, the bankruptcy of an unrelated energy company, war, terrorist attacks, cybersecurity attacks, or threatened attacks.\nIf the Company\u2019s cash flow and credit and capital resources are insufficient to fund capital expenditure plans, the Company may be forced to delay important capital investments, sell assets, seek additional equity or debt capital, or restructure\nA - 22\ndebt. In addition, insufficient cash flows and capital resources may result in reductions of credit ratings. This could negatively impact the Company\u2019s ability to incur additional indebtedness on acceptable terms and would result in an increase in the interest rates applicable under the Company\u2019s credit facilities. The Company\u2019s cash flow and capital resources may be insufficient to pay interest and principal on debt in the future. If that should occur, the Company\u2019s capital raising or debt restructuring measures may be unsuccessful or inadequate to meet scheduled debt service obligations. This could cause the Company to default on its obligations and further impair liquidity.\nReduction in credit ratings or changing rating agency requirements could materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s growth, strategy, business, financial position, results of operations, and liquidity.\nPNMR, PNM, and TNMP cannot be sure that any of their current credit ratings will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be put under review for a downgrade, lowered, or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency. As discussed in MD&A - Liquidity and Capital Resources, all of PNMR, PNM, and TNMP debt ratings are investments grade. Downgrades or changing requirements could result in increased borrowing costs due to higher interest rates on current borrowings or future financings, a smaller potential pool of investors, and decreased funding sources. Such conditions also could require the provision of additional support in the form of letters of credit and cash or other collateral to various counterparties.\nDeclines in values of marketable securities held in trust funds for pension and other postretirement benefits and in the NDT and mine reclamation trusts could result in sustained increases in costs and funding requirements for those obligations, which may affect operational results.\nThe pension plans\u2019 targeted asset allocation is 50% liability matching fixed and 50% return generating income, which includes alternative income. The Company uses a strategy, known as Liability Driven Investing, which seeks to select investments that match the liabilities of the pension plans. The OPEB plans generally use the same pension fixed income and equity investment managers and utilize the same overall investment strategy as the pension plans, except there is no allocation to alternative investments and the OPEB plans have a target asset allocation of 30% equities and 70% fixed income.\nThe NDT investment portfolio maintains a target of 80% fixed income and 20% equity securities. The current asset allocation exposes the NDT investment portfolio to market and macroeconomic factors. Declines in market values could result in increased funding of the trusts, the recognition of losses as impairments for the NDT and mine reclamation trusts, and additional expense for the benefit plans. In addition, a change in GAAP required that all changes in the fair value of equity securities recorded on the Company\u2019s balance sheet be reflected in earnings, which results in increased volatility in earnings.\nImpairments of goodwill and long-lived assets of PNMR, PNM, and TNMP could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial position, liquidity, and results of operations.\nThe Company annually evaluates recorded goodwill for impairment. See Note 1 and the Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates section of MD&A. Long-lived assets are also assessed whenever indicators of impairment exist. Factors that affect the long-term value of these assets, including treatment by regulators in ratemaking proceedings, as well as other economic and market conditions, could result in impairments. Significant impairments could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, financial position, liquidity, and results of operations.\nPNM\u2019s PVNGS leases describe certain events, including \u201cEvents of Loss\u201d and \u201cDeemed Loss Events\u201d, the occurrence of which could require PNM to take ownership of the underlying assets and pay the lessors for the assets.\nThe \u201cEvents of Loss\u201d generally relate to casualties, accidents, and other events at PVNGS, including the occurrence of specified nuclear events, which would severely adversely affect the ability of the operating agent, APS, to operate, and the ability of PNM to earn a return on its interests in PVNGS. The \u201cDeemed Loss Events\u201d consist primarily of legal and regulatory changes (such as issuance by the NRC of specified violation orders, changes in law making the sale and leaseback transactions illegal, or changes in law making the lessors liable for nuclear decommissioning obligations). PNM believes that the probability of such \u201cEvents of Loss\u201d or \u201cDeemed Loss Events\u201d occurring is remote for the following reasons: (1) to a large extent, prevention of \u201cEvents of Loss\u201d and some \u201cDeemed Loss Events\u201d is within the control of the PVNGS participants through the general PVNGS operational and safety oversight process; and (2) other \u201cDeemed Loss Events\u201d would involve a significant change in current law and policy. PNM is unaware of any proposals pending or being considered for introduction in Congress, or in any state legislative or regulatory body that, if adopted, would cause any of those events. Furthermore, the NRC places restrictions on the ownership of nuclear generating facilities. These restrictions could limit the transfer of ownership should PNM decide to return the assets underlying all or a portion of its current leased interests in PVNGS. In the event PNM decides to return these interests to the lessors, and a qualified buyer cannot be identified, PNM may be required to retain all of a portion of its existing leased capacity in PVNGS or be exposed to other claims for damages by the lessors. See Note 8. If these events were to occur, there is no assurance PNM would be provided cost recovery from customers.\nA - 23\nThe impacts and implementation of U.S. tax reform legislation may negatively impact PNMR\u2019s, PNM\u2019s, and TNMP\u2019s businesses, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOn December 22, 2017, comprehensive changes in U.S. federal income taxes were enacted through legislation commonly known as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d). Among other things, the Tax Act reduces the federal corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, eliminates federal bonus depreciation for utilities, and limits interest deductibility for non-utility business activities and the deductibility of certain officer compensation. During 2018, the IRS issued additional guidance related to certain officer compensation and proposed regulations on interest deductibility that provide a 10% \u201cde minimis\u201d exception that allows entities with predominantly regulated activities to fully deduct interest expenses. In addition, the IRS issued proposed regulations interpreting Tax Act amendments to depreciation provisions of the IRC that allow the Company to claim a bonus depreciation deduction on certain construction projects placed in service subsequent to the third quarter of 2017.\nThe Company believes that the impacts of the Tax Act will not significantly impact the future earnings of regulated activities due to the ratemaking process. However, cash flows will be reduced in the near term due to less cash being received from customer billings as the benefits of the reduced corporate income tax are passed on to ratepayers, but without a corresponding reduction in income taxes paid due to the Company having a net operating loss carryforward for income taxes purposes. In addition, the income tax benefit of net losses for the unregulated activities of PNMR will be negatively impacted by the reduced rate.\nIt is possible that the Biden administration will make changes to some, or all, provisions of the Tax Act. In addition, further changes to U.S. Treasury regulations, IRS interpretations of the current provisions of the Tax Act, and actions by the NMPRC, PUCT, and FERC could cause the Company\u2019s expectations of the impacts of the Tax Act to change. Any such changes could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nGovernance Factors\nProvisions of PNMR\u2019s organizational documents, as well as several other statutory and regulatory factors, will limit another party\u2019s ability to acquire PNMR and could deprive PNMR\u2019s shareholders of the opportunity to receive a takeover premium for shares of PNMR\u2019s common stock.\nPNMR\u2019s restated articles of incorporation and by-laws include a number of provisions that may have the effect of discouraging persons from acquiring large blocks of PNMR\u2019s common stock or delaying or preventing a change in control of PNMR. The material provisions that may have such an effect include:\n\u2022Authorization for the Board to issue PNMR\u2019s preferred stock in series and to fix rights and preferences of the series (including, among other things, voting rights and preferences with respect to dividends and other matters)\n\u2022Advance notice procedures with respect to any proposal other than those adopted or recommended by the Board\n\u2022Provisions specifying that only a majority of the Board, the chairman of the Board, the chief executive officer, or holders of at least one-tenth of all of PNMR\u2019s shares entitled to vote may call a special meeting of shareholders\nUnder the New Mexico Public Utility Act, NMPRC approval is required for certain transactions that may result in PNMR\u2019s change in control or exercise of control, including ownership of 10% or more of PNMR\u2019s voting stock. PUCT approval is required for changes to the ownership of TNMP or its parent and certain other transactions relating to TNMP. Certain acquisitions of PNMR\u2019s outstanding voting securities also require FERC approval.", "PERMNO": 55511, "SIC": 4911, "TIC": "PNM"}
