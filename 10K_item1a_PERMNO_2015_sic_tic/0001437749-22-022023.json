{"cik": "100378", "company": "TWIN DISC INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-09-08", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe Company\u2019s business involves various risk factors. The following information about these risks should be considered carefully together with other information contained in this report. The risks described below are not the only risks the Company faces. Additional risks not currently known, deemed immaterial or that could apply to any issuer may also result in adverse results for the Company\u2019s business.\nAs a global company, the Company is subject to currency fluctuations and a significant movement between the U.S. dollar and the euro exchange rate, in particular, could have an adverse effect on its profitability. Although the Company\u2019s financial results are reported in U.S. dollars, a significant portion of its sales and operating costs are realized in euros and other foreign currencies. The Company\u2019s profitability is affected by movements of the U.S. dollar against the euro and the other currencies in which it generates revenues and incurs expenses. Significant long-term fluctuations in relative currency values, in particular a significant change in the exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the euro, could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s profitability and financial condition.\nThe Company continues to be adversely affected by the economic disruptions caused by the global coronavirus pandemic. In March 2020, the World Health Organization (\u201cWHO\u201d) declared that a new strain of coronavirus that originated in Wuhan, China, and has rapidly spread around the world (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) is a pandemic that poses significant risk to the international community. This outbreak contributed to shelter-in-place policies, unexpected factory closures, supply chain disruptions, and market volatility causing substantial declines in market capitalization, and occurring in the midst of an already challenging economic environment in some of our markets, most notably the oil and gas market. As a result of the outbreak, starting in March 2020 and intermittently through June 30, 2022, the Company suspended or reduced its operations, in whole or in part, in several of its locations. The Company\u2019s businesses operate in market segments impacted by COVID-19. Operating during a global pandemic has exposed the Company to a number of material risks, including diminished demand for our products and our customers\u2019 products, suspensions in the operations of our and our suppliers\u2019 manufacturing facilities, maintenance of appropriate labor levels, our ability to ship products to our customers, interruptions in our supply chains and distribution systems, access to capital and potential increases to the cost of capital, collection of trade receivables in accordance with their terms and potential further impairment of long-lived assets; all of which, in the aggregate, have had an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The severity and duration of the pandemic remains unknown. Management continues to actively monitor the global situation and its effect on financial condition, liquidity, operations, suppliers, industry and workforce. The Company remains unable to estimate the full extent or nature of the impact of COVID-19, at this time.\nCertain of the Company\u2019s products are directly or indirectly used in oil exploration and oil drilling and are thus dependent upon the strength of those markets and oil prices. In recent years, the Company has seen significant variations in the sales of its products that are used in oil and energy related markets. The variability in these markets has been defined by the change in oil prices and the global demand for oil. Significant decreases in oil prices and reduced demand for oil and capital investment in the oil and energy markets adversely affect the sales of these products and the Company\u2019s profitability. The cyclical nature of the global oil and gas market presents the ongoing possibility of a severe cutback in demand, which would create a significant adverse effect on the sales of these products and ultimately on the Company\u2019s profitability.\nMany of the Company\u2019s product markets are cyclical in nature or are otherwise sensitive to volatile or unpredictable factors. A downturn or weakness in overall economic activity or fluctuations in those other factors could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s overall financial performance. Historically, sales of many of the products that the Company manufactures and sells have been subject to cyclical variations caused by changes in general economic conditions and other factors. In particular, the Company sells its products to customers primarily in the pleasure craft, commercial and military marine markets, as well as in the energy and natural resources, government and industrial markets. The demand for the products may be impacted by the strength of the economy generally, governmental spending and appropriations, including security and defense outlays, fuel prices, interest rates, as well as many other factors. Adverse economic and other conditions may cause the Company's customers to forego or otherwise postpone purchases in favor of repairing existing equipment.\nIn the event of an increase in the global demand for steel, the Company could be adversely affected if it experiences shortages of raw castings and forgings used in the manufacturing of its products. With the continued development of certain developing economies, in particular China and India, the global demand for steel has risen significantly in recent years. The Company selects its suppliers based on a number of criteria, and the Company expects that they will be able to support its needs. However, there can be no assurance that a significant increase in demand, capacity constraints or other issues experienced by the Company\u2019s suppliers will not result in shortages or delays in their supply of raw materials to the Company. If the Company were to experience a significant or prolonged shortage of critical components from any of its suppliers, particularly those who are sole sources, and could not procure the components from other sources, the Company would be unable to meet its production schedules for some of its key products and would miss product delivery dates which would adversely affect its sales, profitability and relationships with its customers.\nThe Company continues to face the prospect of increasing commodity costs, including steel, other raw materials and energy that could have an adverse effect on future profitability. In addition, developments in tariff regulations in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions have resulted in uncertainty regarding international trade policies and future commodity prices, contributing to an increased risk of higher commodity costs that could have an adverse impact on the Company\u2019s profitability, financial condition and results of operations. The Company\u2019s profitability is dependent, in part, on commodity costs. To date, the Company has been successful with offsetting the effects of increased commodity costs through cost reduction programs and pricing actions. However, if material prices were to continue to increase at a rate that could not be recouped through product pricing or cost reductions, it could potentially have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s future profitability.\nThe Company anticipates that additional tariffs or trade restrictions resulting from \u201ctrade wars\u201d could result in an increase in its cost of sales and there can be no assurance that the Company would be able to pass any of the increases in raw material costs directly resulting from additional tariffs to its customers. Given that it procures many of the raw materials that it uses to create its products directly or indirectly from outside of the United States, the imposition of tariffs and other potential changes in U.S. trade policy could increase the cost or limit the availability of such raw materials, which could hurt its competitive position and adversely impact its business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the Company sells a significant proportion of its products to customers outside of the United States. Retaliatory actions by other countries could result in increases in the price of its products, which could limit demand for such products, hurt its global competitive position and have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf the Company were to lose business with any key customers, the Company\u2019s business would be adversely affected. Although there was only one customer that accounted for 10% or more of consolidated net sales in fiscal 2022, deterioration of a business relationship with one or more of the Company\u2019s significant customers would cause its sales and profitability to be adversely affected. Although the Company\u2019s accounts receivable are dispersed among a large customer base, a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of its largest customers could have a material adverse impact on the collectability of its accounts receivable and future operating results.\nThe termination of relationships with the Company\u2019s suppliers, or the inability of such suppliers to perform, could disrupt its business and have an adverse effect on its ability to manufacture and deliver products. The Company relies on raw materials, component parts, and services supplied by outside third parties. If a supplier of significant raw materials, component parts or services were to terminate its relationship with the Company, or otherwise cease supplying raw materials, component parts, or services consistent with past practice, the Company\u2019s ability to meet its obligations to its customers may be affected. Such a disruption with respect to numerous products, or with respect to a few significant products, could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s profitability and financial condition.\nA significant design, manufacturing or supplier quality issue could result in recalls or other actions by the Company that could adversely affect profitability. As a manufacturer of highly engineered products, the performance, reliability and productivity of the Company\u2019s products are some of its competitive advantages. While the Company prides itself on implementing procedures to ensure the quality and performance of its products and suppliers, a significant quality or product issue, whether due to design, performance, manufacturing or supplier quality issue, could lead to warranty actions, scrapping of raw materials, finished goods or returned products, the deterioration in a customer relationship, or other action that could adversely affect warranty and quality costs, future sales and profitability.\nThe Company faces risks associated with its international sales and operations that could adversely affect its business, results of operations or financial condition. Sales to customers outside the United States approximated 67% of the Company\u2019s consolidated net sales for fiscal 2022. The Company has international manufacturing operations in Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands and Switzerland. In addition, the Company has international distribution operations in Singapore, China, Australia, Japan, Italy, Belgium, and India. The Company\u2019s international sales and operations are subject to a number of risks, including:\n\u21d2 currency exchange rate fluctuations\n\u21d2 export and import duties, changes to import and export regulations, and restrictions on the transfer of funds, including dividends\n\u21d2 problems with the transportation or delivery of its products\n\u21d2 issues arising from cultural or language differences\n\u21d2 potential social and labor unrest as well as public health and political crises\n\u21d2 longer payment cycles and greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivables\n\u21d2 compliance with trade and other laws in a variety of jurisdictions\n\u21d2 changes in tax law\n\u21d2 compliance with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act\nThese factors could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business, results of operations or financial condition.\nA material disruption at the Company\u2019s manufacturing facility in Racine, Wisconsin could adversely affect its ability to generate sales and meet customer demand. The majority of the Company\u2019s manufacturing, based on fiscal 2022 sales, came from its facility in Racine, Wisconsin. If operations at this facility were to be disrupted as a result of significant equipment failures, natural disasters, power outages, fires, explosions, adverse weather conditions, labor force disruptions or other reasons, the Company\u2019s business and results of operations could be adversely affected. Interruptions in production would increase costs and reduce sales. Any interruption in production capability could require the Company to make substantial capital expenditures to remedy the situation, which could negatively affect its profitability and financial condition. The Company maintains property damage insurance which it believes is adequate to reconstruct its facilities and equipment, as well as business interruption insurance to mitigate losses resulting from any production interruption or shutdown caused by an insured loss. However, any recovery under this insurance policy may not offset the lost sales or increased costs that may be experienced during the disruption of operations. Lost sales may not be recoverable under the policy and long-term business disruptions could result in a loss of customers. If this were to occur, future sales levels and costs of doing business, and therefore profitability, could be adversely affected.\nThe ability to service the requirements of debt depends on the ability to generate cash and/or refinance its indebtedness as it becomes due, and depends on many factors, some of which are beyond the Company\u2019s control. The Company entered into a credit agreement on June 29, 2018. The Company\u2019s ability to make payments on its indebtedness, including those under the credit agreement, and to fund planned capital expenditures, research and development efforts and other corporate expenses depends on the Company\u2019s future operating performance and on economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors. Many of these factors are beyond its control. The Company cannot be certain that its business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations, or operating improvements will be realized or that future borrowings will be available to it in an amount sufficient to enable it to repay its indebtedness or to fund its other operating requirements. Significant delays in its planned capital expenditures may materially and adversely affect the Company\u2019s future revenue prospects.\nAny failure to meet debt obligations and financial covenants, and maintain adequate asset-based borrowing capacity could adversely affect the Company\u2019s business and financial condition. The Company\u2019s three-year revolving credit facility expiring June 2025 is secured by certain personal property assets such as accounts receivable, inventory, and machinery and equipment. Under this agreement, the Company\u2019s borrowing capacity is based on the eligible balances of these assets and it is required to maintain sufficient asset levels at all times to secure its outstanding borrowings. The Company is also required to comply with a total funded debt to EBITDA ratio, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio, and a minimum tangible net worth. If the Company does not meet these financial covenants as specified under the agreement, the Company may require forbearance or relief from its financial covenant violations from its senior lender or be required to arrange alternative financing. Failure to obtain relief from financial covenant violations or to obtain alternative financing, if necessary, would have a material adverse impact on the Company.\nAs of June 30, 2022, the Company had a borrowing capacity that exceeded its outstanding loan balance (see Note G, Debt, of the notes to the consolidated financial statements). Based on its annual financial plan, the Company believes that it will generate sufficient cash flow levels throughout fiscal 2023 to meet the required financial covenants under the agreements. However, as with all forward-looking information, there can be no assurance that the Company will achieve the planned results in future periods.\nWhile the Company has obtained forgiveness of its Paycheck Protection Program Loan (\u201cPPP loan\u201d), it remains subject to audit under the program\u2019s rules and any resulting adverse audit findings of non-compliance can result in the repayment of a portion or all of the PPP loan. On April 17, 2020 the Company received proceeds of $8.2 million from a loan under the PPP of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (\u201cCARES Act\u201d), which it has used to retain employees, maintain payroll and make lease and utility payments. The Company accounted for the full proceeds as a loan. It obtained formal forgiveness of the full amount of the loan on June 16, 2021, and accounted for the forgiveness as income from extinguishment of loan in its statement of operations for the year ended June 30, 2021.\nWhile the loan has been formally forgiven, under the terms of the PPP Loan, the Company remains subject to an audit by the Small Business Administration (\u201cSBA\u201d) for a period of six years after forgiveness. The audit is intended to confirm the Company\u2019s eligibility for the PPP loan and the appropriateness of the PPP loan forgiveness. The Company is aware of the requirements of the PPP Loan and believes it is within the eligibility threshold and has used the loan proceeds in accordance with PPP loan forgiveness requirements. It has retained all necessary documentation in support of its eligibility, including gross receipts calculations, supporting payroll expenses and related information. However, no assurance is provided that the Company will satisfy fully all the requirements of an audit. If despite the Company\u2019s actions and certification that it satisfied all eligibility requirements for the PPP loan, it is later determined that it violated applicable laws or was otherwise ineligible to receive the PPP loan, it may be required to repay the PPP loan in its entirety in a lump sum or be subject to additional penalties, which could result in adverse publicity and damage to the Company\u2019s reputation. If these events were to transpire, they could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Company carries a significant amount of intangible assets, but it may never fully realize the full value of these assets. The Company recorded significant non-cash goodwill impairment charges in fiscal 2020, as well as in prior fiscal years. As part of the acquisition of Veth Propulsion in July 2018, the Company acquired goodwill and intangible assets in the form of customer relationships, technology and knowhow and tradenames. In fiscal 2020, due to its assessment of the adverse economic consequences of the COVID-19 outbreak and the negative trends in its markets as explained in Note D, Intangible Assets, the Company recorded significant impairment charges, writing off all the goodwill in its books, as well as writing down some intangibles and other assets. In fiscal 2017 and 2016, when the Company\u2019s markets were significantly adversely affected by the global oil and gas decline, it recorded significant impairment charges related to two of its prior acquisitions. Any deterioration in the industries or businesses of the Company may trigger future non-cash impairment charges, which may have a material adverse effect to the Company\u2019s financial results.\nThe Company may experience negative or unforeseen tax consequences. The Company reviews the probability of the realization of its net deferred tax assets each period based on forecasts of taxable income in both the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. This review uses historical results, projected future operating results based upon approved business plans, eligible carryforward periods, tax planning opportunities and other relevant considerations. Adverse changes in the profitability and financial outlook in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions may require the creation of a valuation allowance to reduce the Company\u2019s net deferred tax assets. Such changes could result in material non-cash expenses in the period in which the changes are made and could have a material adverse impact on the Company\u2019s results of operations and financial condition. In fiscal 2021, the Company recorded a 100% allowance on its domestic deferred tax assets, totaling $24.4 million. In fiscal 2022, the allowance totaled $23.1 million.\nTaxing authority challenges and changes to tax laws may lead to tax payments exceeding current reserves. The Company is subject to ongoing tax examinations in various jurisdictions. As a result, the Company may record incremental tax expense based on expected outcomes of such matters. In addition, the Company may adjust previously reported tax reserves based on expected results of these examinations. Such adjustments could result in an increase or decrease to the Company\u2019s effective tax rate.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d) was signed into law in December 2017. The Tax Act made numerous changes to U.S. federal corporate tax law that the Company expects will impact its effective tax rate in future periods. The changes included in the Tax Act are broad and complex. The final impact of the Tax Act may differ from the Company\u2019s current estimates, possibly materially, due to, among other things, changes in interpretations of the Tax Act, any legislative action to address questions that arise because of the Tax Act, any changes in accounting standards for U.S. federal income taxes or related interpretations in response to the Tax Act or any updates or changes to estimates the Company utilized to calculate the impact. Future changes in tax law in the United States or the various jurisdictions in which the Company operates and income tax holidays could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s effective tax rate, foreign rate differential, future income tax expense and cash flows.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise the Company\u2019s information system and expose the Company to liabilities, which would cause its business and reputation to suffer. In the ordinary course of its business, the Company collects and stores sensitive data, including its proprietary business information and that of its customers, suppliers and business partners, as well as personally identifiable information of its customers and employees, in its internal and external data centers, cloud services and on its networks. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to the Company\u2019s operations and business strategy. Despite the Company\u2019s security measures, its information technology and infrastructure, and that of its partners, may be vulnerable to malicious attacks or breaches due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions, including as a result of rollouts of new systems. Any such breach or operational failure would compromise the Company\u2019s networks and/or that of its partners and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings and/or regulatory fines or penalties, including, among others, under the European Union\u2019s General Data Privacy Regulation, disrupt the Company\u2019s operations, damage its reputation and/or cause a loss of confidence in the Company\u2019s products and services, which could adversely affect its business, financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 59600, "SIC": 3560, "TIC": "TWIN"}
