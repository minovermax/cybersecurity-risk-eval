{"cik": "854800", "company": "MICT, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-19", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nInvesting in our securities is highly speculative and involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the following factors and other information in this Annual Report and our other SEC filings before making a decision to invest in our securities. Additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of may become important factors that affect us. If any of the following events occur, our business, financial conditions and operating results may be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our common stock and warrants may decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to MICT\u2019s Business and Industry\nIf the conditions to the Acquisition are not met, the Acquisition may not occur.\nIn addition to approval by the stockholders of MICT, specified conditions must be satisfied or waived to complete the Acquisition. These conditions, described in detail in the Merger Agreement, include, in addition to shareholder consent and among other requirements: (i) the expiration or termination of any waiting period, and extension thereof, applicable under any antitrust laws, (ii) receipt or filing of any and all required consents from all applicable government authorities or third person, (iii) no law or order preventing the transactions by any applicable governmental authority shall have been issued, enforced or in effect, (iv) no pending litigation to enjoin or restrict the closing, as defined in the Merger Agreement, by any non-affiliated third-party, (v) the definitive proxy statement shall have been filed with the SEC, (vi) each party\u2019s representations and warranties are true and correct as of the date of the Merger Agreement and as of the closing of the Merger Agreement, (vii) each party\u2019s compliance in all material respects with its covenants and agreements to be complied with or performed on or prior to the closing date of the Acquisition, (viii) no material adverse effect with respect to a party since the date of the Merger Agreement which remains continuing and uncured, (ix) the effectiveness of the ParagonEx and Beijing Brookfield Share Exchange Agreements, (x) the appointment of the post-closing board of directors of MICT, (xi) the delivery by each applicable party of each of the required closing deliveries, (x) the voting agreement and lock-up agreements being in full force and effect, and (xi) the lack of indebtedness of MICT other than $3,350,000. MICT, ParagonEx and Beijing Brookfield cannot assure you that all of the conditions will be satisfied. If the conditions are not satisfied or waived, the Acquisition may not occur, or may be delayed. Such delays may cause MICT, ParagonEx and/or Beijing Brookfield to each lose some or all of the intended benefits of the Acquisition.\nThe Acquisition may not be consummated or may not deliver the anticipated benefits MICT expects.\nMICT is devoting substantially all of its time and resources to consummating the Acquisition; however, there can be no assurance that such activities will result in the consummation of the Acquisition and the transactions contemplated thereby or that such transaction will deliver the anticipated benefits or enhance stockholder value. MICT cannot assure you that it will complete the Acquisition in a timely manner or at all. The Merger Agreement is subject to many closing conditions and termination rights. If the Acquisition does not occur, the MICT board of directors may elect to attempt to complete an alternative strategic transaction similar to the Acquisition. Attempting to complete an alternative strategic transaction will be costly and time-consuming, and MICT cannot make any assurances that a future strategic transaction will occur on terms that provide the same or greater opportunity for potential value to MICT\u2019s stockholders, or at all. If MICT is unable to close another strategic transaction, the MICT board of directors may determine to sell or otherwise dispose of MICT\u2019s shares of Micronet, and distribute any remaining cash proceeds to MICT\u2019s stockholders. In that event, MICT would be required to pay all of its debts and contractual obligations, and to set aside certain reserves for potential future claims, so MICT would not be able to provide any assurances as to the amount or timing of available cash or assets available for distribution remaining to distribute to stockholders after paying its obligations and setting aside funds for reserves.\nIf MICT does not successfully consummate the Acquisition, or any other alternative transaction, if any, the MICT board of directors may decide to pursue a dissolution and liquidation of MICT. In such an event, the amount of cash available for distribution to MICT\u2019s stockholders will depend heavily on the timing of such liquidation as well as the amount of cash that will need to be reserved for commitments and contingent liabilities.\nThere can be no assurance that MICT can successfully consummate the Acquisition, or any other alternative transaction. If the Acquisition, or other alternative transaction, is not completed, the MICT board of directors may decide to pursue a dissolution and liquidation of MICT. In such an event, the amount of cash available for distribution to MICT\u2019s stockholders will depend heavily on the timing of such decision and, ultimately, such liquidation, because the amount of cash available for distribution continues to decrease as MICT funds its operations. If the MICT board of directors were to approve and recommend, and MICT\u2019s stockholders were to approve, a dissolution and liquidation of MICT, MICT would be required under Delaware corporate law to pay MICT\u2019s outstanding obligations, as well as to make reasonable provision for contingent and unknown obligations, prior to making any distributions in liquidation to MICT\u2019s stockholders. As a result of this requirement, a portion of MICT\u2019s assets may need to be reserved pending the resolution of such obligations. In addition, MICT may be subject to litigation or other claims related to a dissolution and liquidation of MICT. If a dissolution and liquidation were pursued, the MICT board of directors, in consultation with its advisors, would need to evaluate these matters and make a determination about a reasonable amount to reserve. Accordingly, holders of MICT common stock could lose all or a significant portion of their investment in the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up of MICT.\nMICT is substantially dependent on its remaining employees to facilitate the consummation of the Acquisition.\nMICT\u2019s ability to successfully complete the Acquisition, or if the Acquisition is not completed, another potential strategic transaction, depends in large part on its ability to retain certain of its remaining personnel, particularly David Lucatz, MICT\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Micronet\u2019s President. Despite MICT\u2019s efforts to retain Mr. Lucatz and other key employees, one or more may terminate their employment on short notice. The loss of the services of any of these employees, and more specifically, Mr. Lucatz, could potentially harm MICT\u2019s ability to complete the Acquisition, evaluate and pursue strategic alternatives, as well as fulfill its reporting obligations as a public company.\nMICT is dependent on the services of its executive officers, whose potential conflicts of interest may not permit MICT to effectively execute its business strategy.\nMICT is currently dependent on the continued services and performance of its executive officers, particularly David Lucatz, MICT\u2019s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer and Micronet\u2019s Chief Executive Officer and President. Mr. Lucatz also serves as the President, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of DLC, the primary asset of which is its ownership of shares of MICT common stock. In addition, certain members of MICT\u2019s board of directors, particularly, Darren Mercer, the Chief Executive Officer of BNN, could have a potential conflict in carrying out his duties as a member of our board of directors.\nIf Micronet is unable to develop new products and maintain a qualified workforce it may not be able to meet the needs of customers in the future.\nVirtually all of the products produced and sold by Micronet are highly engineered and require employees with sophisticated manufacturing and system-integration techniques and capabilities. The markets and industry in which Micronet operates are characterized by rapidly changing technologies. The products, systems, solutions and needs of Micronet customers change and evolve regularly. Accordingly, the future performance of Micronet depends on its ability to develop and manufacture competitive products and solutions, and bring those products to market quickly at cost-effective prices. In addition, because of the highly specialized nature of Micronet\u2019s business, the hiring and retention of skilled and qualified personnel is necessary to perform the services required by customers. If Micronet is unable to develop new products that meet customers\u2019 changing needs or successfully attract and retain qualified personnel, its future revenues and earnings may be adversely affected, and therefore the value of MICT\u2019s equity interest in Micronet may be adversely affected.\nDeveloping new technologies entails significant risks and uncertainties that may cause Micronet to incur significant costs and could have a material adverse effect on its operating results, financial condition, and/or cash flows, and as a result thereof, adversely affect the value of our equity interest in Micronet.\nA significant portion of Micronet\u2019s business relates to developing sophisticated products and applications. New technologies may be untested or unproven. In addition, Micronet may incur significant liabilities that are unique to its products and services. While Micronet maintains insurance for some business risks, there is no guarantee that the insurance policies currently in place, or as may be added from time to time, will be sufficient to cover all risks or liabilities that may be incurred. Accordingly, Micronet may be forced to bear substantial costs resulting from risks and uncertainties of its products and products under development, which could have a material adverse effect on its operating results, financial condition and/or cash flows, and therefore the value of MICT\u2019s equity interest in Micronet may be adversely affected.\nIf Micronet is unable to effectively protect proprietary technology, its business and competitive position may be harmed, which would have an adverse effect on MICT\u2019s business and financial position.\nMicronet\u2019s success and ability to compete is dependent on its proprietary technology. The steps Micronet has taken to protect its proprietary rights may not be adequate and Micronet may not be able to prevent others from using its proprietary technology. The methodologies and proprietary technology that constitute the basis of Micronet\u2019s solutions and products are not protected by patents. Existing trade secret, copyright and trademark laws and non-disclosure agreements to which Micronet is a party offer only limited protection. Therefore, others, including Micronet\u2019s competitors, may develop and market similar solutions and products, copy or reverse engineer elements of Micronet\u2019s production lines, or engage in the unauthorized use of Micronet\u2019s intellectual property. Any misappropriation of Micronet\u2019s proprietary technology or the development of competitive technology may have a significant adverse effect on Micronet\u2019s ability to compete and may harm the value of our equity interest in Micronet.\nSubstantial costs as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to intellectual property rights may be incurred, which would have an adverse effect on the value of our equity interest in Micronet.\nThird parties may challenge the validity of Micronet\u2019s intellectual property rights or bring claims regarding Micronet\u2019s infringement of a third party\u2019s intellectual property rights. This may result in costly litigation or other time-consuming and expensive judicial or administrative proceedings, which could deprive Micronet of valuable rights, cause them to incur substantial expenses and cause a diversion for technical and management personnel. An adverse determination may subject Micronet to significant liabilities or require it to seek licenses that may not be available from third parties on commercially favorable terms, if at all. Further, if such claims are proven valid, through litigation or otherwise, Micronet may be required to pay substantial financial damages or be required to discontinue or significantly delay the development, marketing, sale or licensing of the affected products and intellectual property rights. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have an adverse effect on the value of our equity interest in Micronet.\nMicronet\u2019s earnings and margins may be negatively impacted if Micronet is unable to perform under its contracts.\nWhen agreeing to contractual terms, Micronet\u2019s management makes assumptions and projections about future conditions or events. These projections assess, among other factors:\n\u25cf the productivity and availability of labor;\n\u25cf the complexity of the work to be performed;\n\u25cf the cost and availability of materials;\n\u25cf the impact of delayed performance; and\n\u25cf the timing of product deliveries.\nIf there is a significant change in one or more of these circumstances or estimates, or if faced with unexpected contract costs, the profitability of one or more of these contracts may be adversely affected and could affect, among other things, Micronet\u2019s earnings and margins, and in turn the value of our equity interest in Micronet, due to the fact that Micronet\u2019s contracts are often made on a fixed-price basis. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have an adverse effect on the value of our equity interest in Micronet.\nMicronet\u2019s earnings and margins could be negatively affected by deficient subcontractor performance or the unavailability of raw materials or components.\nMicronet relies on other companies to provide raw materials, major components and subsystems for its products. Subcontractors perform some of the services that Micronet provides to its customers. Micronet depends on these subcontractors and vendors to meet contractual obligations in full compliance with customer requirements. Occasionally, Micronet relies on only one or two sources of supply that, if disrupted, could have an adverse effect on Micronet\u2019s ability to meet commitments to customers. Micronet\u2019s ability to perform its obligations as a prime contractor may be adversely affected if one or more of these suppliers is unable to provide the agreed-upon supplies or perform the agreed-upon services in a timely and cost-effective manner. Further, deficiencies in the performance of subcontractors and vendors could result in a customer terminating a contract for default. A termination for default could expose Micronet to liability and adversely affect financial performance and Micronet\u2019s ability to win new contract, and in turn, adversely affect the value of our equity interest in Micronet.\nMicronet is dependent on major customers for a significant portion of revenues, and therefore, future revenues and earnings could be negatively impacted by the loss or reduction of the demand for Micronet\u2019s products or services by such customers.\nA significant portion of Micronet\u2019s MRM annual revenues is derived from a few leading customers. As of December 31, 2019, Micronet\u2019s had three largest customers combined accounted for approximately 74.48% of its revenues.\nMost of Micronet\u2019s major customers do not have any obligation to purchase additional products or services from it. Therefore, there can be no assurance that any of Micronet\u2019s leading customers will continue to purchase solutions, products or services at levels comparable to previous years. A substantial loss or reduction in Micronet\u2019s existing programs could adversely affect its future revenues and earnings and in turn the value of our equity interest in Micronet.\nMicronet operates in a highly competitive and fragmented market and may not be able to maintain a competitive position in the future. Any such failure to successfully compete could have a material adverse effect on the value of our equity interest in Micronet.\nA number of larger competitors have recently entered the MRM market in which Micronet operates. These large companies have far greater development and capital resources than Micronet. Further, there are competitors of Micronet that offer solutions, products and services similar to those offered by Micronet. If they continue, these trends could undermine Micronet\u2019s competitive strength and position and adversely affect its earnings and financial condition, which could have a material adverse effect on the value of our equity interest in Micronet.\nMicronet may cease to be eligible for, or receive reduced, tax benefits under Israeli law, which could negatively impact profits in the future.\nMicronet currently receives certain tax benefits under the Israeli Law Encouragement of Capital Investments of 1959, as a result of the designation of its production facility as an \u201cApproved Enterprise.\u201d To maintain its eligibility for these tax benefits, Micronet must continue to meet several conditions including, among others, generating more than 25% of its gross revenues outside the State of Israel and continuing to qualify as an \u201cIndustrial Company\u201d under Israeli tax law. An Industrial Company, according to the applicable Israeli law (Law for the Encouragement of Industry (Taxes), 1969), is a company that resides in Israel (either incorporated in Israel or managed and controlled from Israel) that, during the relevant tax year, derives at least 90% of its income from an Industrial Factory. An Industrial Factory means a factory that is owned by an Industrial Company and where its manufacturing operations constitute a vast majority of the factory\u2019s total operations/business. The tax benefits of qualifying as an Industrial Company include a reduction of the corporate tax from 24% for \u201cRegular Entities\u201d and 16% or 7.5% for \u201cPreferred Enterprises\u201d (depending on the location of industry) in 2019. In addition, in recent years the Israeli government has reduced the benefits available under this program and has indicated that it may further reduce or eliminate benefits in the future. There is no assurance that Micronet will continue to qualify for these tax benefits or that such tax benefits will continue to be available. The termination or reduction of these tax benefits would increase the amount of tax payable by Micronet and, accordingly, reduce its net profit after tax and negatively impact profits, if any, which may adversely affect the value of our equity interest in Micronet.\nBecause almost all of MICT\u2019s officers and directors are located in non-U.S. jurisdictions, you may have no effective recourse against management for misconduct.\nCurrently, a majority of MICT\u2019s directors and officers are or will be nationals and/or residents of countries other than the United States, and all or a substantial portion of their assets are located outside the United States. As a result, it may be difficult for investors to enforce within the United States any judgments obtained against such officers or directors, including judgments predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the United States or any U.S. state. Additionally, it may be difficult to enforce civil liabilities under U.S. securities law in original actions instituted in Israel. Israeli courts may refuse to hear a claim based on a violation of U.S. securities laws because Israel is not the most appropriate forum to bring such a claim. In addition, even if an Israeli court agrees to hear a claim, it may determine that Israeli law and not U.S. law is applicable to hear the claim. If U.S. law is found to be applicable, the content of applicable U.S. law must be proved as a fact, which can be a time-consuming and costly process. Certain matters of procedure will also be governed by Israeli law.\nCost fluctuations in the global hardware and communications market and reducing production costs may have a negative impact on Micronet\u2019s business and operations, and as a result thereof.\nMicronet\u2019s operations are affected by global hardware prices and communication costs, which are a combined component of the technological solution offered by Micronet to its customers or end users. Also, in order to continue to compete effectively in the target markets, Micronet must continue to streamline its production costs and reduce them in order to enable a competitive price for its products. Micronet must compete among other manufacturers of components and / or products from East Asia including China and India. Micronet\u2019s ability to streamline the production process depends, among other things, on its ability to integrate production processes in these areas, as well as to continue to locate target markets and target customers who are interested in purchasing high-end products that are less sensitive to cost. The occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a negative impact on Micronet\u2019s business and operations, and as a result thereof, adversely affect the value of our equity interest in Micronet.\nEconomic changes in Micronet\u2019s target markets may adversely impact its business, and as a result thereof, adversely affect the value of our equity interest in Micronet.\nDue to the fact that Micronet\u2019s target markets are mainly located in North America and Europe, the lack of economic stability in such markets, such as slowdown or changes to the demands for products or services offered by Micronet, may adversely affect its operations and results, and as a result thereof, adversely affect the value of our equity interest in Micronet.\nMicronet\u2019s financial results may be negatively affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations.\nMicronet\u2019s revenues are mainly denominated in U.S. Dollars and costs are mainly denominated in New Israeli Shekels (NIS). Where possible, MICT matches sales and purchases in these and other currencies to achieve a natural hedge. Currently, Micronet does not have a policy with respect to the use of derivative instruments for hedging purposes, except that Micronet will consider engaging in such hedging activities on a case by case basis. To the extent MICT is unable to fully match sales and purchases in different currencies, its business will be exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates.\nCybersecurity disruptions may impact MICT\u2019s business operations or our efforts to complete the Merger if it becomes a target for such activities.\nMICT and/or Micronet may be subject to attempted cybersecurity disruptions from a variety of threat actors. If systems for protecting against cybersecurity disruptions prove to be insufficient, MICT and Micronet, and their customers, employees or third parties could be adversely affected. Such cybersecurity disruptions could cause physical harm to people or the environment; damage or destroy assets; compromise business systems; result in proprietary information being altered, lost or stolen; result in employee, customer or third party information being compromised; or otherwise disrupt business operations. Significant costs to remedy the effects of such a cybersecurity disruption may be incurred by MICT and Micronet, as well as in connection with resulting regulatory actions and litigation, and such disruption may harm relationships with customers and impact MICT\u2019s and Micronet\u2019s business reputation.\nMicronet is subject to regulations in the United States and Europe, which if failed to be met, could negatively impact Micronet\u2019s and our business and reputation.\nMicronet\u2019s business is subject to certain international standards such as U.S. Federal Communications Commission, or FCC, Part 15B, FCC ID, CE and Restriction of Hazardous Substances, or RoHS, which define compatibility of interface and telecommunications standards to those implemented in the United States by the FCC and in Europe by the European Commission, respectively. Micronet\u2019s solutions and products also need to comply with the E-Mark European standard, which is the standard that defines the compatibility of interface and telecommunications to all appliances installed in and around an automobile. Micronet is exposed to risks from regulators, arising from Micronet\u2019s failure to comply with the aforementioned international standards, which define interface and communication standards, compliance with the standards of the European Common Market, European Conformity, or the CE, and the requirements of the U.S. Communications Regulatory Commission, the FCC, inclusive of the ELD mandate. If Micronet does not adhere to these international standards, Micronet may be limited in marketing its products in such markets, and face fines and/or risks to both our and Micronet\u2019s reputation, and which may also adversely affect our and Micronet\u2019s future revenues and earnings and the value of our of our equity interest in Micronet.\nRisks Related to Ownership of MICT Securities\nYour ability to influence corporate decisions may be limited because ownership of MICT common stock is concentrated.\nAs of the date, Mr. Lucatz, the MICT Chairman, Chief Executive Officer and President, beneficially owned 1,234,200 shares, or approximately 6.4% of MICT\u2019s outstanding common stock. As a result, Mr. Lucatz, may exercise significant control over matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions. Such concentration of ownership could also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of MICT, which could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of its common stock.\nProvisions in MICT\u2019s certificate of incorporation and of Delaware corporate law could make an acquisition of MICT, which may be beneficial to its stockholders, more difficult and may also prevent attempts by MICT stockholders to replace or remove current or future members of MICT\u2019s management team.\nProvisions in MICT\u2019s certificate of incorporation, as amended, and MICT\u2019s amended and restated bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for MICT common stock. These provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for MICT securities, thereby depressing the market price of MICT\u2019s securities. In addition, these provisions may frustrate, deter or prevent any attempts by MICT stockholders to replace or remove current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of the MICT board of directors. Because the board of directors is responsible for appointing the members of the MICT management team, these provisions could in turn affect any attempt by stockholders to replace current members of the MICT management team.\nMoreover, because MICT is incorporated in Delaware, it is governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, or the DGCL, which prohibits a person who owns in excess of 15% of outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with MICT for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15% of outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner. MICT has not opted out of the restrictions under Section 203.\nMICT stockholders may experience significant dilution as a result of any additional financing that results in the issuance of MICT equity securities and/or debt securities.\nTo the extent that additional funds are raised by issuing equity securities, including through convertible debt securities, MICT stockholders may experience significant dilution. Sales of additional equity and/or convertible debt securities at prices below certain levels will trigger anti-dilution provisions with respect to certain securities which have been previously issued. If additional funds are raised through a credit facility, or the issuance of debt securities or preferred stock, lenders or holders of these debt securities or preferred stock would likely have rights that are senior to the rights of holders of common stock, and any credit facility or additional securities could contain covenants that would restrict operations.\nThe price of MICT\u2019s common stock on Nasdaq has been in the past, and may in the future continue to be volatile, and may continue to be volatile even if we complete the Acquisition. Volatility in the trading price of MICT\u2019s common stock could cause purchasers of MICT\u2019s common stock to incur substantial losses.\nThe price of MICT\u2019s common stock has been and may continue to be volatile. The market price of MICT\u2019s common stock may be influenced by many factors, including but not limited to the following:\n\u25cf developments regarding the Acquisition and the transactions contemplated thereby;\n\u25cf announcements of developments related to MICT\u2019s business;\n\u25cf quarterly fluctuations in actual or anticipated operating results;\n\u25cf announcements of technological innovations;\n\u25cf new products or product enhancements introduced by Micronet or its competitors;\n\u25cf developments in patents and other intellectual property rights and litigation;\n\u25cf developments in relationships with third party manufacturers and/or strategic partners;\n\u25cf developments in relationships with customers and/or suppliers;\n\u25cf regulatory or legal developments in the United States, Israel and other countries;\n\u25cf general conditions in the global economy; and\n\u25cf the other factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nFor these reasons and others, you should consider an investment in MICT common stock as risky and invest only if you can withstand a significant loss and wide fluctuations in the value of such investment.\nA sale by MICT of a substantial number of shares of the common stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for the common stock may cause the price of the common stock to decline and may impair the ability to raise capital in the future.\nMICT\u2019s common stock is traded on Nasdaq and despite certain increases of trading volume from time to time, there have been periods when it could be considered \u201cthinly-traded,\u201d meaning that the number of persons interested in purchasing MICT common stock at or near bid prices at any given time may have been relatively small or non-existent. Financing transactions resulting in a large amount of newly-issued securities, or other events that cause current stockholders to sell shares, could place downward pressure on the trading price of MICT common stock. In addition, the lack of a robust resale market may require a stockholder who desires to sell a large number of shares of common stock to sell those shares in increments over time to mitigate any adverse impact of the sales on the market price of MICT stock. If MICT stockholders sell, or the market perceives that its stockholders intend to sell for various reasons, including the ending of restriction on resale, substantial amounts of common stock in the public market, including shares issued upon the exercise of outstanding options or warrants, the market price of MICT common stock could fall. Sales of a substantial number of shares of MICT common stock may make it more difficult for MICT to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and price that MICT deems reasonable or appropriate. Moreover, MICT may become involved in securities class action litigation arising out of volatility resulting from such sales that could divert management\u2019s attention and harm MICT\u2019s business.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports or publish unfavorable research about MICT\u2019s business, the price of its common stock could decline.\nMICT does not currently have any significant research coverage by securities and industry analysts and may never obtain such research coverage. If securities or industry analysts do not commence or maintain coverage of MICT, the trading price for its common stock might be negatively affected. In the event such securities or industry analyst coverage is obtained, if one or more of the analysts who covers MICT or will cover MICT downgrades its securities, the price of MICT common stock would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases to cover MICT or fails to publish regular reports on it, interest in the purchase of MICT common stock could decrease, which could cause the price of MICT common stock and trading volume to decline.\nIf MICT continues to fail to meet all applicable Nasdaq requirements, Nasdaq may delist its common stock, which could have an adverse impact on its liquidity and market price.\nMICT\u2019s common stock is currently listed on Nasdaq, which has qualitative and quantitative listing criteria. If MICT continues to be unable to comply with Nasdaq listing requirements, including, for example, if the closing bid price for MICT common stock continues to fall below $1.00 per share, in breach of Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2), Nasdaq could determine to delist the MICT common stock which could adversely affect its market liquidity market price. In that regard, on September 1, 2017, and again on July 22, 2019, MICT received written notice from Nasdaq indicating that it was not in compliance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2), as the closing bid price of its common stock had been below $1.00 per share for each of the consecutive 30 business days preceding both September 1, 2017 and July 22, 2019. On both occasions, MICT was able to regain compliance by maintaining a minimum closing bid price of at least $1.00 for a minimum of 10 consecutive trading days; however there can be no assurance that MICT will be able to maintain compliance with the Nasdaq listing requirements, or that the common stock will not be delisted from Nasdaq in the future. Such delisting could adversely affect the ability to obtain financing for the continuation of MICT\u2019s operations or prevent us from completing the Acquisition or any other alternative transaction, and could result in the loss of confidence by investors, customers and employees and cause our shareholders to incur substantial losses.\nIf Nasdaq delists MICT\u2019s securities from trading on its exchange and MICT is not able to list its securities on another national securities exchange, MICT expects its securities could be quoted on an over-the-counter market. If this were to occur, MICT could face significant material adverse consequences, including:\n\u25cf a limited availability of market quotations for its securities;\n\u25cf reduced liquidity for its securities;\n\u25cf a determination that the MICT\u2019s common stock is a \u201cpenny stock\u201d which will require brokers trading in the MICT\u2019s common stock to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for MICT\u2019s securities;\n\u25cf a limited amount of news and analyst coverage; and\n\u25cf a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nWe did not declare or pay cash dividends in either 2018 or 2019 and do not expect to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe have no dividends policy and will consider distributing dividends on a year by year basis. The payment of dividends, if any, in the future, rests within the discretion of our board of directors and will depend, among other things, upon our earnings, our capital requirements and our financial condition, as well as other relevant factors. There are no restrictions in our certificate of incorporation, as amended, or amended and restated bylaws that restrict us from declaring dividends. There are no assurances that we will pay dividends in the future.\nRisks Related to Israeli Law and Our Operations in Israel\nPotential political, economic and military instability in Israel could adversely affect our operations.\nOur principal offices and one of Micronet\u2019s operating facilities are located in Israel. Accordingly, political, economic and military conditions in Israel directly affect our and Micronet\u2019s operations. Since the establishment of the State of Israel in 1948, a number of armed conflicts have taken place between Israel and its Arab neighbors. A state of hostility, varying in degree and intensity, has led to security and economic problems for Israel. Since October 2000, there has been an increase in hostilities between Israel and the Palestinian Arabs, which has adversely affected the peace process and has negatively influenced Israel\u2019s relationship with its Arab citizens and several Arab countries, including the Israel-Gaza conflict. Such ongoing hostilities may hinder Israel\u2019s international trade relations and may limit the geographic markets where Micronet can sell its products and solutions. Hostilities involving or threatening Israel, or the interruption or curtailment of trade between Israel and its present trading partners, could materially and adversely affect Micronet\u2019s or our operations.\nIn addition, Israel-based companies and companies doing business with Israel have been the subject of an economic boycott by members of the Arab League and certain other predominantly Muslim countries since Israel\u2019s establishment. Although Israel has entered into various agreements with certain Arab countries and the Palestinian Authority, and various declarations have been signed in connection with efforts to resolve some of the economic and political problems in the Middle East, we cannot predict whether or in what manner these problems will be resolved. Wars and acts of terrorism have resulted in significant damage to the Israeli economy, including reducing the level of foreign and local investment.\nFurthermore, certain of our officers and employees may be obligated to perform annual reserve duty in the Israel Defense Forces and are subject to being called up for active military duty at any time. All Israeli male citizens who have served in the army are subject to an obligation to perform reserve duty until they are between 40 and 49 years old, depending upon the nature of their military service.\nUnder current Israeli law, the Company and Micronet may not be able to enforce our respective Israeli employees\u2019 covenants not to compete and therefore may be unable to prevent our competitors from benefiting from the expertise of some of our respective former employees.\nPreviously, the Company and Micronet entered, and the Company and Micronet may plan in the future to enter into, non-competition agreements with our key employees, in most cases within the framework of their employment agreements. These agreements prohibit our key employees, if they cease working for us, from competing directly with us or working for our competitors for a limited period. Under applicable Israeli law, the Company and Micronet may be unable to enforce these agreements or any part thereof against our Israeli employees. If the Company and Micronet cannot enforce its non- competition agreements against their respective Israeli employees, then the Company and Micronet may be unable to prevent their competitors from benefiting from the expertise of these former employees, which could impair the Company\u2019s business, results of operations and ability to capitalize on Micronet\u2019s proprietary information.\nMicronet may become subject to claims for remuneration or royalties for assigned service invention rights by our employees, which could result in litigation and harm our business.\nA significant portion of the intellectual property covered by Micronet\u2019s products has been developed by Micronet\u2019s employees in the course of their employment for Micronet. Under the Israeli Patent Law, 5727-1967, or the Patent Law, and recent decisions by the Israeli Supreme Court and the Israeli Compensation and Royalties Committee, a body constituted under the Patent Law, Israeli employees may be entitled to remuneration for intellectual property that they develop for us unless they explicitly waive any such rights. To the extent that Micronet is unable to enter into agreements with its future employees pursuant to which they agree that any inventions created in the scope of their employment or engagement are owned exclusively by Micronet (as it has done in the past), Micronet may face claims demanding remuneration. As a consequence of such claims, Micronet could be required to pay additional remuneration or royalties to its current and former employees, or be forced to litigate such claims, which could negatively affect its own and our business.\nThe Israeli identity of certain of Micronet\u2019s products may adversely affect its ability to sell its products and/or solutions.\nThe sale of Micronet\u2019s products is affected in certain countries and may be affected in other countries by the international status of the State of Israel. Israeli identity may be used in some cases for promoting sales (in light of the recognition of the technological advantages that exist in Israel) whereas in other cases and is likely to continue to be a disadvantage and result in the cancellation of transactions.\nProvisions of Israeli law and Micronet\u2019s amended and restated articles of association may delay, prevent or otherwise impede a merger with, or an acquisition of, our company, which could prevent a change of control, even when the terms of such a transaction are favorable to Micronet and its shareholders.\nAs a company incorporated under the law of the State of Israel, Micronet is subject to Israeli corporate law. Israeli corporate law regulates mergers, requires tender offers for acquisitions of shares above specified thresholds, requires special approvals for transactions involving directors, officers or significant shareholders and regulates other matters that may be relevant to such types of transactions. For example, a merger may not be consummated unless at least 50 days have passed from the date on which a merger proposal is filed by each merging company with the Israel Registrar of Companies and at least 30 days have passed from the date on which the shareholders of both merging companies have approved the merger. In addition, a majority of each class of securities of the target company must approve a merger. Moreover, a tender offer for all of a company\u2019s issued and outstanding shares can only be completed if the acquirer receives positive responses from the holders of at least 95% of the issued share capital. Completion of the tender offer also requires approval of and a majority of the offerees that do not have a personal interest in the tender offer approves the tender offer, unless, following consummation of the tender offer, the acquirer would hold at least 98% of the company\u2019s outstanding shares. Furthermore, the shareholders, including those who indicated their acceptance of the tender offer, may, at any time within six months following the completion of the tender offer, claim that the consideration for the acquisition of the shares does not reflect their fair market value, and petition an Israeli court to alter the consideration for the acquisition, unless accordingly, other than those who indicated their acceptance of the tender offer in case the acquirer stipulated in its tender offer that a shareholder that accepts the offer may not seek such appraisal rights., and the acquirer or the company published all required information with respect to the tender offer prior to the tender offer\u2019s response date.\nFurthermore, Israeli tax considerations may make potential transactions unappealing to Micronet or to its shareholders whose country of residence does not have a tax treaty with Israel exempting such shareholders from Israeli tax.\nMicronet\u2019s amended and restated articles of association also contain provisions that could delay or prevent changes in control or changes in its management without the consent of its board of directors. These provisions include the following:\n\u25cf no cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority shareholders to elect director candidates; and\n\u25cf the right of Micronet\u2019s board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which may prevent shareholders from being able to fill vacancies on its board of directors.\nMicronet\u2019s operations may be disrupted as a result of the obligation of management or key personnel to perform military service.\nMicronet\u2019s employees and consultants in Israel, including members of its senior management, may be obligated to perform one month, and in some cases longer periods, of military reserve duty until they reach the age of 40 (or older, for citizens who hold certain positions in the Israeli armed forces reserves) and, in the event of a military conflict or emergency circumstances, may be called to immediate and unlimited active duty. In the event of severe unrest or other conflict, individuals could be required to serve in the military for extended periods of time. In response to increases in terrorist activity, there have been periods of significant call-ups of military reservists. It is possible that there will be similar large-scale military reserve duty call-ups in the future. Micronet\u2019s operations could be disrupted by the absence of a significant number of our officers, directors, employees and consultants related to military service. Such disruption could materially adversely affect Micronet\u2019s business and operations.\nRisks Related to the Acquisition and the Business of the Post-Acquisition Entity\nThe combined entity may be unable to successfully execute its growth strategy.\nOne of the combined entity\u2019s strategies is to pursue organic growth by increasing product offerings, expanding into new verticals and new markets such as China. The combined entity also intends to continue to expand and upgrade the reliability and scalability of the PaaS offering and other aspects of its proprietary technology. The combined entity may not be able to successfully execute all or any of these initiatives, and the results may vary from the expectations of the combined entity or others. Further, even if these initiatives are successful, the combined entity may not be able to expand and upgrade its technology systems and infrastructure to accommodate increases in the business activity in a timely manner, which could lead to operational breakdowns and delays, loss of customers, a reduction in the growth of its customer base, increased operating expenses, financial losses, increased litigation or customer claims, regulatory sanctions or increased regulatory scrutiny. In addition, the combined entity will need to continue to attract, hire and retain highly skilled and motivated executives and employees to both execute the growth strategy and to manage the resulting growth effectively.\nThe combined entity may be unable to integrate the businesses of ParagonEx and Beijing Brookfield successfully.\nParagonEx and Beijing Brookfield are independent companies that have never operated as a combined entity before. Until now, each of ParagonEx and Beijing Brookfield has pursued its own separate businesses in different geographic locations. Upon consummation of the Acquisition, the combined entity will need to integrate the operations of these two companies that currently operate in different industries and geographic locations into a single operation. Although we believe the business of ParagonEx and Beijing Brookfield are complementary and there will be synergies from the integration of the two companies, we cannot assure you that the Acquisition will produce the expected or intended results. The failure to address problems encountered in connection with such integration could cause the combined entity to fail to realize the anticipated benefits or incur unanticipated liabilities, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the combined entity, which could negatively impact its stock price.\nThe combined entity\u2019s acquisition strategy may result in significant transaction expenses, integration and consolidation risks and risks associated with entering new markets, and the combined entity may not operate profitably.\nOne of the combined entity\u2019s strategies is to pursue growth through acquisitions of smaller players in the industry. Such acquisitions involve significant transaction expenses, including, but not limited to, fees paid to legal, financial, tax and accounting advisors, filing fees and printing costs. Acquisitions also present risks associated with offering new products or entering new markets and integrating the acquired companies.\nOther areas where the combined entity may face risks include:\n\u25cf diversion of management time and focus from operating the business of the combined entity to address challenges that may arise in integrating the acquired business;\n\u25cf transition of operations, users and user accounts onto existing platforms or onto platforms of the acquired company;\n\u25cf failure to successfully further develop the acquired business;\n\u25cf failure to realize anticipated operational or financial synergies;\n\u25cf implementation or remediation of controls, procedures, and policies at the acquired company;\n\u25cf the need to integrate operations across different cultures and languages and to address the particular economic, currency, political, and regulatory risks associated with specific countries;\n\u25cf liability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, such as violations of laws and regulatory requirements, commercial disputes, tax liabilities, infringement of third-party rights in intellectual property and other known and unknown liabilities; and\n\u25cf integration of the acquired business\u2019 accounting, human resource and other administrative systems, and coordination of trading and sales and marketing functions.\nFuture acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of the equity securities of the combined entity, the incurrence of debt, amortization expenses, impairment of goodwill and purchased long-lived assets, and restructuring charges, any of which could harm the financial condition or results of operations and cash flows of the combined entity. Additionally, any new businesses that may be acquired by the combined entity, once integrated with the existing operations, may not produce expected or intended results. The failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with future acquisitions could cause the combined entity to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or incur unanticipated liabilities, any of which could have a materially adverse effect on the business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the combined entity.\nNone of GFH, Beijing Brookfield or ParagonEx have any formal risk management policies or procedures and those applied by them may not be effective and may leave them exposed to unidentified or unexpected risks.\nGFH, Beijing Brookfield and ParagonEx are dependent on the professional expertise and experience of their management and staff to assess risks. GFH, Beijing Brookfield and ParagonEx do not have any formal written policies or procedures for identifying, monitoring or controlling risks, including risks related to human error, customer defaults, market movements, technology, fraud or money-laundering, and such risks are evaluated by their respective management teams and boards of directors on an ad-hoc basis. Such practices and methods used by GFH, Beijing Brookfield and ParagonEx for managing risk are discretionary by nature and are based on internally developed controls and observed historical market behavior, and also involve reliance on standard industry practices. These methods may not adequately prevent losses, particularly as they relate to extreme market movements, which may be significantly greater than historical fluctuations in the market. The risk-management methods utilized by GFH, Beijing Brookfield and ParagonEx also may not adequately prevent losses due to technical errors if their testing and quality control practices are not effective in preventing failures. In addition, GFH, Beijing Brookfield and ParagonEx may elect to adjust their risk-management policies to allow for an increase in risk tolerance, which could expose it to the risk of greater losses. The risk-management methods used by GFH, Beijing Brookfield and ParagonEx rely on a combination of technical and human controls and supervision that are subject to error and failure. These methods may not protect GFH, Beijing Brookfield and ParagonEx against all risks or may protect them less than anticipated, in which case the business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows of GFH, Beijing Brookfield and ParagonEx may be materially adversely affected.\nMICT shareholders may be unable to ascertain the merits or risks of Beijing Brookfield\u2019s and ParagonEx\u2019s operations and the business of these companies are outside of MICT management\u2019s area of expertise.\nTo the extent we complete the Acquisition, we will be affected by numerous risks inherent in both Beijing Brookfield\u2019s and ParagonEx\u2019s business operations. Furthermore, after completion of the Acquisition, the business of GFH will be entirely different from MICT\u2019s business. Although MICT\u2019s management has endeavored to evaluate the risks inherent in the proposed Merger, MICT cannot assure you that it can adequately ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors.\nSubsequent to the completion of the Acquisition, MICT may be required to take write-downs or write-offs, restructuring and impairment or other charges that could have a significant negative effect on its financial condition and its share price, which could cause you to lose some or all of your investment.\nMICT cannot assure you that the due diligence MICT has conducted on GFH, and its subsidiaries Beijing Brookfield and ParagonEx has revealed all material issues that may be present with regard to such companies, or that it would be possible to uncover all material issues through a customary amount of due diligence or that risks outside of MICT\u2019s control will not later arise. Each of GFH, Beijing Brookfield and ParagonEx are privately held companies and MICT therefore has made its decision to pursue the Acquisition on the basis of limited information, which may result in a business combination that is not as profitable as expected, if at all. As a result of these factors, MICT may be forced to later write-down or write-off assets, restructure operations, or incur impairment or other charges that could result in reporting losses. Even if MICT\u2019s due diligence successfully identifies certain risks, unexpected risks may arise and previously known risks may materialize in a manner not consistent with MICT\u2019s preliminary risk analysis. Even though these charges may be non-cash items and would not have an immediate impact on MICT\u2019s liquidity, the fact that MICT reports charges of this nature could contribute to negative market perceptions about MICT or MICT\u2019s securities. Accordingly, we cannot predict the impact that the Acquisition will have on GFH\u2019s securities.\nFurthermore, the Acquisition Agreement by which MICT will be acquiring GFH stipulates that all representations and warranties provided by GFH with regard to its businesses, will expire upon completion of the acquisition. Consequently, MICT will be limited in its ability to pursue a claim against GFH for breach of any of its representations and warranties that are discovered after the completion date, unless MICT is able to prove that such breach amounted to fraudulent misrepresentation or resulted from a similar act of malicious intent.\nMICT\u2019s ability to be successful following the Acquisition will be dependent upon the efforts of the MICT Board and key personnel and the loss of such persons could negatively impact the operations and profitability of MICT\u2019s post-combination business.\nMICT\u2019s ability to be successful following the Acquisition will be dependent upon the efforts of the MICT Board and key personnel. Furthermore, the business of MICT following the Acquisition will be made up mostly of GFH\u2019s business, and will be entirely different from MICT\u2019s current business. It is only contemplated that two of MICT\u2019s existing directors will serve on the MICT board of directors for a limited period of time, and MICT cannot assure you that MICT\u2019s board of directors and key personnel will be effective or successful or remain with MICT. In addition to the other challenges they will face, the new members of MICT\u2019s board of directors, other than the MICT continuing directors, may be unfamiliar with the requirements of operating a public company, which could cause MICT\u2019s management to have to expend time and resources helping them become familiar with such requirements.\nIt is estimated that, pursuant to the Merger Agreement, MICT\u2019s current public stockholders will only own a minimal interest of MICT. Accordingly, the future performance of MICT will depend upon the quality of the post-Merger board of directors, management and key personnel of MICT and the MICT\u2019s ability to retain such managers and key personnel over time.\nFailure to complete the Acquisition could harm the price of MICT\u2019s common stock and the future business and operations of each company.\nIf the Merger Agreement is terminated and the board of directors of the respective parties determine to seek another business combination, there can be no assurance that either MICT or GFH will be able to find a partner willing to provide equivalent or more attractive consideration than the consideration to be provided in connection with the Acquisition.\nSome of MICT\u2019s officers and directors have interests in the Acquisition that are different from yours and that may influence them to support or approve the Merger without regard to your interests.\nCertain officers and directors of MICT, like those of other companies, participate in compensation arrangements that provide them with interests in the Acquisition that are different from yours, including, among others, the continued service as an officer or director of the combined organization for some limited period of time, severance benefits and the potential ability to sell an increased number of shares of common stock of the combined organization in accordance with Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or the Securities Act. For example, such officers and directors may receive compensation for their services generally, as well as in connection with the Acquisition, and subject to and upon the consummation of the Acquisition, MICT will issue to our former director, Miki Balin, and two of our current directors, Chezy (Yehezkel) Ofir and Jeffrey P. Bialos, including our Chief Executive Officer, Mr. David Lucatz, 300,000 options to purchase MICT common stock (1,200,000 options in the aggregate) with an exercise price equal to $1.41, which shall be granted as success bonuses under MICT\u2019s existing stock incentive plans or under GFH\u2019s 2019 equity plan (including the 2019 Israeli sub-plan) and which shall be, converted into certain replacement stock options of MICT.\nThe securityholders of MICT will have a reduced ownership and voting interest in, and will exercise less influence over the management of, the combined organization following the completion of the Acquisitions as compared to their current ownership and voting interests in MICT.\nAfter the completion of the Acquisition, the current stockholders of MICT will own a smaller percentage of the combined organization than their ownership of their respective companies prior to the Transactions. Immediately after the closing of the Acquisition, it is anticipated that MICT stockholders will own approximately 7.64% of the common stock of the combined organization and GFH stockholder will own approximately 75.76% of the common stock of MICT. These estimates are subject to adjustment.\nDuring the pendency of the Acquisition, MICT and GFH may not be able to enter into a business combination with another party at a favorable price because of restrictions in the Merger Agreement, which could adversely affect their respective businesses.\nCovenants in the Merger Agreement impede the ability of MICT and GFH to make acquisitions, subject to certain exceptions relating to fiduciary duties, as set forth below, or to complete other transactions that are not in the ordinary course of business pending completion of the Acquisition. As a result, if the Acquisition is not completed, the parties may be at a disadvantage to their competitors during such period. In addition, while the Merger Agreement is in effect, each party is generally prohibited during the interim period from soliciting, initiating, encouraging or entering into certain extraordinary transactions, such as merger, sale of assets or other business combination outside the ordinary course of business with any third party, subject to certain exceptions relating to fiduciary duties, as set forth below. Any such transactions could be favorable to such party\u2019s stockholders.\nCertain provisions of the Merger Agreement may discourage third parties from submitting alternative takeover proposals, including proposals that may be superior to the arrangements contemplated by the Merger Agreement.\nThe terms of the Merger Agreement prohibit each of MICT and GFH from soliciting alternative takeover proposals or cooperating with persons making unsolicited takeover proposals, except, in the case of MICT, in the limited circumstances when its board of directors determines in good faith that an unsolicited alternative takeover proposal is or is reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the board of directors\u2019 fiduciary duties.\nThe market price of MICT\u2019s common stock is expected to be volatile, and the market price of the common stock may drop following the Acquisition.\nThe market price of MICT\u2019s common stock following the Acquisition could be subject to significant fluctuations. Some of the factors that may cause the market price of MICT\u2019s common stock to fluctuate include:\n\u25cf changes in laws or regulations applicable to MICT\u2019s business and operations;\n\u25cf introduction of new products, services or technologies by MICT\u2019s competitors;\n\u25cf failure to meet or exceed financial and development projections MICT may provide to the public;\n\u25cf failure to meet or exceed the financial and development projections of the investment community;\n\u25cf announcements of significant acquisitions, strategic collaborations, joint ventures or capital commitments by MICT or its competitors;\n\u25cf additions or departures of key personnel;\n\u25cf significant lawsuits, including patent or stockholder litigation;\n\u25cf if securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about MICT\u2019s business, or if they issue an adverse or misleading opinions regarding its business and stock;\n\u25cf general market or macroeconomic conditions;\n\u25cf sales of its common stock by MICT or its shareholders in the future;\n\u25cf trading volume of MICT\u2019s common stock; and\n\u25cf period-to-period fluctuations in MICT\u2019s financial results\nMoreover, the stock markets in general have experienced substantial volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of individual companies. These broad market fluctuations may also adversely affect the trading price of MICT\u2019s common stock.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, stockholders have often instituted class action securities litigation against those companies. Such litigation, if instituted, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management attention and resources, which could significantly harm MICT\u2019s profitability and reputation.\nAn active market for MICT\u2019s common stock may not develop, which would adversely affect the liquidity and price of MICT\u2019s common stock.\nThe price of MICT\u2019s common stock may vary significantly due to factors specific to MICT as well as to general market or economic conditions. Furthermore, an active trading market for MICT\u2019s common stock may never develop or, if developed, it may not be sustained. You may be unable to sell your securities unless a market can be established and sustained.\nThe market price of MICT\u2019s common stock may decline as a result of the Acquisition.\nThe market price of MICT\u2019s common stock may decline as a result of the Acquisition for a number of reasons including if:\n\u25cf investors react negatively to the prospects of MICT\u2019s business and the prospects of the Acquisition;\n\u25cf the effect of the Acquisition on MICT\u2019s business and prospects is not consistent with the expectations of financial or industry analysts; or\n\u25cf MICT does not achieve the perceived benefits of the Acquisition as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by financial or industry analysts.\nMICT\u2019s stockholders may not realize a benefit from the Acquisition commensurate with the ownership dilution they will experience in connection with the Merger.\nIf MICT is unable to realize the full strategic and financial benefits currently anticipated from the Acquisition, MICT\u2019s stockholders will have experienced substantial dilution of their ownership interests in MICT without receiving any commensurate benefit, or only receiving part of the commensurate benefit to the extent MICT is able to realize only part of the strategic and financial benefits currently anticipated from the Merger.\nFollowing the Acquisition, if securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about MICT, its business, or its market, or if they change their recommendations regarding MICT common stock adversely, the price and trading volume of the MICT common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for MICT\u2019s common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about MICT, its business, its market, or its competitors. Securities and industry analysts do not currently, and may never, publish research on MICT. If no securities or industry analysts commence coverage of MICT, MICT\u2019s stock price and trading volume would likely be negatively impacted. If any of the analysts who may cover MICT change their recommendation regarding MICT\u2019s share adversely, or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors, the price of the MICT\u2019s common stock would likely decline. If any analyst who may currently cover MICT were to cease coverage of MICT or fail to regularly publish reports on it, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause MICT\u2019s stock price or trading volume to decline.\nFuture sales of shares by stockholders could cause MICT\u2019s stock price to decline.\nIf stockholders of MICT sell, or indicate an intention to sell, substantial amounts of MICT\u2019s common stock in the public market after legal restrictions on resale discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K lapse, the trading price of MICT\u2019s common stock could decline. Based on shares outstanding as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and shares expected to be issued upon completion of the Acquisition, MICT is expected to have outstanding a total of approximately 145,130,577 shares of common stock immediately following the completion of the Acquisition. Of such shares, all of the shares being issued to GFH pursuant to the Merger Agreement, which shall be subject to a lock-up agreement for a period of twelve (12) months following the closing of the Acquisition, shall become available for sale. All other outstanding shares of common stock will be freely tradable, without restriction, in the public market. If these shares are sold, the trading price of MICT\u2019s common stock shares could decline.\nRisks related to recent and potential changes to regulatory legislation in the British Virgin Islands could lead to increased costs of GFH in complying with additional regulatory and reporting requirements.\nAs the global regulatory and tax environment evolves, GFH may be subject to new or different statutory and regulatory requirements (for example, on January 1, 2019 the Economic Substance (Companies and Limited Partnerships) Act, 2018 of the British Virgin Islands (the \u201cEconomic Substance Act\u201d) came into force and related regulations and guidance are anticipated in due course). It is difficult to predict what impact the adoption of these laws or regulations, or changes in the interpretation of existing laws or regulations could have on GFH, however, compliance with various additional obligations may create significant additional costs that may be borne by GFH or otherwise affect the management and operation of GFH.", "PERMNO": 13879, "SIC": 3812, "TIC": "MICT"}
