{"cik": "36506", "company": "MACKINAC FINANCIAL CORP /MI/", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-12", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nOur business, prospects, financial condition, or operating results could be materially adversely affected by any of the risks and uncertainties set forth below, as well as in any amendments or updates reflected in subsequent filings with the SEC. In assessing these risks, you should also refer to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes.\nRISK FACTORS\nInvesting in our securities involves risk. You should carefully consider the specific risks set forth in \u201cRisk Factors\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These risks are not the only risks we face. Additional risks not presently known to us, or that we currently view as immaterial, may also impair our business, if any of the risks described herein or any additional risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe Corporation\u2019s net interest income could be negatively affected by interest rate adjustments by the Federal Reserve, as well as by competition in its primary market area.\nAs a financial institution, the Coporation\u2019s earnings are significantly dependent upon its net interest income, which is the difference between the interest income that is earned on interest-earning assets, such as investment securities and loans, and the interest expense that we pay on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowings. Therefore, any change in general market interest rates, including changes resulting from changes in the Federal Reserve\u2019s fiscal and monetary policies, affects it more than non-financial institutions and can have a significant effect on net interest income and total income. The Corporation\u2019s assets and liabilities may react differently to changes in overall market rates or conditions because there may be mismatches between the repricing or maturity characteristics of the assets and liabilities. The Federal Reserve recently lowered market interest rates after previously raising such rates. Such rate moves may be difficult for us to predict or manage. As a result, an increase or decrease in market interest rates could have material adverse effects on net interest margin and results of operations.\nIf the allowance for loan losses is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses, our earnings could decrease.\nOur success depends to a significant extent upon the quality of our assets, particularly loans. In originating loans, there is a substantial likelihood that credit losses will be experienced. The risk of loss will vary with, among other things, general economic conditions, the type of loan being made, the creditworthiness of the borrower over the term of the loan and, in the case of a collateralized loan, the quality of the collateral for the loan.\nOur loan customers may not repay their loans according to the terms of these loans, and the collateral securing the payment of these loans may be insufficient to assure repayment. As a result, we may experience significant loan losses, which could have a material adverse effect on operating results. Management makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of the loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of many of our loans. An allowance for loan losses is maintained in an attempt to cover any loan losses that may occur. In determining the size of the allowance, management relies on an analysis of the loan portfolio based on historical loss experience, volume and types of loans, trends in classification, volume and trends in delinquencies and non-accruals, national and local economic conditions and other pertinent information. The determination of the size of the allowance could be understated due to deviations in one or more of these factors.\nIf our assumptions are wrong, the current allowance may not be sufficient to cover future loan losses, and adjustments may be necessary to allow for different economic conditions or adverse developments in the Corporation\u2019s loan portfolio. Material additions to the allowance would materially decrease net income.\nIn addition, federal and state regulators periodically review the allowance for loan losses and may require the Corporation to increase its provision for loan losses or recognize further loan charge-offs, based on judgments different than those of management. Any increase in the allowance for loan losses or loan charge-offs as required by these regulatory agencies could have a negative effect on our operating results.\nWe may need to raise additional capital in the future, but that capital may not be available when it is needed.\nWe are required by federal and state regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations. Management may at some point in the future need to raise additional capital to support its business as a result of losses or acquisition activity. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time, which are outside the control of management, and on our financial performance. Accordingly, we cannot assure you of our ability to raise additional capital if needed on terms acceptable to management. If additional capital cannot be raised when needed, our ability to further expand our operations through internal growth or acquisition activity and to operate our business could be materially impaired.\nIf the Corporation is unable to increase its share of deposits in the markets that its bank operates within, it may accept out-of-market and brokered deposits, the costs of which may be higher than expected.\nOur management can offer no assurance that it will be able to maintain or increase the Corporation\u2019s market share of deposits in its highly competitive service areas. If unable to do so, it may be forced to accept increased amounts of out-of-market or brokered deposits. As of December 31, 2019, the Corporation had approximately $58.622 million in out of market brokered deposits, which represented approximately 5.45% of total deposits. Most times, the cost of out-of-market and brokered deposits exceeds the cost of deposits in the local market. In addition, the cost of out-of-market and brokered deposits can be volatile, and if we are unable to access these markets, or if its costs related to out of market and brokered deposits increase, our liquidity and ability to support demand for loans could be adversely affected.\nVolatility and disruptions in global capital and credit markets may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEven though the Corporation operates in a distinct geographic region in the U.S., it is impacted by global capital and credit markets, which are sometimes subject to periods of extreme volatility and disruption. Disruptions, uncertainty or volatility in the capital and credit markets may limit our ability to access capital and manage liquidity, which may adversely affect the Corporation\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, our customers may be adversely impacted by such conditions, which could have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Corporation is subject to extensive regulation that could limit or restrict its activities.\nThe Corporation operates in a highly regulated industry and is subject to examination, supervision and comprehensive regulation by various federal and state agencies. Compliance with these regulations is costly and restricts certain activities, including payment of dividends, mergers and acquisitions, investments, loans and interest rates charged, interest rates paid on deposits and locations of offices. The Corporation is also subject to capitalization guidelines established by its regulators, which require it to maintain adequate capital to support its growth.\nThe Corporation\u2019s business also is subject to laws, rules and regulations regarding the disclosure of non-public information about its customers to non-affiliated third parties. Internet operations are not currently subject to direct regulation by any government agency in the United States beyond regulations applicable to businesses generally. A number of legislative and regulatory proposals currently under consideration by federal, state and local governmental organizations may lead to laws or regulations concerning various aspects of our business on the Internet, including: user privacy, taxation, content, access charges, liability for third-party activities and jurisdiction. The adoption of new laws or a change in the application of existing laws may decrease the use of the Internet, increase costs or otherwise adversely affect our business.\nIn particular, Congress and other regulators have increased their focus on the regulation of the financial services industry in recent years. Future political trends and the effects on the Corporation of recent and potential legislation and regulatory actions cannot reliably be fully determined at this time. Moreover, as some of the legislation and regulatory actions previously implemented in response to the recent financial crisis expire, the impact of the conclusion of these\nprograms on the financial sector and on the economic recovery is unknown. Any worsening of current financial market conditions could adversely affect the Corporation. The Corporation can neither predict when or whether future regulatory or legislative reforms will be enacted nor what their contents will be. The impact of any future legislation or regulatory actions on our businesses or operations cannot be determined at this time, and such impact may adversely affect the Corporation.\nThe laws and regulations applicable to the banking industry could change at any time, and management cannot predict the effects of these changes on our business and profitability. Additionally, we cannot predict the effect of any legislation that may be passed at the state or federal level in response to the recent deterioration of the subprime, mortgage, credit and liquidity markets. Because government regulation greatly affects the business and financial results of all commercial banks and bank holding companies, the cost of compliance could adversely affect our ability to operate profitably.\nThe Corporation\u2019s financial condition and results of operations are reported in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\u201cGAAP\u201d). While not impacting economic results, future changes in accounting principles issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board could impact the Corporation\u2019s earnings as reported under GAAP. As a public company, the Corporation is also subject to the corporate governance standards set forth in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as applicable rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC. Complying with these standards, rules and regulations has and continues to impose administrative costs and burdens on the Corporation.\nAdditionally, political conditions could impact our earnings. Acts or threats of war or terrorism, as well as actions taken by the United States or other governments in response to such acts or threats, could impact the business and economic conditions in which we operates.\nWe may make or be required to make further increases in our provision for loan losses and to charge off additional loans in the future, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nAs a result of changes in balances and composition of our loan portfolio, changes in economic and market conditions that occur from time to time and other factors specific to a borrower\u2019s circumstances, the level of non-performing assets will fluctuate. Increased non-performing assets, credit losses or the provision for loan losses would materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur adjustable-rate loans may expose us to increased default risks.\nWhile adjustable-rate loans better offset the adverse effects of an increase in interest rates as compared to fixed-rate loans, the increased payments required of adjustable-rate loan borrowers upon an interest rate adjustment in a rising interest rate environment could cause an increase in delinquencies and defaults. The marketability of the underlying property may also be adversely affected in a rising interest rate environment. In addition, although adjustable-rate loans help make our asset base more responsive to changes in interest rates, the extent of this interest sensitivity is limited by the annual and lifetime interest rate adjustment limits.\nChanging interest rates may decrease the Corporation\u2019s earnings and asset values.\nManagement is unable to accurately predict future market interest rates, which are affected by many factors, including, but not limited to, inflation, recession, changes in employment levels, changes in the money supply and domestic and international disorder and instability in domestic and foreign financial markets. Changes in the interest rate environment may reduce the Corporation\u2019s profits. Net interest income is a significant component of its net income and consists of the difference, or spread, between interest income generated on interest-earning assets and interest expense incurred on interest-bearing liabilities. Net interest spreads are affected by the difference between the maturities and repricing characteristics of interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities. Although certain interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities may have similar maturities or periods in which they reprice, they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates. In addition, residential mortgage loan origination volumes are affected by market interest rates on loans; rising interest rates generally are associated with a lower volume of loan originations, while falling interest rates are usually associated with higher loan originations. The Corporation\u2019s ability to generate gains on sales of mortgage loans is significantly dependent on the level of originations. Cash flows are affected by changes in market interest rates. Generally, in rising interest rate environments, loan prepayment rates are likely to decline, and in falling interest rate environments, such as ecperienced in the past period, loan prepayment rates are likely\nto increase. A majority of our commercial, commercial real estate and multi-family residential real estate loans are adjustable rate loans and an increase in the general level of interest rates may adversely affect the ability of some borrowers to pay the interest on and principal of their obligations, especially borrowers with loans that have adjustable rates of interest. Changes in interest rates, prepayment speeds and other factors may also cause the value of loans held for sale to change. Accordingly, changes in levels of market interest rates could materially and adversely affect our net interest spread, loan volume, asset quality, value of loans held for sale and cash flows, as well as the market value of our securities portfolio and overall profitability.\nMackinac faces strong competition from other financial institutions, financial services companies and other organizations offering services similar to those offered by it, which could result in Mackinac not being able to sustain or grow its loan and deposit businesses.\nMackinac conducts its business operations primarily in the State of Michigan and Northeastern Wisconsin. Increased competition within these markets may result in reduced loan originations and deposits. Ultimately, we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors. Many competitors offer the types of loans and banking services that the Corporation offers. These competitors include other savings associations, community banks, regional banks and money center banks. We also face competition from many other types of financial institutions, including finance companies, brokerage firms, insurance companies, credit unions, mortgage banks and other financial intermediaries. Our competitors with greater resources may have a marketplace advantage enabling them to maintain numerous banking locations and mount extensive promotional and advertising campaigns.\nAdditionally, financial intermediaries not subject to bank regulatory restrictions and banks and other financial institutions with larger capitalization have larger lending limits and are thereby able to serve the credit needs of larger clients. These institutions, particularly to the extent they are more diversified than the Corporation is, may be able to offer the same loan products and services that we offer at more competitive rates and prices. If we are unable to attract and retain banking clients, we may be unable to sustain current loan and deposit levels or increase our loan and deposit levels, and our business, financial condition and future prospects may be negatively affected.\nOur business could be adversely affected due to risks related to our recent acquisitions and the subsequent integration of the acquired businesses.\nIn recent years, we have closed several acquisitions of varying significance, and expect to consider future acquisitions from time to time. We cannot be certain that we will be able to identify, consummate and successfully integrate acquisitions, and no assurance can be given with respect to the timing, likelihood or business effect of any possible transaction. Transactions that we consummate would involve risks and uncertainties to us, including mispricing the inherent value of the acquired entity, as well as potential difficulties integrating people, systems and customers and realizing synergies.\nThe risks associated with our recent acquisitions any future acquisitions include, but are not limited to:\n\u00b7\nWe may experience inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies that adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with clients, customers, depositors and employees;\n\u00b7\nWe could be subject to liabilities that could be material or become subject to litigation or regulatory risks as a result of the acquisition;\n\u00b7\nManagement\u2019s attention may be diverted from other business initiatives; and\n\u00b7\nUnanticipated restructuring and other integration costs may be incurred.\nAny future acquisitions could involve these and additional risks. Our ability to pursue additional strategic transactions may also be limited by any significant decrease our stock price, which would adversely affect the attractiveness of our currency to potential targets, or by our ability to raise additional equity or debt capital to fund future acquisitions. Any of these risks, whether with respect to the recent or any future acquisitions, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe may be required to transition from the use of the LIBOR interest rate index in the future.\nA portion of the loans in our portfolio are indexed to LIBOR to calculate the loan interest rate. The continued availability of the LIBOR index is not guaranteed after 2021. It is impossible to predict whether and to what extent banks will continue to provide LIBOR submissions to the administrator of LIBOR or whether any additional reforms to LIBOR may be enacted. At this time, no consensus exists as to what rate or rates may become acceptable alternatives to LIBOR. The implementation of a substitute index or indices for the calculation of interest rates under our loan agreements with our borrowers may incur significant expenses in effecting the transition, may result in reduced loan balances if borrowers do not accept the substitute index or indices, and may result in disputes or litigation with customers over the appropriateness or comparability to LIBOR of the substitute index or indices, each of which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nOur ability to use net operating loss carryovers to reduce future tax payments may be limited or restricted.\nAs of December 31, 2019, the Corporation had net operating loss (\u201cNOL\u201d) carryforwards of approximately $10.2 million. The Corporation is generally able to carry NOLs forward to reduce taxable income in future years. However, its ability to utilize its NOL carryforwards is subject to the rules of Section 382 of the Code. Section 382 of the Code generally restricts the use of NOL carryforwards after an \u201cownership change.\u201d An ownership change occurs if, among other things, the shareholders (or specified groups of shareholders) who own or have owned, directly or indirectly, 5% or more of a corporation\u2019s common shares, or are otherwise treated as 5% shareholders under Section 382 of the Code and the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder, increase their aggregate percentage ownership of that corporation\u2019s shares by more than fifty (50) percentage points over the lowest percentage of the shares owned by these shareholders over a three (3)-year rolling period. In the event of an ownership change, Section 382 of the Code imposes an annual limitation on the amount of taxable income a corporation may offset with its pre-ownership change NOL carry forwards. This annual limitation is generally equal to the value of the corporation\u2019s shares immediately before the ownership change multiplied by the long-term tax-exempt rate in effect for the month in which the ownership change occurs. Any unused annual limitation may be carried over to later years until the applicable expiration date for the respective NOL carryforwards.\nManagement cannot ensure that the Corporation\u2019s ability to use its NOL carryforwards to offset taxable income or its tax credit carryforwards to offset tax will not become limited in the future. As a result, the Corporation could pay taxes earlier and in larger amounts than would be the case if its NOL and tax credit carryforwards were available to reduce its federal income taxes without restriction.\nWe may not be able to utilize technology to efficiently and effectively develop, market, and deliver new products and services to our customers.\nThe financial services industry experiences rapid technological change with regular introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The efficient and effective utilization of technology enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to market and deliver products and services that will satisfy customer demands, meet regulatory requirements, and create additional efficiencies in its operations. We may not be able to effectively develop new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing or supporting these products and services to our customers, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOperational difficulties, failure of technology infrastructure or information security incidents could adversely affect Our business and operations.\nWe are exposed to many types of operational risk, including reputational risk, legal and compliance risk, the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders, failure of our controls and procedures and unauthorized transactions by employees or operational errors, including clerical or recordkeeping errors or those resulting from computer or telecommunications systems malfunctions. Given the high volume of transactions we process, certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they are identified and resolved. In particular, our operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information on our technology systems and networks. Any failure, interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management, general ledger, deposit, loan and other systems.\nWe also face the risk of operational disruption, failure or capacity constraints due to our dependency on third party vendors for components of our business infrastructure, including our core data processing systems which are largely outsourced. While we have selected these third party vendors carefully, we do not control their operations. As such, any failure on the part of these business partners to perform their various responsibilities could also adversely affect our business and operations.\nWe may also be subject to disruptions of our operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, which may include, for example, computer viruses, cyberattacks, spikes in transaction volume and/or customer activity, electrical or telecommunications outages, or natural disasters. Although we have has programs in place related to business continuity, disaster recovery and information security to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its systems, business applications and customer information, such disruptions may give rise to interruptions in service to customers and loss or liability to the Corporation.\nThe occurrence of any failure or interruption in our operations or information systems, or any security breach, could cause reputational damage, jeopardize the confidentiality of customer information, result in a loss of customer business, subject us to regulatory intervention or expose us to civil litigation and financial loss or liability, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nChanges in customer behavior may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe use a variety of methods to anticipate customer behavior as a part of its strategic planning and to meet certain regulatory requirements. Individual, economic, political, industry-specific conditions and other factors outside of our control, such as fuel prices, energy costs, real estate values or other factors that affect customer income levels, could alter predicted customer borrowing, repayment, investment and deposit practices. Such a change in these practices could materially adversely affect our ability to anticipate business needs and meet regulatory requirements.\nFurther, difficult economic conditions may negatively affect consumer confidence levels. A decrease in consumer confidence levels would likely aggravate the adverse effects of these difficult market conditions on the Corporation, its customers and others in the financial institutions industry.\nOur ability to maintain and expand customer relationships may differ from expectations.\nThe financial services industry is very competitive. The Corporation not only vies for business opportunities with new customers, but also competes to maintain and expand the relationships it has with its existing customers. While we believe that we can continue to grow many of these relationships, we will continue to experience pressures to maintain these relationships as its competitors attempt to capture our customers. Failure to create new customer relationships and to maintain and expand existing customer relationships to the extent anticipated may adversely impact our earnings.\nThe trading price of our common stock may be subject to significant fluctuations and volatility.\nThe market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations due to, among other things:\n\u00b7\nvariations in quarterly or annual results of operations;\n\u00b7\nchanges in dividends per share;\n\u00b7\ndeterioration in asset quality, including declining real estate values;\n\u00b7\nchanges in interest rates;\n\u00b7\nsignificant acquisitions or business combinations, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments by or involving the Corporation or its competitors;\n\u00b7\nregulatory actions, including changes to regulatory capital levels, the components of regulatory capital and how regulatory capital is calculated;\n\u00b7\nnew regulations that limit or significantly change our ability to continue to offer products or services;\n\u00b7\nvolatility of stock market prices and volumes;\n\u00b7\nissuance of additional shares of common stock or other debt or equity securities;\n\u00b7\nchanges in market valuations of similar companies;\n\u00b7\nchanges in securities analysts\u2019 estimates of financial performance or recommendations;\n\u00b7\nperceptions in the marketplace regarding the financial services industry, the Corporation and/or its competitors; and/or\n\u00b7\nthe occurrence of any one or more of the risk factors described above.\nThese risks and uncertainties should be considered in evaluating forward-looking statements. Further information concerning the Corporation and its business, including additional factors that could materially affect the Corporation\u2019s financial results, is included in the Corporation\u2019s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. All forward-looking statements contained in this report are based upon information presently available and the Corporation assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements.", "PERMNO": 89109, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "MFNC"}
