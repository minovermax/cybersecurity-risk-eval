{"cik": "932696", "company": "INSIGHT ENTERPRISES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-20", "item_1A": "Item 1A of this report.\nBacklog\nThe majority of our backlog historically has been and continues to be open cancelable purchase orders. We do not believe that backlog as of any particular date is predictive of future results.\nIntellectual Property\nWe do not maintain a traditional research and development group, but we do develop and seek to protect a range of intellectual property, including trademarks, service marks, copyrights, domain name rights, trade dress, trade secrets and similar intellectual property, relying for such protection on applicable statutes and common law rights, trade-secret protection and confidentiality and license agreements, as applicable, with teammates, clients, partners and others to protect our intellectual property rights. Our principal trademark is a registered mark, and we also license certain of our proprietary intellectual property rights to third parties. We have registered a number of domain names, applied for registration of other marks in the U.S. and in select international jurisdictions, and, from time to time, filed patent applications. We believe our trademarks and service marks, in particular, have significant value, and we continue to invest in the promotion of our trademarks and service marks and in our protection of them.\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nAvailable Information\nOur annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to such reports filed pursuant to Sections 13(a) and 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the \u201cExchange Act\u201d), and the reports of beneficial ownership filed pursuant to Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act are available free of charge on our web site at www.insight.com, as soon as reasonably practicable after we electronically file them with, or furnish them to, the Securities and Exchange Commission. The information contained on our web site is not included as a part of, or incorporated by reference into, this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nWe rely on our partners for product availability and competitive products to sell, and we also compete with many of our partners. We acquire products for resale both directly from manufacturers and publishers and indirectly through distributors, and the loss of a significant partner relationship could cause a disruption in the availability of products to us. Many of our manufacturer and publisher partners are also our competitors, as many sell directly to business customers, particularly larger corporate customers. There can be no assurance that, as manufacturers and publishers continue to sell both through the reseller channel and directly to end users, they will not limit or curtail the availability of their product to resellers like us. In addition, the manner in which publishers distribute software is changing, and many publishers now offer their programs as Cloud, hosted or SaaS solutions. These changes in distribution may intensify competition and increase the volume of software made available directly to end users through these competitive programs. Any significant increase in such sales could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on our partners for marketing funds and purchasing incentives. Certain manufacturers, publishers and distributors provide us with substantial incentives in the form of rebates, marketing funds, purchasing incentives, early payment discounts, referral fees and price protections (collectively, \u201cpartner funding\u201d). Partner funding is used to offset, among other things, inventory costs, costs of goods sold, marketing costs and other operating expenses. Certain of these funds are based on our volume of sales or purchases, growth rate of net sales or purchases and marketing programs. If we do not meet the goals of these programs or if we are not in compliance with the terms of these programs, there could be a material negative effect on the amount of incentives offered or paid to us by manufacturers and publishers. We continue to experience adverse program changes, and we anticipate that in the future the incentives that many partners make available to us may either be reduced or that the requirements for earning the available amounts will change. If we are unable to react timely to any fundamental changes in the partner funding programs of publishers or manufacturers, including the elimination of, or significant reductions in, funding for some of the activities for which we have been compensated in the past, particularly related to incentive programs with our largest partners, Microsoft, HP and Cisco, the changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. There can be no assurance that we will continue to receive such incentives.\nChanges in the IT industry and/or rapid changes in technology may reduce demand for the IT hardware, software and services we sell or change who makes purchasing decisions for IT hardware, software and services. Our results of operations are influenced by a variety of factors, including the condition of the IT industry, shifts in demand for, or availability of, IT hardware, software, peripherals and services, and industry innovation and the introduction of new products. The IT industry is characterized by rapid technological change and the frequent introduction of new products and changing delivery channels and models, which can decrease demand for current products and services and can disrupt purchasing patterns. If we fail to react in a timely manner to such changes, we may experience lower sales and, with respect to hardware, we may have to record write-downs of obsolete inventory. In addition, in order to satisfy client demand, protect ourselves against product shortages, obtain greater purchasing discounts and react to changes in original equipment manufacturers\u2019 terms and conditions, we may decide to carry inventory products that may have limited or no return privileges. There can be no assurance that we will be able to avoid losses related to inventory obsolescence on these products. Additionally, if purchasing power within our clients shifts from centralized procurement functions to business units or individual end users and we are unable to react timely to any such changes, these shifts in purchasing power could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions and results of operations.\nThe Cloud and \u201cas-a-service\u201d models are disrupting the IT market and introducing new products, services and competitors to the market. In many cases, these new distribution models allow enterprises to obtain the benefits of commercially licensed, internally operated software with less complexity and lower initial set-up, operational and licensing costs, increasing competition for us. There can be no assurance that we will be able to adapt to, or compete effectively with, current or future distribution channels or competitors or that the competitive pressures we face will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nThe IT hardware, software and services industry is intensely competitive, and actions of our competitors, including manufacturers and publishers of products we sell, can negatively affect our business. Competition in the industry is based on price, product availability, speed of delivery, credit availability, quality and breadth of product lines, and, increasingly, on the ability to provide services and tailor specific solutions to client needs. In addition to the manufacturers and publishers of products we sell, we compete with a large number and wide variety of providers and resellers of IT hardware, software and services. We believe our industry will see further consolidation as product resellers and direct marketers combine operations or acquire or merge with other resellers, service providers and direct marketers to increase efficiency, service capabilities and market share. Moreover, current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to enhance their product and service offerings. Accordingly, it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and acquire significant market share. Generally, pricing is very aggressive in the industry, and we expect pricing pressures to continue. There can be no assurance that we will be able to negotiate prices as favorable as those negotiated by our competitors or that we will be able to offset the effects of price reductions with an increase in the number of clients, higher net sales, cost reductions, greater sales of services, which are typically at higher gross margins, or otherwise. Price reductions by our competitors that we either cannot or choose not to match could result in an erosion of our market share and/or reduced sales or, to the extent we match such reductions, could result in reduced operating margins or inventory impairment charges, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCertain of our competitors in each of our operating segments have greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do. In addition, some of these competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities, technologies and client requirements. Many current and potential competitors also have greater name recognition and engage in more extensive promotional activities, offer more attractive terms to their customers and adopt more aggressive pricing policies than we do. Additionally, some of our competitors have higher margins and/or lower operating cost structures, allowing them to price more aggressively. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively with current or future competitors or that the competitive pressures we face will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe failure to comply with the terms and conditions of our commercial and public sector contracts could result in, among other things, damages, fines or other liabilities. Sales to commercial clients are based on stated contractual terms, the terms and conditions on our website or terms contained in purchase orders on a transaction by transaction basis. Sales to public sector clients are derived from sales to federal, state and local governmental departments and agencies, as well as to educational institutions, through open market sales and various contracts and programs. Noncompliance with contract terms, particularly to highly regulated public sector clients, or with government procurement regulations could result in fines or penalties against us or termination of contracts, and, in the public sector, could also result in civil, criminal, and administrative liability. With respect to our public sector clients, the government\u2019s remedies may include suspension or debarment. In addition, almost all of our contracts have default provisions, and substantially all of our contracts in the public sector are terminable at any time for convenience of the contracting agency. The effect of any of these possible actions or the adoption of new or modified procurement regulations or practices could materially adversely affect our business, financial position and results of operations.\nDisruptions in our IT systems and voice and data networks could affect our ability to service our clients and cause us to incur additional expenses. We believe that our success to date has been, and future results of operations will be, dependent in large part upon our ability to provide prompt and efficient service to our clients. Our ability to provide that level of service is largely dependent on the ease of use, accuracy, quality and utilization of our IT systems, which affects our ability to manage our sales, client service, distribution, inventories and accounting systems, and the reliability of our voice and data networks and managed services offerings. During 2013 and 2014, we completed a comprehensive integration and conversion of our IT systems. There can be no assurance that these integration and conversion projects will yield the anticipated efficiency benefits. If current technology is determined to have a shorter useful life or the value of the current system is impaired, we could incur additional depreciation expense and/or impairment charges. A substantial interruption in our IT systems or in our voice and data networks, however caused, could occur and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nBreaches in the security of our electronic and other confidential information could materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. We are dependent upon automated information technology processes. Privacy, security, and compliance concerns have continued to increase as technology has evolved to facilitate commerce and as cross-border commerce increases. As part of our normal business activities, we collect and store certain confidential information, including information about teammates and information about partners and clients which may be entitled to protection under a number of regulatory regimes. In the course of normal and customary business practice, we may share some of this information with vendors who assist us with certain aspects of our business. Moreover, the success of our operations depends upon the secure transmission of confidential and personal data over public networks, including the use of cashless payments. Any failure on the part of us or our vendors to maintain the security of data we are required to protect, including via the penetration of our network security and the misappropriation of confidential and personal information, could result in business disruption, damage to our reputation, financial obligations to third parties, fines, penalties, regulatory proceedings and private litigation with potentially large costs, and also result in deterioration in our teammates\u2019, partners\u2019 and clients\u2019 confidence in us and other competitive disadvantages, and thus could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In 2014, we were subject to information security attacks with increasing frequency at year-end. Although we do not believe the attacks resulted in the misappropriation of sensitive data, we have been, and expect to continue to be, subject to electronic data attacks and threats.\nGeneral economic conditions, including unfavorable economic conditions in a particular region, business or industry sector, may lead our clients to delay or forgo investments in IT hardware, software and services. Weak economic conditions generally or any broad-based reduction in IT spending adversely affects our business, operating results and financial condition. A prolonged slowdown in the global economy or similar crisis, or in a particular region or business or industry sector, or tightening of credit markets, could cause our clients to have difficulty accessing capital and credit sources, delay contractual payments, or delay or forgo decisions to upgrade or add to their existing IT environments, license new software or purchase products or services (particularly with respect to discretionary spending for hardware, software and services). Such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nEconomic or industry downturns could result in longer payment cycles, increased collection costs and defaults in excess of our expectations. A significant deterioration in our ability to collect on accounts receivable could also impact the cost or availability of financing under our accounts receivable securitization program.\nWe rely on independent shipping companies for delivery of products and are subject to price increases or service interruptions from these carriers. We generally ship hardware products to our customers by FedEx, United Parcel Service and other commercial delivery services and invoice customers for delivery charges. If we are unable to pass on to our clients future increases in the cost of commercial delivery services, our profitability could be adversely affected. Additionally, strikes, inclement weather, natural disasters or other service interruptions by such shippers could adversely affect our ability to deliver products on a timely basis. Such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on certain personnel. We rely on key management teammates to execute our strategy to grow profitable market share. The loss of one or more of these leaders, or a failure to attract and retain new executives, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. We also believe that our future success will be largely dependent on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified management, sales, service and technical teammates, and we make significant investments in the training of our sales account executives and services engineers. If we are not able to retain such personnel or to train them quickly enough to meet changing market conditions, we could experience a drop in the overall quality and efficiency of our sales and services teammates, and that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur net sales and gross profit have historically varied, making our future operating results less predictable. Our operating results are highly dependent upon our level of gross profit as a percentage of net sales, which fluctuates due to numerous factors, including changes in prices from partners, changes in the amount and timing of partner funding, volumes of purchases, changes in client mix, management of our cash conversion cycle, the relative mix of products and services sold during the period, general competitive conditions, and strategic product and services pricing and purchasing actions. As a result of significant price competition, our gross margins are low, and we expect them to continue to be low in the future. Increased competition arising from industry consolidation and low demand for certain IT products and services may hinder our ability to maintain or improve our gross margins. These low gross margins magnify the impact\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nof variations in revenue and operating costs on our operating results. In addition, our expense levels are based, in part, on anticipated net sales and the anticipated amount and timing of partner funding, and a portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed. Therefore, we may not be able to reduce spending quickly enough to compensate for any unexpected net sales shortfall, and we may not be able to reduce our operating expenses as a percentage of revenue to mitigate any further reductions in gross margins in the future. If we cannot proportionately decrease our cost structure, our business, financial condition and results of operations could suffer.\nIn addition, a reduction in the amount of credit granted to us by our partners could increase our need for and cost of working capital and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThere are risks associated with our international operations that are different than the risks associated with our operations in the United States, and our exposure to the risks of a global market could hinder our ability to maintain and expand international operations. We have operation centers in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the U.S., and the United Kingdom, as well as sales offices throughout EMEA and APAC. In the regions in which we do not currently have a physical presence, we serve our clients through strategic relationships. In implementing our international strategy, we may face barriers to entry and competition from local companies and other companies that already have established global businesses, as well as the risks generally associated with conducting business internationally. The success and profitability of international operations are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of our control, such as:\n\u2022\npolitical or economic instability;\n\u2022\nchanges in governmental regulation or taxation (foreign and domestic);\n\u2022\ncurrency exchange fluctuations;\n\u2022\nchanges in import/export laws, regulations and customs and duties (foreign and domestic);\n\u2022\ntrade restrictions (foreign and domestic);\n\u2022\ndifficulties and costs of staffing and managing operations in certain foreign countries;\n\u2022\nwork stoppages or other changes in labor conditions;\n\u2022\ntaxes and other restrictions on repatriating foreign profits back to the U.S.;\n\u2022\nextended payment terms; and\n\u2022\nseasonal reductions in business activity in some parts of the world.\nIn addition, changes in policies and/or laws of the U.S. or foreign governments resulting in, among other changes, higher taxation, tariffs or similar protectionist laws, currency conversion limitations or the nationalization of private enterprises could reduce the anticipated benefits of international operations and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have currency exposure arising from both sales and purchases denominated in foreign currencies, including intercompany transactions outside the U.S., and we currently conduct limited hedging activities. In addition, some currencies are subject to limitations on conversion into other currencies, which can limit the ability to otherwise react to rapid foreign currency devaluations. We cannot predict with precision the effect of future exchange-rate fluctuations, and significant rate fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nInternational operations also expose us to currency fluctuations as we translate the financial statements of our foreign operations to U.S. dollars.\nChanges in, interpretations of, or enforcement trends related to, tax rules and regulations may adversely affect our effective income tax rates or operating margins and we may be required to pay additional tax assessments. We conduct business globally and file income tax returns in various U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by various factors, many of which are outside of our control, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in pre-tax income in various jurisdictions in which we operate that have differing statutory tax rates;\n\u2022\nhigher corporate tax rates and the availability of deductions or credits in the U.S. and elsewhere;\n\u2022\nchanges in tax laws, regulations, and/or interpretations of such tax laws in multiple jurisdictions;\n\u2022\ntax effects related to purchase accounting for acquisitions; and\n\u2022\nresolutions of issues arising from tax examinations and any related interest or penalties.\nINSIGHT ENTERPRISES, INC.\nThe determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires estimation, judgment and complex calculations in situations where the ultimate tax determination may not be certain. Our determination of tax liabilities is always subject to review or examination by tax authorities in various jurisdictions. Any adverse outcome of such review or examination could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property adequately, and we may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims. To protect our intellectual property, we rely on copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, unpatented proprietary know-how, and patents, as well as confidentiality, invention assignment, non-solicitation and non-competition agreements. There can be no assurance that these measures will afford us sufficient protection of our intellectual property, and it is possible that third parties may copy or otherwise obtain and use our proprietary information without authorization or otherwise infringe on our intellectual property rights. The disclosure of our trade secrets could impair our competitive position and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, our registered trademarks and trade names are subject to challenge by third parties. This may affect our ability to continue using those marks and names. Likewise, many businesses are actively investing in, developing and seeking protection for intellectual property in the areas of search, indexing, e-commerce and other Web-related technologies, as well as a variety of on-line business models and methods, all of which are in addition to traditional research and development efforts for IT products and application software, and non-practicing entities continue to invest in acquiring patent portfolios for the purpose of turning the portfolios into income-generating assets, whether through licensing campaigns or litigation. As a result, disputes regarding the ownership of and the right to use these technologies are likely to arise in the future, and, from time to time, parties do assert various infringement claims against us, either because of our practices or because we resell allegedly infringing hardware or software, in the form of cease-and-desist letters, licensing inquiries, lawsuits and other communications and demands. If there is a determination that we have infringed the proprietary rights of others, we could incur substantial monetary liability, be forced to stop selling infringing products or providing infringing services, be required to enter into costly royalty or licensing agreements, if available, or be prevented from using the rights, which could force us to change our business practices or hardware, software or services offerings in the future. Additionally, as we increase the types of services provided under the Insight brand, there is a greater likelihood that we will encounter challenges to our trade names, trademarks and service marks. We may not be able to use our principal mark without modification in all geographies for all of our offerings, and these challenges may come from either governmental agencies or other market participants. These types of claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 81220, "SIC": 5045, "TIC": "NSIT"}
