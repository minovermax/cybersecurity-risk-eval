{"cik": "918541", "company": "NN INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThe following are risk factors that affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows, some of which are beyond our control. These risk factors should be considered in connection with evaluating the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If any of the events described below were to actually occur, our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected and results could differ materially from expected and historical results.\nWe may not realize all of the anticipated benefits from the six acquisitions closed since January 1, 2014 or any future strategic portfolio acquisition, or those benefits may take longer to realize than expected.\nOur ability to realize the anticipated benefits of the six acquisitions closed since January 1, 2014 will depend, to a large extent, on our ability to integrate these businesses and any future strategic portfolio acquisitions. The integration process may disrupt the businesses and, if implemented ineffectively, would preclude realization of the full benefits expected. The difficulties of combining the operations of the acquired companies include, among others:\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management\u2019s attention to integration matters;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings, synergies, business opportunities and growth prospects from combining the acquired businesses with our own;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in the integration of operations and systems;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in managing the expanded operations of a significantly larger and more complex company;\n\u2022\nchallenges in keeping existing customers and obtaining new customers; and\n\u2022\nchallenges in attracting and retaining key personnel.\nMany of these factors will be outside of our control and any one of them could result in increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and diversion of management\u2019s time and energy, which could materially impact our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nAdditionally, we incurred a significant amount of debt in connection with these six acquisitions. Finally, in relation to these acquisitions we have significantly higher amounts of intangible assets, including goodwill. These intangible assets will be subject to impairment testing and we could incur a significant impact to our financial statements in the form of an impairment if assumptions and expectations related to these five acquisitions are not realized.\nA recession impacting our end markets or the geographic regions in which we or our customers operate could have a material adverse effect on our ability to finance our operations and implement our growth strategy.\nDuring the three month period ended December 31, 2008 and the year ended December 31, 2009, we experienced a sudden and significant reduction in customer orders driven by reductions in automotive and industrial end market demand across all our businesses. Additionally, during the latter part of 2011 and all of 2012, we experienced the impacts of a European recession in our European businesses. Prior to this time, we had never been affected by a recession that had impacted both of our key geographic markets of the U.S. and Europe simultaneously. If we are impacted by a global recession in the future, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows from operations and could lead to additional restructuring and/or impairment charges being incurred and our ability to implement our growth strategy. However, we believe we would be in a much better position to weather any recession or economic downturn given the actions taken to permanently reduce our cost base including closing or ceasing operations at four former manufacturing locations.\nThe demand for our products is cyclical, which could adversely impact our revenues.\nThe end markets for fully assembled bearings and industrial and automotive components are cyclical and tend to decline in response to overall declines in industrial and automotive production. As a result, the market for the bearing components and precision metal and industrial plastic products we sell is also cyclical and impacted by overall levels of industrial and automotive production. Our sales have been, and can be in the future, negatively affected by adverse conditions in the industrial and/or automotive production sectors of the economy or by adverse global or national economic conditions generally. Additionally, any inflation in oil and any resulting increase in gasoline prices could have a negative impact on demand for our products as a result of consumer and corporate spending reductions.\nWe depend on a very limited number of foreign sources for our primary raw material and are subject to risks of shortages and price fluctuation.\nThe steel that we use to manufacture our precision bearing components is of an extremely high quality and is available from only a limited number of producers on a global basis. Due to quality constraints in the U.S. steel industry, we obtain substantially all of the steel used in our U.S. operations of our Precision Bearing Components Group from non-U.S. suppliers. In addition, we obtain most of the steel used in our European operations from a single European source. If we had to obtain steel from sources other than our current suppliers, we could face higher prices and automotive costs, increased duties or taxes and shortages of steel. Problems in obtaining steel, particularly 52100 chrome steel in the quantities that we require, on commercially reasonable terms could increase our costs, adversely impact our ability to operate our business efficiently and have a material adverse effect on our revenues and operating and financial results.\nWe depend heavily on a relatively limited number of customers, and the loss of any major customer would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nSales to various U.S. and foreign divisions of SKF, one of the largest bearing manufacturers in the world, accounted for approximately 16% of consolidated net sales in 2015. No other customers accounted for more than 10% of sales. During 2015, sales to various U.S. and foreign divisions of our ten largest customers accounted for approximately 53% of our consolidated net sales. The loss of all or a substantial portion of sales to these customers would cause us to lose a substantial portion of our revenue and would lower our operating profit margin and cash flows from operations.\nOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are highly leveraged. As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $820 million of indebtedness outstanding, and had an additional $90.9 million available for borrowing under our debt agreements. Our high degree of leverage could have important consequences, including:\n\u2022\nincreasing our vulnerability to adverse economic, industry, or competitive developments;\n\u2022\nrequiring a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, therefore reducing our ability to use our cash flows to fund operations, capital expenditures, and future business opportunities;\n\u2022\nexposing us to the risk of increased interest rates, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly;\n\u2022\nmaking it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness, and any failure to comply with the obligations of any of our debt instruments, including restrictive covenants and borrowing conditions, could result in an event of default under our debt agreements;\n\u2022\nrestricting us from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make non-strategic divestitures;\n\u2022\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, product and service development, debt service requirements, acquisitions, and general corporate or other purposes; and\n\u2022\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business or market conditions and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who are less highly leveraged and who, therefore, may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our leverage may prevent us from exploiting.\nIf any one of these events were to occur, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. For more information regarding our indebtedness, please see \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources.\u201d\nDespite our high indebtedness level, we will still be able to incur substantial additional amounts of debt, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future. Although our debt agreements contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and under certain circumstances, the amount of indebtedness that could be incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. If new debt is added to our and our subsidiaries\u2019 debt levels, the related risks that we now face would increase.\nOur debt agreements contain restrictions that will limit our flexibility in operating our business.\nOur debt agreements contain various covenants that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions. These covenants will limit our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness or issue certain preferred equity;\n\u2022\npay dividends on, repurchase, or make distributions in respect of our capital stock, prepay, redeem, or repurchase certain debt or make other restricted payments;\n\u2022\nmake certain investments;\n\u2022\ncreate certain liens;\n\u2022\nenter into agreements restricting our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to pay dividends to us;\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets; and\n\u2022\nenter into certain transactions with our affiliates.\nIn addition, the restrictive covenants in our debt agreements require us to maintain specified financial ratios and satisfy other financial condition tests. Our ability to meet those financial ratios and tests will depend on our ongoing financial and operating performance, which, in turn, will be subject to economic conditions and to financial, market, and competitive factors, many of which are beyond our control. A breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under one or more of our debt agreements, and permit our lenders to cease making loans to us under our credit facilities. Furthermore, if we were unable to repay the amounts due and\npayable under our secured debt agreements, our secured lenders could proceed against the collateral granted to them to secure our borrowings. Such actions by the lenders could also cause cross defaults under our other debt agreements.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and we may not be able to refinance our debt obligations as they mature.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on or to refinance our debt obligations depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors beyond our control. We may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness.\nAs our debt obligations mature or if our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital, or restructure or refinance our indebtedness, including the Senior Notes. Our ability to restructure or refinance our debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of our debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. The terms of our existing or future debt instruments may restrict us from adopting some of these alternatives. In addition, any failure to make payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful and may not permit us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations.\nWork stoppages or similar difficulties could significantly disrupt our operations, reduce our revenues and materially affect our earnings.\nA work stoppage at one or more of our facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows from operations. Also, if one or more of our customers were to experience a work stoppage, that customer would likely halt or limit purchases of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations or cash flows from operations.\nWe operate in and sell products to customers outside the U.S. and are subject to several risks related to doing business internationally.\nBecause we obtain a majority of our raw materials from overseas suppliers, actively participate in overseas manufacturing operations and sell to a large number of international customers, we face risks associated with the following:\n\u2022\nchanges in tariff regulations, which may make our products more costly to export or import;\n\u2022\nchanges in monetary and fiscal policies, laws and regulations, and other activities of governments, agencies and similar organizations;\n\u2022\nthe potential imposition of trade restrictions or prohibitions;\n\u2022\na U.S. federal tax code that discourages the repatriation of funds to the U.S.;\n\u2022\nthe potential imposition of import or other duties or taxes;\n\u2022\ndifficulties establishing and maintaining relationships with local original equipment manufacturers, distributors and dealers;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in staffing and managing geographically diverse operations; and\n\u2022\nunstable governments or legal systems in countries in which our suppliers, manufacturing operations, and customers are located.\nThese and other risks may also increase the relative price of our products compared to those manufactured in other countries, thereby reducing the demand for our products in the markets in which we operate, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows from operations.\nIn addition, we could be adversely affected by violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d) and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws, as well as export controls and economic sanction laws. The FCPA and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-U.S. officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Our policies mandate compliance with these laws. We operate in many parts of the world that have experienced governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. We cannot assure you that our internal controls and procedures will always protect us from the improper acts committed by our employees or agents. If we are found to be liable for FCPA, export control or sanction violations, we could suffer from criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions, including loss of export privileges or authorization needed to conduct aspects of our international business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows from operations.\nIn addition, due to the typical slower summer manufacturing season in Europe, we expect that revenues in the third fiscal quarter of each year will be lower than in the other quarters of the year.\nWe have international operations that are subject to foreign economic uncertainties and foreign currency fluctuation.\nApproximately 39% of our revenues are denominated in foreign currencies, which may result in additional risk of fluctuating currency values and exchange rates and controls on currency exchange. Changes in the value of foreign currencies could increase our U.S. dollar costs for, or reduce our U.S. dollar revenues from, our foreign operations. Any increased costs or reduced revenues as a result of foreign currency fluctuations could affect our profits. In 2015, the U.S. dollar continued to strengthen compared to the euro, which adversely affected our revenue by $39.1 million. Further strengthening of the U.S. dollar may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nEnvironmental, health and safety laws and regulations impose substantial costs and limitations on our operations; environmental compliance may be more costly than we expect, and any adverse regulatory action may materially adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign environmental, health and safety laws and regulations concerning matters such as air emissions, wastewater discharges, solid and hazardous waste handling and disposal and the investigation and remediation of contamination. The risks of substantial costs, liabilities and limitations on our operations related to compliance with these laws and regulations are an inherent part of our business, and future conditions may develop, arise or be discovered that create substantial environmental compliance or remediation liabilities and costs.\nCompliance with environmental, health and safety legislation and regulatory requirements may prove to be more limiting and costly than we anticipate. To date, we have committed significant expenditures in our efforts to achieve and maintain compliance with these requirements at our facilities, and we expect that we will continue to make significant expenditures related to such compliance in the future. From time to time, we may be subject to legal proceedings brought by private parties or governmental authorities with respect to environmental matters, including matters involving alleged noncompliance with or liability under environmental, health and safety laws, property damage or personal injury. New laws and regulations, including those which may relate to emissions of greenhouse gases, stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new clean-up requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur medical devices are subject to regulation by numerous government agencies, including the FDA and comparable agencies outside the U.S. To varying degrees, each of these agencies requires us to comply with laws and regulations governing the development, testing, manufacturing, labeling, marketing and distribution of our medical devices. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain marketing clearance for our new products or enhancements or modifications to existing products. If such approval is obtained, it may:\n\u2022\ntake a significant amount of time;\n\u2022\nrequire the expenditure of substantial resources;\n\u2022\ninvolve stringent clinical and pre-clinical testing, as well as increased post-market surveillance;\n\u2022\ninvolve modifications, repairs or replacements of our products; and\n\u2022\nresult in limitations on the proposed uses of our products.\nBoth before and after a product is commercially released, we have ongoing responsibilities under FDA regulations. We are also subject to periodic inspections by the FDA to determine compliance with the FDA\u2019s requirements, including primarily the quality system regulations and medical device reporting regulations. The results of these inspections can include inspectional observations on FDA\u2019s Form-483, warning letters, or other forms of enforcement. Since 2009, the FDA has significantly increased its oversight of companies subject to its regulations, including medical device companies, by hiring new investigators and stepping up inspections of manufacturing facilities. The FDA has recently also significantly increased the number of warning letters issued to companies. If the FDA were to conclude that we are not in compliance with applicable laws or regulations, or that any of our medical devices are ineffective or pose an unreasonable health risk, the FDA could ban such medical devices, detain or seize adulterated or misbranded medical devices, order a recall, repair, replacement or refund of such devices, refuse to grant pending pre-market approval applications or require certificates of foreign governments for exports, and/or require us to notify health professionals and others that the devices present unreasonable risks of substantial harm to the public health. The FDA may also impose operating restrictions on a company-wide basis, enjoin and/or restrain certain conduct resulting in violations of applicable law pertaining to medical devices, and assess civil or criminal penalties against our officers, employees, or us. The FDA may also recommend prosecution to the Department of Justice. Any adverse regulatory action, depending on its magnitude, may restrict us from effectively marketing and selling our products.\nForeign governmental regulations have become increasingly stringent and more common, and we may become subject to more rigorous regulation by foreign governmental authorities in the future. Penalties for a company\u2019s non-compliance with foreign governmental regulation could be severe, including revocation or suspension of a company\u2019s business license and criminal sanctions. Any domestic or foreign governmental law or regulation imposed in the future may have a material adverse effect on us.\nFailure of our products could result in a product recall.\nThe majority of our products are components of our customers\u2019 products that are used in the automotive industry and other critical industrial applications. A failure of our components could lead to a product recall. If a recall were to happen as a result of our components failing, we could bear a substantial part of the cost of correction. In addition to the cost of fixing the parts affected by the component, a recall could result in the loss of a portion of or all of the customer\u2019s business. A successful product recall claim requiring that we bear a substantial part of the cost of correction or the loss of a key customer could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows from operations.\nOur growth strategy depends in part on companies outsourcing critical components, and if outsourcing does not continue, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur growth strategy depends in part on major customers continuing to outsource components and expanding the number of components being outsourced. This requires manufacturers to depart significantly from their traditional methods of operations. If major customers do not continue to expand outsourcing efforts or determine to reduce their use of outsourcing, our ability to grow our business could be materially adversely affected.\nOur market is highly competitive, and many of our competitors have significant advantages that could adversely affect our business.\nThe global markets for precision bearing components and precision metal and plastic components are highly competitive, with a majority of production represented by the captive production operations of large manufacturers, and the balance represented by independent manufacturers. Captive manufacturers make components for internal use and for sale to third parties. All of the captive manufacturers, and many independent manufacturers, are significantly larger and have greater resources than we do. Our competitors are continuously exploring and implementing\nimprovements in technology and manufacturing processes in order to improve product quality, and our ability to remain competitive will depend, among other things, on whether we are able to keep pace with such quality improvements in a cost effective manner. Due to this competitiveness, we may not be able to increase prices for our products to cover cost increases. In many cases we face pressure from our customers to reduce prices, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows from operations. In addition, our customers may choose to purchase products from one of our competitors rather than pay the prices we seek for our products, which could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows from operations.\nOur production capacity has been expanded geographically in recent years to operate in the same markets as our customers.\nWe have expanded our precision bearing components production facilities and capacity over the last several years. Historically, precision bearing component production facilities have not always operated at full capacity. Over the past several years, we have undertaken steps to address a portion of the capacity risk including closing or ceasing operations at certain plants and downsizing employment levels at others. As such, the risk exists that our customers may exit the geographic markets in which our production capacity is located and/or develop vendors in lower cost countries in which we do not have production capacity.\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations and may decline. Among the factors that could affect our stock price are:\n\u2022\nmacro or micro-economic factors;\n\u2022\nour operating and financial performance and prospects;\n\u2022\nquarterly variations in the rate of growth of our financial indicators, such as earnings per share, net income and revenues;\n\u2022\nchanges in revenue or earnings estimates or publication of research reports by analysts;\n\u2022\nloss of any member of our senior management team;\n\u2022\nspeculation in the press or investment community;\n\u2022\nstrategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;\n\u2022\nsales of our common stock by stockholders;\n\u2022\ngeneral market conditions;\n\u2022\ndomestic and international economic, legal and regulatory factors unrelated to our performance;\n\u2022\nloss of a major customer; and\n\u2022\nthe declaration and payment of a dividend.\nThe stock markets in general have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. In addition, due to the market capitalization of our stock, our stock tends to be more volatile than large capitalization stocks that comprise the Dow Jones Industrial Average or Standard and Poor\u2019s 500 Index.\nProvisions in our charter documents and Delaware law may inhibit a takeover, which could adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as Delaware corporate law, contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change of control or changes in our management that a stockholder might consider favorable and may prevent shareholders from receiving a takeover premium for their shares. These provisions include, for example, a classified board of directors and the authorization of our board of directors to issue up to five million preferred shares without a stockholder vote. In addition, our certificate of incorporation provides that stockholders may not call a special meeting.\nWe are a Delaware corporation subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, an anti-takeover law. Generally, this statute prohibits a publicly-held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which such person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. A business combination includes a merger, asset sale or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the stockholder. We anticipate that the provisions of Section 203 may encourage parties interested in acquiring us to negotiate in advance with our board of directors, because the stockholder approval requirement would be avoided if a majority of the directors then in office approve either the business combination or the transaction that results in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder.\nThese provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some of our stockholders. If a change of control or change in management is delayed or prevented, the market price of our common stock could decline.\nWe may be unable to integrate PEP\u2019s businesses with ours successfully or realize the anticipated synergies and other benefits of the PEP Acquisition or do so within the anticipated timeframe.\nWe will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the operations and business practices of PEP with our existing operations and business practices. Potential difficulties we may encounter as part of the integration process include the following:\n\u2022\nthe inability to successfully integrate PEP in a manner that permits us to achieve the full revenue and other benefits anticipated to result from the PEP Acquisition;\n\u2022\ncomplexities associated with managing the businesses, including difficulty addressing possible differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies and the challenge of integrating complex systems, technology, networks and other assets of each of the companies in a seamless manner that minimizes any adverse impact on customers, suppliers, employees and other constituencies;\n\u2022\npotential unknown liabilities and unforeseen increased expenses or delays associated with the PEP Acquisition;\n\u2022\nthe inability to implement effective internal controls, procedures and policies for PEP as required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 within the time periods prescribed thereby;\n\u2022\nthe inability to implement effectively our new NN Operating System with respect to PEP;\n\u2022\nnegotiations concerning possible modifications to PEP contracts as a result of the PEP acquisition;\n\u2022\ndiversion of the attention of our management and the management of PEP; and\n\u2022\nthe disruption of, or the loss of momentum in, ongoing operations or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies.\nThese potential difficulties could adversely affect our and the managers of PEP\u2019s ability to maintain relationships with customers, suppliers, employees and other constituencies and the ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the PEP Acquisition, and could adversely affect our business, prospects, financial results or operations.\nWe may be unable to realize the anticipated cost or capital expenditure savings or may incur additional and/or unexpected costs in order to realize them.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to realize the anticipated cost or capital expenditure savings from the PEP Acquisition in the anticipated amounts or within the anticipated timeframes or at all. We anticipate\nimplementing a series of cost savings initiatives that we expect to result in recurring, annual run-rate cost savings. We expect to incur one-time, non-recurring costs to achieve such synergies, including certain costs during 2015 and 2016. These or any other cost or capital expenditure savings that we realize may differ materially from our estimates. We cannot provide assurances that these anticipated savings will be achieved or that our programs and improvements will be completed as anticipated or at all. In addition, any cost savings that we realize may be offset, in whole or in part, by reductions in revenues or through increases in other expenses.\nOur projections and assumptions related to cost savings are based on our current estimates, but they involve risks, uncertainties, projections and other factors that may cause actual results, performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements, express or implied. Neither our independent auditors nor any other independent auditors, have examined, compiled or performed any procedures with respect to these projections, nor have they expressed any opinion, or any other form of assurance on such information or their achievability. Assumptions relating to our projections involve subjective decisions and judgments with respect to, among other things, the estimated impact of certain operational adjustments, including Six Sigma/OpEx optimization programs, product grouping and rationalization, facility rationalization and shared services cost savings and other cost and savings adjustments, as well as future economic, competitive, industry and market conditions and future business decisions, all of which are inherently uncertain and may be beyond the control of our management.\nFailure to realize the expected costs savings and operating synergies related to the PEP Acquisition could result in increased costs and have an adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial results or operations.\nOur future results could suffer if we cannot effectively manage our expanded operations following the PEP Acquisition.\nAs a result of the PEP Acquisition, the size of our operations were significantly increased. Our future success depends, in part, upon our ability to manage the expanded operations, which will pose substantial challenges for management, including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations and associated increased costs and complexity. There can be no assurance that we will be successful or that we will realize any operating efficiencies, cost savings, revenue enhancements or other benefits currently anticipated from the PEP Acquisition.\nWe may be unable to retain key employees as a result of the PEP Acquisition.\nOur success will depend in part upon the ability to retain key former employees of PEP, as well as our key employees. Key employees may depart because of, among other things, issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with us following the PEP Acquisition. Accordingly, no assurance can be given that we will be able to retain key employees to the same extent as in the past.\nPEP operates in a different line of business from our historical business, and the PEP Acquisition is significantly larger than any other acquisition we have made to date. We may face challenges managing PEP as a new business and may not realize anticipated benefits.\nThe PEP Acquisition, our largest acquisition to date in terms of acquisition price, resulted in our being significantly engaged in lines of business of which we have little to no historical operations. Because we are entering into a new line of business, we may not have the expertise, experience and resources to pursue all of our businesses at once, or we may be unable to successfully operate the businesses. The administration of our businesses will require implementation of appropriate operations, management, compliance and financial reporting systems and controls. We may experience difficulties in effectively implementing these and other systems. PEP\u2019s management team will require the focused attention of their management team, including a significant commitment of its time and resources. The need for management to focus on these matters could have a material and adverse impact on our revenues and operating results. If PEP\u2019s operations are less profitable than we currently anticipate or if we do not have the experience, the appropriate expertise, or the resources to pursue all of our businesses, our business, prospects, financial results or operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe incurred substantial expenses related to the PEP Acquisition and expect to incur substantial expenses relating to the integration of our operations with PEP.\nWe expect to incur substantial expenses in connection with the Acquisition and the integration of our operations with PEP. There are a large number of processes, policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems that must be\nintegrated, including purchasing, accounting and finance, sales, payroll, pricing, marketing and benefits. While we have assumed that a certain level of expenses will be incurred, there are many factors beyond our control that could affect the total amount or the timing of the integration expenses. Moreover, many of the expenses that will be incurred are, by their nature, difficult to estimate accurately. These integration expenses may result in us taking significant charges against earnings following the consummation of the Acquisition, and the amount and timing of such charges are uncertain at present.", "PERMNO": 80343, "SIC": 3562, "TIC": "NNBR"}
