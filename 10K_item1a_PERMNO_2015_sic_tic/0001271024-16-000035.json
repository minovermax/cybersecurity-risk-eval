{"cik": "1271024", "company": "LINKEDIN CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-12", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nInvesting in our Class A common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes, before deciding whether to purchase shares of our Class A common stock. If any of the following risks are realized, our business, operating results and prospects could be materially and adversely affected. In that event, the price of our Class A common stock could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nOur core value of putting our members first may conflict with the short-term interests of our business.\nOne of our core values is to make decisions based on the best long-term interests of our members, which we believe is essential to our success in increasing our member growth rate and engagement, creating value for our members and in serving the best, long-term interests of the company and our stockholders. Therefore, in the past, we have forgone, and may in the future forgo, certain expansion or short-term revenue opportunities that we do not believe are in the best interests of our members, even if our decision negatively impacts our operating results in the short term. In addition, our philosophy of putting our members first may cause disagreements, or negatively impact our relationships, with our existing or prospective customers. This could result in enterprises and professional organizations blocking access to our services or refusing to purchase our Talent Solutions, Marketing Solutions or Premium Subscriptions. Our decisions may not result in the long-term benefits that we expect, in which case our member engagement, business and operating results could be harmed.\nWe may not timely and effectively scale and adapt our existing technology and network infrastructure to ensure that our services and solutions are accessible within an acceptable load time. Additionally, natural disasters or other catastrophic occurrences beyond our control could interfere with access to our services.\nA key element to our continued growth is the ability of our members, users (whom we define as anyone who visits one of our websites through a computer or application on a mobile device, regardless of whether or not they are a member), enterprises and professional organizations in all geographies to access our websites, services and solutions within acceptable load times. We call this website performance. We have experienced, and may in the future experience, service disruptions, outages and other performance problems due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors, capacity constraints due to an overwhelming number of users accessing our services simultaneously, and denial of service or fraud or security attacks. In some instances, we may not be able to identify the cause or causes of these website performance problems within an acceptable period of time. We expect it will become increasingly difficult to maintain and improve our website performance, especially during peak usage times and as our solutions become more complex and our total user traffic increases. If our services are unavailable when users attempt to access them or they do not load as quickly as users expect, users may seek other websites or services to obtain the information for which they are looking, and may not return to our website or use our services as often in the future, or at all. This would negatively impact our ability to attract members, enterprises and professional organizations and increase engagement of our members and users. We expect to continue to make significant investments to maintain and improve website performance and to enable rapid releases of new features and products. To the extent that we do not effectively address capacity constraints, upgrade our systems as needed and continually develop our technology and network architecture to accommodate actual and anticipated changes in technology, our business and operating results may be harmed.\nWe have implemented a disaster recovery program, which allows us to move production traffic to a backup data center in the event of a catastrophe. For the majority of our services, we serve traffic out of multiple data centers in parallel. This allows us the ability to move traffic immediately and, in the event of a problem, the ability to recover in a short period of time. However, some of our services have not yet migrated to this model and still operate solely in a primary data center. In the event of a disaster, these services would remain shut down during the transition to a backup data center. To the extent our disaster recovery program does not effectively support the movement of traffic in a timely or complete manner in the event of a catastrophe, our business and operating results may be harmed.\nOur systems are also vulnerable to damage or interruption from catastrophic occurrences such as earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunication failures, terrorist attacks and similar events. Our US corporate offices and certain of the facilities we lease to house our computer and telecommunications equipment are located in the San Francisco Bay Area and Southern California, both regions known for seismic activity. Despite\nany precautions we may take, the occurrence of a natural disaster or other unanticipated problems at our hosting facilities could result in lengthy interruptions in our services.\nWe do not carry business interruption insurance sufficient to compensate us for the potentially significant losses, including the potential harm to the growth of our business that may result from interruptions in our service as a result of system failures.\nIf our security measures are compromised, or if our websites are subject to attacks that degrade or deny the ability of members or customers to access our solutions, or if our member data is compromised, members and customers may curtail or stop use of our solutions.\nOur solutions involve the collection, processing, storage, sharing, disclosure and usage of members\u2019 and customers\u2019 information and communications, some of which may be private. We also work with third party vendors to process credit card payments by our customers and are subject to payment card association operating rules. We are vulnerable to software bugs, computer viruses, break-ins, phishing attacks, employee errors or malfeasance, attempts to overload our servers with denial-of-service or other attacks and similar disruptions from unauthorized use of our computer systems, any of which could lead to interruptions, delays, or website shutdowns, causing loss of critical data or the unauthorized disclosure or use of personally identifiable or confidential information. For example, in June 2012, approximately 6.5 million of our members\u2019 encrypted passwords were stolen and published on an unauthorized website. If we experience compromises to our security that result in website performance or availability problems, the complete shutdown of our websites, or the actual or perceived loss or unauthorized disclosure or use of confidential information, such as credit card information, our members or customers may be harmed or lose trust and confidence in us, and decrease the use of our website, mobile applications and services or stop using our services in their entirety, and we would suffer reputational and financial harm.\nIn addition, we may be subject to regulatory investigations or litigation in connection with a security breach or related issue, and we could also be liable to third parties for these types of breaches. Such litigation, regulatory investigations and our technical activities intended to prevent future security breaches are likely to require additional management resources and expenditures. If our security measures fail to protect this information adequately or we fail to comply with the applicable credit card association operating rules, we could be liable to both our customers for their losses, as well as the vendors under our agreements with them, we could be subject to fines and higher transaction fees, we could face regulatory action, and our customers and vendors could end their relationships with us, any of which could harm our business and financial results.\nIf our members' profiles are out-of-date, inaccurate or lack the information that users and customers want to see, we may not be able to realize the full potential of our network, which could adversely impact our business.\nIf our members do not update their information or provide accurate and complete information when they join LinkedIn, or do not establish sufficient connections, the value of our network may be negatively impacted because our value proposition as a professional network and as a source of accurate and comprehensive data will be weakened. For example, customers of our Talent Solutions may not find members that meet their qualifications or may misidentify a candidate as having such qualifications, which could result in mismatches that erode customer confidence in our solutions, or our learning and development solutions may not suit our customers' needs. Similarly, incomplete or outdated member information would diminish the ability of our Marketing or Sales Solutions customers to reach their target audiences and our ability to provide our customers with valuable insights. Therefore, we must provide features and products that demonstrate the value of our network to our members and motivate them to contribute additional, timely and accurate information to their profile and our network. If we fail to successfully motivate our members to do so, our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nIf we are unable to effectively operate on mobile devices, our business could be adversely affected.\nThe number of people who access online services through mobile devices, such as smart phones, handheld tablets and mobile telephones, as opposed to personal computers, has increased dramatically in the past few years and is projected to continue to increase. If the mobile solutions we have developed do not meet the needs of prospective members, current members or customers, they may not sign up or reduce their usage of our platform and our business could suffer. Additionally, we are dependent on the interoperability of LinkedIn with popular mobile operating systems, networks and standards that we do not control, such as Android and iOS operating systems, and any changes in such systems and terms of service that degrade our solutions\u2019 functionality, give preferential treatment to competitive products or prevent our ability to promote advertising could adversely affect traffic and monetization on mobile devices. We may not be successful in maintaining and developing relationships with key\nparticipants in the mobile industry or in developing products that operate effectively with these technologies, systems, networks, or standards. Each manufacturer or distributor may establish unique technical standards for its devices, and our products and services may not work, or be easily accessible or viewable on these devices as a result. Some manufacturers may also elect not to include our products on their devices, or we may have difficulty preparing or loading our applications in app stores. As new devices and platforms are continually being released, it is difficult to predict the challenges we may encounter in developing versions of our solutions for use on these alternative devices, and we are devoting significant resources to the support and maintenance of such devices.\nGrowth in access to LinkedIn\u2019s services through mobile devices as a substitute for access on personal computers may negatively affect our revenue and financial results.\nOur members are increasingly accessing LinkedIn on mobile devices. While many of our members who use our online services on mobile devices also access LinkedIn through personal computers, we have seen substantial growth in mobile usage. We are devoting valuable resources to solutions related to monetization of mobile usage, and cannot assure you that these solutions will be successful. Our members are increasingly using mobile devices as a substitute for access to our online services as opposed to personal computers, and if we are unable to successfully implement monetization strategies for our solutions on mobile devices, or these strategies are not as successful as our offerings for personal computers, or if we incur excessive expenses in this effort, our financial performance and ability to grow revenue would be negatively affected.\nThe tracking of certain of our performance metrics is done with internal tools and is not independently verified. Certain of our performance metrics are subject to inherent challenges in measurement, and real or perceived inaccuracies in such metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business.\nWe track certain performance metrics, including number of registered members, unique visiting members and member page views, with internal tools, which are not independently verified by any third party. Our internal tools have a number of limitations and our methodologies for tracking these metrics may change over time, which could result in unexpected changes to our metrics, including the metrics we report. If the internal tools we use to track these metrics undercount or overcount performance or contain algorithm or other technical errors, the data we report may not be accurate. In addition, limitations or errors with respect to how we measure data (or the data that we measure) may affect our understanding of certain details of our business, which could affect our longer term strategies. If our performance metrics are not accurate representations of our business, member base or traffic levels; if we discover material inaccuracies in our metrics; or if the metrics we rely on to track our performance do not provide an accurate measurement of our business, our reputation may be harmed and our operating and financial results could be adversely affected, causing our stock price to decline.\nThe number of our registered members is higher than the number of actual members and a substantial majority of our traffic is generated by a minority of our members. Our business may be adversely impacted if we are unable to attract and retain additional members who actively use our services.\nThe number of registered members in our network is higher than the number of actual members because some members have multiple registrations, other members have died or become incapacitated, and others may have registered under fictitious names or created fraudulent accounts. While the number of registered members represents what we believe to be reasonable estimates of our member base, there are inherent challenges in ensuring that the number of registered members presents an accurate reflection of our member network. For example, we do not have a reliable system for identifying and counting duplicate or fraudulent accounts, or deceased, incapacitated or other non-members and so we rely on estimates and assumptions, which may not be accurate. In addition, our methodology for measuring our membership numbers, and specifically for making estimates regarding non-members who should not be included as registered members, has changed over time and may continue to change from time to time. While we are using what we believe to be reasonable and appropriate methods of measuring the number of registered members, there are no methodologies available that would provide us with an exact number of non-actual member types of accounts. Therefore, we cannot assure you that our current or future methodologies are accurate, and we will need to continue to adjust them in the future from time to time, which could result in the number of registered members being lower or higher than expected. Further, a substantial majority of our members do not visit our websites on a monthly basis, and a substantial majority of our desktop and mobile traffic is generated by a minority of our members. If the number of our actual members does not meet our expectations, if the rate at which we add new members slows or declines or if we are unable to increase the breadth and frequency of our visiting members, then our business may not grow as fast as we expect.\nOur solutions and internal systems rely on software that is highly technical, and if it contains undetected errors, our business could be adversely affected.\nOur solutions and internal systems rely on software that is highly technical and complex. In addition, our solutions and internal systems depend on the ability of our software to store, retrieve, process, and manage immense amounts of data. Our software has contained, and may now or in the future contain, undetected errors, bugs, or vulnerabilities. Some errors in our software may only be discovered after the code has been released for external or internal use. Errors or other design defects within our software may result in a negative experience for members or customers, delay product introductions or enhancements, or result in measurement or other errors. We also rely on third party software that may contain errors or bugs. Any errors, bugs, or defects discovered in our software or third party software we use could result in damage to our reputation, loss of members, loss of revenue, or liability for damages, any of which could adversely affect our business and financial results.\nWe collect, process, store, share, disclose and use personal information and other data, which subjects us to governmental regulations and other legal obligations related to privacy and security, and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could harm our business.\nWe collect, process, store, share, disclose and use information from and about our members, customers and users, including personal information and other data, and we enable our members to passively and proactively share their personal information with each other and with third parties and to communicate and share news and other information into and across our platform. There are numerous laws around the world regarding privacy and security, including laws regarding the collection, processing, storage, sharing, disclosure, use and security of personal information and other data from and about our members and users. The scope of these laws is changing, subject to differing interpretations, may be costly to comply with, and may be inconsistent among countries and jurisdictions or conflict with other rules.\nWe strive to comply with applicable laws, policies, and legal obligations and certain applicable industry codes of conduct (such as the Digital Advertising Alliance's self-regulatory principles for online behavioral advertising) relating to privacy and data protection and are subject to the terms of our privacy policies and privacy-related obligations to third parties. However, these obligations may be interpreted and applied in new ways and/or in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or our practices. Data privacy and security are active areas and new laws and regulations are likely to be enacted.\nAny failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our privacy policies, our privacy-related obligations to members, customers or other third parties, our data disclosure and consent obligations, or our privacy or security-related legal obligations, or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized disclosure, transfer or use of personal or other information, which may include personally identifiable information or other member data, may result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation or public statements critical of us by consumer advocacy groups or others and could cause our members and customers to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our business. Additionally, if third parties we work with, such as customers, vendors or developers, violate applicable laws, our policies or other privacy or security-related obligations, such violations may also put our members\u2019 information at risk and could in turn have an adverse effect on our business. Governmental agencies may also request or take member or customer data for national security or informational purposes, and also can make data requests in connection with criminal or civil investigations or other matters, which could harm our reputation and our business.\nIn addition, the EU-US Safe Harbor program (\u201cSafe Harbor\u201d), which provided a valid legal basis for transfers of personal data from Europe to the United States, was recently held to be invalid, which has a significant impact on the transfer of data from the European Union to US companies, including us. While we have other legally recognized mechanisms in place that we believe allow for the transfer of EU member and customer and employee information to the United States, it is possible that these mechanisms may also be challenged or evolve to include new legal requirements that could have an impact on how we move data from the European Union to LinkedIn entities outside the European Union. Recently, the United States and the European Union agreed in principle upon the Privacy Shield as a potential replacement for the Safe Harbor, but it has not yet been finalized, published or interpreted. The Privacy Shield may add significant requirements that could impact our business and result in substantial expense to implement, and it is unclear that it will be appropriate for us. In response to these regulatory changes, we may have to require some of our vendors who process personal data to take on additional privacy and security obligations, and some may refuse, causing us to incur potential disruption and expense related to our business processes. If our policies and practices, or those of our vendors, are, or are perceived to be, insufficient or if our members and customers have concerns regarding the transfer of data from the European Union to the United\nStates, we could be subject to enforcement actions or investigations by individual EU Data Protection Authorities or lawsuits by private parties, member engagement could decline and our business could be negatively impacted.\nPublic scrutiny of Internet privacy and security issues may result in increased regulation and different industry standards, which could deter or prevent us from providing our current products and solutions to our members and customers, thereby harming our business.\nThe regulatory framework for privacy and security issues worldwide is evolving and is likely to remain in flux for the foreseeable future. Various government and consumer agencies have also called for new regulation and changes in industry practices. Practices regarding the registration, collection, processing, storage, sharing, disclosure, use and security of personal and other information by companies offering online services have recently come under increased public scrutiny.\nFor example, the European Union is anticipated to enact a new General Data Protection Regulation, which will likely become effective in 2018. The General Data Protection Regulation is expected to result in significantly greater compliance burdens for companies with users and operations in the European Union and to provide for considerable fines of up to 4% of global annual revenues for noncompliance. The European Union is also considering an update to the EU\u2019s Privacy and Electronic Communications (e-Privacy) Directive to, among other things, amend the current directive\u2019s rules on the use of cookies.\nIn the United States, the federal government, including the White House, the Federal Trade Commission, the Department of Commerce and Congress, and many state governments are reviewing the need for greater regulation of the collection, processing, storage, sharing, disclosure, use and security of information concerning consumer behavior with respect to online services, including regulations aimed at restricting certain targeted advertising practices and collection and use of data from mobile devices. This review may result in new laws or the promulgation of new regulations or guidelines. For example, the State of California and other states have passed laws relating to disclosure of companies\u2019 practices with regard to Do-Not-Track signals from Internet browsers, the ability to delete information of minors, and new data breach notification requirements. California has also adopted privacy guidelines with respect to mobile applications. Outside the European Union and the United States, a number of countries have adopted or are considering privacy laws and regulations that may result in significant greater compliance burdens.\nIn addition, government agencies and regulators have reviewed, are reviewing and will continue to review, the personal data practices of online media companies including our privacy and security policies and practices. The FTC in particular has approved consent decrees resolving complaints and their resulting investigations into the privacy and security practices of a number of online social media companies. These reviews can and have resulted in changes to our products and policies, and could result in additional changes in the future. If we are unable to comply with any such reviews or decrees that result in recommendations or binding changes, or if the recommended changes result in degradation of our products, our business could be harmed.\nOur business, including our ability to operate and expand internationally or on new technology platforms, could be adversely affected if legislation or regulations are adopted, interpreted or implemented in a manner that is inconsistent with our current business practices and that require changes to these practices, the design of our websites, mobile applications, products, features or our privacy policy. In particular, the success of our business has been, and we expect will continue to be, driven by our ability to responsibly use data about our members. Therefore, our business could be harmed by any significant change to applicable laws, regulations or industry standards or practices regarding the storage, use or disclosure of data our members choose to share with us, or regarding the manner in which the express or implied consent of consumers for such use and disclosure is obtained. Such changes may require us to modify our products and features, possibly in a material manner, and may limit our ability to develop new products and features that make use of the data that we collect about our members.\nOur business is subject to a variety of US and foreign laws, many of which are unsettled and still developing and which could subject us to claims or otherwise harm our business.\nWe are subject to a variety of laws in the United States and abroad, including laws regarding privacy, data protection, data security, data retention and consumer protection, accessibility, sending electronic messages, human resource services and the provision of online payment services, including credit card processing, which are continuously evolving and developing. In addition, some of our members are subject to laws and/or licensing or certification obligations that may restrict their ability to engage with LinkedIn\u2019s online services. The scope and interpretation of the laws and other obligations that are or may be applicable to us or certain groups of our members\nare often uncertain and may be conflicting, particularly laws and other obligations outside the United States. For example, laws related to the online dissemination of content of others and laws related to sending messages over online service are continuing to evolve and are being tested pursuant to actions based on, among other things, invasion of privacy, defamation, spam, and other torts, unfair competition, copyright and trademark infringement, credit reporting and other theories based on the nature and content of the materials and messages sent or provided by others.\nIn addition, regulatory authorities around the world are considering a number of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning privacy, spam, data storage, data protection, content regulation, cybersecurity, government access to personal information and other matters that may be applicable to our business. Compliance with these laws may require substantial investment or may provide technical challenges for our business. It is also likely that as our business grows, evolves, and an increasing portion of our business shifts to mobile, and our solutions are used in a greater number of countries and additional groups, we will become subject to laws and regulations in additional jurisdictions. Further, as our services and solutions expand to include more content (including from third parties), additional laws and regulations may become applicable to our products and offerings including laws requiring us to restrict the availability of such content on a geographical basis or to certain groups of members. In some cases, laws and legal obligations of various jurisdictions may be ambiguous or conflict as to LinkedIn\u2019s right to display and distribute certain content as part of its online services. Users of our site and our solutions could also abuse or misuse our products in ways that violate laws. It is difficult to predict how existing laws will be applied to our business and the new laws and legal obligations to which we may become subject.\nIf we are not able to comply with these laws or other legal obligations or if we (or our members) become liable under these laws or legal obligations, or if our services are suspended or blocked, we could be directly harmed, and we may be forced to implement new measures to reduce exposure to this liability. This may require us to expend substantial resources or to discontinue certain solutions, which would negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the increased attention focused upon liability issues as a result of lawsuits and legislative proposals could harm our reputation or otherwise impact the growth of our business. Any costs incurred as a result of this potential liability could harm our business and operating results.\nWe face competition in the market for online professional networks from social networking sites and Internet search companies, among others, as well as continued competition for customers.\nWe face significant competition in all aspects of our business, and we expect such competition to increase, particularly in the market for online professional networks and engagement of professionals.\nOur industry is evolving rapidly and is becoming increasingly competitive. Larger and more established companies may focus on our market and could directly compete with us. Smaller companies, including application developers, could also launch new products and services that compete with us and that could gain market acceptance quickly. We may also face competition if we shift our focus of development to new or different products or separate areas of our business.\nWe expect our existing competitors in the markets for Talent Solutions, Marketing Solutions and Premium Subscriptions (including Sales Solutions) to continue to focus on these areas. A number of these companies may have greater resources than us, which may enable them to compete more effectively. Specifically, we are investing significantly in our Marketing Solutions products with respect to content and mobile solutions, and we may not be as successful as our competitors in generating revenue through new forms of content marketing or mobile advertising. Additionally, users of social networks may choose to use, or increase their use of, those networks for professional purposes, which may result in those users decreasing or eliminating their use of LinkedIn. Companies that currently focus on social networking could also expand their focus to professionals. We and other companies have historically established alliances and relationships with some of these companies to allow broader exposure to users and access to data on the Internet. We may also, in the future, establish alliances or relationships with other competitors or potential competitors. To the extent companies terminate such relationships and establish alliances and relationships with others, our business could be harmed. Additionally, other companies that provide content for professionals could develop more compelling offerings than ours. This could impact the engagement of our members, and could also compete with our Premium Subscriptions and adversely impact our ability to sell and renew subscriptions to our members. Specifically, we compete for members, enterprises and professional organizations as discussed below.\nMembers-professional networks. The space for online professional networks is rapidly evolving. Other companies such as Facebook, Google, Microsoft and Twitter are developing or could develop solutions that compete with ours. Further, some of these companies are partnering with third parties to offer products and\nservices that could compete with ours. Additionally, we face competition from a number of companies outside the United States that provide online professional networking solutions. We also compete against smaller companies that focus on groups of professionals within a specific industry or vertical. Our competitors may announce new products, services or enhancements that better address changing industry standards or the needs of members and customers, such as mobile access or different market focus. Any such increased competition could cause pricing pressure, loss of business or decreased member activity, any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results. Internet search engines could also change their methodologies in ways that adversely affect our ability to optimize our page rankings within their search results.\nEnterprises and professional organizations-Talent Solutions. With respect to our Talent Solutions, we compete with online recruiting companies, talent management companies and larger companies that are focusing on talent management and human resource services, job boards, traditional recruiting firms, and companies that provide learning and development products and services. Additionally, other companies, including newcomers to the recruiting or learning and development industries, may partner with Internet companies, including social networking companies, to provide services that compete with our solutions, either on their own or as third party applications. If the efficiency and usefulness of our products to enterprises and professional organizations do not exceed those provided by competitors, we will not be able to compete successfully.\nEnterprises and professional organizations-Marketing Solutions. With respect to our Marketing Solutions, we compete with online and offline outlets that generate revenue from advertisers and marketers. To the extent competitors are better able to provide customers with cost-effective access to attractive demographics, either through new business models or increased user volume, we may not be successful in retaining our existing advertisers or attracting new advertisers, and our business would be harmed.\nEnterprises and professional organizations-Premium Subscriptions/Sales Solutions. With respect to our Premium Subscriptions and Sales Solutions, we compete with online and offline companies for customers with lead generation and customer intelligence and insights. Our Sales Solutions product is in the early stages, and we may not be able to compete effectively in this area.\nIf we do not continue to attract new customers, or if existing customers do not renew their subscriptions, renew on less favorable terms, or fail to purchase additional solutions, we may not achieve our revenue projections, and our operating results would be harmed.\nIn order to grow our business, we must continually attract new customers, sell additional solutions to existing customers and reduce the level of non-renewals in our business. Our ability to do so depends in large part on the success of our sales and marketing efforts. We do not typically enter into long-term contracts with our customers, and even when we do, they can generally terminate their relationship with us. We may not accurately predict future trends with respect to rates of customer renewals, upgrades and expansions. Furthermore, the nature of our products and solutions is such that customers may decide to terminate or not renew their agreements with us without causing significant disruptions to their own businesses.\nWe must demonstrate that our Talent Solutions are important recruiting and learning and development tools for enterprises, professional organizations, and individuals and that our Marketing and Sales Solutions provide them with access to an audience of one of the most influential, affluent and highly educated audiences on the Internet. However, potential customers may not be familiar with our solutions or may prefer other or more traditional products and services for their talent, advertising and marketing needs.\nOur customer base and our customers\u2019 renewal rates may decline or fluctuate because of several factors, including the prices of our solutions, the prices of products and services offered by our competitors, reduced hiring by our customers or reductions in their talent or marketing spending levels due to macroeconomic or other factors and the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of our solutions. If we do not attract new customers or if our customers do not renew their agreements for our solutions, renew on less favorable terms, or do not purchase additional functionality or offerings, our revenue may grow more slowly than expected or decline.\nUltimately, attracting new customers and retaining existing customers requires that we continue to provide high quality solutions that our customers value. In particular, our Talent Solutions customers will discontinue their purchases of our solutions if we fail to effectively connect them with the talent they seek or provide learning and development opportunities that they are looking for, and our premium subscribers will discontinue their subscriptions if they do not find the networking and business opportunities that they value. Similarly, customers of our Marketing Solutions will not continue to do business with us if their advertisements do not reach their intended audiences. Therefore we must continue to demonstrate to our customers that using our Marketing Solutions is the\nmost effective and cost-efficient way to maximize their results. Even if our Marketing Solutions are providing value to our customers, advertisers are sensitive to general economic downturns and reductions in consumer spending, among other events and trends, which generally results in reduced advertising expenditures and could adversely affect sales of our Marketing Solutions. In addition, we have recently expanded our Marketing Solutions products to include off-network advertising. This product area will complement our current offerings primarily sold on our wholly owned properties, and we may not be successful or our customers or members may not be receptive to these products. Finally, for our Sales Solutions products, we may not be able to retain existing customers or attract new customers if we fail to provide high quality solutions, if customers are unable to realize the value our solutions, or if we are not able to measure and demonstrate the value that our solutions provide.\nWe expect our operating results to fluctuate on a quarterly and annual basis, which may result in a decline in our stock price if such fluctuations result in a failure to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors.\nOur revenue and operating results have in the past and could in the future vary significantly from quarter-to-quarter and year-to-year and may fail to match our past performance, our projections or the expectations of securities analysts because of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. Any of these events could cause the market price of our Class A common stock to fluctuate. Factors that may contribute to the variability of our operating results include:\n\u2022\nour ability to create value for our members as well as increase the size of our member base;\n\u2022\nengagement of our members and customers;\n\u2022\nour commitment to putting our members first even if it means forgoing short-term revenue opportunities;\n\u2022\nshifts in the way members and users access our websites and services from personal computers to mobile devices;\n\u2022\ndisruptions or outages in the availability of our websites or services, actual or perceived breaches of privacy, and compromises of our member data;\n\u2022\nchanges in our pricing policies or those of our competitors;\n\u2022\nour ability to increase sales of our products and solutions to new customers and expand sales of additional products and solutions to our existing customers;\n\u2022\nthe size and seasonal variability of our customers\u2019 recruiting, marketing and sales budgets;\n\u2022\nthe extent to which existing customers renew their agreements with us and the timing and terms of those renewals;\n\u2022\ngeneral industry and macroeconomic conditions, in particular, deterioration in labor markets, which would adversely impact sales of our Talent Solutions, or economic growth that does not lead to job growth, for instance increases in productivity;\n\u2022\nthe cost of investing in our technology infrastructure, product initiatives, facilities and international expansion may be greater than we anticipate;\n\u2022\nour needs related to facilities may change over time and vary from our original forecasts, and the value of the property that we lease or own may fluctuate;\n\u2022\nexpenses related to hiring, incentivizing and retaining employees;\n\u2022\nthe timing and costs of expanding our field sales organization and delays or inability in achieving expected productivity;\n\u2022\nthe timing of certain expenditures, including hiring of employees and capital expenditures;\n\u2022\nthe entrance of new competitors in our market whether by established companies or the entrance of new companies;\n\u2022\ncurrency exchange rate fluctuations;\n\u2022\nour ability to integrate acquisitions and realize the expected benefit of such acquisitions in a timely manner or at all; and\n\u2022\nchanging tax laws and regulations.\nOur historical operating results may not be indicative of our future operating results. We believe our rapid growth has masked the cyclicality and seasonality of our business. As our revenue growth rate has slowed, the cyclicality and seasonality in our business has become more pronounced, and we expect that to continue. This has, and will, cause our operating results to fluctuate. In addition, global economic concerns continue to create uncertainty and unpredictability and add risk to our future outlook. Sovereign debt issues and economic uncertainty in the United States, Europe and around the world raise concerns in markets important to our business. An economic downturn in any particular region in which we do business or globally could result in reductions in sales of our products, decreased renewals of existing arrangements and other adverse effects that could harm our operating results.\nWe expect our revenue growth rate to decline, and, as our costs increase, we may not be able to generate sufficient revenue to sustain profitability over the long term.\nFrom 2010 to 2015, our annual net revenue grew from $243.1 million to $2,990.9 million, which represents a compounded annual growth rate of approximately 65.2%. As our net revenue has increased, our revenue growth rate has slowed, and we expect that it will continue to decline over time. We also expect that the growth rates of each of our primary product lines will fluctuate and that these product lines may not grow at the same rate. In recent years, and continuing in 2016, our philosophy has been to invest for future growth. We expect to continue to expend substantial financial and other resources on:\n\u2022\nour technology infrastructure, including architecture, development tools scalability, availability, performance and security, as well as disaster recovery measures;\n\u2022\nproduct development, including investments in our product development team and the development of new features for both members and customers;\n\u2022\nsales and marketing, including a significant expansion of our field sales organization;\n\u2022\ninternational expansion in an effort to increase our member base, member activity and sales;\n\u2022\ngeneral administration, including legal and accounting expenses related to our expanding global presence and the integration of newly acquired businesses; and\n\u2022\ncapital expenditures, including facilities and build-out of our data centers.\nThese investments may not result in increased revenue or business growth, or increased network growth or member value, and will increase our expenses. Even if our revenue continues to increase, we expect that due to increased expenses, in particular, stock-based compensation, depreciation and amortization and provision for income taxes, we may incur a US GAAP loss during future periods. If we fail to continue to grow our revenue and overall business, our operating results and business would be harmed.\nIf we fail to effectively manage our growth, our business and operating results could be harmed.\nWe continue to experience rapid growth in our headcount and operations, which will continue to place significant demands on our management and our operational and financial infrastructure. As of December 31, 2015, approximately 35% of our employees had been with us for less than one year and approximately 59% for less than two years. As we continue to grow, we must effectively integrate, develop and motivate a large number of new employees in various countries around the world, and we must maintain the beneficial aspects of our corporate culture. We intend to continue to make substantial investments to expand our engineering, research and development, field sales, and general and administrative organizations, and our international operations. To attract top talent, we have had to offer, and believe we will need to continue to offer, highly competitive compensation packages before we can validate the productivity of those employees. In addition, fluctuations in the price of our Class A common stock may make it more difficult or costly to use equity compensation to motivate, incentivize and retain our employees. We face significant competition for talent from other Internet and high-growth companies, which include both publicly traded and privately-held companies. The risks of over-hiring (especially given overall macroeconomic risks) or over-compensating employees and the challenges of integrating a rapidly growing employee base into our corporate culture are exacerbated by our international expansion. Additionally, because of our growth, we have significantly expanded our operating lease and purchase commitments, which have increased our expenses. We may not be able to hire new employees quickly enough to meet our needs. If we fail to effectively manage our hiring needs and successfully integrate our new hires, our efficiency and ability to meet our forecasts and our employee morale, productivity and retention could suffer, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nAdditionally, if we do not effectively manage the growth of our business and operations, the quality of our solutions could suffer, which could negatively affect our brand, operating results and overall business. Further, we have made changes in the past, and will make changes in the future, to our features, products and services that our members or customers may not like, find useful or agree with. We may also decide to discontinue certain features, products or services, or charge for certain features, products or services that are currently free or increase fees for any of our features, products or services. If members or customers are unhappy with these changes, they may decrease their engagement on our site, or stop using features, products or services or the site generally. In addition, they may choose to take other types of action against us such as organizing petitions or boycotts focused on our company, our website or any of our services, filing claims with the government or other regulatory bodies, or filing lawsuits against us. Any of these actions could negatively impact our member growth and engagement and our brand, which would harm our business. To effectively manage this growth, we will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls, and our reporting systems and procedures by, among other things:\n\u2022\nimproving our information technology infrastructure to maintain the effectiveness of our solutions;\n\u2022\nenhancing information and communication systems to ensure that our employees and offices around the world are well-coordinated and can effectively communicate with each other and our growing base of members, enterprises and professional organizations;\n\u2022\nenhancing our internal controls to ensure timely and accurate reporting of all of our operations; and\n\u2022\nappropriately documenting our information technology systems and our business processes.\nThese systems enhancements and improvements will require significant capital expenditures and allocation of valuable management and employee resources. If we fail to implement these improvements effectively, our ability to manage our expected growth and comply with the rules and regulations that are applicable to publicly reporting companies will be impaired.\nWe depend on world class talent to grow and operate our business, and if we are unable to hire, retain and motivate our personnel, we may not be able to grow effectively.\nOur future success will depend upon our continued ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate and retain world class talent. Our ability to execute efficiently is dependent upon contributions from all of our employees, in particular our senior management team. Key institutional knowledge remains with a small group of long-term employees whom we may not be able to retain. We may not be able to retain the services of any of our long-term employees or other members of senior management in the future. We do not have employment agreements other than offer letters with any of our key employees, and we do not maintain key person life insurance for any employee. In addition, from time to time, there may be changes in our senior management team that may be disruptive to our business. If our senior management team, including any new hires that we may make, fails to work together effectively and to execute our plans and strategies on a timely basis, our business could be harmed.\nOur growth strategy also depends on our ability to expand and retain our organization with world class talent. Identifying, recruiting, training and integrating qualified individuals will require significant time, expense and attention. In addition to hiring new employees, we must continue to focus on retaining our best talent. Competition for these resources, particularly for engineers, is intense, and competition for the facilities to house our employees is also intense, specifically in the San Francisco Bay Area, where our headquarters is located. We may need to invest significant amounts of cash and equity for new and existing employees and we may never realize returns on these investments, and we also are investing heavily in our facilities. If we are not able to effectively increase and retain our talent, our ability to achieve our strategic objectives will be adversely impacted, and our business will be harmed.\nOur international operations account for a significant portion of our revenue and are subject to increased challenges and risks.\nWe have offices around the world and our websites and mobile applications are available in numerous languages. For the year ended December 31, 2015, international revenue represented 38% of our total revenue. We expect to continue to expand our international operations in the future by opening offices in different countries and expanding our offerings in new languages. Our ability to manage our business and conduct our operations internationally, including in emerging markets, requires considerable management attention and resources and is subject to the particular challenges of supporting a rapidly growing business in an environment of multiple languages, cultures, customs, legal systems, alternative dispute resolution systems, regulatory systems and commercial infrastructures. International expansion has required and will continue to require us to invest significant funds and other resources. Operating internationally subjects us to new risks and may increase risks that we currently face, including risks associated with:\n\u2022\nrecruiting and retaining talented and capable employees in foreign countries, and maintaining our company culture across all of our offices;\n\u2022\nproviding solutions across a significant distance, in different languages, in competitive market environments and among different cultures, including modifying, or in some cases building entirely new services, solutions and features to ensure that they are culturally relevant in different countries and conforming to local laws and regulations, which may include modifying or blocking content in certain jurisdictions if it is deemed objectionable or unlawful;\n\u2022\nincreased competition from local websites and services that provide online professional networking solutions, online recruitment services and learning and development products, which may benefit from first-mover advantages. These competitors have expanded and may continue to expand their geographic footprint;\n\u2022\ndiffering and potentially lower levels of member growth and activity in new and nascent geographies;\n\u2022\ncompliance with applicable foreign laws and regulations, which may change or conflict with each other, require us to take on additional compliance obligations and practices as well as the potential risk of penalties to individual members of management if our practices are deemed to be out of compliance;\n\u2022\nlonger payment cycles in some countries;\n\u2022\ncredit risk and higher levels of payment fraud;\n\u2022\nstringent local labor laws and regulations;\n\u2022\nlaws and regulations that favor local competitors or prohibit or limit foreign ownership of businesses;\n\u2022\nlegal regimes where the application of laws and regulations is subject to greater uncertainty, as well as higher risk of corruption, fraud and unethical business practices, and compliance with anti-bribery laws;\n\u2022\nimplementing and maintaining effective internal processes and controls;\n\u2022\ncompliance with various economic and trade sanctions regulations which restrict certain conduct of business;\n\u2022\ncurrency exchange rate fluctuations and controls;\n\u2022\npolitical or social unrest, or, economic instability in some countries;\n\u2022\nlaws and proposed legislation relating to data localization in various countries, which may restrict our ability to do business in new and existing markets;\n\u2022\ndouble taxation of our non-US earnings and potentially adverse tax consequences due to changes in the tax laws of the United States or the foreign jurisdictions in which we operate; and\n\u2022\nhigher costs of doing business internationally.\nIf our revenue from our international operations, and particularly from our operations in the countries and regions on which we have focused our spending, do not exceed the expense of establishing and maintaining these operations, our business and operating results will suffer. In addition, as our member base expands internationally, members in certain geographies may have lower levels of activity with our websites and services.\nFinally, in late 2013, we established a joint venture to expand our operations in the People\u2019s Republic of China (\"PRC\"), which is in its early stages. Although we believe this joint venture and our activities in the PRC comply with existing laws, they involve unique risks, and the PRC is actively considering changes in its foreign investment rules that could impact this structure and our activities. There are substantial uncertainties regarding the interpretation of PRC laws and regulations, and it is possible that the government will ultimately take a view contrary to ours. We may be unable to continue to operate in the PRC if we or our affiliates are unable to access sufficient funding or enforce contractual relationships with respect to management and control of such business. In addition, the PRC\u2019s laws and regulations, as they apply to our business operations in Mainland China, have resulted in modifications to our products and services in Mainland China. For example, the PRC government has laws and regulations that govern the dissemination of content over the Internet, and it may enact additional laws or regulations in the future related to content, privacy, security and government access to personal information in a way that may materially impact our ability to conduct operations in the PRC. Failure to comply with these requirements may mean that we will not obtain or retain necessary licenses to operate all or some of our services in Mainland China, or result in the blocking of our services in Mainland China. In addition, our compliance with these rules could harm our business, reputation and brand outside of China. We will need to allocate significant resources to developing our presence in China, and we may not be successful in doing so.\nOur business depends on a strong and trusted brand, and any failure to maintain, protect and enhance our brand would hurt our ability to retain or expand our base of members, enterprises and professional organizations, our ability to increase their level of engagement and our ability to attract and retain high level employees.\nWe have developed a strong and trusted brand that we believe has contributed significantly to the success of our member network and business. Our brand is predicated on the idea that individual professionals will trust us and find immense value in building and maintaining their professional identities and reputations on our platform, as well as investing in their professional learning and knowledge. Maintaining, protecting and enhancing the \u201cLinkedIn\u201d brand and our other key brands is critical to expanding our base of members, enterprises, advertisers, corporate customers and other partners, and increasing their engagement with our services, and will depend largely on our ability to maintain member trust, be a technology leader and continue to provide valuable and high-quality solutions, which we may not do successfully. Despite our efforts to protect our brands and prevent misuse, if others misuse our brands or pass themselves off as being endorsed or affiliated with us, it could harm our reputation and our business could suffer. If our members or potential members determine that they can use other platforms, such as social networks, for the same purposes as or as a replacement for our network, or if they choose to blend their professional and social networking activities, our brand and our business could be harmed. Our members or\ncustomers could find that new products or features that we introduce are difficult to use or may feel that they degrade their experience with online service offered by LinkedIn, which could harm our reputation for delivering high-quality products. Our brand is also important in attracting and maintaining high performing employees. If we do not successfully maintain a strong and trusted brand, our business could be harmed.\nWe may not be able to halt the operations of online services that aggregate our data as well as data from other companies, including social networks, or copycat online services that have misappropriated our data in the past or may misappropriate our data in the future. These activities could harm our brand and our business.\nFrom time to time, third parties have accessed data from our networks through scraping, robots or other means and used this data or aggregated this data on their online services with other data. In addition, \u201ccopycat\u201d online services have misappropriated data on our network and attempted to imitate our brand or the functionality of our services, and these services or others could use similar tactics to develop products that compete with ours. These activities could degrade our brand, negatively impact our website performance and harm our business. When we have become aware of such online services, in many instances we have employed contractual, technological or legal measures in an attempt to halt unauthorized activities, but these measures may not be successful. In addition, if our customers do not comply with our terms of service, they also may be able to abuse our products and services and provide access to our solutions to unauthorized users. However, we may not be able to detect any or all of these types of activities in a timely manner and, even if we could, technological and legal measures may be insufficient to stop their operations. In some cases, particularly in the case of online services operating from outside of the United States, our available legal remedies may not be adequate to protect our business against such activities. Regardless of whether we can successfully enforce our rights against these parties, any measures that we may take could require us to expend significant financial or other resources.\nFailure to protect or enforce our intellectual property rights could harm our business and operating results.\nWe regard the protection of our trade secrets, copyrights, trademarks, trade dress, databases, domain names and patents as critical to our success. We strive to protect our intellectual property rights by relying on federal, state and common law rights and other rights provided under foreign laws. These laws are subject to change at any time and could further restrict our ability to protect our intellectual property rights. In addition, the existing laws of certain foreign countries in which we operate may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States. We also have a practice of entering into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and often enter into confidentiality agreements with parties with whom we conduct business in order to limit access to, and disclosure and use of, our proprietary information. In addition, from time to time we make our intellectual property rights available to others under license agreements. However, these contractual arrangements and the other steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights may not prevent the misappropriation of our proprietary information, infringement of our intellectual property rights or deter independent development of similar or competing technologies by others and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of such misappropriation or infringement.\nObtaining and maintaining effective intellectual property rights is expensive, including the costs of defending our rights. We are seeking to protect our trademarks and patents, and other intellectual property rights in a number of jurisdictions, a process that is expensive and may not be successful in all jurisdictions for every such right. Even where we have such rights, they may later be found to be unenforceable or have a limited scope of enforceability. In addition, we may not seek to pursue such protection in every location. In particular, we believe it is important to maintain, protect and enhance our brands. Accordingly, we pursue the registration of domain names and our trademarks and service marks in the United States and in many locations outside the United States. We have already and may, over time, increase our investment in protecting innovations through investments in patents and similar rights, and this process is expensive and time-consuming.\nLitigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our proprietary rights or determine the validity and scope of proprietary rights claimed by others. Any litigation of this nature, regardless of outcome or merit, could result in substantial costs and diversion of management and technical resources, any of which could adversely affect our business and operating results. We may also incur significant costs in enforcing our trademarks against those who attempt to imitate our \u201cLinkedIn\u201d brand and other valuable trademarks and service marks.\nIn addition, we have chosen to make certain of our technology available under open source licenses that allow others to use the technology without payment to us. While we hope to benefit from these activities by having access\nto others\u2019 useful technology under open source licenses, there is no assurance that we will receive the business benefits we expect.\nIf we fail to maintain, protect and enhance our intellectual property rights, our business and operating results may be harmed, and the market price of our Class A common stock could decline.\nWe are, and expect in the future to be, subject to legal proceedings and litigation, including intellectual property and privacy disputes, which are costly to defend and could materially harm our business and operating results.\nWe are party to lawsuits and legal proceedings in the normal course of business. These matters are often expensive and disruptive to normal business operations. We are currently facing, or may face in the future, allegations, lawsuits and regulatory inquiries, audits and investigations regarding data privacy, security, labor and employment, consumer protection, the Fair Credit Reporting Act and intellectual property infringement, including claims related to privacy, patents, publicity, trademarks, copyrights and other rights. We may also face allegations or litigation related to our acquisitions, securities issuances or our business practices, including public disclosures about our business. Litigation and regulatory proceedings, and particularly the patent infringement and class action matters we are facing or may face, may be protracted and expensive, and the results are difficult to predict. Certain of these matters include speculative claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts of damages, and include claims for injunctive relief. Additionally, our litigation costs can be significant. Adverse outcomes with respect to litigation or any of these legal proceedings may result in significant settlement costs or judgments, penalties and fines, or require us to modify our products and features or require us to stop offering certain features, all of which could negatively impact our membership and revenue growth. Additionally, we are subject to periodic audits, which would likely increase our regulatory compliance costs, and may require us to change our business practices, which could negatively impact our revenue growth. Managing legal proceedings, litigation and audits, even if we achieve favorable outcomes, is time-consuming and diverts management\u2019s attention from our business.\nIn addition, we use open source software in our solutions and plan to continue to use open source software in the future. The terms of many open source licenses have not been interpreted by United States or other courts, and these licenses could be construed in a manner that imposes unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products. We may face claims from others claiming ownership of open source software or patents related to that software, or breach of open source license terms, including a demand for release of material portions of our source code or otherwise seeking to enforce the terms of the applicable open source license. These claims could also result in litigation, which could be costly to defend, require us to purchase a costly license, require us to establish additional specific open source compliance procedures, or require us to devote additional research and development resources to remove open source elements from or otherwise change our solutions, any of which would have a negative effect on our business and operating results. In addition, if we were to combine our own software with open source software in a certain manner, we could, under certain open source licenses, be required to release the source code of some software that would be valuable to keep as a trade secret and/or not make available for use by others which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nThe results of regulatory proceedings, litigation, claims and audits cannot be predicted with certainty, and determining reserves for pending litigation and other legal, regulatory and audit matters requires significant judgment. There can be no assurance that our expectations will prove correct, and even if these matters are not resolved in our favor or without significant cash settlements, these matters, and the time and resources necessary to litigate or, resolve them, could harm our business, our operating results, our reputation or the market price of our Class A common stock.\nBecause we recognize most of the revenue from our Talent Solutions and our Premium Subscriptions over the term of the agreement, a significant downturn in these businesses may not be immediately reflected in our operating results.\nWe recognize most of the revenue from sales of our Talent Solutions and Premium Subscriptions (which include Sales Solutions) over the terms of the agreements, which is typically 12 months. As a result, a significant portion of the revenue we report in each quarter is generated from agreements entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed agreements in any one quarter may not significantly impact our revenue in that quarter but will negatively affect our revenue in future quarters. In addition, we may be unable to adjust our fixed costs in response to reduced revenue. Accordingly, the effect of significant declines in the sales of these offerings may not be reflected in our short-term results of operations.\nThe effectiveness of our Marketing Solutions depends in part on our relationships with advertising serving technology companies and the continued use of display advertising.\nWe do and will rely, in part, on advertising serving technology companies to deliver our Marketing Solutions product. We may not be successful in entering into agreements on advantageous terms, our existing agreements with these companies may not be extended or renewed after their respective expirations, or we may not be able to extend or renew our agreements on terms and conditions favorable to us. If these agreements are terminated, we may not be able to enter into agreements with alternative companies on acceptable terms or on a timely basis or both, which could negatively impact revenue from our Marketing Solutions. In addition, the use of display advertising is declining and we face challenges coping with ad blocking technologies that have been developed and are likely to continue to be developed that can block the display of advertisements.\nEnterprises or professional organizations, including governmental agencies, may restrict access to our services, which could lead to the loss or slowing of growth in our member base or the level of member engagement.\nOur solutions depend on the ability of our members to access the Internet and our services. Enterprises or professional organizations, including governmental agencies, could block or restrict access to our online services, website or the Internet generally for a number of reasons such as security or confidentiality concerns or regulatory reasons, or they may adopt policies that prohibit listing the employers\u2019 names on the employees\u2019 LinkedIn profiles in order to minimize the risk that employees will be contacted and hired by other employers.\nIn some cases, certain governments may seek to restrict the Internet or our service providers\u2019 websites, services and solutions and the performance of our websites, services and solutions could be suspended, blocked (in whole or part) or otherwise adversely impacted in these jurisdictions. For example, the government of the People\u2019s Republic of China has blocked access to many social networking and other sites (including ours for a brief period), and certain self-regulatory organizations have policies that could result in access to our content, services or features being blocked. Any restrictions on the use of our services by our members and users could lead to the loss or slowing of growth in our member base or the level of member engagement.\nIf Internet search engines\u2019 methodologies are modified or our search result page rankings decline for other reasons, our member and non-member engagement could decline.\nWe depend in part on various Internet search engines to direct a significant amount of traffic to our website. Similarly, we depend on providers of mobile application \u201cstore fronts\u201d to allow users to locate and download our mobile applications that enable our service. Our ability to maintain the number of visitors directed to our website and users of our online services is not entirely within our control. Our competitors\u2019 search engine optimization, or SEO, efforts may result in their websites receiving a higher search result page ranking than ours, or Internet search engines could revise their methodologies in an attempt to improve their search results, which could adversely affect the placement of our search result page ranking. If search engine companies modify their search algorithms in ways that are detrimental to our new user growth or in ways that make it harder for our members to use our website, or if our competitors\u2019 SEO efforts are more successful than ours, overall growth in our member base could slow, member and non-member engagement could decrease, and we could lose existing members. These modifications may be prompted by search engine companies entering the online professional networking market or aligning with competitors. Our website has experienced fluctuations in search result rankings in the past, and we anticipate similar fluctuations in the future. Any reduction in the number of users directed to our websites would harm our business and operating results.\nOur business depends on continued and unimpeded access to the Internet and mobile networks by us and our members on personal computers and mobile devices. If government regulations relating to the Internet or mobile networks or other areas of our business change, if Internet access providers are able to block, degrade, or charge for access to certain of our products and services, or if third parties disrupt access to the Internet, we could incur additional expenses and the loss of members and customers.\nOur products and services depend on the ability of our members and customers to access our online services through their personal computers and mobile devices. Currently, this access is provided by companies that have significant market power in the broadband and Internet access marketplace, including incumbent telephone companies, cable companies, mobile communications companies, and government-owned service providers, any of whom could take actions that degrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of user access to our products or solutions, which would, in turn, negatively impact our business. In addition, Internet or network access could be disrupted by\nother third parties. Further, the adoption of any laws or regulations that adversely affect the growth, popularity or use of the Internet and mobile networks, including laws limiting Internet neutrality, could decrease the demand for our subscription service or the usage of our services and increase our cost of doing business.\nOur growth depends in part on the success of our strategic relationships with third parties.\nWe anticipate that we will continue to depend on relationships with various third parties, including access to platforms and content providers and distributors to grow our business, authors who provide content (including learning and development material), and channel partners. Identifying, negotiating and maintaining relationships with third parties require significant time and resources, as does integrating third-party content and technology. Our agreements with technology and content providers and similar third parties are typically non-exclusive and do not prohibit them from working with our competitors or from offering competing services. In some cases, in particular, with respect to content providers, these relationships are undocumented, or, if there are agreements in place, they may be easily terminable. Our competitors may be effective in providing incentives to these parties to favor their solutions or may prevent us from developing strategic relationships with these parties. These third parties may decide that working with LinkedIn is not in their interest. In addition, these third parties may not perform as expected under our agreements with them, and we have had, and may in the future have, disagreements or disputes with these parties, which could negatively affect our brand and reputation. It is possible that these third parties may not be able to devote the resources we expect to the relationship or they may terminate their relationships with us. Further, as users increasingly access our services through mobile devices, we are becoming more dependent on the distribution of our mobile applications through third parties, and we may not be able to access their application program interfaces or be able to distribute our applications or provide ease of integration, and this may also impact our ability to monetize our mobile products. If we are unsuccessful in establishing or maintaining our relationships with third parties, our ability to compete in the marketplace or to grow our business could be impaired, and our operating results would suffer. Even if we are successful, these relationships may not result in improved operating results.\nIf currency exchange rates fluctuate substantially in the future, the results of our operations, which are reported in US dollars, could be adversely affected.\nAs we continue to expand our international operations, we become more exposed to the effects of fluctuations in currency exchange rates. We incur expenses for employee compensation and other operating expenses at our non-US locations in the local currency, and accept payment from customers in currencies other than the US dollar. Since we conduct business in currencies other than US dollars but report our financial results in US dollars, we face exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Consequently, exchange rate fluctuations between the US dollar and other currencies could have a material impact on our profitability, and because we recognize revenue over time, exchange rate fluctuations at one point in time may have a negative impact in future quarters. Although we hedge a portion of our foreign currency exposure, significant fluctuations in exchange rates between the US dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our net income (loss). Additionally, hedging programs rely on our ability to forecast accurately and could expose us to additional risks that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe intended tax efficiency of our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements depend on the interpretation and application of the tax laws of various jurisdictions and on how we operate our business, and changes to our effective tax rate could adversely impact our results.\nOur corporate structure and intercompany arrangements, including the manner in which we develop and use our intellectual property and the transfer pricing of our intercompany transactions, are intended to optimize business efficiency as well as reduce our worldwide effective tax rate. The application of the tax laws of various jurisdictions, including the United States and the other jurisdictions in which we operate, to our international business activities is subject to interpretation and depends on our ability to operate our business in a manner consistent with our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements. The taxing authorities of the jurisdictions in which we operate may challenge our methodologies for valuing developed technology or for transfer pricing on intercompany arrangements. In particular, our non-US headquarters is located in Dublin, Ireland, but tax authorities in other jurisdictions where we operate may make a determination that the manner in which we operate results in our business not achieving the intended tax consequences. This could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations. Our effective tax rate could be adversely affected by several other factors, many of which are outside of our control, such as: increases in expenses that are not deductible for tax purposes, the tax effects of restructuring charges or purchase accounting for acquisitions, increases in withholding taxes, changes related to our ability to ultimately realize future benefits attributed to our deferred tax\nassets, including those related to other-than-temporary impairment, and a change in our decision to indefinitely reinvest foreign earnings. Further, we are currently undergoing review and audit by both domestic and foreign tax authorities and expect such actions to continue in the future. Any adverse outcome of such a review or audit could have a negative effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nThe enactment of legislation implementing changes in the US taxation of international business activities, the adoption of other tax reform policies or changes in tax legislation or policies in jurisdictions outside the United States could materially impact our financial position and results of operations.\nPossible future changes to US tax laws, including limitations on the ability of taxpayers to claim and utilize foreign tax credits and the deferral of certain tax deductions until earnings outside of the United States are repatriated to the United States, as well as changes to US tax laws that may be enacted in the future, could impact the tax treatment of our foreign earnings and adversely impact our effective tax rate. Due to the large and expanding scale of our international business activities, any changes in the US or international taxation of such activities may increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations.\nThe tax authorities in Ireland have announced changes to the treatment of non-resident Irish entities, commonly used in a \u201cdouble Irish\u201d structure. The changes will impact newly created Irish entities immediately but are not expected to impact existing non-resident Irish entities, such as ours, until after December 31, 2020. These changes may adversely impact our effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations. The United Kingdom has also recently enacted new tax legislation, and Australia has proposed new tax legislation, on diverted profits which may ultimately impact our foreign tax liability and negatively impact our effective tax rate and results of operations.\nAdditionally, the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development recently released final guidance covering various topics, including addressing the \u201ctax challenges of the digital economy,\u201d country-by-country reporting, and definitional changes to permanent establishment, which could ultimately impact our tax liabilities to foreign jurisdictions and treatment of our foreign earnings from a US perspective which may adversely impact our effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations.\nWe may require additional capital to support business growth, and this capital might not be available on acceptable terms, if at all.\nWe intend to continue to make investments to support our business growth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges, including the need to develop new features and products or enhance our existing solutions, improve our operating infrastructure or acquire complementary businesses and technologies. Accordingly, we have engaged and may continue to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. If we raise additional funds through future issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our Class A common stock. Any debt financing we secure in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. We may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly impaired, and our business may be harmed.\nAcquisitions and investments could result in operating difficulties, dilution, and other harmful consequences that may adversely impact our business and results of operations.\nWe have made and will continue to make acquisitions to add employees, complementary companies, products, technologies or revenue. These transactions could be material to our financial condition and results of operations. We also expect to continue to evaluate and enter into discussions regarding a wide array of potential strategic transactions. The identification of suitable acquisition candidates can be difficult, time-consuming and costly, and we may not be able to complete acquisitions on favorable terms, if at all. The process of integrating an acquired company, business, or technology has created, and will continue to create, unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. The areas where we face risks include:\n\u2022\nloss of key employees of the acquired company and other challenges associated with integrating new employees into our culture, as well as reputational harm if integration is not successful;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management time and focus from operating our business to acquisition integration challenges;\n\u2022\nimplementation or remediation of controls, procedures, and policies at the acquired company;\n\u2022\nintegration of the acquired company\u2019s accounting, human resource, and other administrative systems, and coordination of product, engineering, and sales and marketing function;\n\u2022\nassumption of contractual obligations that contain terms that are not beneficial to us, require us to license or waive intellectual property rights or increase our risk for liability;\n\u2022\nfailure to successfully further develop the acquired technology;\n\u2022\ndifficulty of transitioning the acquired technology onto our existing platforms and maintaining the security standards for such technology consistent with our other services;\n\u2022\nfailure to successfully onboard customers or maintain brand quality of acquired companies;\n\u2022\nliability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including patent and trademark infringement claims, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities, and other known and unknown liabilities;\n\u2022\nfailure to generate the expected financial results related to an acquisition on a timely manner or at all; and\n\u2022\nfailure to accurately forecast the impact of an acquisition transaction.\nThese risks or other problems encountered in connection with our acquisitions and investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions or investments, incur unanticipated liabilities, and adversely affect our business generally.\nFuture acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, amortization expenses, or write-offs of goodwill, any of which could harm our financial condition. In addition, any acquisitions we announce could be viewed negatively by users, marketers, developers or investors.\nRisks Related to Our Class A Common Stock\nThe dual class structure of our common stock as contained in our charter documents has the effect of concentrating voting control with those stockholders who held our stock prior to our initial public offering, including our founders and our executive officers, employees and directors and their affiliates, and limiting our other stockholders\u2019 ability to influence corporate matters.\nOur Class B common stock has 10 votes per share, and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. Stockholders who hold shares of our Class B common stock, including our founders, and our executive officers, employees and directors and their affiliates, together held approximately 57.2% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock as of December 31, 2015. Our co-founder and Chair, Reid Hoffman, held approximately 11.0% of the outstanding shares of our Class A and Class B common stock, representing approximately 53.2% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock as of December 31, 2015. Mr. Hoffman has significant influence over the management and affairs of the company and over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or its assets. Mr. Hoffman will continue to have significant influence over these matters in the future.\nIn addition, the holders of our Class B common stock collectively will continue to be able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval even though their stock holdings represent less than 50% of the outstanding shares of our common stock. Because of the 10-to-1 voting ratio between our Class B and Class A common stock, the holders of our Class B common stock collectively will continue to control a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock even when the shares of Class B common stock represent as little as 10% of the combined voting power of all outstanding shares of our Class A and Class B common stock. This concentrated control will limit the ability of our Class A stockholders to influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future, and, as a result, the market price of our Class A common stock could be adversely affected.\nIf Mr. Hoffman continues to retain a significant portion of his holdings of Class B common stock for an extended period of time, he could continue to control a majority of the combined voting power of our Class A and Class B common stock. As a board member, Mr. Hoffman owes a fiduciary duty to our stockholders and must act in good faith in a manner he reasonably believes to be in the best interests of our stockholders. As a stockholder, even a controlling stockholder, Mr. Hoffman is entitled to vote his shares in his own interests, which may not always be in the interests of our stockholders generally.\nOur stock price has been volatile in the past and may be subject to volatility in the future.\nThe trading price of our Class A common stock has been volatile historically, and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. During 2015, the closing price of our Class A common stock ranged from $169.94 to $270.76, and during 2016 to date, the closing price has been as low as $100.98. Fluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us or in valuation metrics, such as our price to earnings ratio, could impact our stock price. Additionally, the stock markets have at times experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and might in the future affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. These fluctuations have, in some cases, been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. Further, the trading prices of publicly traded shares of companies in our industry have been particularly volatile and may be very volatile in the future. These broad market and industry fluctuations, as well as general economic, political and market conditions such as recessions, interest rate changes, international currency fluctuations or political unrest, may negatively impact the market price of our Class A common stock. In addition, our stock price may fluctuate based on whether our performance or guidance as to our future performance meets the expectations of our investors or securities analysts. Volatility in our stock price also impacts the value of our equity compensation, which affects our ability to recruit and retain employees. We may incur additional cash expense in connection with recruiting and retention costs, and we may also experience increased dilution because of the need to provide more equity as part of our overall compensation packages. In addition, some companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We may be the target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could harm our business.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us more difficult, limit attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management and limit the market price of our Class A common stock.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws include provisions that:\n\u2022\nauthorize our board of directors to issue, without further action by the stockholders, up to 100,000,000 shares of undesignated preferred stock;\n\u2022\nrequire that any action to be taken by our stockholders be effected at a duly called annual or special meeting and not by written consent;\n\u2022\nspecify that special meetings of our stockholders can be called only by our board of directors, the Chair of our board of directors, or our Chief Executive Officer;\n\u2022\nestablish an advance notice procedure for stockholder proposals to be brought before an annual meeting, including proposed nominations of persons for election to our board of directors;\n\u2022\nestablish that our board of directors is divided into three classes, Class I, Class II and Class III, with each class serving three-year staggered terms;\n\u2022\nprohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n\u2022\nprovide that our directors may be removed only for cause;\n\u2022\nprovide that vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by a majority of directors then in office, even though less than a quorum;\n\u2022\nrequire the approval of our board of directors or the holders of a supermajority of our outstanding shares of capital stock to amend our bylaws and certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation; and\n\u2022\nreflect two classes of common stock, as discussed above.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, which is responsible for appointing the members of our management. Provisions in the indenture related to our convertible debt may also deter or prevent a business combination. In addition, institutional shareholder representative groups, shareholder activists and others may disagree with our corporate governance provisions or other practices, including our dual class structure and the other anti-takeover provisions, such as those listed above. We generally will consider recommendations of institutional shareholder representative groups, but we will make decisions based on what our board and management believe to be in the best long term interests of our company and stockholders. Our dual class structure concentrates the voting power of our stock in a small group of stockholders who would have the ability to control the outcome of a stockholder vote. Additionally, these groups could make\nrecommendations to our stockholders against our practices or our board members if they disagree with our positions. Finally, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which generally prohibits a Delaware corporation from engaging in any of a broad range of business combinations with any \u201cinterested\u201d stockholder for a period of three years following the date on which the stockholder became an \u201cinterested\u201d stockholder.\nIf securities or industry analysts publish reports that are interpreted negatively by the investment community or publish negative research reports about our business, our share price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock depends, to some extent, on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. We do not have any control over these analysts or the information contained in their reports. If one or more analysts publish research reports that are interpreted negatively by the investment community, or have a negative tone regarding our business, financial or operating performance, industry or end-markets, our share price could decline. In addition, if a majority of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which could cause our share price or trading volume to decline.\nWe do not intend to pay dividends for the foreseeable future.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not intend to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. We anticipate that we will retain all of our future earnings for use in the development of our business and for general corporate purposes. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors. Accordingly, investors must rely on sales of their Class A common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investments.\nRisks Related to our Convertible Notes\nServicing our convertible notes may require a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow or the ability to raise the funds necessary to satisfy our obligations under the convertible notes, and our future debt may contain limitations on our ability to pay cash upon conversion or repurchase of the convertible notes.\nIn November 2014, we issued approximately $1.3 billion aggregate principal amount of 0.50% convertible senior notes due 2019 (the \"Notes\"). As of December 31, 2015, we had a total par value of approximately $1.3 billion of outstanding Notes. Holders of the Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change before the relevant maturity date, in each case at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the fundamental change repurchase date. In addition, upon conversion of the Notes, unless we elect to deliver solely shares of our common stock to settle such conversion (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional shares), we will be required to make cash payments in respect of the Notes being converted. Moreover, we will be required to repay the Notes in cash at their maturity, unless earlier converted or repurchased.\nOur ability to make cash payments in connection with conversions of the Notes or repurchase the Notes in the event of a fundamental change will depend on market conditions and our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. We also may not use the cash raised through the issuance of the Notes in an optimally productive and profitable manner. At the time we are required to make repurchases of the Notes being surrendered or converted at their maturity, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing to refinance the Notes on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Our level of indebtedness could adversely affect our future operations by increasing our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic and industry conditions by limiting or prohibiting our ability to obtain additional financing for future capital expenditures, acquisitions and general corporate and other purposes. If we are unable to make cash payments upon conversion of the Notes we would be required to issue significant amounts of our Class A common stock, which would be dilutive to existing stockholders. In addition, if we do not have sufficient cash to repurchase the Notes following a fundamental change, we would be in default under the terms of the Notes, which could seriously harm our business. The terms of the Notes do not limit the amount of future indebtedness we may incur and if we incur significantly more debt, this could intensify the risks described above.\nThe conditional conversion feature of the Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nIn the event the conditional conversion feature of the Notes is triggered, holders of notes will be entitled to convert the notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their Notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nNote hedge and warrant transactions we have entered into may affect the value of the Notes and our common stock.\nConcurrently with the issuance of the Notes, we entered into note hedge transactions with certain financial institutions, which we refer to as the \u201coption counterparties.\u201d The note hedge transactions are expected to reduce the potential dilution upon any conversion of the Notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of converted Notes, as the case may be. We also entered into warrant transactions with the option counterparties. However, the warrant transactions could separately have a dilutive effect to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds $381.82.\nIn connection with establishing their initial hedge of the note hedge and warrant transactions, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates have purchased shares of our common stock and/or entered into various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock following the pricing of the Notes. In addition, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives contracts with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the Notes (and are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of Notes or following any repurchase of Notes by us on any fundamental change repurchase date or otherwise). This activity could cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock or the Notes.\nIn addition, if any such convertible note hedge and warrant transactions fail to become effective, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates may unwind their hedge positions with respect to our common stock, which could adversely affect the value of our common stock and the value of the Notes.\nWe are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the note hedge transactions.\nThe option counterparties are financial institutions or affiliates of financial institutions, and we will be subject to the risk that these option counterparties may default under the note hedge transactions. Our exposure to the credit risk of the option counterparties will not be secured by any collateral. If one or more of the option counterparties to one or more of our note hedge transactions becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings with a claim equal to our exposure at the time under those transactions. Our exposure will depend on many factors but, generally, the increase in our exposure will be correlated to the increase in the market price of our common stock and in the volatility of the market price of our common stock. In addition, upon a default by one of the option counterparties, we may suffer adverse tax consequences and dilution with respect to our common stock. We can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of any of the option counterparties.", "PERMNO": 12742, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "LNKD"}
