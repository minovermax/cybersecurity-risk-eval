You should carefully read the following risk factors, together with the financial statements, related notes and other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our business, financial condition and operating results may suffer if any of the following risks are realized. If any of these risks or uncertainties occur, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you might lose all or part of your investment. There may be additional risks of which we are not presently aware or that we currently believe are immaterial that could have an adverse impact on our business. This Annual Report on Form 10-K contains forward-looking statements that contain risks and uncertainties. Please refer to the discussion of \u201cforward-looking statements\u201d on page four of this Annual Report on Form 10-K in connection with your consideration of the risk factors and other important factors that may affect future results described below.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nA significant or prolonged economic downturn or a decline in the demand for marketing materials, could adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.\nOur results of operations are affected directly by the level of business activity of our clients, which in turn is affected by the level of economic activity and cyclicality in the industries and markets that they serve. Certain of our products are sold to industries, including the advertising, retail, consumer products, housing, financial and pharmaceutical industries, that experience significant fluctuations in demand based on general economic conditions, cyclicality and other factors beyond our control. Economic uncertainty or an economic downturn could result in a reduction of the marketing budgets of our clients or a decrease in the volume of marketing materials that our clients order from us. Reduced demand from one of these industries or markets could negatively affect our revenue, operating income and profitability.\nOur results could be negatively impacted by a global or regional epidemic or similar event.\nWe operate in approximately 50 countries, including China, Italy, Spain, France and Germany. In aggregate, revenue from outside of the United States represented 30% of our company\u2019s total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2019. For some of the products and services we sell, including branded merchandise, retail displays and luxury packaging, we have historically sourced many of our goods from manufacturers and other suppliers in China. As a result, an epidemic or similar event in any location where we, our suppliers, or our clients operate, could result in serious harm to our business and operating results if it depresses demand for marketing materials or results in major disruptions or delays in our supply chain. Following the early 2020 outbreak of COVID-19 coronavirus, many of our suppliers in China temporarily halted manufacturing, and have only recently restarted production. The recent spread of COVID-19 in the United States, our largest market, has also raised concerns about a possible recession, and created substantial uncertainty about the expectations for marketing spend in the near term. In addition, for some products and services we sell, including retail displays and warehouse and logistics services, our ability to complete orders and earn revenues depends in part on the physical performance of services by our personnel at a specific location, such as a client retail location or one of our warehouses. Due to temporary travel restrictions imposed by various countries in Europe and elsewhere, including the Czech Republic where our retail displays business is based, we may face delays in our ability to complete retail display installations for some clients. Moreover, we have historically relied on in-person selling efforts by our sales executives to secure long-term client contracts. In the short-term, precautionary measures taken by many companies around the world to limit in-person workplace contact in order to reduce the potential for employee exposure to COVID-19 could extend the time required to secure new client contracts. If our business is materially affected by the recent outbreak of the COVID-19 coronavirus, or by similar widespread outbreaks of contagious disease in the future, it could have a material adverse impact on our operating results or financial condition.\nCompetition could substantially impair our business and our operating results.\nWe compete with companies in the manufacturing of marketing related products, including printed materials, in-store displays, packaging materials, graphics art and digital imaging and fulfillment and logistics. Competition in these industries is intense. Our primary competitors are manufacturers that employ traditional methods of marketing and selling their marketing materials. Some of these manufacturers have larger client bases and significantly more resources than we do. Buyers may prefer to utilize the traditional services offered by the manufacturers with whom we compete. Alternatively, some of these manufacturers may elect to offer outsourced print procurement services or enterprise software applications and their well-established client relationships, industry knowledge, brand recognition, financial and marketing capabilities, technical resources and pricing flexibility may provide them with a competitive advantage over us.\nWe also compete with a number of management firms and brokers. Several of these competitors offer outsourced procurement services or enterprise software applications for the marketing industry. These competitors or new competitors that enter the market may also offer procurement services similar to and competitive with, or superior to, our current or proposed offerings and may achieve greater market acceptance. In addition, a software solution and database similar to our proprietary technology could be created over time by a competitor with sufficient financial resources and comparable industry experience. If our competitors are successful in selling and providing comparable services, we could lose clients and our market share could decline.\nOur competitors may also establish cooperative relationships to increase their ability to address client needs. Increased competition may lead to revenue reductions, reduced gross margins or a loss of market share, any one of which could harm our business and our operating results.\nIf our services do not achieve widespread commercial acceptance, our business will suffer.\nMost companies currently coordinate the procurement and management of their marketing materials with their own employees using a combination of telephone, e-mail, their own technology platforms and the Internet. Growth in the demand for our services depends on the adoption of our outsourcing model for marketing related procurement services. We may not be able to persuade prospective clients to change their traditional procurement processes. Our business could suffer if our services are not accepted or are not perceived by the marketplace to be effective or valuable.\nIf our suppliers do not meet our needs or expectations or those of our clients, our business would suffer.\nThe success of our business depends to a large extent on our relationships with our clients and our reputation for high quality marketing materials and marketing execution services. We do not own manufacturing equipment. Instead, we rely on third-party suppliers to deliver the products and services that we provide to our clients. If our suppliers do not meet our needs or expectations or those of our clients, our professional reputation may be damaged, our business would be harmed and we could be subject to legal liability.\nA significant portion of our revenue is derived from a relatively limited number of large clients and any loss or decrease in sales to these clients could harm our results of operations.\nA significant portion of our revenue is derived from a relatively limited number of large clients. Revenue from our top ten clients accounted for 26%, 27%, and 28% of our revenue during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. Our largest client accounted for 5%, 5%, and 5% of our revenue in 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. We cannot guarantee that we will maintain or improve our relationships with these clients or that we will continue to provide services to these clients at historical levels. In the future, there may be a loss or reduction in business from one or more of our large clients. The loss or significant reduction of business from our major clients would adversely affect our results of operations.\nAdditionally, in general, we take full title and risk of loss for the products we procure from our suppliers. Our obligation to pay our suppliers is not contingent upon receipt of payment from our clients. If any of our key clients fails to pay for our services, our profitability would be negatively impacted.\nWe may face difficulties operating profitably in countries in which we have limited operating experience.\nAggregate revenue from outside of the United States represented 30%, 32%, and 31% of total revenue for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. We expect our global footprint to continue evolving, which may involve expanding into countries other than those in which we currently operate or increasing our operations in countries where we currently have limited operations and resources. Our business outside of the United States is subject to various risks, including:\n\u2022\nchanges in economic and political conditions;\n\u2022\nchanges in and compliance with international and domestic laws and regulations, including anti-corruption laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the U.K. Anti-Bribery Act and data privacy laws such as the European Union General Data Protection Regulation;\n\u2022\nwars, civil unrest, acts of terrorism and other conflicts;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters, pandemics and health crises (such as the recent coronavirus outbreak);\n\u2022\ncompliance with and changes in tariffs, trade restrictions, trade agreements and taxation;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in managing or overseeing foreign operations;\n\u2022\nlimitations on the repatriation of funds because of foreign exchange controls;\n\u2022\npolitical and economic corruption;\n\u2022\nless developed and less predictable legal systems than those in the United States; and\n\u2022\nintellectual property laws of countries which do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States.\nThe occurrence or consequences of any of these factors may lead to significant legal or compliance expenses and may restrict our ability to operate in the affected region or result in the loss of clients in the affected region or other regions, which could adversely affect our revenue, operating income and profitability.\nAs we expand our business in foreign countries, we will become exposed to increased risk of loss from foreign currency fluctuations and exchange controls, particularly the strengthening of the U.S. dollar against major currencies, as well as longer accounts receivable payment cycles. We have limited control over these risks and if we do not correctly anticipate changes in international economic and political conditions, we may not alter our business practices in time to avoid adverse effects.\nChanges in the United Kingdom's economic and other relationships with the European Union could adversely affect us.\nOn January 31, 2020, the United Kingdom formally withdrew from the European Union. Pursuant to the Withdrawal Agreement Bill, the United Kingdom will remain in the European Union's free market and customs union until December 31, 2020. On January 1, 2021, the United Kingdom will withdraw from the free market and customs union, and trade between the European Union and the United Kingdom will be subject to border controls. During the transition, the parties will negotiate a free trade agreement to manage future trade in goods and services. However, it is possible that an agreement will not be reached within the transition period, and there remains significant uncertainty about the terms of the future trade relationship between the European Union and the United Kingdom. We conduct a portion of our business in both the United Kingdom and the European Union. In 2019, we generated 8.2% of our revenue in the United Kingdom and 8.7% in other countries within the European Union. Our supply chain depends on the free flow of goods in those regions. The ongoing uncertainty and likely re-imposition of border controls and customs duties on trade between the United Kingdom and European Union nations could negatively impact our competitive position, supplier and customer relationships and financial performance. The ultimate effects of the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union on us will depend on the specific terms of any agreement the United Kingdom and the European Union reach to provide access to each other\u2019s respective markets.\nChanges in U.S. administrative policy, including changes to existing trade agreements and any resulting changes in international relations, could adversely affect our financial performance and supply chain economics.\nAs a result of changes to U.S. administrative policy, among other possible changes, there may be (i) changes to existing trade agreements; (ii) greater restrictions on free trade generally; and (iii) significant increases in tariffs on goods imported into the United States, particularly those manufactured in China, Mexico and Canada. China is currently a leading global source of promotional marketing products, such as branded merchandise and barware, sold in the United States, and Canada supplies a substantial percentage of the pulp and paper used by the U.S. printing industry. In January 2020, the United States signed the \"Phase 1\" trade agreement with China, effective in February 2020, which created a temporary tariff truce with China. The United States, Mexico and Canada signed the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (\"USMCA\"), the successor agreement to the North American Free Trade Agreement (\"NAFTA\"). The USMCA has been ratified by Mexico and the United States, but Canada has not yet done so.\nIt remains unclear what the U.S. administration or foreign governments, including China, will or will not do with respect to tariffs, NAFTA, USMCA or other international trade agreements and policies. A trade war, other governmental action related to tariffs or international trade agreements, changes in U.S. social, political, regulatory and economic conditions or in laws and policies governing foreign trade, manufacturing, development and investment in the territories and countries where we currently do business or any resulting negative sentiments towards the United States could adversely affect our supply chain economics, consolidated revenue, earnings and cash flow.\nWe are subject to taxation related risks in multiple jurisdictions.\nWe are a U.S.-based multinational company subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our global provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets or liabilities and in evaluating our tax positions on a worldwide basis. While we believe our tax positions are consistent with the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business, it is possible that these positions may be overturned by jurisdictional tax authorities, which may have a significant impact on our global provision for income taxes. Tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied. We are also subject to ongoing tax audits. These audits can involve complex issues, which may require an extended period of time to resolve and can be highly subjective. Tax authorities may disagree with certain tax reporting positions taken by us and, as a result, assess additional taxes against us. We regularly assess the likely outcomes of these audits in order to determine the appropriateness of our tax provision.\nIn addition, governmental tax authorities are increasingly scrutinizing the tax positions of companies. Many countries in the European Union, as well as a number of other countries and organizations such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, are actively considering changes to existing tax laws that, if enacted, could increase our tax obligations in countries where we do business. The impact of tax reform in the U.S. or other foreign tax law changes could result in an overall tax rate increase to our business.\nIf we are unable to retain and expand the number of our sales executives or if a significant number of our sales executives leave InnerWorkings, our revenue could be negatively impacted.\nOur ability to expand our business will depend largely on our ability to attract and retain sales executives with the skills and experience needed to develop new client relationships. We rely on our core team of approximately 10 enterprise sales executives to win business from new, large clients. Competition for qualified sales executives can be challenging and we may be unable to hire such individuals. In addition, we must properly incentivize our sales executives to obtain new clients and promote the renewal and expansion of existing client relationships. Any difficulties we experience in hiring or retaining sales executives could have a negative impact on our ability to expand our client base, increase our revenue and continue our growth.\nMost of our clients may terminate their relationships with us on short notice with no or limited penalties.\nMany of our clients use our services on an order-by-order basis rather than under long-term contracts. These clients have no obligation to continue using our services and may stop purchasing from us at any time. We have entered into long-term contracts and contract renewals with many of our clients, which are generally for three to five-year initial terms. Most of these contracts, however, permit the clients to terminate our engagements upon prior notice, typically ranging from 90 days to 12 months with limited or no penalties.\nThe volume and type of services we provide our clients may vary from year to year and could be reduced if a client were to change its outsourcing or procurement strategy. If a significant number of our clients elect to terminate or not to renew their engagements with us or if the volume of their orders decreases, our business, operating results and financial condition could suffer.\nWe may not be able to develop or implement new systems, procedures and controls that are required to support the continued growth in our operations.\nOur business continues to grow in size and complexity, and continued growth could place a significant strain on our ability to:\n\u2022\nrecruit, motivate and retain qualified account executives, production managers and management personnel;\n\u2022\npreserve our culture, values and entrepreneurial environment;\n\u2022\ndevelop and improve our internal administrative infrastructure and execution standards; and\n\u2022\nmaintain high levels of client satisfaction.\nTo manage our growth, we must implement and maintain proper operational and financial controls and systems. Further, we will need to manage our relationships with various clients and suppliers. We cannot give any assurance that we will be able to develop and implement, on a timely basis, the systems, procedures and controls required to support the growth in our operations or effectively manage our relationships with various clients and suppliers. If we are unable to manage our growth, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOur business and stock price may be adversely affected if our internal controls over financial reporting are not effective.\nSection 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires companies to conduct a comprehensive annual evaluation of their internal control over financial reporting. To comply with this statute, each year we are required to document and test our internal control over financial reporting; our management is required to assess and issue a report concerning our internal control over financial reporting; and our independent registered public accounting firm is required to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\nIn our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2018, we reported that management identified material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting as of December 31, 2018, which were remediated in 2019. See \u201cItem 9A. Controls and Procedures.\u201d\nWe cannot assure that we will not discover other material weaknesses in the future. The existence of one or more material weaknesses could result in errors to our financial statements and substantial costs and resources may be required to correct and remediate internal control deficiencies and to defend litigation. If we cannot produce reliable financial reports, investors could lose\nconfidence in our reported financial information, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly, we may be unable to obtain additional financing to operate and expand our business and our business and financial results could deteriorate.\nThe global integration of our technology platform may result in business interruptions.\nWe are currently implementing a common technology platform across our global operations. The implementation of and such changes to our technology platform and related software carry risks such as cost overruns, project delays and business interruptions and delays. If we experience a material business interruption as a result of this process, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nSecurity and privacy breaches may damage client relations and inhibit our growth.\nThe secure and uninterrupted operation of our information technology systems is critical to our business. Despite the security measures that we have implemented, including those measures related to cybersecurity, our systems, as well as those of our customers, suppliers and other service providers could be breached or damaged by computer viruses, malware, phishing attacks, denial-of-service attacks, natural or man-made incidents or disasters, or unauthorized physical or electronic access. These types of incidents have become more prevalent and pervasive across industries, including in our industry, and are expected to continue in the future. A breach could result in business disruption, theft of our intellectual property, trade secrets or customer information and unauthorized access to personal information, such as email or mailing addresses of our clients\u2019 customers or employees. Although cybersecurity and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes and practices designed to protect our information technology systems from attack, damage or unauthorized access are a high priority for us, our activities and investment may not be deployed quickly enough or successfully protect our systems against all vulnerabilities, including technologies developed to bypass our security measures. In addition, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or customers to disclose access credentials or other sensitive information in order to gain access to our secure systems and networks. There are no assurances that our actions and investments to improve the maturity of our systems, processes and risk management framework or remediate vulnerabilities will be sufficient or completed quickly enough to prevent or limit the impact of any cyber intrusion. Moreover, because the techniques used to gain access to or sabotage systems often are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate the methods necessary to defend against these types of attacks and we cannot predict the extent, frequency or impact these problems may have on us. To the extent that our business is interrupted or data is lost, destroyed or inappropriately used or disclosed, such disruptions could adversely affect our competitive position, relationships with our customers, financial condition, operating results and cash flows and/or subject us to regulatory actions, including those contemplated by data privacy laws and regulations like the European Union General Data Protection Regulation and California Consumer Privacy Act, or litigation. In addition, we may be required to incur significant costs to protect against the damage caused by these disruptions or security breaches in the future.\nWe are also dependent on security measures that some of our third-party customers, suppliers and other service providers take to protect their own systems and infrastructures. Some of these third parties store or have access to certain of our sensitive data, as well as confidential information about their own operations, and as such are subject to their own cybersecurity threats.\nAny security breach of any of these third-parties\u2019 systems could result in unauthorized access to our information technology systems, cause us to be non-compliant with applicable laws or regulations, subject us to legal claims or proceedings, disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, any of which could adversely affect our financial performance.\nA decrease in levels of excess capacity in the commercial print industry could have an adverse impact on our business.\nWe believe that for the past several years the U.S. commercial print industry has experienced significant levels of excess capacity. Our business seeks to capitalize on imbalances between supply and demand in the print industry by obtaining favorable pricing terms from suppliers in our network with excess capacity. Reduced excess capacity in the print industry generally and in our supplier network specifically, could have an adverse impact on our ability to execute our business strategy and on our business results and growth prospects.\nOur inability to protect our intellectual property rights may impair our competitive position.\nIf we fail to protect our intellectual property rights adequately, our competitors could replicate our proprietary technology and processes and offer similar services, which would harm our competitive position. We rely primarily on a combination of copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws and confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements to protect our proprietary technology. We cannot be certain that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights will be adequate or that third parties will not infringe or misappropriate our rights or imitate or duplicate our services and methodologies. We may need to litigate to enforce our\nintellectual property rights or determine the validity and scope of the rights of others. Any such litigation could be time-consuming and costly.\nIf we are unable to maintain our proprietary technology, demand for our services and therefore our revenue could decrease.\nWe rely heavily on our proprietary technology to procure marketing materials for our clients. To keep pace with changing technologies and client demands, we must correctly interpret and address market trends and enhance the features and functionality of our technology in response to these trends, which may lead to significant research and development costs. We may be unable to accurately determine the needs of buyers or the trends in the marketing industry or to design and implement the appropriate features and functionality of our technology in a timely and cost-effective manner, which could result in decreased demand for our services and a corresponding decrease in our revenue.\nIn addition, we must protect our systems against physical damage from fire, earthquakes, power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, hacker attacks, physical break-ins and similar events. Any software or hardware damage or failure that causes interruption or an increase in response time of our proprietary technology could reduce client satisfaction and decrease usage of our services.\nIf the key members of our management team do not remain with us in the future, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nOur future success will depend to a significant extent on the continued services of our current executive team, including Rich Stoddart our Chief Executive Officer, Don Pearson, our Chief Financial Officer, Oren Azar, our General Counsel, Renae Chorzempa, our Chief Human Resources Officer, Adan Pope, our Chief Technology Officer, and Ron Provenzano, our Head of Operations Excellence. The loss of the services of these individuals could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition and could divert other senior management time in searching for their replacements.\nOur business is subject to seasonal sales fluctuations, which could result in volatility or have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nOur business is subject to some degree of sales seasonality. Historically, the percentage of our annual revenue earned during the third and fourth fiscal quarters has been higher due, in part, to a greater number of orders for marketing materials in anticipation of the year-end holiday season. If our business continues to experience seasonality, we may incur significant additional expenses during our third and fourth quarters, including additional staffing expenses. Consequently, if we were to experience lower than expected revenue during any future third or fourth quarter, whether from a general decline in economic conditions or other factors beyond our control, our expenses may not be offset, which would have a disproportionate impact on our operating results and financial condition for that year. Such fluctuations in our operating results could result in volatility or have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nPrice fluctuations in raw materials costs could adversely affect the margins on our orders.\nOur business relies on a constant supply of various raw materials, including paper and ink. Prices within the print industry are directly affected by the cost of paper, which is purchased in a price sensitive market that has historically exhibited price and demand cyclicality. Prices are also affected by the cost of ink. Our profit margin and profitability are largely a function of the rates that our suppliers charge us compared to the rates that we charge our clients. If our suppliers increase the price of our orders and we are not able to find suitable or alternative suppliers, our profit margin may decline.\nOur ability to obtain financing or raise capital in the future may be limited and our failure to raise capital when needed could prevent us from growing.\nWe may in the future be required to raise capital through public or private financing or other arrangements. Such financing may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all, and our failure to raise capital when needed could harm our business. Furthermore, additional equity financing may dilute the interests of our common stockholders, and debt financing, if available, may involve restrictive covenants that could further restrict our business activities or our ability to execute our strategic objectives and could reduce our profitability.\nIf LIBOR ceases to exist after 2021, it may result in higher interest rates, which could result in higher interest expense.\nThe interest rates under our Credit Agreements are calculated using the London Inter-bank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d). In July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (the authority that regulates LIBOR) announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. These reforms may cause LIBOR to perform differently than it has in the past, and LIBOR may ultimately cease to exist after 2021. Alternative benchmark rates may replace LIBOR and could affect our debt payments. At this time, it is not possible to predict the effect of any changes to LIBOR, any phase out of LIBOR or any establishment of alternative benchmark rates. Any new benchmark rate will likely not replicate LIBOR exactly, which could impact our Credit Agreements. There is uncertainty about how applicable law and the courts will address the replacement of LIBOR with alternative rates on contracts that do not include alternative rate fallback provisions. If LIBOR ceases to exist after 2021, it may result in higher interest rates. In addition, any changes to benchmark rates may have an uncertain impact on our cost of funds and our access to the capital markets, which could impact our results of operations and cash flows.\nWe may not be able to successfully implement initiatives, including our restructuring activities, that reduce our cost structure while driving returns for clients and stockholders.\nAchieving our long-term profitability goals depends significantly on our ability to control or reduce our operating costs. If we are not able to identify and implement initiatives that control or reduce costs and increase operating efficiency, or if the cost savings initiatives we have implemented to date do not generate expected cost savings, our financial results could be adversely impacted. Our efforts to control or reduce costs may include restructuring activities involving workforce reductions, lease and contract terminations and other cost reduction initiatives. Some of the operational improvements we may make to reduce our cost structure are expected to involve significant change management and will require careful management to avoid disrupting client and employee relationships. If we do not successfully manage our current restructuring activities, or any other restructuring activities that we may undertake in the future, expected efficiencies and benefits may be delayed or not realized, and our operations and business could be disrupted.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nThe trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile.\nThe trading prices of many small and mid-cap companies are highly volatile. Since our initial public offering in August 2006 through December 31, 2019, the closing sale price of our common stock as reported by the Nasdaq Global Market has ranged from a low of $1.92 on March 2, 2009 to a high of $18.69 on October 9, 2007.\nCertain factors may continue to cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate, including:\n\u2022\nfluctuations in our quarterly financial results or the quarterly financial results of companies perceived to be similar to us;\n\u2022\nchanges in market valuations of similar companies;\n\u2022\nchanges in economic and political conditions in the United States or abroad;\n\u2022\nsuccess of competitive products or services;\n\u2022\nchanges in our capital structure, such as future issuances of debt or equity securities;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us, our competitors, our clients or our suppliers of significant products or services, contracts, acquisitions or strategic alliances;\n\u2022\nregulatory developments in the United States or foreign countries;\n\u2022\nlitigation involving our company, our general industry or both;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel;\n\u2022\ninvestors\u2019 general perception of us; and\n\u2022\nchanges in general industry and market conditions.\nIn addition, if the stock market experiences a loss of investor confidence, then the trading price of our common stock could decline for reasons unrelated to our business, financial condition or results of operations. If any of the foregoing occurs, it could cause our stock price to fall and may expose us to class action lawsuits that could be costly to defend and a distraction to management. As a result, you could lose all or part of your investment.\nOur quarterly results are difficult to predict and may vary from quarter to quarter, which may result in our failure to meet the expectations of investors and increased volatility of our stock price.\nThe continued use of our services by our clients depends, in part, on the business activity of our clients and our ability to meet their cost saving needs, as well as their own changing business conditions. The time between our payment to the supplier and our receipt of payment from our clients varies with each job and client. In addition, a significant percentage of our revenue is subject to the discretion of our clients, who determine the timing of specific orders and may also stop using our services at any time, subject, in the case of most of our clients, to advance notice requirements. Therefore, the number, size and profitability of jobs may vary significantly from quarter to quarter. As a result, our quarterly operating results are difficult to predict and may fall below the expectations of current or potential investors in some future quarters, which could lead to significant variations in the market price of our stock. The factors that are likely to cause these variations include:\n\u2022\nthe demand for our marketing execution solutions;\n\u2022\nthe use of outsourced enterprise solutions;\n\u2022\nclients\u2019 business decisions regarding the quantities of marketing materials they purchase;\n\u2022\nthe number, timing and profitability of our jobs, unanticipated contract terminations and job postponements;\n\u2022\nnew product introductions and enhancements by our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in our pricing policies;\n\u2022\nour ability to manage costs, including personnel costs; and\n\u2022\ncosts related to possible acquisitions of other businesses.\nWe do not currently intend to pay dividends, which may limit the return on your investment.\nWe have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future.\nIf our board of directors authorizes the issuance of preferred stock, holders of our common stock could be diluted and harmed.\nOur board of directors has the authority to issue up to 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to establish the preferred stock\u2019s voting powers, preferences and other rights and qualifications without any further vote or action by the stockholders. The issuance of preferred stock could adversely affect the voting power and dividend liquidation rights of the holders of common stock. In addition, the issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire or discouraging a third party from acquiring, a majority of our outstanding voting stock or otherwise adversely affect the market price of our common stock. It is possible that we may need to raise capital through the sale of preferred stock in the future.", "PERMNO": 91432, "SIC": 7389, "TIC": "INWK"}
