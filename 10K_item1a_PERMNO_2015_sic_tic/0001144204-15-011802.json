{"cik": "1289850", "company": "NeuroMetrix, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-25", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors You should carefully consider the following risks and all other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and our other public filings before making any investment decisions with respect to our common stock. If any of the following risks occurs, our business, prospects, reputation, results of operations, or financial condition could be harmed. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could decline, and our stockholders could lose all or part of their investment. This Annual Report also contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements as a result of specific factors, including the risks described below and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe have incurred significant operating losses since inception and cannot assure you that we will again achieve profitability. We have incurred significant cumulative net losses since our inception. Our net losses for 2014, 2013, and 2012, were approximately $7.8 million, $8.0 million, and $10.0 million, respectively. At December 31, 2014, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $154.4 million. The extent of our future operating income or losses is highly uncertain, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to achieve or maintain profitability.\nOur independent auditor has expressed substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on our ability to raise additional capital and our operations could be curtailed if we are unable to obtain the required additional funding when needed. We may not be able to do so when necessary, and/or the terms of any financings may not be advantageous to us. We held cash and cash equivalents of $9.2 million as of December 31, 2014. We believe that these resources and the cash to be generated from expected product sales will be sufficient to meet our projected operating requirements through the third quarter of 2015. Our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. We expect to incur further losses as we aim to successfully commercialize DPNCheck and Quell and the operations of our business and will be dependent on funding our operations through public or private financing, collaborative arrangements with strategic partners, or through additional credit lines or other debt financing sources to increase the funds available to fund operations. These circumstances raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. As a result of this uncertainty and the substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern as of December 31, 2014 the Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm at the beginning of the Financial Statements section in this Form 10-K includes a going concern explanatory paragraph. Management\u2019s plans include increasing revenue through the commercialization of Quell and DPNCheck. However, no assurance can be given at this time as to whether we will be able to achieve these objectives. Our financial statements do not include any adjustment relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern.\nWe continue to face significant challenges and uncertainties and, as a result, our available capital resources may be consumed more rapidly than currently expected due to (a) decreases in sales of our products and the uncertainty of future revenues from new products; (b) changes we may make to the business that affect ongoing operating expenses; (c) changes we may make in our business strategy; (d) regulatory developments affecting our existing products and delays in the FDA approval process for products under development; (e) changes in our research and development spending plans; and (f) other items affecting our forecasted level of expenditures and use of cash resources. Accordingly, we will need to raise additional funds to support our operating and capital needs for the fourth quarter of 2015 and beyond. We may attempt to obtain additional funding through public or private financing, collaborative arrangements with strategic partners, or through additional credit lines or other debt financing sources to increase the funds available to fund operations. However, we may not be able to secure such financing in a timely manner or on favorable terms, if at all. Furthermore, if we issue equity or debt securities to raise additional funds, our existing stockholders may experience dilution, and the new equity or debt securities may have rights, preferences and\nprivileges senior to those of our existing stockholders. If we raise additional funds through collaboration, licensing or other similar arrangements, it may be necessary to relinquish valuable rights to our potential products or proprietary technologies, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. Without additional funds, we may be forced to delay, scale back or eliminate some of our sales and marketing efforts, research and development activities, or other operations and potentially delay product development in an effort to provide sufficient funds to continue our operations. If any of these events occurs, our ability to achieve our development and commercialization goals would be adversely affected.\nWe are focused on commercialization of our wearable devices for chronic pain. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in this field or that our current commercial product for peripheral neuropathy, DPNCheck, or the product candidates in our development pipeline, will be successful. We are focused on the launch in the second quarter of 2015 and subsequent commercialization of Quell, our OTC wearable device for pain relief. Quell is based on our prescription product for pain relief, SENSUS, which has been on the market for two years. We have shipped over 7,000 SENSUS devices during that period. DPNCheck, which was launched in late 2011, is a fast, accurate, and quantitative nerve conduction test for systemic neuropathies, such as DPN. We have other product candidates in our development pipeline. Our future prospects are closely tied to our success with our wearable devices for chronic pain which, in turn, depend upon market acceptance and growth in future revenues. We cannot assure you that our commercialization strategy will be successful. If our strategy is not successful, it could materially affect our revenues and results of operations.\nOur future success could be adversely affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u2022 inability to complete development and launch Quell in 2015;\n\u2022 inability to create market demand for Quell through a direct sales force and through online marketing efforts;\n\u2022 manufacturing issues with Quell, SENSUS or our other products;\n\u2022 inability to increase adoption of DPNCheck within the Medicare Advantage market;\n\u2022 unfavorable market response to DPNCheck in Japan and other Asia markets;\n\u2022 unfavorable changes to current Medicare, Medicare Advantage and commercial payer payment policies;\n\u2022 changes to payor policies under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act;\n\u2022 unfavorable experiences by patients and physicians using Quell, SENSUS and our other products; and,\n\u2022 physicians\u2019 reluctance to alter their existing practices and adopt the use of our devices.\nIf we are unable to expand exposure and penetrate the market for DPNCheck and SENSUS, or to establish a market for Quell, our ability to increase our revenues will be limited and our business prospects will be adversely affected.\nIf health care providers are unable to obtain sufficient reimbursement or other financial incentives from third-party health care payers related to the use of our products, the adoption of our products and our future product sales will be materially adversely affected. Widespread adoption of our SENSUS and DPNCheck products by the medical community is unlikely to occur without a financial incentive from third-party payers for the use of these products. If health care providers are unable to obtain adequate reimbursement for procedures performed using these products, if managed care organizations do not receive improved capitated payments due to more accurate patient risk assessment using our products, and if DME suppliers are not adequately reimbursed for supplying our therapeutic products, we may be unable to sell our products at levels that are sufficient to allow us to achieve and maintain profitability, and our business would suffer significantly. Additionally, even if these products and procedures are adequately reimbursed by third-party payers today, adverse changes in payers future policies\ntoward payment would harm our ability to market and sell our products. Third-party payers include those governmental programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, private health insurers, workers\u2019 compensation programs and other organizations.\nFuture regulatory action by CMS or other governmental agencies or negative clinical results may diminish reimbursement payments to physicians for performing procedures using our products. Medicaid reimbursement differs from state to state, and some state Medicaid programs may not cover the procedures performed with our products or pay physicians an adequate amount for performing those procedures, if at all. Additionally, some private payers do not follow the Medicare guidelines and may reimburse for only a portion of these procedures or not at all. We are unable to predict what changes will be made in the reimbursement methods used by private or governmental third-party payers. Importantly, we cannot predict the effects that implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act will have on CMS, commercial insurers, health care providers, and ultimately on our business.\nHealthcare reform legislation could adversely affect our future revenues. Our future revenues will be impacted by the CMS Durable Medical Equipment, Prosthetics, Orthotics and Supplies (DMEPOS) Competitive Bidding Program. Under this program, Medicare will no longer reimburse suppliers for certain products and services, including transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), based on the Medicare fee schedule amount. Instead CMS will provide reimbursement for those products and services based on a competitive bidding process. Our SENSUS pain management system is presently classified within TENS. The DMEPOS Competitive Bidding Program will likely require us to sell SENSUS devices and related consumables subject to Medicare reimbursement at significantly lower prices which would have a material adverse effect on SENSUS profitability. In those regions of the country where DMEPOS Competitive Bidding was implemented in January 2014, low Medicare pricing is restricting our ability to sell SENSUS. As the DMEPOS program is expanded to other regions, a similar effect will likely be seen.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA which could restrict the sales and marketing of the Quell, SENSUS and DPNCheck devices and the ADVANCE System as well as other products for which we may seek FDA clearance or approval, and could cause us to incur significant costs. We sell medical devices that are subject to extensive regulation in the United States by the FDA with regard to manufacturing, labeling, sale, promotion, distribution, shipping and ongoing monitoring and follow-up. Before a new medical device, or a new use of or claim for an existing product, can be marketed in the United States, it must first be cleared or approved by the FDA. Medical devices may be marketed only for the indications for which they are approved or cleared. The regulatory review process can be expensive and lengthy. The FDA\u2019s process for granting 510(k) clearance typically takes approximately three to six months, but it can be significantly longer. The process for obtaining a pre-market approval, or PMA, is much more costly and onerous. By law, the time period designated for the FDA\u2019s review of a PMA is 180 days; however, this time is often extended and it is not uncommon for the PMA review process to take three years or longer from the time the application is filed with the FDA.\nThe FDA may remove our devices from the market or enjoin them from commercial distribution if safety or effectiveness problems develop. Further, we may not be able to obtain additional 510(k) clearances or pre-market approvals for new products or for modifications to, or additional indications for, our existing products in a timely fashion, or at all. Delays in obtaining future clearances or approvals would adversely affect our ability to introduce new or enhanced products in a timely manner, which in turn would harm our revenue and future profitability. We have made modifications to our devices in the past and may make additional modifications in the future that we believe do not or will not require additional clearances or approvals. If the FDA disagrees, and requires new clearances or approvals for the modifications, we may be required to recall and to stop marketing the modified devices. If any of these events occurs or if the FDA takes other enforcement actions, we may not be able to provide our customers with the products they require on a timely basis, our reputation could be harmed, and we could lose customers and suffer reduced revenues and increased costs.\nWe also are subject to numerous post-marketing regulatory requirements, including the FDA\u2019s quality system regulations, which relate to the design, manufacture, packaging, labeling, storage, installation and\nservicing of our products, labeling regulations, medical device reporting regulations and correction and removal reporting regulations. Our failure or the failure by any manufacturer of our products to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in enforcement action by the FDA. FDA enforcement actions relating to post-marketing regulatory requirements or other issues, including any issues arising from the not substantially equivalent letter described above, may include any of the following:\n\u2022 warning letters, untitled letters, fines, injunctions, product seizures, consent decrees and civil penalties;\n\u2022 requiring repair, replacement, refunds, customer notifications or recall of our products;\n\u2022 imposing operating restrictions, suspension or shutdown of production;\n\u2022 refusing our requests for 510(k) clearance or PMA approval of new products, new intended uses, or modifications to existing products;\n\u2022 requesting voluntary rescission of 510(k) clearances or withdrawing PMA approvals that have already been granted; and\n\u2022 criminal prosecution.\nIf any of these events were to occur, they could harm our reputation, our ability to generate revenues and our profitability.\nAlso, from time to time, legislation is introduced into Congress that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the approval, manufacturing and marketing of medical devices. FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the agency in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. It is impossible to predict whether legislative changes will be enacted, or FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations changed, and what the impact of such changes, if any, may be. The FDA has publicly stated that it is reevaluating its longstanding 510(k) review program. It is not clear when the program will be modified and what effect the modified review process will have on our ability to bring our product candidates to market.\nWe depend on several single source manufacturers to produce our products. Any material adverse changes in our relationships with these manufacturers could prevent us from delivering products to our customers in a timely manner and may adversely impact our future revenues or costs. We rely on third-party manufacturers to manufacture components of our DPNCheck, SENSUS and Quell systems, and to fully manufacture the ADVANCE system. In the event that our manufacturers cease to manufacture sufficient quantities of our products or components in a timely manner and on terms acceptable to us, we would be forced to locate alternate manufacturers. Additionally, if our manufacturers experience a failure in their production process, are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of the components necessary to manufacture our products or otherwise fail to meet our quality requirements, we may be forced to delay the manufacture and sale of our products or locate an alternative manufacturer. We may be unable to locate suitable alternative manufacturers for our products or components for which the manufacturing process is relatively specialized, on terms acceptable to us, or at all. We have a manufacturing and supply agreement with Parlex Polymer Flexible Circuits, Inc. for the manufacture of the ADVANCE electrodes for nerve conduction testing. Katecho, Inc. manufactures biosensors for use with our DPNCheck devices and manufactures electrodes for SENSUS and Quell, and Sunburst EMS, Inc. manufactures electronic boards and other components of our DPNCheck, SENSUS and Quell products which we assemble at our Massachusetts facility to produce completed devices. Sunburst EMS, Inc. also manufactures our ADVANCE System monitors, docking stations, and communication hubs.\nWe have experienced transient inventory shortages on new products during the initial production ramp-up phase. If any materially adverse changes in our relationships with these manufacturers occur, our ability to supply our customers will be severely limited until we are able to engage an alternate manufacturer or, if applicable, resolve any quality issues with our existing manufacturer. This situation could prevent us from delivering products to our customers in a timely manner, lead to decreased sales or increased costs, or harm our reputation with our customers.\nIf our manufacturers are unable to supply us with an adequate supply of products as we expand our markets, we could lose customers, our potential future growth could be limited and our business could be harmed. In order for us to successfully expand our business within the United States and internationally, our contract manufacturers must be able to provide us with substantial quantities of our products in compliance with regulatory requirements, in accordance with agreed upon specifications, at acceptable cost and on a timely basis. Our potential future growth could strain the ability of our manufacturers to deliver products and obtain materials and components in sufficient quantities. Manufacturers often experience difficulties in scaling up production, including problems with production yields and quality control and assurance. If we are unable to obtain sufficient quantities of high quality products to meet customer demand on a timely basis, we could lose customers, our growth may be limited and our business could be harmed.\nIf we or the manufacturers of our products fail to comply with the FDA\u2019s quality system regulation, the manufacturing and distribution of our products could be interrupted, and our product sales and operating results could suffer. We and our contract manufacturers are required to comply with the FDA\u2019s quality system regulation, or QSR, which is a complex regulation that governs the procedures and documentation of the design, testing, production, control, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, sterilization, storage and shipping of our devices. The FDA enforces the QSR through periodic inspections. We cannot assure you that our facilities or the facilities of the manufacturers of our products would pass any future inspection. If our facilities or any of the facilities of the manufacturers of our products fail an inspection, the manufacturing or distribution of our products could be interrupted and our operations disrupted. Failure to take adequate and timely corrective action in response to an adverse inspection could result in a suspension or shutdown of our packaging and labeling operations and the operations of the manufacturers of our products or a recall of our products, or other administrative or judicial sanctions. If any of these events occurs, we may not be able to provide our customers with the quantity of products they require on a timely basis, our reputation could be harmed, and we could lose customers and suffer reduced revenues and increased costs.\nOur products may be subject to recalls, even after receiving FDA clearance or approval, which would harm our reputation, business and financial results. We are subject to the medical device reporting regulations, which require us to report to the FDA if our products may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury, or have malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury if the malfunction were to occur. We are also subject to the correction and removal reporting regulations, which require us to report to the FDA any field corrections and device recalls or removals that we undertake to reduce a risk to health posed by the device or to remedy a violation of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, or FDCA, caused by the device which may present a risk to health. In addition, the FDA and similar governmental agencies in other countries have the authority to require the recall of our products if there is a reasonable probability that the products would cause serious adverse health consequences or death. A government-mandated or voluntary recall by us could occur as a result of manufacturing defects, labeling deficiencies, packaging defects or other failures to comply with applicable regulations. Any recall would divert management attention and financial resources and harm our reputation with customers and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe success of our business depends upon our ability to advance our pipeline products to commercialization. The primary focus of our research and development department is development of our Quell device for chronic pain and the initiation of commercial shipments of Quell in the second quarter of 2015. We have other products in our R&D pipeline. We expect that advancing our pipeline products will require significant time and resources. We may not be successful in our commercialization efforts for any of the product candidates currently in our pipeline and we may not be successful in developing, acquiring, or in-licensing additional product candidates, to the extent we decide to do so. If we are not successful advancing new products through our development pipeline, the regulatory process and commercial launch, our business, financial condition, and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nWe currently rely on sales of the products that comprise the ADVANCE System to generate a meaningful portion of our revenues. Any factors that negatively impact our sales of these products could significantly reduce our ability to generate revenues. We launched the ADVANCE System, our general purpose nerve conduction testing system, in June 2008. For 2014 and 2013, 51% and 72%, respectively, of our total revenue was attributed to the ADVANCE System. We continue to derive a substantial portion of our revenues from sales of ADVANCE electrodes. We expect that sales of ADVANCE System products will constitute approximately 20% of our sales during 2015. Accordingly, our revenue in the short-term is dependent on our ability to sell ADVANCE electrodes. ADVANCE electrode sales may be negatively impacted by many factors, including:\n\u2022 changes in reimbursement rates or policies by third-party payers;\n\u2022 manufacturing problems;\n\u2022 claims that our products infringe on patent rights or other intellectual property rights owned by other parties;\n\u2022 adverse regulatory or legal actions relating to our products; and\n\u2022 clinical trial results relating to our products or our competitors\u2019 products.\nIf any of these events occurs, ADVANCE electrode sales could be significantly reduced.\nThe patent rights we rely upon to protect the intellectual property underlying our products may not be adequate, which could enable third parties to use our technology and would harm our ability to compete in the market. Our success will depend in part on our ability to develop or acquire commercially valuable patent rights and to protect these rights adequately. The risks and uncertainties that we face with respect to our patents and other related rights include the following:\n\u2022 the pending patent applications we have filed or to which we have exclusive rights may not result in issued patents or may take longer than we expect to result in issued patents;\n\u2022 the claims of any patents that are issued may not provide meaningful protection;\n\u2022 we may not be able to develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable;\n\u2022 other parties may challenge patents, patent claims or patent applications licensed or issued to us; and\n\u2022 other companies may design around technologies we have patented, licensed or developed.\nOur issued design patents begin to expire in 2015. We also may not be able to protect our patent rights effectively in some foreign countries. For a variety of reasons, we may decide not to file for patent protection in the United States or in particular foreign countries. Our patent rights underlying our products may not be adequate, and our competitors or customers may design around our proprietary technologies or independently develop similar or alternative technologies or products that are equal or superior to our technology and products without infringing on any of our patent rights. In addition, the patents licensed or issued to us may not provide a competitive advantage. If any of these events were to occur, our ability to compete in the market would be harmed.\nOther rights and measures we have taken to protect our intellectual property may not be adequate, which would harm our ability to compete in the market. In addition to patents, we rely on a combination of trade secrets, copyright and trademark laws, confidentiality, nondisclosure and assignment of invention agreements and other contractual provisions and technical measures to protect our intellectual property rights. We rely on trade secrets to protect the technology and algorithms we use in our customer data processing and warehousing information system. While we currently require employees, consultants and other third parties to enter into confidentiality, non-disclosure or assignment of invention agreements or a combination thereof where appropriate, any of the following could still occur:\n\u2022 the agreements may be breached or not enforced in a particular jurisdiction;\n\u2022 we may have inadequate remedies for any breach;\n\u2022 trade secrets and other proprietary information could be disclosed to our competitors; or\n\u2022 others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or disclose such technologies.\nIf, for any of the above reasons, our intellectual property is disclosed or misappropriated, it would harm our ability to protect our rights and our competitive position.\nWe may need to initiate lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents and other intellectual property rights, which could be expensive and, if we lose, could cause us to lose some of our intellectual property rights, which would harm our ability to compete in the market. We rely on patents to protect a portion of our intellectual property and our competitive position. Patent law relating to the scope of claims in the technology fields in which we operate is still evolving and, consequently, patent positions in the medical device industry are generally uncertain. In order to protect or enforce our patent rights, we may initiate patent litigation against third parties, such as infringement suits or interference proceedings. Litigation may be necessary to:\n\u2022 assert claims of infringement;\n\u2022 enforce our patents;\n\u2022 protect our trade secrets or know-how; or\n\u2022 determine the enforceability, scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others.\nAny lawsuits that we initiate could be expensive, take significant time and divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns. Litigation also puts our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our patent applications at risk of not issuing. Additionally, we may provoke third parties to assert claims against us. We may not prevail in any lawsuits that we initiate and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially valuable. The occurrence of any of these events could harm our business, our ability to compete in the market or our reputation.\nClaims that our products infringe on the proprietary rights of others could adversely affect our ability to sell our products and increase our costs. Substantial litigation over intellectual property rights exists in the medical device industry. We expect that our products could be increasingly subject to third-party infringement claims as the number of competitors grows and the functionality of products and technology in different industry segments overlap. Third parties may currently have, or may eventually be issued, patents on which our products or technologies may infringe. Any of these third parties might make a claim of infringement against us. Any litigation regardless of its impact would likely result in the expenditure of significant financial resources and the diversion of management\u2019s time and resources. In addition, litigation in which we are accused of infringement may cause negative publicity, adversely impact prospective customers, cause product shipment delays or require us to develop non-infringing technology, make substantial payments to third parties, or enter into royalty or license agreements, which may not be available on acceptable terms, or at all. If a successful claim of infringement were made against us and we could not develop non-infringing technology or license the infringed or similar technology on a timely and cost-effective basis, our revenues may decrease substantially and we could be exposed to significant liability.\nWe are subject to federal and state laws prohibiting \u201ckickbacks\u201d and false or fraudulent claims, which, if violated, could subject us to substantial penalties. Additionally, any challenge to or investigation into our practices under these laws could cause adverse publicity and be costly to respond to, and thus could harm our business. A federal law commonly known as the federal anti-kickback law, and several similar state laws, prohibit the payment of any remuneration that is intended to induce physicians or others either to refer patients or to acquire or arrange for or recommend the acquisition of health care products or services. These laws constrain\na medical device company\u2019s sales, marketing and other promotional activities by limiting the kinds of business relationships and financial arrangements, including sales programs we may have with hospitals, physicians or other potential purchasers of medical devices. Other federal and state laws generally prohibit individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment to Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payers that are false or fraudulent, or for items or services that were not provided as claimed. From time to time, we may provide coding and billing information as product support to purchasers of our products. Anti-kickback and false claims laws prescribe civil and criminal penalties for noncompliance, which can be quite substantial including exclusion from participation in federal health care programs. A number of states have enacted laws that require pharmaceutical and medical device companies to monitor and report payments, gifts and other remuneration made to physicians and other health care professionals and health care organizations. Some state statutes, such as the one in Massachusetts, impose an outright ban on gifts to physicians. These laws are often referred to as \u201cgift ban\u201d or \u201caggregate spend\u201d laws and carry substantial fines if they are violated. Similar legislation, known as the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, was enacted by Congress in 2014. In the event that we are found to have violated these laws or determine to settle a claim that we have done so, our business may be materially adversely affected as a result of any payments required to be made, restrictions on our future operations or actions required to be taken, damage to our business reputation or adverse publicity in connection with such a finding or settlement or other adverse effects relating thereto. Additionally, even an unsuccessful challenge or investigation into our practices could cause adverse publicity, and be costly to respond to, and thus could harm our business and results of operations.\nIf we are found to have violated laws protecting the confidentiality of patient health information, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, which could increase our liabilities, damage our reputation and harm our business. There are a number of federal and state laws protecting the confidentiality of individually identifiable patient health information, including patient records, and restricting the use and disclosure of that protected information. In particular, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services promulgated patient privacy rules under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA. These privacy rules protect medical records and other personal health information by limiting their use and disclosure, giving individuals the right to access, amend and seek accounting of their own health information and limiting most use and disclosures of health information to the minimum amount reasonably necessary to accomplish the intended purpose. Although we do not believe that we are subject to the HIPAA rules, the exact scope of these rules has not been clearly established. If we are found to be in violation of the privacy rules under HIPAA, we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties, which could increase our liabilities and harm our reputation or our business.\nThe use of our products could result in product liability claims that could be expensive, damage our reputation and harm our business. Our business exposes us to an inherent risk of potential product liability claims related to the manufacturing, marketing and sale of medical devices. The medical device industry historically has been litigious, and we face financial exposure to product liability claims if the use of our products were to cause or contribute to injury or death. Our ADVANCE system and DPNCheck, SENSUS and Quell products may be susceptible to claims of injury because their use involves the electric stimulation of a patient\u2019s nerves. Although we maintain product liability insurance for our products and other commercial insurance, the coverage limits of these policies may not be adequate to cover future claims. As sales and use of our products increase, we may be unable to maintain sufficient product liability or other commercial insurance on acceptable terms or at reasonable costs, and this insurance may not provide us with adequate coverage against potential liabilities. A successful claim brought against us in excess of, or outside of, our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. A product liability claim, regardless of its merit or eventual outcome, could result in substantial costs to us, a substantial diversion of management attention and adverse publicity. A product liability claim could also harm our reputation and result in a decline in revenues and an increase in expenses.\nOur products are complex in design, and defects may not be discovered prior to shipment to customers, which could result in warranty obligations or product liability or other claims, reducing our revenues and increasing our costs and liabilities. We depend upon third parties for the manufacture of our products or components. Our products, particularly our electrodes, require a significant degree of technical expertise to produce. If these manufacturers fail to produce our products to specification, or if the manufacturers use defective materials or workmanship in the manufacturing process, the reliability and performance of our products will be compromised.\nIf our products contain defects that cannot be repaired quickly, easily and inexpensively, we may experience:\n\u2022 loss of customer orders and delay in order fulfillment;\n\u2022 damage to our brand reputation;\n\u2022 increased cost of our warranty program due to product repair or replacement;\n\u2022 inability to attract new customers;\n\u2022 diversion of resources from our manufacturing and research and development departments into our service department; and\n\u2022 legal action.\nThe occurrence of any one or more of the foregoing could harm our reputation and materially reduce our revenues and increase our costs and liabilities.\nIf we lose any of our officers or key employees, our management and technical expertise could be weakened significantly. Our success largely depends on the skills, experience, and efforts of our executive officers, including Shai N. Gozani, M.D., Ph.D., our founder, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer; Thomas T. Higgins, our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Frank McGillin, our Senior Vice President and General Manager Consumer. We do not maintain key person life insurance policies covering any of our employees. The loss of any of our executive officers could weaken our management and technical expertise significantly and harm our business.\nIf we are unable to recruit, hire and retain skilled and experienced personnel, our ability to manage and expand our business will be harmed, which would impair our future revenues and profitability. We are a small company with 32 employees as of December 31, 2014, and our ability to retain our skilled labor force and our success in attracting and hiring new skilled employees will be a critical factor in determining our future performance. We may not be able to meet our future hiring needs or retain existing personnel, particularly given the challenges faced by our business. We will face challenges and risks in hiring, training, managing and retaining engineering and sales and marketing employees. Failure to attract and retain personnel, particularly technical and sales and marketing personnel would materially harm our ability to compete effectively and grow our business.\nFailure to develop or enter into relationships to sell products other than our existing products or enhance our existing products could have an adverse effect on our business prospects. Our future business and financial success will depend, in part, on our ability to effectively market our new products, such as Quell, SENSUS and DPNCheck, and enhance these products in response to customer demand. Developing new products and upgrades to existing and future products imposes burdens on our research and development department and our management. This process is costly, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully develop new products or enhance our current products. We also may not be able to enter into relationships with other companies to sell additional products. In addition, as we develop the market for our products, future competitors may develop desirable product features earlier than we do which could make our competitors\u2019 products less expensive or more effective than our products and could render our products obsolete or unmarketable. If our product development efforts are unsuccessful, we will have incurred significant costs without recognizing the expected benefits and our business prospects may suffer.\nWe currently compete, and may in the future need to compete, against other medical device and consumer companies with greater resources, more established distribution channels and other competitive advantages, and the success of these competitors may harm our ability to generate revenues. We currently do, and in the future may need to, compete directly and indirectly with a number of other companies that may have competitive advantages over us. Our diagnostic devices for nerve testing compete with companies that sell traditional nerve conduction study and electromyography equipment including Cadwell Laboratories, Inc. and Natus Medical Incorporated. These companies enjoy significant competitive advantages, including:\n\u2022 greater resources for product development, sales and marketing;\n\u2022 more established distribution networks;\n\u2022 greater name recognition;\n\u2022 more established relationships with health care professionals, customers and third-party payers; and\n\u2022 additional lines of products and the ability to offer rebates or bundle products to offer discounts or incentives.\nAs we develop the market for wearable technology for chronic pain and other illnesses, we may be faced with competition from other companies that decide and are able to enter the market. Some or all of our future competitors in the diagnostic nerve testing market and the consumer market for pain relief may enjoy competitive advantages such as those described above. If we are unable to compete effectively against existing and future competitors, our sales will decline and our business will be harmed.\nSecurity breaches and other disruptions could compromise our information and expose us to liability, which could cause our business and reputation to suffer. In the ordinary course of our business, we collect and store sensitive data in our data centers, on our networks, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information, and that of our customers, suppliers and business partners, and personally identifiable information of our employees. The secure processing, maintenance and transmission of this information is critical to our operations. Despite our security measures, our information technology and infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breached due to employee error, malfeasance or other disruptions. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Any such access, disclosure or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings, disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and cause a loss of confidence in our products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nIf future clinical studies or other articles are published, or physician associations or other organizations announce positions that are unfavorable to our products, our sales efforts and revenues may be negatively affected. Future clinical studies or other articles regarding our existing products or any competing products may be published that either support a claim, or are perceived to support a claim, that a competitor\u2019s product is more accurate or effective than our products or that our products are not as accurate or effective as we claim or previous clinical studies have concluded. Additionally, physician associations or other organizations that may be viewed as authoritative or have an economic interest in nerve conduction studies and in related electrodiagnostic procedures or other procedures that may be performed using our products could endorse products or methods that compete with our products or otherwise announce positions that are unfavorable to our products. We have experienced this with the professional societies representing the neurology community. Any of these events may negatively affect our sales efforts and result in decreased revenues.\nAs we expand into foreign markets, we will be affected by new business risks that may adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations. Foreign markets represented approximately 19% of our revenues in 2014, compared to 16% of our revenues in 2013. We are working to expand market penetration, particularly in Asia. Any such expansion will subject us to the possibility of new business risks, including:\n\u2022 failure to fulfill foreign regulatory requirements, if applicable, to market our products;\n\u2022 availability of, and changes in, reimbursement within prevailing foreign health care payment systems;\n\u2022 adapting to the differing business practices and laws in foreign countries;\n\u2022 difficulties in managing foreign relationships and operations, including any relationships that we establish with foreign distributors or sales or marketing agents;\n\u2022 limited protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;\n\u2022 difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods;\n\u2022 costs of enforcing contractual obligations in foreign jurisdictions;\n\u2022 recessions in economies outside of the United States;\n\u2022 political instability and unexpected changes in diplomatic and trade relationships;\n\u2022 currency exchange rate fluctuations; and\n\u2022 potentially adverse tax consequences.\nIf we are successful in introducing our products into foreign markets, we will be affected by these additional business risks, which may adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations. In addition, expansion into foreign markets imposes additional burdens on our executive and administrative personnel, research and sales departments, and general managerial resources. Our efforts to introduce our products into foreign markets may not be successful, in which case we may have expended significant resources without realizing the expected benefit.\nOur loan and security agreement with a bank, which we refer to as our credit facility, contains financial and operating restrictions that may limit our access to credit. If we fail to comply with covenants in the credit facility, we may be required to repay any indebtedness thereunder, which may have an adverse effect on our liquidity. Although we have not borrowed any funds under the credit facility, provisions in the credit facility impose restrictions on our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022 incur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022 create liens;\n\u2022 replace certain of our executive officers;\n\u2022 enter into transactions with affiliates;\n\u2022 transfer assets;\n\u2022 pay dividends or make distributions on, or repurchase, our capital stock; and\n\u2022 merge or consolidate.\nIn addition, we are required to meet certain financial covenants customary with this type of credit facility, including maintaining a minimum specified tangible net worth. The credit facility also contains other customary covenants, which we may not be able to comply with in the future. Our failure to comply with these covenants may result in the declaration of an event of default and could cause us to be unable to borrow under the credit facility. In addition to preventing additional borrowings under the credit facility, an event of default, if not cured or waived, may result in the acceleration of the maturity of indebtedness outstanding\nunder the credit facility at the time of the default, which would require us to pay all amounts outstanding. If an event of default occurs, we may not be able to cure it within any applicable cure period, if at all. If the maturity of our indebtedness is accelerated, we may not have sufficient funds available for repayment or we may not have the ability to borrow or obtain sufficient funds to replace the accelerated indebtedness on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nIf we choose to acquire or invest in new businesses, products or technologies, instead of developing them ourselves, these acquisitions or investments could disrupt our business and could result in the use of significant amounts of equity, cash or a combination of both. From time to time we may seek to acquire or invest in businesses, products or technologies, instead of developing them ourselves. Acquisitions and investments involve numerous risks, including:\n\u2022 the inability to complete the acquisition or investment;\n\u2022 disruption of our ongoing businesses and diversion of management attention;\n\u2022 difficulties in integrating the acquired entities, products or technologies;\n\u2022 difficulties in operating the acquired business profitably;\n\u2022 the inability to achieve anticipated synergies, cost savings or growth;\n\u2022 potential loss of key employees, particularly those of the acquired business;\n\u2022 difficulties in transitioning and maintaining key customer, distributor and supplier relationships;\n\u2022 risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience; and\n\u2022 unanticipated costs.\nIn addition, any future acquisitions or investments may result in one or more of the following:\n\u2022 issuances of dilutive equity securities, which may be sold at a discount to market price;\n\u2022 the use of significant amounts of cash;\n\u2022 the incurrence of debt;\n\u2022 the assumption of significant liabilities;\n\u2022 increased operating costs or reduced earnings;\n\u2022 financing obtained on unfavorable terms;\n\u2022 large one-time expenses; and\n\u2022 the creation of certain intangible assets, including goodwill, the write-down of which may result in significant charges to earnings.\nAny of these factors could materially harm our stock price, our business, or our operating results.\nIf we sell additional shares, our stock price may decline as a result of the dilution which will occur to existing stockholders. Until we are profitable, we will need significant additional funds to develop our business and sustain our operations. We sold shares of our stock and warrants in June 2014 and June 2013 and any additional sales of shares of our common stock or other securities exercisable into our common stock are likely to have a dilutive effect on some or all of our then existing stockholders. Resales of newly issued shares in the open market could also have the effect of lowering our stock price, thereby increasing the number of shares we may need to issue in the future to raise the same dollar amount and consequently further diluting our outstanding shares.\nThe perceived risk associated with the possible sale of a large number of shares could cause some of our stockholders to sell their stock, thus causing the price of our stock to decline. In addition, actual or anticipated\ndownward pressure on our stock price due to actual or anticipated issuances or sales of stock could cause some institutions or individuals to engage in short sales of our common stock, which may itself cause the price of our stock to decline.\nIf our stock price declines, we may be unable to raise additional capital. A sustained inability to raise capital could force us to go out of business. Significant declines in the price of our common stock could also impair our ability to attract and retain qualified employees, reduce the liquidity of our common stock and result in the delisting of our common stock from The NASDAQ Stock Market LLC, or NASDAQ.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been volatile and is likely to be volatile in the future. The trading price of our common stock has been highly volatile. For the five year period ended February 1, 2015, our stock price has fluctuated from a low of $1.47 to a high of $95.40. The market price for our common stock will be affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u2022 the denial or delay of regulatory clearances or approvals for our products under development or receipt of regulatory approval of competing products;\n\u2022 our ability to accomplish clinical, regulatory and other product development and commercialization milestones and to do so in accordance with our timing estimates;\n\u2022 changes in policies affecting third-party coverage and reimbursement in the United States and other countries;\n\u2022 changes in government regulations and standards affecting the medical device industry and our products;\n\u2022 ability of our products to achieve market success;\n\u2022 the performance of third-party contract manufacturers and component suppliers;\n\u2022 actual or anticipated variations in our results of operations or those of our competitors;\n\u2022 announcements of new products, technological innovations or product advancements by us or our competitors;\n\u2022 developments with respect to patents and other intellectual property rights;\n\u2022 sales of common stock or other securities by us or our stockholders in the future;\n\u2022 additions or departures of key scientific or management personnel;\n\u2022 disputes or other developments relating to proprietary rights, including patents, litigation matters and our ability to obtain patent protection for our technologies;\n\u2022 trading volume of our common stock;\n\u2022 changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts, failure to obtain or maintain analyst coverage of our common stock or our failure to achieve analyst earnings estimates;\n\u2022 public statements by analysts or clinicians regarding their perceptions of our clinical results or the effectiveness of our products;\n\u2022 decreases in market valuations of medical device companies; and\n\u2022 general market conditions and other factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors.\nThe stock prices of many companies in the medical device industry have experienced wide fluctuations that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies. Periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities can result in securities class action litigation against a company. If class action litigation is initiated against us, we may incur substantial costs and our management\u2019s attention may be diverted from our operations, which could significantly harm our business.\nThere have been instances in the past when we failed to satisfy certain continued listing requirements on NASDAQ and we could fail to satisfy those requirements again in the future which could affect the market price of our common stock and liquidity and reduce our ability to raise capital. Currently, our common stock trades on the NASDAQ Capital Market. During 2012 and 2010 we received notifications from NASDAQ informing us of certain listing deficiencies related to the minimum bid price listing requirements. Although we have since cured these deficiencies, it is possible that we could fall out of compliance again in the future. If we fail to maintain compliance with any NASDAQ listing requirements, we could be delisted and our stock would be considered a penny stock under regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC, and would therefore be subject to rules that impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell our securities. The additional burdens imposed upon broker-dealers by these requirements could discourage broker-dealers from effecting transactions in our common stock, which could severely limit the market liquidity of our common stock and your ability to sell our securities in the secondary market.\nThe low trading volume of our common stock may adversely affect the price of our shares. Although our common stock is listed on the NASDAQ Capital Market, our common stock has experienced low trading volume. The 50 day average trading volume through February 1, 2015 as reported by NASDAQ was approximately 70,300 shares. Limited trading volume may subject our common stock to greater price volatility and may make it difficult for investors to sell shares at a price that is attractive to them.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents and Delaware law, and the shareholder rights plan that we previously adopted in 2007, may discourage or prevent a change of control, even if an acquisition would be beneficial to our stockholders, which could affect our stock price adversely and prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our Board of Directors that our stockholders might consider favorable. Some of these provisions:\n\u2022 authorize the issuance of preferred stock which can be created and issued by the Board of Directors without prior stockholder approval, with rights senior to those of our common stock;\n\u2022 provide for a classified Board of Directors, with each director serving a staggered three-year term;\n\u2022 prohibit our stockholders from filling board vacancies, calling special stockholder meetings, or taking action by written consent;\n\u2022 provide for the removal of a director only with cause and by the affirmative vote of the holders of 75% or more of the shares then entitled to vote at an election of our directors; and\n\u2022 require advance written notice of stockholder proposals and director nominations.\nWe have also adopted a shareholder rights plan that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire, or could discourage a third party from acquiring, us or a large block of our common stock. A third party that acquires 15% or more of our common stock could suffer substantial dilution of its ownership interest under the terms of the shareholder rights plan through the issuance of common stock to all stockholders other than the acquiring person.\nIn addition, we are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which may prohibit certain business combinations with stockholders owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock. These and other provisions in our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and Delaware law could make it more difficult for stockholders or potential acquirers to obtain control of our Board of Directors or initiate actions that are opposed by our then-current Board of Directors, including a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest involving our company. Any delay or prevention of a change of control transaction or changes in our Board of Directors could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nWe do not intend to pay cash dividends. We have never declared or paid cash dividends on our capital stock. We currently intend to retain all available funds and any future earnings for use in the operation and expansion of our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. In addition, the terms of our credit facility precludes us from paying any dividends. As a result, capital appreciation, if any, of our common stock will be our stockholders\u2019 sole source of potential gain for the foreseeable future.", "PERMNO": 90288, "SIC": 3841, "TIC": "NURO"}
