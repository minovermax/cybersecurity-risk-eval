The risks below should be read and considered with other information provided in this report and in other reports and materials we have filed with the SEC. In addition to these risks, other risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results.\nIf we fail to price accurately the risks we underwrite, profitability may be affected.\nOur profitability depends on our ability to set premium rates accurately. Inflationary pressures on medical care, auto parts and repair services costs complicate pricing with accuracy. Accurate pricing is also dependent on the availability of sufficient, reliable data on which to project both severity and frequency trends and timely recognition of changes in loss cost trends. This process poses more of a challenge in markets where we have less pricing experience. We could under-price risks, which could negatively affect our profit margins, or over-price risks, which could reduce sales volume and competitiveness. Either scenario could adversely affect profitability.\nBecause of the significant concentration of our business in California and Florida, negative developments in the regulatory, legal or economic conditions in these states may adversely affect our profitability.\nCalifornia and Florida personal auto business represented 78% of our total gross written premium in 2016. In 2016 our two largest urban zones, Los Angeles and Miami, represented 54% of total gross written premium. Our personal auto business may become further concentrated in these states and within our two largest urban zones. Consequently, the dynamic nature of regulatory, legal, competitive and economic conditions in these states affects our revenues and profitability. Further, both California and Florida have regulations that limit the after-tax return on underwriting profit allowed for an insurer. These conditions could negatively affect premium revenue and make it more expensive or less profitable for us to conduct business in these states.\nWe rely upon a limited number of independent agents to generate a substantial portion of our business. If we were unable to retain or increase the level of business that these independent agents place with us or increase the level of business generated by other agents, our revenues would be negatively affected.\nApproximately 15% of our 10,800 independent agencies and brokers accounted for approximately 80% of our gross written premium in 2016. Further, in California, 54 agencies and brokers produced 50% of our premium in the state, accounting for 25% of our premium nationwide, and in Florida, 31 independent agents and brokers produced 50% of gross written premium in the state, accounting for 15% of our premium nationwide.\nWe must compete with other insurance carriers for the business of these agents in an increasingly competitive marketplace. Some competitors offer more advanced systems to quote and process business, a larger variety of products, lower prices for insurance coverage, higher commissions or more attractive cash and non-cash incentives. In addition, some of our current agencies may merge or be acquired and the surviving entity may reduce the number of insurers with which business is placed.\nIf we fail to establish accurate loss reserves, our financial position and results of operations may be affected.\nOur loss reserves are our best estimate of the amounts that will be paid for losses incurred as well as losses incurred but not reported. The accuracy of these estimates depends on a number of factors, including but not limited to the availability of sufficient and reliable historical data, inflationary pressures on medical and auto repair costs, changes in regulation, changes in frequency and severity trends and changes in our claims settlement practices. Because of the inherent uncertainty involved in the practice of establishing loss reserves, ultimate losses paid could vary materially from recorded reserves and may adversely affect our operating results.\nWe are vulnerable to a reduction in business written through the independent agent distribution channel.\nReliance on the independent agency as our primary distribution channel makes us vulnerable to the growing popularity of direct to consumer distribution channels, particularly the Internet. Approximately 73% of all personal automobile insurance sold in the United States is sold direct or through captive agents (agents employed by one company or selling only one company's products) and approximately 27% is sold by independent agents. A material reduction in business generated through the independent agency channel could negatively affect our revenues and growth opportunities.\nINFINITY PROPERTY AND CASUALTY CORPORATION 10-K\nJudicial, regulatory and legislative changes or challenges to prevailing insurance industry practices as well as technology innovations are ongoing, and could adversely affect our revenue or operating results.\nPolitical, judicial, economic and financial developments occasionally lead to challenges or changes to established industry practices. Examples include challenges to (i) the use of credit and other rating factors in making risk selection and pricing decisions; and (ii) how Florida Personal Injury Protection (PIP) payments to providers are calculated. It is difficult to predict the outcome or impact of current challenges or to identify others that might be brought in the future, but some could result in class action litigation, regulatory sanctions and substantial fines or penalties. In addition, auto technology advancements such as driverless cars, and emerging business models, including transportation network companies and usage-based insurance, could materially impact our revenue over time.\nThe failure to maintain or to develop further reliable, efficient and secure information technology systems would be disruptive to our operations and diminish our ability to compete successfully.\nWe are highly dependent on efficient and uninterrupted performance of our information technology and business systems. These systems quote, process and service our business, and perform actuarial functions necessary for pricing and product development. These systems must also be able to undergo periodic modifications and improvements without interruptions or untimely delays in service. This capability is crucial to meeting growing customer demands for user friendly, online capabilities and convenient, quality service. We are undergoing fundamental changes and improvements to our information technology (IT) platform. A failure or delay to achieve these improvements could interrupt certain processes or degrade business operations and could place us at a competitive disadvantage. Additionally, failure to maintain secure systems could result in unauthorized access to or theft of sensitive customer or company data, misappropriation of funds or disruption to our systems.\nThe inability to recruit, develop and retain key personnel could prevent us from executing our key business and financial objectives.\nThe highly competitive nature of our industry, along with the advantages that larger, better-known firms possess in the recruiting process, poses a challenge with respect to both employee retention and recruitment efforts. Successful execution of our key business and financial objectives depends, in part, on our ability to retain, develop or find qualified successors for key personnel, including our Chief Executive Officer, James Gober, and our other four named executive officers - each of whom, with the exception of our chief financial officer, has an employment agreement that expires in August 2017. The announcement of the loss of key personnel or the delay or inability to retain or appoint successors could negatively affect our stock price, our retention of other key personnel, or hinder us in achieving our business and financial objectives given the specialized knowledge of each of our executive officers and the limited pool of candidates with experience relevant to our operations.\nExtra-contractual losses arising from bad faith claims could materially reduce our profitability.\nIn California and Florida, courts and laws are often viewed as unfavorable toward an insurer in litigation brought against it by policyholders and third-party claimants. This tends to increase our exposure to monetary damages beyond policy limits, in what are commonly referred to as \"extra-contractual\" or \"bad faith\" claims. Such claims may result in losses that materially reduce our profitability.\nOur goodwill may be at risk for impairment if actual results regarding growth and profitability vary from our estimates.\nAt December 31, 2016, we had $75.3 million, or approximately $6.82 per share, of goodwill. In accordance with the Goodwill topic of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification, we perform impairment test procedures for goodwill on an annual basis. These procedures require us to calculate the fair value of goodwill, compare the result to our carrying value and record the amount of any shortfall as an impairment charge.\nWe use a variety of methods to test goodwill for impairment, including estimates of future discounted cash flows and comparisons of our market value to our major competitors. Our cash flow projections rely on assumptions that are subject to uncertainty, including premium growth, loss and loss adjustment expense ratios, interest rates and capital requirements. If actual results differ significantly from these assumptions, the fair value of our goodwill could fall below our carrying value and we could be required to record an impairment charge.\nINFINITY PROPERTY AND CASUALTY CORPORATION 10-K", "PERMNO": 89681, "SIC": 6331, "TIC": "IPCC"}
