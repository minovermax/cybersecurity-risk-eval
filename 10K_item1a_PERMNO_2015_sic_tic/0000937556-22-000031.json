RISK FACTORS\nThe following risk factors and other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we presently deem less significant may also impair our business operations. If any of the following risks come to fruition, our business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects would likely be materially and adversely affected. In these circumstances, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nSummary of Material Risk Factors\nBelow is a summary of the principal factors that make an investment in our securities speculative or risky. This summary does not address all of the risks that we face. Additional discussion of the risks summarized in this summary, and other risks that we face, can be found following this summary and should be carefully considered together with all of the other information appearing in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n\u2022We currently derive the majority of our revenue from our Masimo SET\u00ae platform, Masimo rainbow SET\u00ae platform and related products. If these technologies and related products do not continue to achieve market acceptance, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.\n\u2022Some of our products are in development or have been recently introduced into the market and may not achieve market acceptance, which could limit our growth and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022Our ability to commercialize new products, new or improved technologies and additional applications for Masimo SET\u00ae and our licensed rainbow\u00ae technology is limited to certain markets by our Cross-Licensing Agreement with Cercacor Laboratories, Inc. (Cercacor), which may impair our growth and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022We face competition from other companies, many of which have substantially greater resources than we do. If we do not successfully develop and commercialize enhanced or new products that remain competitive with products or alternative technologies developed by others, we could lose revenue opportunities and customers, and our ability to grow our business would be impaired, adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022We depend on our domestic and international OEM partners for a portion of our revenue. If they do not devote sufficient resources to the promotion of products that use our technologies, our business would be harmed.\n\u2022If we fail to maintain or develop relationships with GPOs, sales of our products would decline.\n\u2022Inadequate levels of coverage or reimbursement from governmental or other third-party payers for our products, or for procedures using our products, may cause our revenue to decline or prevent us from realizing revenues from future products.\n\u2022Consolidation in the healthcare industry could lead to demands for price concessions or to the exclusion of existing market participants from certain markets, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\n\u2022Our customers may reduce, delay or cancel purchases due to a variety of factors, such as lower hospital census levels or third-party guidelines, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022The loss of any large customer or distributor, or any cancellation or delay of a significant purchase by a large customer, could reduce our net sales and harm our operating results.\n\u2022Counterfeit Masimo sensors and third-party reprocessed single-patient-use Masimo sensors may harm our reputation. Also, these counterfeit and third-party reprocessed sensors, as well as genuine Masimo reprocessed sensors, are sold at lower prices than new Masimo sensors and could cause our revenue to decline, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\u2022If the patents we own or license, or our other intellectual property rights, do not adequately protect our technologies, we may lose market share to our competitors and be unable to operate our business profitably.\n\u2022If third parties claim that we infringe their intellectual property rights, we may incur liabilities and costs and may have to redesign or discontinue selling certain products.\n\u2022We believe competitors may currently be violating and may in the future violate our intellectual property rights. As a result, we may initiate litigation to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights, which may result in substantial expense and may divert management\u2019s attention from implementing our business strategy.\n\u2022The laws of foreign countries may not adequately protect our intellectual property rights.\n\u2022Our failure to obtain and maintain FDA clearances or approvals on a timely basis, or at all, would prevent us from commercializing our current, upgraded or new products in the U.S., which could severely harm our business.\n\u2022The failure of our OEM partners to obtain required FDA clearances or approvals for products that incorporate our technologies could have a negative impact on our revenue.\n\u2022If we or our suppliers fail to comply with ongoing regulatory requirements, or if we experience unanticipated problems with our products, these products could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market.\n\u2022Failure to obtain regulatory authorizations in foreign jurisdictions may prevent us from marketing our products abroad.\n\u2022Modifications to our marketed devices may require new regulatory clearances or premarket approvals, or may require us to cease marketing or to recall the modified devices until clearances or approvals are obtained.\n\u2022Regulatory reforms may impact our ability to develop and commercialize our products and technologies.\n\u2022If our products cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, or malfunction in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, we will be subject to medical device reporting regulations, and may need to initiate voluntary corrective actions or in certain circumstances be required to take corrective actions, such as the recall of our products.\n\u2022Promotion of our products using claims that are off-label, unsubstantiated, false or misleading could subject us to substantial penalties.\n\u2022The regulatory environment governing information, cybersecurity and privacy is increasingly demanding and continues to evolve.\n\u2022We may be subject to or otherwise affected by federal and state healthcare laws, including fraud and abuse laws, and could face substantial penalties if we are unable to fully comply with these laws.\n\u2022Legislative and regulatory changes in the healthcare industry could have a negative impact on our financial performance. Furthermore, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be significantly and adversely affected by healthcare reform legislation in the U.S. or in our key international markets.\n\u2022Our business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\u2022If our employees become ill or otherwise incapacitated, our operations may be adversely impacted.\n\u2022We may experience conflicts of interest with Cercacor with respect to business opportunities and other matters.\n\u2022We will be required to assign to Cercacor and pay Cercacor for the right to use certain products and technologies we develop that relate to the monitoring of non-vital sign parameters, including improvements to Masimo SET\u00ae.\n\u2022In the event that the Cross-Licensing Agreement is terminated for any reason, or Cercacor grants a license to rainbow\u00ae technology to a third-party, our business would be adversely affected.\n\u2022We may not be able to commercialize our products incorporating licensed rainbow\u00ae technology cost-effectively or successfully.\n\u2022Rights provided to Cercacor in the Cross-Licensing Agreement may impede a change in control of our company.\n\u2022If we are unable to obtain key materials and components from sole or limited source suppliers, we will not be able to deliver our products to customers.\n\u2022Future strategic initiatives, including acquisitions of businesses and strategic investments, could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations if we fail to integrate the acquired businesses successfully into our existing operations or achieve the desired results of our investment.\n\u2022Our new products and changes to existing products as a result of our proposed acquisition of Sound United could fail to attract or retain users or generate revenue and profits. Further, we may not be successful in our personal consumer strategy and investments, which could adversely affect our business, reputation or financial results.\n\u2022Our credit agreement contains certain covenants and restrictions that may limit our flexibility in operating our business.\n\u2022Our proposed new debt facility, which will be used to partially fund our pending acquisition of Sound United, may restrict our future operations, including our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions. If we fail to comply with the covenants and other obligations under the proposed credit facility, the lender may be able to accelerate amounts owed under the facility.\n\u2022Concentration of ownership of our stock among our existing directors, executive officers and principal stockholders may prevent new investors from influencing significant corporate decisions.\n\u2022Our corporate documents and Delaware law contain provisions that could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company, prevent attempts to replace or remove current management and reduce the market price of our stock.\n\u2022Our bylaws provide that the state or federal courts located within the State of Delaware are the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nRisks Related to Our Revenues\nWe currently derive the majority of our revenue from our Masimo SET\u00ae platform, Masimo rainbow SET\u00ae platform and related products. If these technologies and related products do not continue to achieve market acceptance, our business, financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected.\nWe are highly dependent upon the continued success and market acceptance of our proprietary Masimo SET\u00ae and Masimo rainbow SET\u00ae technologies that serve as the basis of our primary product offerings. Continued market acceptance of products incorporating these technologies will depend upon us continuing to provide evidence to the medical community that our products are cost-effective and offer significantly improved performance compared to conventional pulse oximeters. Healthcare providers that currently have significant investments in competitive pulse oximetry products may be reluctant to purchase our products. If hospitals and other healthcare providers do not believe our Masimo SET\u00ae and Masimo rainbow SET\u00ae platforms are cost-effective, safe or more accurate or reliable than competitive pulse oximetry products, they may not buy our products in sufficient quantities to enable us to generate revenue growth from the sale of these products. In addition, allegations regarding the safety and effectiveness of our products, whether or not substantiated, may impair or impede the acceptance of our products.\nSome of our products are in development or have been recently introduced into the market and may not achieve market acceptance, which could limit our growth and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMany of our noninvasive measurement technologies are considered disruptive. These technologies have performance levels that we believe are acceptable for many clinical environments but may be insufficient in others. In addition, these technologies may perform better in some patients and settings than others. Over time, we hope to continue to improve the performance of these technologies and educate the clinical community on how to properly evaluate them. If we are successful in these endeavors, we expect these technologies will become more useful in more environments and will become more widely adopted. Our product portfolio continues to expand, and we are investing significant resources to enter into, and in some cases create, new markets for these products. We are continuing to invest in sales and marketing resources to achieve market acceptance of these products, but are unable to guarantee that our technologies will achieve general market acceptance.\nThe degree of market acceptance of these products will depend on a number of factors, including but not limited to:\n\u2022perceived clinical benefits from our products;\n\u2022perceived cost effectiveness of our products;\n\u2022perceived safety and effectiveness of our products;\n\u2022reimbursement available through government and private healthcare programs for using some of our products; and\n\u2022introduction and acceptance of competing products or technologies.\nIf our products do not gain market acceptance or if our customers prefer our competitors\u2019 products, our potential revenue growth would be limited, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to commercialize new products, new or improved technologies and additional applications for Masimo SET\u00ae and our licensed rainbow\u00ae technology is limited to certain markets by our Cross-Licensing Agreement with Cercacor Laboratories, Inc. (Cercacor), which may impair our growth and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSince 1998, we have been a party to a cross-licensing agreement with Cercacor, (as amended, the Cross-Licensing Agreement), under which we granted Cercacor:\n\u2022an exclusive, perpetual and worldwide license, with sublicense rights, to use all Masimo SET\u00ae technology owned by us, including all improvements to this technology, for the monitoring of non-vital signs parameters and to develop and sell devices incorporating Masimo SET\u00ae for monitoring non-vital signs parameters in any product market in which a product is intended to be used by a patient or pharmacist rather than by a professional medical caregiver, which we refer to as the \u201cCercacor Market\u201d; and\n\u2022a non-exclusive, perpetual and worldwide license, with sublicense rights, to use all Masimo SET\u00ae technology owned by us for measurement of vital signs in the \u201cCercacor Market\u201d.\nNon-vital signs measurements consist of body fluid constituents other than vital signs measurements, including, but not limited to, carbon monoxide, methemoglobin, blood glucose, hemoglobin and bilirubin. Under the Cross-Licensing Agreement, we are only permitted to sell devices utilizing Masimo SET\u00ae for the monitoring of non-vital signs parameters in markets where the product is intended to be used by a professional medical caregiver, including, but not limited to, hospital caregivers and alternate care facility caregivers, rather than by a patient or pharmacist, which we refer to as the \u201cMasimo Market\u201d.\nAccordingly, our ability to commercialize new products, new or improved technologies and additional applications for Masimo SET\u00ae is limited. In particular, our inability to expand beyond the \u201cMasimo Market\u201d may limit our ability to maintain or increase our revenue and impair our growth.\nPursuant to the Cross-Licensing Agreement, we have licensed from Cercacor the right to make and distribute products in the \u201cMasimo Market\u201d that utilize rainbow\u00ae technology for certain noninvasive measurements. As a result, the opportunity to expand the market for our products incorporating rainbow\u00ae technology is also limited, which could limit our ability to maintain or increase our revenue and impair our growth.\nWe face competition from other companies, many of which have substantially greater resources than we do. If we do not successfully develop and commercialize enhanced or new products that remain competitive with products or alternative technologies developed by others, we could lose revenue opportunities and customers, and our ability to grow our business would be impaired, adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe medical device industry is intensely competitive and is significantly affected by new product introductions and other market activities of industry participants. A number of our competitors have substantially greater capital resources, larger product portfolios, larger customer bases, larger sales forces and greater geographic presence, have established stronger reputations with specific customers, and have built relationships with Group Purchasing Organizations and other hospital purchasing groups (collectively, GPOs) that may be more effective than ours. Our Masimo SET\u00ae platform faces additional competition from companies developing products for use with third-party monitoring systems, as well as from companies that currently market their own pulse oximetry monitors. In addition, competitors with larger product portfolios than ours are engaging in bundling practices, whereby they offer increased discounts to hospitals that purchase their requirements for a variety of different products from the competitor, including products that we do not offer, effectively pricing their competing products at a loss.\nContinuing technological advances and new product introductions within the medical device industry place our products at risk of obsolescence. Our long-term success depends upon the development and successful commercialization of new products, new or improved technologies and additional applications for our existing technologies. The research and development process is time-consuming and costly and may not result in products or applications that we can successfully commercialize. In particular, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our products for applications other than arterial blood oxygen saturation and pulse rate monitoring, such as for respiration rate, hemoglobin, carboxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin monitoring. In addition, we may not be able to develop and successfully commercialize new products and technologies that we acquire.\nIf we do not successfully adapt our products and applications both within and outside these measurements, we could lose revenue opportunities and customers. Furthermore, one or more of our competitors may develop products that are substantially equivalent to those of our products that are cleared or approved for use, or those of our original equipment manufacturer (OEM) partners, in which case a competitor of ours may use our products or those of our OEM partners as predicate devices to more quickly obtain regulatory clearance or approval of their competing products. Competition could result in pressure from our customers to reduce the price of our products and could cause them to place fewer orders for our products, which could, in turn, cause a reduction in our revenues and product gross margins, thereby adversely impacting our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSome of the world\u2019s largest technology companies that have not historically operated in the healthcare or medical device space, such as Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com, Inc., Apple Inc., Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. and others, have developed or may develop products and technologies that may compete with our current or future products and technologies. For example, in September 2020, Apple, Inc. announced that its Apple Watch Series 6 includes a pulse oximetry monitoring feature, which may compete with certain of our existing products and products in development, including the consumer versions of our iSpO2\u00ae and MightySat\u00ae pulse oximeters. In addition, in September 2021, Apple, Inc. announced that its Apple Watch Series 7 includes a blood oxygen level monitoring feature and a sleep tracking function, both of which compete with our existing products. These companies have substantially greater capital, research and development, and sales resources than we have. To effectively compete, we may need to expand our product offerings and distribution channels, which in the interim could increase our research and development costs and decrease our operating margins, thereby adversely impacting our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on our domestic and international OEM partners for a portion of our revenue. If they do not devote sufficient resources to the promotion of products that use our technologies, our business would be harmed.\nWe are, and will continue to be, dependent upon our domestic and international OEM partners for a portion of our revenue through their marketing, selling and distribution of certain of their products that incorporate our technologies. Although we expect that our OEM partners will accept and actively market, sell and distribute products that incorporate our technologies, they may not do so. Because products that incorporate our technologies may represent a relatively small percentage of business for some of our OEM partners, they may have less incentive to promote these products over other products that do not incorporate these technologies.\nIn addition, some of our OEM partners offer products that compete with ours and also may be involved in intellectual property disputes with us. Therefore, we cannot guarantee that our OEM partners, or any company that may acquire any of our OEM partners, will vigorously promote products incorporating our technologies. The failure of our OEM partners to successfully market, sell or distribute products incorporating our technologies, the termination of OEM agreements, the loss of OEM partners or the inability to enter into future OEM partnership agreements would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to maintain or develop relationships with GPOs, sales of our products would decline.\nOur ability to sell our products to hospitals depends, in part, on our relationships with GPOs. Many existing and potential customers for our products are members of GPOs. GPOs negotiate pricing arrangements and contracts with medical supply manufacturers and distributors that may include provisions for sole sourcing and bundling, which generally reduce the choices available to member hospitals.\nThese negotiated prices are made available to a GPO\u2019s members. If we are not one of the providers selected by a GPO, the GPO\u2019s members may be less likely or unlikely to purchase our products. If a GPO has negotiated a strict sole source, market share compliance or bundling contract for another manufacturer\u2019s products, we may be prohibited from making sales to members of such GPO for the duration of such contractual arrangement. Shipments of our pulse oximetry products to customers that are members of GPOs represent approximately 90% of our U.S. product sales. Our failure to renew our contracts with GPOs may cause us to lose market share and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, if we are unable to develop new relationships with GPOs, our competitive position would likely suffer and our opportunities to grow our revenues and business would be harmed.\nInadequate levels of coverage or reimbursement from governmental or other third-party payers for our products, or for procedures using our products, may cause our revenue to decline or prevent us from realizing revenues from future products.\nSales of our products depend in part on the reimbursement and coverage policies of governmental and private healthcare payers. The lack of adequate coverage and reimbursement for our products or the procedures in which our products are used may deter customers from purchasing our products.\nWe cannot guarantee that governmental or third-party payers will reimburse or begin reimbursing a customer for the cost of our products or the procedures in which our products are used. For example, some insurance carriers have issued policies denying coverage for transcutaneous hemoglobin measurement on the grounds that the technology is investigational in the outpatient setting. Other payers are continuing to investigate our products to determine if they will provide reimbursement for the use of such products.\nThese trends could lead to pressure to reduce prices for our current and future products, hinder our ability to obtain market adoption, cause a decrease in the size of the market or potentially increase competition, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe do not control payer decision-making with respect to coverage and payment levels for our products. Additionally, we expect many payers to continue to explore cost-containment strategies (e.g., comparative and cost-effectiveness analyses, so-called \u201cpay-for-performance\u201d programs implemented by various public government healthcare programs and private third-party payers, and expansion of payment bundling initiatives, and other such methods that shift medical cost risk to providers) that may potentially impact coverage and/or payment levels for our current products or products we develop in the future.\nOutside of the U.S., reimbursement systems vary by country. These systems are often subject to the same pressures to curb rising healthcare costs and control healthcare expenditures as those in the U.S. In addition, as economies of emerging markets develop, these countries may implement changes in their healthcare delivery and payment systems. If adequate levels of reimbursement from third-party payers outside of the U.S. are not obtained, sales of our products outside of the U.S. may be adversely affected.\nConsolidation in the healthcare industry could lead to demands for price concessions or to the exclusion of existing market participants from certain markets, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nBecause healthcare costs have risen significantly over the past decade, numerous initiatives and reforms initiated by legislators, regulators and third-party payers to curb these costs have resulted in a consolidation trend in the healthcare industry to aggregate purchasing power. As the healthcare industry consolidates, competition to provide products and services to industry participants has become, and will continue to become, more intense. This has resulted in, and will likely continue to result in, greater pricing pressures and the exclusion of certain existing market participants from important market segments as GPOs, independent delivery networks and large single accounts continue to use their market power to consolidate purchasing decisions for hospitals.\nWe expect that market demand, government regulation, third-party coverage and reimbursement policies and societal pressures will continue to impact the worldwide healthcare industry, resulting in further business consolidations and alliances among our customers, which may reduce competition, exert further downward pressure on the prices of our products and adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur customers may reduce, delay or cancel purchases due to a variety of factors, such as lower hospital census levels or third-party guidelines, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur customers are facing growing levels of uncertainties, including variations in overall hospital census for paying patients and the impact of such census variations on hospital budgets. As a result, many hospitals are reevaluating their entire cost structure, including the amount of capital they allocate to medical device technologies and products. In addition, certain of our products, including our rainbow\u00ae measurements such as carbon monoxide, methemoglobin and hemoglobin, that are sold with upfront license fees and more complex and expensive sensors, could also be impacted by hospital budget reductions. Any reductions in capital spending budgets by hospitals could have a significant negative impact on our OEM customers who, due to their traditionally larger capital equipment sales model, could see declines in purchases from their hospital customers. This, in turn, could reduce our board sales to our OEM customers.\nFrom time to time, states and other local regulatory authorities may issue guidelines regarding the appropriate scope and use of our products. For example, some of our noninvasive monitoring devices may be subject to authorization by individual states as part of the Emergency Medical Services (EMS) scope of practice procedures. A lack of inclusion into scope of practice procedures may limit adoption of our products.\nAdditionally, increases in demand resulting from global medical crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic may be short lived. If the increased demand results in a stockpiling of our products by, or excess inventory at, our customers, future orders may be delayed or canceled until such on-hand inventory is consumed.\nThe loss of any large customer or distributor, or any cancellation or delay of a significant purchase by a large customer, could reduce our net sales and harm our operating results.\nWe have a concentration of OEM, distributor and direct customers. For example, sales to two just-in-time distributors each represented 10% or more of our product sales for the year ended January 1, 2022. We cannot provide any assurances that we will retain our current customers, groups of customers or distributors, or that we will be able to attract and retain additional customers in the future. If for any reason we were to lose our ability to sell to a specific group or class of customers or through a distributor, we could experience a significant reduction in revenue, which would adversely impact our operating results.\nOur sales could also be negatively affected by any rebates, discounts or fees that are required by, or offered to, GPOs and customers, including wholesalers or distributors. Additionally, some of our just-in-time distributors have been demanding higher fees, which we may be obligated to pay in order to continue to offer products to our customers through these distributors or which may obligate us to distribute our products directly to our customers. The loss of any large customer or distributor, an increase in distributor fees, or the risks associated with selling directly to our customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCounterfeit Masimo sensors and third-party reprocessed single-patient-use Masimo sensors may harm our reputation. Also, these counterfeit and third-party reprocessed sensors, as well as genuine Masimo reprocessed sensors, are sold at lower prices than new Masimo sensors and could cause our revenue to decline, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe believe that other entities are manufacturing and selling counterfeit Masimo sensors. In addition, certain medical device reprocessors have been collecting our used single-patient-use sensors from hospitals and then reprocessing, repackaging and reselling those sensors to hospitals. These counterfeit and third-party reprocessed sensors are sold at lower prices than new Masimo sensors. Our experience with both these counterfeit sensors and third-party reprocessed sensors is that they provide inferior performance, increased sensor consumption, reduced comfort and a number of monitoring problems. Notwithstanding these limitations, some of our customers have indicated a willingness to purchase some of their sensor requirements from these counterfeit manufacturers and third-party reprocessors in an effort to reduce their sensor costs.\nThese counterfeit and reprocessed sensors have led and may continue to lead to confusion with our genuine Masimo products, have reduced and may continue to reduce our revenue, and, in some cases, have harmed and may continue to harm our reputation if customers conclude incorrectly that these counterfeit or reprocessed sensors are original Masimo sensors.\nIn addition, we have expended a significant amount of time and expense investigating issues caused by counterfeit and reprocessed sensors, troubleshooting problems stemming from such sensors, educating customers about why counterfeit and reprocessed sensors do not perform to their expectations, enforcing our proprietary rights against the counterfeit manufacturers and reprocessors, and enforcing our contractual rights.\nIn response to these counterfeit sensors and third-party reprocessors, we have incorporated X-Cal\u00ae technology into certain products to ensure our customers get the performance they expect by using genuine Masimo sensors and that such sensors do not continue to be used beyond their useful life. However, some customers may object to the X-Cal\u00ae technology, potentially resulting in the loss of customers and revenues.\nWe also offer our own Masimo reprocessed sensors, which meet the same performance specifications as our new Masimo sensors, to our customers. Reprocessed sensors sold by us are also offered at a lower price and, therefore, may reduce certain customer demand for our new sensors. As a result, increased sales of our own Masimo reprocessed sensors may result in lower revenues, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nIf the patents we own or license, or our other intellectual property rights, do not adequately protect our technologies, we may lose market share to our competitors and be unable to operate our business profitably.\nOur success depends significantly on our ability to protect our rights to the technologies used in our products. Our utilization of patent protection, trade secrets and a combination of copyright and trademark laws, as well as nondisclosure, confidentiality and other contractual arrangements, to protect our intellectual property afford us only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or maintain any competitive advantage.\nCertain of our patents related to our technologies have begun to expire. Upon the expiration of our issued or licensed patents, we generally lose some of our rights to exclude competitors from making, using, selling or importing products using the technology based on the expired patents.\nFurthermore, in recent years, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled on several patent cases and several laws have been enacted that, in certain situations, potentially narrow the scope of patent protection available and weaken the rights of patent owners. As a result, we believe large technology companies may be pursuing an \u201cefficient infringement\u201d strategy, having concluded that it is cheaper to infringe third party intellectual property rights than to acquire, license or otherwise respect them. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in securing additional patents on commercially desirable improvements, that such additional patents will adequately protect our innovations or offset the effect of expiring patents, or that competitors will not be able to design around our patents.\nIn addition, third parties have challenged, and may continue to challenge, our issued patents through procedures such as Inter-Partes Review (IPR). In many IPR challenges, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) cancels or significantly narrows issued patent claims. IPR challenges could increase the uncertainties and costs associated with the maintenance, enforcement and defense of our issued and future patents and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe also utilize unpatented proprietary technology and know-how and often rely on confidentiality agreements and intellectual property assignment agreements with our employees, OEM partners, independent distributors and consultants to protect such unpatented proprietary technology and know-how. However, such agreements may not be enforceable or may not provide meaningful protection for our proprietary information in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure or other breaches of the agreements, or in the event that our competitors discover or independently develop similar or identical designs or other proprietary information.\nWe rely on the use of registered and common law trademarks with respect to the brand names of some of our products. Common law trademarks provide less protection than registered trademarks. Loss of rights in our trademarks could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf third parties claim that we infringe their intellectual property rights, we may incur liabilities and costs and may have to redesign or discontinue selling certain products.\nSearching for existing intellectual property rights may not reveal important intellectual property and our competitors may also have filed for patent protection, which may not be publicly-available information, or claimed trademark rights that have not been revealed through our searches. In addition, some of our employees were previously employed at other medical device companies. We may be subject to claims that our employees have disclosed, or that we have used, trade secrets or other proprietary information of our employees\u2019 former employers. Our efforts to identify and avoid infringing on third parties\u2019 intellectual property rights may not always be successful. Any claims of patent or other intellectual property infringement against us, even those without merit, could:\n\u2022be expensive and time-consuming to defend and result in payment of significant damages to third parties;\n\u2022force us to stop making or selling products that incorporate the intellectual property;\n\u2022require us to redesign, reengineer or rebrand our products, product candidates and technologies;\n\u2022require us to enter into royalty agreements that would increase the costs of our products;\n\u2022require us to indemnify third parties pursuant to contracts in which we have agreed to provide indemnification for intellectual property infringement claims;\n\u2022divert the attention of our management and other key employees; and\n\u2022result in our customers or potential customers deferring or limiting their purchase or use of the affected products impacted by the claims until the claims are resolved;\nany of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, new patents obtained by our competitors could threaten the continued commercialization of our products in the market even after they have already been introduced.\nWe believe competitors may currently be violating and may in the future violate our intellectual property rights. As a result, we may initiate litigation to protect and enforce our intellectual property rights, which may result in substantial expense and may divert management\u2019s attention from implementing our business strategy.\nWe believe that the success of our business depends, in part, on obtaining patent protection for our products and technologies, defending our patents and preserving our trade secrets. We were previously involved in significant litigation to protect our patent positions related to some of our pulse oximetry signal processing patents that resulted in various settlements. We believe some of the new market entrants in the healthcare and monitoring space, including some of the world\u2019s largest technology companies, may be infringing our intellectual property, and we may be required to engage in additional litigation to protect our intellectual property in the future. In addition, we believe that certain individuals who previously held high level technical and clinical positions with us misappropriated our intellectual property for the benefit of themselves and other companies. For example, on January 9, 2020, we initiated litigation against Apple Inc. for infringement of a number of patents, for trade secret misappropriation and for ownership and correction of inventorship of a number of Apple Inc. patents that list one of our former employees as an inventor. Our ongoing and future litigation could result in significant additional costs and further divert the attention of our management and key personnel from our business operations and the implementation of our business strategy and may not be successful or adequate to protect our intellectual property rights.\nThe laws of foreign countries may not adequately protect our intellectual property rights.\nIntellectual property protection laws in foreign countries differ substantially from those in the U.S. If we fail to apply for intellectual property protection in foreign countries, or if we cannot adequately protect our intellectual property rights in these foreign countries, our competitors may be able to compete more effectively against us, which could adversely affect our competitive position, as well as our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Regulatory Environment\nOur failure to obtain and maintain FDA clearances or approvals on a timely basis, or at all, would prevent us from commercializing our current, upgraded or new products in the U.S., which could severely harm our business.\nUnless an exemption applies, each medical device that we market in the U.S. must first undergo premarket review pursuant to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) by receiving clearance of a 510(k) premarket notification, receiving clearance through the de novo classification review process or obtaining approval of a premarket approval (PMA) application. Even if regulatory clearance or approval of a product is granted, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) may clear or approve our products only for limited indications for use. Additionally, the FDA may not grant 510(k) clearance on a timely basis, if at all, for new products or new uses that we propose for Masimo SET\u00ae or licensed rainbow\u00ae technology.\nThe traditional FDA 510(k) clearance process for our products has generally taken between four to nine months. However, our more recent experience and interactions with the FDA, along with information we have received from other medical device manufacturers, suggests that, in some cases, the FDA is requiring applicants to provide additional or different information and data for 510(k) clearance than it had previously required, and that the FDA may not rely on approaches that it had previously accepted to support 510(k) clearance. As a result, FDA 510(k) clearance can be delayed for our products in some cases.\nTo support our product applications to the FDA, we frequently are required to conduct clinical testing of our products. Such clinical testing must be conducted in compliance with FDA requirements pertaining to human research. Among other requirements, we must obtain informed consent from study subjects and approval by institutional review boards before such studies may begin. We must also comply with other FDA requirements such as monitoring, record-keeping, reporting and the submission of information regarding certain clinical trials to a public database maintained by the National Institutes of Health. In addition, if the study involves a significant risk device, we are required to obtain the FDA\u2019s approval of the study under an Investigational Device Exemption (IDE). Compliance with these requirements can require significant time and resources. In addition, public health emergencies and other extraordinary circumstances may disrupt the conduct of our clinical trials. If the FDA determines that we have not complied with such requirements, the FDA may refuse to consider the data to support our applications or may initiate enforcement actions.\nEven though 510(k) clearances have been obtained, if safety or effectiveness problems are identified with our products, we may need to initiate a recall of such products. Furthermore, our new products or significantly modified marketed products could be\ndenied 510(k) clearance and be required to undergo the more burdensome PMA or de novo classification review processes. The process of obtaining a de novo classification or PMA approval is much more costly, lengthy and uncertain than the process for obtaining 510(k) clearance.\nDe novo classification review generally takes six months to one year from the time of submission of the de novo request, although it can take longer. Approval of a PMA generally takes one year from the time of submission of the PMA, but may be longer.\nWe sell consumer versions of our iSpO2\u00ae and MightySat\u00ae pulse oximeters that are not intended for medical use. Some of our products or product features may not be subject to the 510(k) process and/or other regulatory requirements in accordance with specific FDA guidance and policies, such as the FDA guidance related to mobile medical applications. In addition, some of our products or product features may not be subject to device regulation pursuant to Section 520(o) of the FDCA, which excludes certain software functions from the statutory definition of a device. In addition, we may market certain products pursuant to enforcement discretion policies the FDA previously announced to address the need for these products as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Such policies only remain in effect during the public health emergency, such that we will need to seek clearance or approval of such products to continue marketing these products at the end of the COVID-19 pandemic. If the FDA changes its policies or concludes that our marketing of these products is not in accordance with its current policies and/or Section 520(o) of the FDCA, we may be required to seek clearance or approval of these devices through the 510(k), de novo classification review or PMA processes.\nThe failure of our OEM partners to obtain required FDA clearances or approvals for products that incorporate our technologies could have a negative impact on our revenue.\nOur OEM partners are required to obtain their own FDA clearances in the U.S. for most products incorporating Masimo technologies. The FDA clearances we have obtained may not make it easier for our OEM partners to obtain clearances of products incorporating these technologies, or the FDA may not grant clearances on a timely basis, if at all, for any future products incorporating Masimo technologies that our OEM partners propose to market.\nIf we or our suppliers fail to comply with ongoing regulatory requirements, or if we experience unanticipated problems with our products, these products could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market.\nOur products, along with the manufacturing processes, labeling and promotional activities for our products, are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory bodies. Among other requirements, we and certain of our suppliers are required to comply with the FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulation (QSR), which governs the methods and documentation of the design, control testing, production, component suppliers control, quality assurance, complaint handling, labeling control, packaging, storage and shipping of our products. The FDA enforces the QSR through announced and unannounced inspections. We are also subject to similar state requirements and licenses.\nIn addition to the FDA, from time to time we are subject to inspections by the California Food and Drug Branch, international regulatory authorities and other similar governmental agencies. The standards used by these regulatory authorities are complex and may differ from those used by the FDA.\nFailure by us or one of our suppliers to comply with statutes and regulations administered by the FDA and other regulatory bodies or failure to adequately respond to any FDA Form 483 observations, any California Food and Drug Branch notices of violation or any similar reports could result in, among other things, any of the following:\n\u2022warning letters or untitled letters issued by the FDA;\n\u2022fines, civil penalties, in rem forfeiture proceedings, injunctions, consent decrees and criminal prosecution;\n\u2022import alerts;\n\u2022unanticipated expenditures to address or defend such actions;\n\u2022delays in clearing or approving, or refusal to clear or approve, our products;\n\u2022withdrawals or suspensions of clearance or approval of our products or those of our third-party suppliers by the FDA or other regulatory bodies;\n\u2022product recalls or seizures;\n\u2022orders for physician notification or device repair, replacement or refund;\n\u2022interruptions of production or inability to export to certain foreign countries; and\n\u2022operating restrictions.\nIf any of these events were to occur, it would harm our reputation and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to obtain regulatory authorizations in foreign jurisdictions may prevent us from marketing our products abroad.\nWe currently market and intend to continue to market our products internationally. Outside of the U.S., we can generally market a product only if we receive a marketing authorization (and/or meet certain pre-marketing requirements) and, in some cases, pricing approval, from the appropriate regulatory authorities. The regulatory registration/licensing process varies among international jurisdictions and may require additional or different product testing than required to obtain FDA clearance. FDA clearance does not ensure new product registration/licensing by foreign regulatory authorities, and we may be unable to obtain foreign regulatory registration/licensing on a timely basis, if at all.\nIn addition, clearance by one foreign regulatory authority does not ensure clearance by any other foreign regulatory authority or by the FDA. If we fail to receive necessary approvals to commercialize our products in foreign jurisdictions on a timely basis, or at all, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nFurthermore, foreign regulatory requirements may change from time to time, which could adversely affect our ability to market new products, and/or continue to market existing products, internationally. Certain significant changes in the international regulatory landscape have recently taken place or will take place in the near future. These include the new EU Medical Devices Regulation (EU) 2017/745 (MDR), which came into effect on May 26, 2021 and a new regulatory regime in the UK effective since January 1, 2021 as a result of the UK\u2019s exit from the EU and the expiry of the transitional periods.\nModifications to our marketed devices may require new regulatory clearances or premarket approvals, or may require us to cease marketing or to recall the modified devices until clearances or approvals are obtained.\nWe have made modifications to our devices in the past and we may make additional modifications in the future. Any modification to a device that is cleared by the FDA that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness or that could constitute a major change in its intended use would require a new clearance or approval and certain modifications to devices cleared or approved by foreign regulatory authorities may also require a new clearance or approval.\nWe may not be able to obtain such clearances or approvals in a timely fashion, or at all. Delays in obtaining future clearances would adversely affect our ability to introduce new or enhanced products in a timely manner, which in turn would have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFor device modifications that we conclude do not require a new regulatory clearance or approval, we may be required to recall and to stop marketing the modified devices if the government agency disagrees with our conclusion and requires new clearances or approvals for the modifications. This could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, the FDA has issued enforcement policies under which the agency has said it will not require clearance of a new 510(k) for certain modifications to 510(k)-cleared non-invasive vital-sign patient monitoring devices. However, these policies remain in effect only during the COVID-19 pandemic. Manufacturers that make modifications pursuant to these policies will need to stop marketing the modifications at the end of the COVID-19 pandemic unless the manufacturer receives 510(k) clearance for the modifications.\nRegulatory reforms may impact our ability to develop and commercialize our products and technologies.\nFrom time to time, legislation is drafted and introduced by governments that could significantly change the statutory provisions governing the clearance or approval, manufacture and marketing of medical devices. For example, in August 2017, Congress enacted the FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017 (FDARA). FDARA reauthorized the FDA to collect device user fees, including a new user fee for de novo classification requests, and contained substantive amendments to the device provisions of the FDCA. Among other changes, FDARA required that the FDA update and revise its processes for scheduling inspections of device establishments, communicating about those inspections with manufacturers and providing feedback on the manufacturer\u2019s responses to Form 483s. The statute also required that the FDA study the impact of device servicing, including third-party services, and created a new process for device sponsors to request classification of accessory devices as part of the PMA application for the parent device or to request a separate classification of accessory devices.\nIn addition, regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the government agency in ways that may significantly affect our business or products. Future regulatory changes could make it more difficult for us to obtain or maintain approval to develop and commercialize our products and technologies. Public health emergencies may also prompt temporary or permanent regulatory reforms that could change the processes governing the clearance or approval, manufacture and marketing of medical devices.\nIn the EU, for example, the new MDR became applicable to our medical devices on May 26, 2021. The MDR requires medical devices and their manufacturers to comply with more stringent standards than before. The MDR also imposes new and enhanced obligations on importers and distributors of medical devices in the EU. Although the MDR is subject to certain transitional periods, both we and others involved in the distribution and commercialization of our medical devices in the EU will need to comply with more stringent EU rules.\nDue to Brexit, from January 1, 2021, a new regulatory framework applies to medical devices commercialized in Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales). This is now separate from the regime in the EU. Although certain transition periods apply until June 30, 2023, the medical devices we intend to commercialize in Great Britain will need to conform to different requirements than the requirements in the EU. These factors are likely to add more complexity to our regulatory compliance obligations in Europe and our ability to commercialize medical devices in European markets.\nIf our products cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, or malfunction in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, we will be subject to medical device reporting regulations, and may need to initiate voluntary corrective actions or in certain circumstances be required to take corrective actions, such as the recall of our products.\nRegulatory agencies in many countries require us to report anytime our products cause or contribute to a death or serious injury, or malfunction in a way that would likely cause or contribute to a death or serious injury. For example, under the FDA medical device reporting regulations, we are required to report to the FDA any incident in which a product of ours may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or in which a product of ours malfunctioned and, if the malfunction were to recur, would be likely to cause or contribute to death or serious injury. In addition, all manufacturers placing medical devices on the market in the EU are legally required to report any serious or potentially serious incidents involving devices produced or sold by the manufacturer to the relevant authority in those jurisdictions where any such incident occurred.\nThe FDA and similar foreign regulatory authorities have the authority to require the recall of our commercialized products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in, for example, design, labeling or manufacture. The FDA must find that there is a reasonable probability that the device would cause serious adverse health consequences or death in order to require a recall. The standard for recalling deficient products may be different in foreign jurisdictions. Manufacturers may, under their own initiative, recall a product if any material deficiency is found in a device or they become aware of a safety issue involving a marketed product. A government-mandated or voluntary recall by us or by one of our distributors could occur as a result of component failures, manufacturing errors, design or labeling defects or other deficiencies and issues.\nWe may initiate certain field actions, such as a product correction or removal of our products in the future. In addition, third parties that commercialize products incorporating our technologies may initiate similar actions or product corrections. Any correction or removal initiated by us to reduce a health risk posed by our device, or to remedy a violation of the FDCA or other regulations caused by the device that may present a risk to health, must be reported to the FDA. If the FDA subsequently determines that a report was required for a correction or removal of our products that we did not believe required a report, we could be subject to enforcement actions.\nAny recalls or corrections of our products or third party products that incorporate our technologies, or enforcement actions would divert managerial and financial resources and could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, given our dependence upon patient and physician perceptions, any negative publicity associated with any recalls could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nPromotion of our products using claims that are off-label, unsubstantiated, false or misleading could subject us to substantial penalties.\nObtaining 510(k) clearance permits us to promote our products for the uses cleared by the FDA. Use of a device outside its cleared or approved indications is known as \u201coff-label\u201d use or promotion, respectively. Physicians may use our products off-label because the FDA does not restrict or regulate a physician\u2019s choice of treatment within the practice of medicine, but we may not promote our products \u201coff-label\u201d. While we may request additional cleared indications for our current products, the FDA may deny those requests, require additional expensive clinical data to support any additional indications or impose limitations on the intended use of any cleared product as a condition of clearance. If the FDA determines that our products were promoted for off-label use or that false, misleading or inadequately substantiated promotional claims have been made by us or our OEM partners, it could request that we or our OEM partners modify those promotional materials or it could take regulatory or enforcement actions, including the issuance of an untitled letter, warning letter, injunction, seizure, civil fine and criminal penalties. While certain U.S. courts have held that truthful, non-misleading, off-label information is protected under the First Amendment under certain circumstances, the FDA continues to take the position that off-label promotion is subject to enforcement action.\nIt is also possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities may take action if they consider our communications, including promotional or training materials, to constitute promotion of an uncleared or unapproved use. If not successfully defended, enforcement actions related to off-label promotion could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities, such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement. In any such event, our reputation could be damaged, adoption of our products could be impaired and we could be subject to extensive fines and penalties.\nAdditionally, we must have adequate substantiation for the claims we make for our products. If any of our claims are determined to be false, misleading or deceptive, our products could be considered misbranded under the FDCA or in violation of the Federal Trade Commission Act. We could also face lawsuits from our competitors under the Lanham Act alleging that our marketing materials are false or misleading.\nThe regulatory environment governing information, cybersecurity and privacy is increasingly demanding and continues to evolve.\nPersonal privacy and data security have become significant issues in the U.S., Europe and many other jurisdictions where we offer our products. The regulatory framework for privacy and security issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future.\nCertain U.S. and foreign laws, such as the federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA), govern the transmission, security and privacy of individually identifiable information and sensitive health and other personal information that we may obtain or have access to in connection with the operation of our business, including the conduct of clinical research trials or other research studies that may provide us with access to this information. We may be required to make costly system modifications to comply with these data privacy and security requirements. In addition, if we do not properly comply with applicable laws and regulations related to the protection of this information, we could be subject to criminal or civil penalties and sanctions. The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA), which became effective on January 1, 2020, requires us to make new disclosures to consumers about our data collection, use and sharing practices. The CCPA also allows consumers to opt out of certain data sales to third parties, affords new consumer rights, and provides a new cause of action for data breaches with the possibility of significant statutory damage awards as well as injunctive or declaratory relief if there has been unauthorized access, theft or disclosure of specified personal information due to failure to implement reasonable security procedures. The California Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), which will go into effect on January 1, 2023, with a twelve month look-back period for enforcement purposes, will effectively replace the CCPA. Among other changes, the CPRA expands consumers\u2019 rights and has enhanced enforcement mechanisms such as the creation of a new California privacy agency that will investigate and enforce the CPRA and its promulgating regulations. In addition to the CCPA and the CPRA, all 50 U.S. states have data breach notification laws that, if violated, could result in penalties, fines and litigation. In addition, many states have implemented or are in the process of implementing related legislation, including state-specific biometric privacy laws that have resulted in class-action lawsuits against businesses. The full impact of these laws on our business is yet to be determined, but it could result in increased operating expenses as well as additional exposure to the risk of litigation by or on behalf of consumers.\nInternationally, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) took effect in May 2018 within the European Economic Area (EEA), and many EEA jurisdictions have also adopted their own data privacy and protection laws in addition to the GDPR. Furthermore, other international jurisdictions, including Singapore, South Korea, China, Brazil, Mexico and Australia, have also implemented laws relating to data privacy and protection. Although we believe that we are complying with the GDPR and similar laws, these laws are still relatively new. Therefore, as international data privacy and protection laws continue to evolve, and as new regulations, interpretive guidance and enforcement information become available, we may incur incremental costs to modify our business practices to comply with these requirements. In addition, our internal control policies and procedures may not always protect us from reckless, intentional or criminal acts committed by our employees or agents.\nIn addition, our pending acquisition of Sound United, a consumer technology company, may subject us to additional privacy regulations.\nViolations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could subject us to monetary and non-monetary penalties for noncompliance, disrupt our operations, involve significant management distraction, subject us to class action lawsuits and result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to or otherwise affected by federal and state healthcare laws, including fraud and abuse laws, and could face substantial penalties if we are unable to fully comply with these laws.\nHealthcare fraud and abuse laws potentially applicable to our operations include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022the federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving any bribe, kickback or other remuneration intended to induce the purchase, order or recommendation of an item or service reimbursable under a federal healthcare program (such as the Medicare or Medicaid programs);\n\u2022the federal False Claims Act and other federal laws which prohibit, among other things, knowingly and willfully presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid, other government payers or other third-party payers that are false or fraudulent;\n\u2022the Physician Payments Sunshine Act, which requires medical device companies to track and publicly report, with limited exceptions, all payments and transfers of value to physicians and teaching hospitals in the U.S.; and\n\u2022state laws analogous to each of the above federal laws, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws that may apply to items or services reimbursed by governmental programs and non-governmental third-party payers, including commercial insurers.\nIf we are found to have violated any such laws or other similar governmental regulations, including their foreign counterparts, that are directly or indirectly applicable to us, we may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, exclusion of our products from reimbursement under Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. Any penalties could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against such action, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business.\nLegislative and regulatory changes in the healthcare industry could have a negative impact on our financial performance. Furthermore, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be significantly and adversely affected by healthcare reform legislation in the U.S. or in our key international markets.\nChanges in the healthcare industry in the U.S. and abroad could adversely affect the demand for our products and the way in which we conduct our business. For example, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the ACA), enacted in 2010, required most individuals to have health insurance, established new regulations on health plans, created insurance-pooling mechanisms and reduced Medicare spending on services provided by hospitals and other providers. The long-term viability of the ACA, and its impact on our business and results of operations, remains uncertain. There have also been recent U.S. Congressional actions to repeal and replace the ACA, and future actions are expected. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (TCJA), among other things, eliminated the individual mandate requiring most Americans (other than those who qualify for a hardship exemption) to carry a minimum level of health coverage effective January 1, 2019.\nIn December 2018, a federal district court judge in Texas found the ACA\u2019s individual mandate to be unconstitutional; and therefore, the entire law to be invalid. In December 2019, the Fifth Circuit affirmed the ruling regarding the individual mandate but remanded the case to the district court for additional analysis of the question of severability and whether portions of the law remain valid. In June 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court held that the states and individuals that brought the lawsuit do not have standing to challenge the law, effectively ending the case without ruling on the constitutionality of the individual mandate. Although we cannot predict the ultimate content or timing of any healthcare reform legislation or other court challenges to the ACA, potential changes resulting from any amendment, repeal, replacement or invalidation of these programs, including any reduction in the future availability of healthcare insurance benefits, may decrease the number of people who are insured, which could adversely affect our business and future results of operations.\nOur medical devices and business activities are subject to rigorous regulation by the FDA and other federal, state and international governmental authorities. These authorities and members of Congress have been increasing their scrutiny over the medical device industry. In recent years, Congress, the Department of Justice, the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of Defense have issued subpoenas and other requests for information to medical device manufacturers, primarily related to financial arrangements with healthcare providers, regulatory compliance and marketing and product promotional practices. Furthermore, certain state governments have enacted legislation to limit and/or increase transparency of interactions with healthcare providers, pursuant to which we are required by law to disclose payments and other transfers of value to healthcare providers licensed by certain states.\nWe anticipate that the government will continue to scrutinize our industry closely, and any new regulations or statutory provisions could result in delays or increased costs during the periods of product development, clinical trials and regulatory review and approval, as well as increased costs to assure compliance.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Operations\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn December 2019, COVID-19 was reported to have surfaced in Wuhan, China and has since spread to many other countries, including the United States, where we have our principal executive offices and principal operations, Switzerland, where we have our international headquarters, and Mexico, where we have significant manufacturing operations. Government-imposed travel restrictions have resulted, and may continue to result, in direct operational and administrative disruptions to our domestic and foreign facilities. In addition, quarantines, shelter-in-place and similar orders by local governments have impacted and could further impact the productivity of our manufacturing, engineering, sales and administrative staff and facilities in the United States and other countries. Our operations would be disrupted if any of our employees or employees of our business partners were suspected of having contracted COVID-19, which could require quarantine of some or all such employees or closure of our facilities for disinfection.\nIf the current pace of the COVID-19 pandemic continues to accelerate due to variants such as the omicron variant and the spread of the virus is not contained in the U.S. and other jurisdictions where we operate, our business operations could be further delayed or interrupted. Further, any resurgence in infections in the U.S. or other countries where government restrictions have been fully or partially lifted could result in a re-imposition of such restrictions, causing renewed disruptions to our business. In the event that government and health authorities may announce new or extend existing restrictions, which could include vaccine or testing mandates, we may be required to make further adjustments to our operations in order to comply with any such restrictions. For example, on September 9, 2021, the President of the United States issued Executive Order (EO) 14042, requiring that employees of federal contractors and subcontractors be fully vaccinated against COVID-19, and Masimo is a federal contractor. However, the EO has faced legal challenges in federal courts and there is currently a nationwide injunction on EO 14042. The President of the United States also directed the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (Fed-OSHA) to issue Emergency Temporary Standards (ETS) that will direct large employers (those with 100+ employees) to mandate COVID-19 vaccinations for their employees; however, on January 13, 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court blocked these regulations from going into effect. Though it is difficult to predict whether the injunction on the EO mandate will be lifted, if we are ultimately required to mandate vaccines for our employees, we may experience workforce constraints due to shortages of vaccinated personnel, strains on the labor market, limitations on hiring new employees and difficulty retaining and securing employees who are vaccinated. In addition, our suppliers who are subject to similar vaccination mandates or regulations may experience similar constraints, thereby affecting their ability to provide to us with sufficient inventory or material to meet our demands and needs in a timely manner. All of these factors could negatively affect our business and operations.\nFurthermore, global supply chains and the timely availability of raw materials, component parts and products may be materially disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic and measures taken to combat COVID-19, such as quarantines, government mandates surrounding vaccinations, factory slowdowns or shutdowns, border closings and travel restrictions. In addition, our suppliers have experienced, and may continue to experience, difficulties in delivering raw materials, components and products to us as transportation networks and distribution facilities have been disrupted, resulting in delays at ports of arrival. Furthermore, the availability of shipping containers has decreased and there have been global changes in the types of goods being shipped, all of which have resulted in increased shipping costs, which may affect the availability of raw materials, component parts and products to meet our sales demand. For example, we utilize semiconductor chips in certain products that we manufacture. Semiconductor chips have been subject to an ongoing global supply shortage and our ability to source semiconductor chips or the components that use semiconductor chips may be adversely affected in the future. Component delivery lead times have increased and are expected to continue to increase, which may cause delays in our production of products and increase the cost to obtain semiconductor chips and components that use semiconductor chips. If this semiconductor chip shortage or shortages of other component parts continues, we may experience delays, production interruptions, increased costs and an inability to fulfill engineering design changes or customer demand, each of which could adversely affect our business and financial performance.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has also led to extreme volatility in capital markets and a decline in interest rates, and has adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, the market price of our common stock. While the potential economic impact brought by, and the duration of, the COVID-19 pandemic may be difficult to assess or predict, a continued or widespread pandemic could result in significant disruption of global financial markets, reducing our ability to access capital, which could negatively affect our liquidity in the future. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our business and financial results continues to depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict.\nIf our employees become ill or otherwise incapacitated, our operations may be adversely impacted.\nAt the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented telework policies wherever possible for appropriate categories of employees in response to various stay at home/shelter in place orders (Stay at Home Orders) implemented by state and local governments. In response to the lifting or partial lifting of the Stay at Home Orders, we have reopened our facilities to both \u201cnonessential\u201d and \u201cessential\u201d employees. We have implemented a number of safety measures for our facilities, including limiting facility access, social distancing, face covering, temperature checking and increased sanitation standards. While we have developed and implemented, and continue to develop and implement, health and safety guidelines in an effort to try to mitigate the negative impact of COVID-19, there can be no assurances that our measures will be sufficient to protect our employees in our workplace or that our employees will not otherwise be exposed to COVID-19 outside of our workplace. If a number of our employees become ill, incapacitated or are otherwise unable to continue working during the current or any future pandemic or epidemic, our operations may be adversely impacted.\nWe may experience conflicts of interest with Cercacor with respect to business opportunities and other matters.\nPrior to our initial public offering in August 2007, our stockholders owned 99% of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Cercacor, and we believe that a number of our stockholders, including certain of our directors and executive officers, continue to own shares of Cercacor stock. Joe Kiani, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer (CEO), is also the Chairman and CEO of Cercacor.\nDue to the interrelated nature of Cercacor with us, conflicts of interest may arise with respect to transactions involving business dealings between us and Cercacor, potential acquisitions of businesses or products, the development and ownership of technologies and products, the sale of products, markets and other matters in which our best interests and the best interests of our stockholders may conflict with the best interests of the stockholders of Cercacor. In addition, we and Cercacor may disagree regarding the interpretation of certain terms in the Cross-Licensing Agreement. We cannot guarantee that any conflict of interest will be resolved in our favor, or that, with respect to our transactions with Cercacor, we will negotiate terms that are as favorable to us as if such transactions were with another third-party.\nWe will be required to assign to Cercacor and pay Cercacor for the right to use certain products and technologies we develop that relate to the monitoring of non-vital sign parameters, including improvements to Masimo SET\u00ae.\nUnder the Cross-Licensing Agreement, if we develop certain products or technologies that relate to the noninvasive monitoring of non-vital sign parameters, including improvements to Masimo SET\u00ae for the noninvasive monitoring of non-vital sign parameters, we would be required to assign these developments to Cercacor and then license the technology back from Cercacor in consideration for upfront payments and royalty obligations to Cercacor. Therefore, these products and technologies would be deemed to have been developed or improved exclusively by Cercacor.\nIn addition, we will not be reimbursed by Cercacor for our expenses relating to the development or improvement of any such products or technologies, which expenses may be significant. As a result of these terms, we may not generate any revenue from the further development of certain products and technologies for the monitoring of non-vital sign parameters, including improvements to Masimo SET\u00ae, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn the event that the Cross-Licensing Agreement is terminated for any reason, or Cercacor grants a license to rainbow\u00ae technology to a third-party, our business would be adversely affected.\nCercacor owns all of the proprietary rights to certain rainbow\u00ae technology developed with our proprietary Masimo SET\u00ae for products intended to be used in the \u201cCercacor Market\u201d, and all rights to any non-vital signs measurement for which we do not exercise an option pursuant to the Cross-Licensing Agreement. In addition, Cercacor has the right to terminate the Cross-Licensing Agreement or grant licenses covering rainbow\u00ae technology to third parties if we breach certain terms of the agreement, including any failure to meet our minimum royalty payment obligations or failure to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop or market products incorporating licensed rainbow\u00ae technology. If we lose our exclusive license to rainbow\u00ae technology, we would lose the ability to prevent others from making, using, selling or importing products using rainbow\u00ae technology in our market. As a result, we would likely be subject to increased competition within our market, and Cercacor or competitors who obtain a license to rainbow\u00ae technology from Cercacor would be able to offer related products.\nWe may not be able to commercialize our products incorporating licensed rainbow\u00ae technology cost-effectively or successfully.\nAs a result of the royalties that we must pay to Cercacor, it is generally more expensive for us to make products that incorporate licensed rainbow\u00ae technology than products that do not include licensed rainbow\u00ae technology.\nAs a result, we may not be able to sell products incorporating licensed rainbow\u00ae technology at a price the market is willing to accept. If we cannot commercialize our products incorporating licensed rainbow\u00ae technology successfully, we may not be able to generate sufficient product revenue from these products to be profitable, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRights provided to Cercacor in the Cross-Licensing Agreement may impede a change in control of our company.\nUnder the Cross-Licensing Agreement, a change in control includes the resignation or termination of Joe Kiani from his position as CEO of either Masimo or Cercacor. A change in control also includes other customary events, such as the sale or merger of Masimo or Cercacor to a non-affiliated third-party or the acquisition of 50% or more of the voting power of Masimo or Cercacor by a non-affiliated third-party. In the event we undergo a change in control, we are required to immediately pay a $2.5 million fee to exercise an option to license technology developed by Cercacor for use in blood glucose monitoring.\nAdditionally, our per product royalties payable to Cercacor will become subject to specified minimums, and the minimum aggregate annual royalties for licensed rainbow\u00ae measurements payable to Cercacor related to carbon monoxide, methemoglobin, fractional arterial oxygen saturation, hemoglobin and blood glucose will increase to $15.0 million, plus up to $2.0 million for other rainbow\u00ae measurements. Also, if the surviving or acquiring entity ceases to use \u201cMasimo\u201d as a company name and trademark following a change in control, all rights to the \u201cMasimo\u201d trademark will automatically be assigned to Cercacor. This could delay or discourage transactions involving an actual or potential change in control of us, including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over our then-current trading price. In addition, our requirement to assign all future improvements for non-vital signs to Cercacor could impede a change in control of our company.\nIf we are unable to obtain key materials and components from sole or limited source suppliers, we will not be able to deliver our products to customers.\nWe depend on certain sole or limited source suppliers for certain key materials and components, including digital signal processor chips and analog-to-digital converter chips, for our noninvasive patient monitoring solutions. These suppliers are located around the world, and the production and shipment of such materials and components may be constrained globally due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We may experience manufacturing problems related to these suppliers and other outside sources if such suppliers fail to develop, manufacture or ship products and components to us on a timely basis, or provide us with products and components that do not meet our quality standards and required quantities. We have experienced supply constraints with regard to certain digital signal processor chips and other components during the pandemic, but have so far been able to mitigate these constraints. In addition, from time to time there have been industry-wide shortages of certain components that we use in our noninvasive blood constituent patient monitoring solutions. We may also experience price increases for materials or components, with no guarantee that such increases can be passed along to our customers, which could adversely impact our gross margins.\nIf any of these problems occur, we may be unable to obtain substitute sources for these products and components on a timely basis or on terms acceptable to us, which could harm our ability to manufacture our own products and components profitably or on time.\nFuture strategic initiatives, including acquisitions of businesses and strategic investments, could negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations if we fail to integrate the acquired businesses successfully into our existing operations or achieve the desired results of our investment.\nWe have acquired several businesses since our inception and we may acquire additional businesses in the future. For example, on February 15, 2022, we entered into a definitive merger agreement to acquire Sound United. Future acquisitions may require debt or equity financing, which could be dilutive to our existing stockholders or reduce our earnings per share or other financial metrics. In connection with the pending acquisition of Sound United, we received a debt commitment letter for a credit facility in the amount of $800 million and expect to secure this credit facility in the event the proposed acquisition closes. Even if we complete acquisitions, there are many factors that could affect whether such acquisition will be beneficial to our business, including, without limitation:\n\u2022payment of above-market prices for acquisitions and higher than anticipated acquisition costs;\n\u2022issuance of common stock as part of the acquisition price or a need to issue stock options or other equity to newly-hired employees of target companies, resulting in dilution of ownership to our existing stockholders;\n\u2022reduced profitability if an acquisition is not accretive to our business over either the short-term or the long-term;\n\u2022difficulties in integrating any acquired companies, personnel, products and other assets into our existing business;\n\u2022delays in realizing the benefits of the acquired company, products or other assets;\n\u2022regulatory challenges and becoming subject to additional regulatory requirements;\n\u2022cybersecurity and compliance-related issues;\n\u2022diversion of our management\u2019s time and attention from other business concerns;\n\u2022limited or no direct prior experience in new markets or countries we may enter;\n\u2022unanticipated issues dealing with unfamiliar suppliers, service providers or other collaborators of the acquired company;\n\u2022higher costs of integration than we anticipated;\n\u2022write-downs or impairments of goodwill or other intangible assets associated with the acquired company;\n\u2022difficulties in retaining key employees of the acquired business who are necessary to manage these acquisitions;\n\u2022negative impacts on our relationships with our employees, clients or collaborators;\n\u2022intellectual property and other litigation, other claims or liabilities in connection with the acquisition; and\n\u2022changes in the overall financial model as certain acquired companies may have a different revenue, gross profit margin or operating expense profile.\nFurther, our ability to benefit from future acquisitions and/or external strategic investments depends on our ability to successfully conduct due diligence, negotiate acceptable terms, evaluate prospective opportunities and bring acquired technologies and/or products to market at acceptable margins and operating expense levels. For example, we acquired TNI medical AG\u00ae (TNI) and added softFlow\u00ae technology to our product portfolio during 2020. In addition, we acquired LiDCO Group, Plc, which specializes in hemodynamic monitoring solutions. As these are our first therapeutic and hemodynamic monitoring solutions, the integration of these technologies may require substantial management time and attention and may divert attention and resources from other important areas, including our existing business and product lines, and we may not be able to sell softFlow\u00ae technology and hemodynamic monitoring solutions at acceptable margins and operating expense levels. Our failure in any of these tasks could result in unforeseen liabilities associated with an acquired company, acquiring a company on unfavorable terms or selecting and eventually acquiring a suboptimal acquisition target.\nWe may also discover deficiencies in internal controls, data adequacy and integrity, product quality, regulatory compliance, product liabilities or other undisclosed liabilities that we did not uncover prior to our acquisition or investment, which could result in us becoming subject to penalties, other liabilities or asset impairments. In addition, if we do not achieve the anticipated benefits of an acquisition or other external investment as rapidly as expected, or at all, investors or analysts may downgrade our stock.\nWe also expect to continue to carry out internal strategic initiatives that we believe are necessary to grow our revenues and expand our business, both in the U.S. and abroad. For example, we have continued to invest in international expansion programs designed to increase our worldwide presence and take advantage of market expansion opportunities around the world. Although we believe our investments in these initiatives continue to be in the long-term best interests of Masimo and our stockholders, there are no assurances that such initiatives will yield favorable results for us. Accordingly, if these initiatives are not successful, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIf these risks materialize, our stock price could be materially adversely affected. Any difficulties in the integration of acquired businesses or unexpected penalties, liabilities or asset impairments in connection with such acquisitions or investments could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur new products and changes to existing products as a result of our proposed acquisition of Sound United could fail to attract or retain users or generate revenue and profits. Further, we may not be successful in our personal consumer strategy and investments, which could adversely affect our business, reputation or financial results.\nIn connection with our proposed acquisition of Sound United, we announced an expansion in our business and product strategy to additionally focus on personal consumer products to integrate with our successful medical technology businesses. Further, we may introduce certain changes to our existing products or introduce new and unproven products. We do not have significant experience with consumer hardware products, which may adversely affect our ability to successfully develop and market these products and technologies and integrate them with our existing products and platforms. We expect this will be a complex, evolving, and long-term strategic initiative that will involve the development of new and emerging technologies, continued investment in medical technology and consumer hardware products, and collaboration with other companies, developers, partners and other participants. However, our personal consumer business may not develop in accordance with our vision and expectations, and market acceptance of features, products or services we build for the personal consumer business may be uncertain. We may be unsuccessful in our research and product development efforts, including if we are unable to develop relationships with key participants in the personal consumer business. Our new strategic efforts may also divert resources and management attention from other areas of our business. In addition, as our personal consumer business continues to evolve, we may be subject to a variety of laws and regulations in the United States and international jurisdictions, which we were not previously affected by, including in the areas of privacy, which may delay or impede the development of our products and services, increase our operating costs, require significant management time and attention, or otherwise harm our business. As a result of these or other factors, our personal consumer strategy and investments may not be successful in the foreseeable future, or at all, which could adversely affect our business, reputation, or financial results.\nOur credit agreement contains certain covenants and restrictions that may limit our flexibility in operating our business.\nOur credit agreement dated December 17, 2018 (Credit Facility) with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as Administrative Agent and as a lender, and Bank of the West, as a lender (together, Lenders), contains various affirmative covenants and restrictions that limit our ability to engage in specified types of transactions, including:\n\u2022incurring specified types of additional indebtedness, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain any additional debt or equity financing at the time needed or that such financing will be available on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us (including guarantees or other contingent obligations);\n\u2022paying dividends on, repurchasing or making distributions in respect of our common stock or making other restricted payments, subject to specified exceptions;\n\u2022making specified investments (including loans and advances);\n\u2022selling or transferring certain assets;\n\u2022creating certain liens;\n\u2022consolidating, merging, selling or otherwise disposing of all or substantially all of our assets; and\n\u2022entering into certain transactions with any of our affiliates.\nIn addition, under our Credit Facility, we are required to satisfy and maintain specified financial ratios and other affirmative covenants. Our ability to meet those financial ratios and affirmative covenants could be affected by events beyond our control and, therefore, we cannot be assured that we will be able to continue to satisfy these requirements. A breach of any of these ratios or covenants could result in a default under our Credit Facility. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the Lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under our Credit Facility immediately due and payable, terminate all commitments to extend further credit and pursue legal remedies for recovery, all of which could adversely affect our business and financial condition. See Note 15 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15(a) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on our Credit Facility.\nOur proposed new debt facility, which will be used to partially fund our pending acquisition of Sound United, may restrict our future operations, including our ability to respond to changes or to take certain actions. If we fail to comply with the covenants and other obligations under the proposed credit facility, the lender may be able to accelerate amounts owed under the facility.\nIn connection with the pending acquisition of Sound United, we recently received a commitment letter for a credit facility in the amount of $800 million and expect to secure this credit facility in the event the pending acquisition closes (the \u201cNew Debt Facility\u201d). The New Debt Facility may contain a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and may, unless waived by the lender, limit our ability to engage in acts that may be in our long-term best interests, including restrictions on our ability to:\n\u2022Incur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022Incur liens;\n\u2022Merge, dissolve, liquidate, amalgamate, consolidate or sell all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022Declare or pay certain dividends, payments or distribution or repurchase or redeem certain capital stock; and\n\u2022Make certain investments.\nThese restrictions could limit, potentially significantly, our operational flexibility and affect our ability to finance our future operations or capital needs or to execute our business strategy.\nFurther, if we do not achieve the anticipated benefits from the pending acquisition of Sound United, our ability to service our indebtedness may be adversely impacted. Even if we achieve the anticipated benefits from the pending acquisition, we may be required to raise substantial additional financing to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, or other general corporate purposes. Our ability to arrange additional financing and make payments of principal and interest on our indebtedness will depend on our future performance, which will be subject to general economic, financial, and business conditions as well as other factors affecting our operations, many of which are beyond our control.\nRisks Related to Our Stock\nConcentration of ownership of our stock among our existing directors, executive officers and principal stockholders may prevent new investors from influencing significant corporate decisions.\nAs of January 1, 2022, our current directors and executive officers and their affiliates, in the aggregate, beneficially owned approximately 9.5% of our outstanding stock. Subject to any fiduciary duties owed to our other stockholders under Delaware law, these stockholders may be able to exercise significant influence over matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions, and will have some control over our management and policies in their roles as stockholders. Some of these persons or entities may have interests that are different from yours. For example, these stockholders may support proposals and actions with which you may disagree or which are not in your best interests.\nThe concentration of ownership could delay or prevent a change in control of us, or otherwise discourage a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of us, which in turn could reduce the price of our stock.\nIn addition, these stockholders could use their voting influence to maintain our existing management and directors in office or support or reject other management and Board proposals that are subject to stockholder approval, such as amendments to our employee stock plans and approvals of significant financing transactions.\nOur corporate documents and Delaware law contain provisions that could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control of our company, prevent attempts to replace or remove current management and reduce the market price of our stock.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a merger or acquisition involving us that our stockholders may consider favorable. For example, our certificate of incorporation authorizes our Board to issue up to 5.0 million shares of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock. As a result, without further stockholder approval, our Board has the authority to attach special rights, including voting and dividend rights, to this preferred stock, including pursuant to a stockholder rights plan. With these rights, preferred stockholders could make it more difficult for a third-party to acquire us. In addition, our certificate of incorporation provides for a staggered Board, whereby directors serve for three-year terms, with one-third of the directors coming up for reelection each year. A staggered Board will make it more difficult for a third-party to obtain control of our Board through a proxy contest, which may be a necessary step in an acquisition of us that is not favored by our Board.\nWe are also subject to anti-takeover provisions under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. Under these provisions, if anyone becomes an \u201cinterested stockholder,\u201d we may not enter into a \u201cbusiness combination\u201d with that person for three years without special approval, which could discourage a third-party from making a takeover offer and could delay or prevent a change in control of us. For purposes of these provisions, an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d generally means someone owning 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock or an affiliate of ours that owned 15% or more of our outstanding voting stock during the past three years, subject to certain exceptions as described in the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware.\nOur bylaws provide that the state or federal courts located within the State of Delaware are the exclusive forum for substantially all disputes between us and our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur bylaws provide that the state or federal courts located within the State of Delaware are the sole and exclusive forum for: (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees or stockholders to our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws or as to which the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware confers jurisdiction on the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, or (iv) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine. However, this choice of forum provision does not apply to (a) actions in which the Court of Chancery in the State of Delaware concludes that an indispensable party is not subject to the jurisdiction of Delaware courts, or (b) actions in which a federal court has assumed exclusive jurisdiction to a proceeding. This choice of forum provision is not intended to apply to any actions brought under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). Section 27 of the Exchange Act creates exclusive federal jurisdiction over all suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. As a result, the exclusive forum provision will not apply to suits brought to enforce any duty or liability created by the Exchange Act or any other claim for which the federal courts have exclusive jurisdiction This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds\nfavorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees or stockholders, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and other employees or stockholders.\nFurthermore, the enforceability of similar choice of forum provisions in other companies\u2019 certificates of incorporation has been challenged in legal proceedings, and it is possible that a court could find these types of provisions to be inapplicable or unenforceable. If a court were to find the choice of forum provision in our bylaws to be inapplicable or unenforceable in an action, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such action in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe may experience significant fluctuations in our periodic financial results and may not maintain our current levels of profitability in the future.\nOur operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate in the future. Many of the countries in which we operate, including the U.S. and several of the members of the EU, have experienced and continue to experience uncertain economic conditions resulting from global as well as local factors. In addition, continuing uncertainty in the U.S. economy may result in continued inflationary pressures globally and in the U.S. in particular, which may contribute to future interest rate volatility.\nOur business or financial results may be adversely impacted by these uncertain economic conditions, including: adverse changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, tax laws or tax rates; inflation; contraction in the availability of credit in the marketplace due to legislation or other economic conditions, which may potentially impair our ability to access the capital markets on terms acceptable to us or at all; and the effects of government initiatives to manage economic conditions.\nWe are also unable to predict how changing global economic conditions or potential global health concerns such as the COVID-19 pandemic will affect our critical customers, suppliers and distributors. Any negative impact of such matters on our critical customers, suppliers or distributors may also have an adverse impact on our results of operations or financial condition. Our expense levels are based, in part, on our expectations regarding future revenue levels and are relatively fixed in the short term. As a result, if our revenue for a particular period was below our expectations, we would not be able to proportionately reduce our operating expenses for that period. Any revenue shortfall would have a disproportionately negative effect on our operating results for the period.\nIn addition, the methods, estimates and judgments that we use in applying our accounting policies are, by their nature, subject to substantial risks, uncertainties and assumptions. Factors may arise over time that lead us to change our methods, estimates and judgments, the impact of which could significantly affect our results of operations. See \u201cCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\u201d contained in Part I, Item 2 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRecent accounting changes related to our embedded leases within certain deferred equipment agreements have also resulted in the acceleration of the timing related to our recognition of revenue and expenses associated with certain equipment provided to customers at no up-front charge. Since we cannot control the timing of when our customers will request us to deliver such equipment, our revenue and costs with respect to leased equipment could vary substantially in any given quarter or year, which could further increase quarterly or annual fluctuations within our financial results.\nDue to these and other factors, you should not rely on our results for any one quarter as an indication of our future performance. If our operating results fail to meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price could drop suddenly and significantly.\nFuture changes in accounting pronouncements and tax laws, or the interpretation thereof, could have a significant impact on our reported results, and may affect our historical reporting of previous transactions.\nNew accounting pronouncements or taxation rules, and evolving interpretations thereof, have occurred and are likely to occur in the future. Future changes made by new accounting standards may apply prospectively or retrospectively, depending on the method of adoption, and may recast previously reported results. For additional information related to the impact of new accounting pronouncements, please see Note 2 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15(a) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn addition, future changes to the U.S. tax code and its regulations could have a material impact on our effective tax rate and the implementation of these changes could require us to make substantial changes to our business practices, allocate resources, and increase our costs, which could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf we lose the services of our key personnel, or if we are unable to attract and retain other key personnel, we may not be able to manage our operations or meet our growth objectives.\nWe are highly dependent on our senior management, especially Joe Kiani, our CEO, and other key officers. We are also heavily dependent on our engineers and field sales team, including sales representatives and clinical specialists. We believe certain of our competitors with greater financial resources than us have targeted our key personnel for recruitment and will likely continue to do so in the future. In addition, we may experience employee turnover as a result of the ongoing \u201cgreat resignation\u201d occurring throughout the U.S. economy, which has impacted job market dynamics. New hires require training and take time before they achieve full productivity. New employees may not become as productive as we expect, and we may be unable to hire or retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals. The loss of the services of members of our key personnel, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, or the inability to attract and retain qualified personnel in the future could prevent the implementation and completion of our objectives, including the development and introduction of our products. In general, our key personnel may terminate their employment at any time and for any reason without notice, unless the individual is a participant in our 2007 Severance Protection Plan, in which case the individual has agreed to provide us with six months\u2019 notice if such individual decides to voluntarily resign. We do not maintain any \u201ckey person\u201d life insurance policies with respect to any of our key personnel.\nWe are involved, and may become involved in the future, in disputes and other legal or regulatory proceedings that, if adversely decided or settled, could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are, and may in the future become, party to litigation, regulatory proceedings or other disputes. In general, claims made by or against us in disputes and other legal or regulatory proceedings can be expensive and time-consuming to bring or defend against, requiring us to expend significant resources and divert the efforts and attention of our management and other personnel from our business operations. These potential claims may include but are not limited to personal injury and class action lawsuits, intellectual property claims and regulatory investigations relating to the advertising and promotional claims about our products and employee claims against us based on, among other things, discrimination, harassment or wrongful termination. Any one of these claims, even those without merit, may divert our financial and management resources that would otherwise be used to benefit the future performance of our operations. Any adverse determination against us in these proceedings, or even the allegations contained in the claims, regardless of whether they are ultimately found to be without merit, may also result in settlements, injunctions or damages that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges to government immigration regulations may materially affect our workforce and limit our supply of qualified professionals, or increase our cost of securing workers.\nWe recruit professionals on a global basis and must comply with the immigration laws in the countries in which we operate, including the U.S. Some of our employees are working under Masimo-sponsored temporary work visas, including H1-B visas. Statutory law limits the number of new H1-B temporary work permit petitions that may be approved in a fiscal year. Furthermore, there is a possibility that the current U.S. immigration visa program may be significantly overhauled, and the number of H1-B visas available, as well as the process to obtain them, may be subject to significant change. Any resulting changes to this visa program could impact our ability to recruit, hire and retain qualified skilled personnel. If we are unable to obtain work visas in sufficient quantities or at a sufficient rate for a significant period of time, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nThe risks inherent in operating internationally, including the purchase, sale and shipment of our components and products across international borders, may adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe currently derive approximately 33% of our net sales from international operations. In addition, we purchase a portion of our raw materials and components from international sources. The sale and shipment of our products across international borders, as well as the purchase of materials and components from international sources, subject us to extensive U.S. and foreign governmental trade regulations, including those related to duties, tariffs and conflict minerals. Compliance with such regulations is costly and we could be exposed to potentially significant penalties, fines and interest if we are found not to be in compliance with such regulations. Any failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory obligations could impact us in a variety of ways that include, but are not limited to, significant criminal, civil and administrative penalties, including imprisonment of individuals, fines and penalties, denial of export privileges, seizure of shipments, restrictions on certain business activities, and exclusion or debarment from government contracting. We have historically engaged in transactions with entities related to or located in countries subject to certain U.S. export restrictions. For example, we have had sales of medical products destined for Iran.\nIn addition, changes in policy in the U.S. and other countries regarding international trade, including import and export regulation and international trade agreements, could negatively impact our business. In recent years, the U.S. has imposed tariffs on goods imported from China and certain other countries, which has resulted in retaliatory tariffs by China and other countries. Changes or uncertainty in tariffs or further retaliatory trade measures taken by China or other countries in response could affect the demand for our products and services, impact the competitive position of our products, prevent us from being able to sell products in certain countries or otherwise adversely impact our results of operations. The implementation of more restrictive trade policies, such as more detailed inspections, higher tariffs or new barriers to entry, could negatively impact our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAlthough these activities have not been financially material to our business, financial condition or results of operations, and were undertaken in accordance with general licenses authorizing such activities issued by the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control, we may not be successful in ensuring compliance with limitations or restrictions on business in Iran or any other countries subject to economic sanctions and embargoes imposed by the United States. Also, the failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory obligations could result in the disruption of our shipping, manufacturing and sales activities. Any material decrease in our international sales would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, our international operations expose us and our representatives, agents and distributors to risks inherent in operating in foreign jurisdictions. These risks include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022the imposition of additional U.S. and foreign governmental controls or regulations;\n\u2022the imposition of costly and lengthy new export licensing requirements;\n\u2022a shortage of high-quality sales people and distributors;\n\u2022the loss of any key personnel who possess proprietary knowledge, or who are otherwise important to our success in certain international markets;\n\u2022changes in duties and tariffs, license obligations and other non-tariff barriers to trade;\n\u2022the imposition of new trade restrictions;\n\u2022the imposition of restrictions on the activities of foreign agents, representatives and distributors;\n\u2022compliance with foreign tax laws, regulations and requirements;\n\u2022pricing pressure;\n\u2022changes in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022laws and business practices favoring local companies;\n\u2022political instability and actual or anticipated military or political conflicts;\n\u2022financial and civil unrest worldwide;\n\u2022outbreaks of illnesses, pandemics or other local or global health issues;\n\u2022the inability to collect amounts paid by foreign government customers to our appointed foreign agents;\n\u2022longer payment cycles, increased credit risk and different collection remedies with respect to receivables; and\n\u2022difficulties in enforcing or defending intellectual property rights.\nThe U.S. government initiated substantial changes in U.S. trade policy and U.S. trade agreements, including tariffs on certain foreign goods. In response to these tariffs, certain foreign governments instituted or are considering imposing tariffs on certain U.S. goods. In addition, the U.S. has negotiated new trade agreements that could impact us, including the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which went into force on July 1, 2020 and replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement. A trade war, trade barriers or other governmental actions related to tariffs, international trade agreements, import or export restrictions or other trade policies could adversely impact demand for our products, our costs, customers, suppliers and/or the U.S. economy or certain sectors thereof and, therefore, adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws in non-U.S. jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from promising or making improper payments to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining an advantage to secure or retain business. Because of the predominance of government-sponsored healthcare systems around the world, many of our customer relationships outside of the U.S. are with governmental entities and are therefore subject to such anti-bribery laws. We have adopted policies and practices that help us ensure compliance with these anti-bribery laws. However, such policies and practice may require us to invest in additional monitoring resources or forgo certain business opportunities in order to ensure global compliance with these laws.\nOur operations may be adversely impacted by our exposure to risks related to foreign currency exchange rates.\nWe market our products in certain foreign markets through our subsidiaries and other international distributors. As a result, events that result in global economic uncertainty could significantly affect our results of operations in the form of gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and potential devaluation of the local currencies of our customers relative to the U.S. Dollar.\nWhile a majority of our sales are transacted in U.S. Dollars, some of our sales agreements with foreign customers provide for payment in currencies other than the U.S. Dollar. These foreign currency revenues, when converted into U.S. Dollars, can vary depending on the approximation of the exchange rates applied during a respective period. Similarly, certain of our foreign subsidiaries transact business in their respective country\u2019s local currency, which is also their functional currency. In addition, certain production costs related to our manufacturing operations in Mexico are denominated in Mexican Pesos. As a result, expenses of these foreign subsidiaries and certain production costs, when converted into U.S. Dollars, can vary depending on average monthly exchange rates during a respective period.\nWe are also exposed to foreign currency gains or losses on outstanding foreign currency denominated receivables and payables, as well as cash deposits. When converted to U.S. Dollars, these receivables, payables and cash deposits can vary depending on the monthly exchange rates at the end of the period. In addition, certain intercompany transactions may give rise to realized and unrealized foreign currency gains or losses based on the currency underlying such intercompany transactions. Accordingly, our operating results are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nThe balance sheets of our foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. Dollar are translated into U.S. Dollars at the rate of exchange at the balance sheet date and the statements of operations and cash flows are translated into U.S. Dollars using an approximation of the average monthly exchange rates applicable during the period. Any foreign currency exchange gain or loss as a result of translating the balance sheets of our foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U.S. Dollar is included in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\nWe currently do not hedge our foreign currency exchange rate risk. As a result, changes in foreign exchange rates could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For additional information related to our foreign currency exchange rate risk, please see Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risks in Part I, Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe currently manufacture our products at a limited number of locations and any disruption to, expansion of, or changes in trade programs related to such manufacturing operations could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on manufacturing facilities in California, New Hampshire and Mexico that may be affected by natural or man-made disasters. Earthquakes are of particular significance since some of our facilities are located in earthquake-prone areas. We are also vulnerable to damage from other types of disasters, including power loss, attacks from extremist or terrorist organizations, epidemics, communication failures, fire, floods and similar events. Our facilities and the manufacturing equipment we use to produce our products would be difficult to replace and could require substantial time to repair if significant damage were to result from any of these occurrences.\nIf one of our manufacturing facilities was affected by a natural or man-made disaster, we would be forced to rely on third-party manufacturers if we could not shift production to our other manufacturing facilities. Furthermore, our insurance for damage to our property and the disruption of our business from casualties may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all. If the lease for any of our leased facilities is terminated, we are unable to renew any of our leases or we are otherwise forced to seek alternative facilities, or if we voluntarily expand one or more of our manufacturing operations to new locations, we may incur additional transition costs and experience a disruption in the supply of our products until the new facilities are available and operating. Additionally, we have occasionally experienced seasonality among our manufacturing workforce, and if we continue to experience such seasonality or other workforce shortages or otherwise have issues retaining employees or contractors at our manufacturing facilities, we may not be able to meet our customers\u2019 demands.\nOur global manufacturing and distribution are dependent upon our manufacturing facilities in Mexico, and the expedient importation of raw materials and exportation of finished goods between the U.S. and Mexico. Undue delays and/or closures of the proximal cross-border transit facilities, or any restrictions by the U.S. federal administration related to the movement of goods across the U.S. and Mexico border, may adversely affect our ability to fulfill orders and supply our healthcare provider customers with essential replenishment supplies, as well as adversely impact our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIn addition, our manufacturing facilities in Mexico are authorized to operate under the Mexican Maquiladora (IMMEX) program. The IMMEX program allows us to import certain items from the U.S. into Mexico duty-free, provided that such items, after processing, are exported from Mexico within a stipulated timeframe. Maquiladora status, which is renewed periodically, is subject to various restrictions and requirements, including compliance with the terms of the IMMEX program and other local regulations. Failure to comply with the IMMEX program regulations, including any changes thereto, could increase our manufacturing costs and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nIf we do not accurately forecast customer demand, we may hold suboptimal inventory levels that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to meet the demand of our customers, our customers may cancel orders or purchase products from our competitors, which could reduce our revenue and gross profit margin. Conversely, if product demand decreases, we may be unable to timely adjust our manufacturing cost structure, resulting in excess capacity, which would lower gross product margins. Similarly, if we are unable to forecast demand accurately, we could be required to record charges related to excess or obsolete inventory, which would also lower our gross margin.\nIf we fail to comply with the reporting obligations of the Exchange Act or if we fail to maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting, our business, results of operations and financial condition and investors\u2019 confidence in us could be adversely affected.\nWe are required to prepare and disclose certain information under the Exchange Act as amended, in a timely manner and meet our reporting obligations in their entirety, and our failure to do so could subject us to penalties under federal securities laws and regulations of The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC, expose us to lawsuits and restrict our ability to access financing on favorable terms, or at all.\nIf we fail to maintain adequate internal controls over financial reporting, we may not be able to conclude on an ongoing basis that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Moreover, any material weakness in our internal control environment could result in the loss of investor confidence in the reliability of our financial statements, which in turn could harm our business, negatively impact the trading price of our stock, and adversely affect investors\u2019 confidence in our company and our ability to access capital markets for financing.\nChanging laws and increasingly complex corporate governance and public disclosure requirements could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nChanging laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Dodd-Frank Act), the California Transparency in Supply Chains Act, the UK Modern Slavery Act and new regulations issued by the SEC and The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC, have created, and will create, additional compliance requirements for us. For example, the Dodd-Frank Act includes provisions regarding, among other things, advisory votes on named executive officer compensation and \u201cconflict minerals\u201d reporting. Complying with these rules and regulations has increased and will increase our legal and financial compliance costs, make some activities more difficult, time-consuming or costly and increase demand on our systems and resources. As a result, management\u2019s attention may be diverted from other business concerns, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may also need to hire additional employees or engage outside consultants to comply with these requirements, which will increase our costs and expenses. To maintain high standards of corporate governance and public disclosure, we have invested in, and intend to continue to invest in, reasonably necessary resources to comply with evolving standards.\nIn addition, stockholder litigation surrounding executive compensation and disclosure of executive compensation has increased with the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act. Furthermore, our stockholders may not continue to approve our advisory vote on named executive officer compensation that is being voted on by our stockholders annually pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act. If we are involved in a lawsuit related to compensation matters or any other matters not covered by our directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance, we may incur significant expenses in defending against such lawsuits, or be subject to significant fines or required to take significant remedial actions, each of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf product liability claims are brought against us, we could face substantial liability and costs.\nOur products are predominantly used in patient care and expose us to product liability claims and product recalls, including, but not limited to, those that may arise from unauthorized off-label use, malfunctions, design flaws or manufacturing defects related to our products or the use of our products with incompatible components or systems. In addition, as we continue to expand our product portfolio, we may enter or create new markets, including consumer markets, that may expose us to additional product liability risks. For example, with the acquisition of TNI\u00ae in March 2020, we added softFlow\u00ae technology to our product portfolio. While this technology provides efficient, quiet and comfortable respiratory support to patients, it may present increased risk of infection to caregivers.\nWe cannot be certain that our product liability insurance will be sufficient to cover any or all damages for product liability claims that may be brought against us in the future. Furthermore, we may not be able to obtain or maintain insurance in the future at satisfactory rates or in adequate amounts to protect us against any product liability claims.\nAdditionally, the laws and regulations regarding product liability are constantly evolving, both through the passage of new legislation at the state and federal levels and through new interpretations of existing legislation. For example, in February 2017, the Washington Supreme Court determined that, under the Washington Product Liability Act, medical device manufacturers have a duty to warn hospitals of any potential risks posed by their products. As the legal and regulatory landscape surrounding product liability change, we may become exposed to greater liability than currently anticipated.\nAny losses that we may suffer from product liability claims, and the effect that any product liability litigation may have upon the reputation and marketability of our technology and products, together with the corresponding diversion of the attention of our key employees, may subject us to significant damages and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may incur environmental and personal injury liabilities related to certain hazardous materials used in our operations.\nCertain manufacturing processes for our products may involve the storage, use, generation and disposal of certain hazardous materials and wastes, including silicone adhesives, solder and solder paste, sealants, epoxies and various solvents such as methyl ethyl ketone, acetone and isopropyl alcohol. As a result, we are subject to certain environmental laws, as well as certain other laws and regulations, that restrict the materials that can be used in our products or in our manufacturing processes. For example, products that we sell in Europe are subject to regulation in the EU markets under the Restriction of the Use of Hazardous Substances Directive (RoHS). RoHS prohibits companies from selling products that contain certain hazardous materials in EU member states. In addition, the EU\u2019s Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and Restriction of Chemicals Directive also restricts substances of very high concern in products. Compliance with such regulations may be costly and, therefore, we may incur significant costs to comply with these laws and regulations.\nIn addition, new environmental laws may further affect how we manufacture our products, how we use, generate or dispose of hazardous materials and waste, or further affect what materials can be used in our products. Any required changes to our operations or products may increase our manufacturing costs, detrimentally impact the performance of our products, add greater testing lead-times for product introductions or have other similar effects.\nIn connection with our research and manufacturing activities, we use, and our employees may be exposed to, materials that are hazardous to human health, safety or the environment. The risk of accidental injury to our employees or contamination from these materials cannot be eliminated, and we could be held liable for any resulting damages, the related liability for which could exceed our reserves. We do not specifically insure against environmental liabilities. If an enforcement action were to occur, our reputation and our business and financial condition may be harmed, even if we were to prevail or settle the action on terms favorable to us.\nWe rely significantly on information technology and any failure, inadequacy, interruption or security lapse of that technology, including any cybersecurity incidents, could harm our ability to operate our business effectively.\nIncreased global cybersecurity vulnerabilities, cybersecurity threats and sophisticated and targeted cybersecurity attacks pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks, including the confidentiality, availability and integrity of any underlying information and data, and those of our customers, partners, suppliers and third-party service providers. Our ability to effectively manage and maintain our internal business information, and to ship products to customers and invoice them on a timely basis, depends significantly on our enterprise resource planning system and other information systems.\nPortions of our information technology systems may experience interruptions, delays or cessations of service or produce errors in connection with ongoing systems implementation work. In addition, interfaces between our products and our customers\u2019 computer networks could provide additional opportunities for cybersecurity attacks on us and our customers. The techniques used to attack computer systems are sophisticated, change frequently and may originate from less regulated and remote areas of the world. Cybersecurity attacks in particular are evolving and include, but are not limited to: threats, malicious software, ransomware, attempts to gain unauthorized access to data and other electronic security breaches that could lead to disruptions in systems, misappropriation of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data. As a result, there can be no assurance that our protective measures will prevent or detect security breaches that could have a significant impact on our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe failure of these systems to operate or integrate effectively with other internal, customer, supplier or third-party service provider systems and to protect the underlying information technology system and data integrity, including from cyber-attacks, intrusions or other breaches or unauthorized access of these systems, or any failure by us to remediate any such attacks or breaches, may also result in damage to our reputation or competitiveness, delays in product fulfillment and reduced efficiency of our operations, and could require significant capital investments to remediate any such failure, problem or breach, all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDiscontinuation, reform or replacement of LIBOR and other benchmark rates, or uncertainty related to the potential for any of the foregoing, may adversely affect our business.\nThe U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced in 2017 that it intends to phase out the London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) by the end of 2023. In addition, other regulators have suggested reforming or replacing other benchmark rates. The discontinuation, reform or replacement of LIBOR or any other benchmark rates may have an unpredictable impact on contractual mechanics in the credit markets or cause disruption to the broader financial markets. Uncertainty as to the nature of such potential discontinuation, reform or replacement may also negatively impact interest expense related to borrowings under our Credit Facility. Borrowings under our Credit Facility bear interest, at our election, either at the Alternate Base Rate (as defined in the Credit Facility), or at the Adjusted LIBO Rate (as defined in the Credit Facility), which is derived from LIBOR. We may in the future pursue amendments to our Credit Facility to provide for a transition mechanism or other reference rate in anticipation of LIBOR\u2019s discontinuation, but we may not be able to reach agreement with our Lenders on any such amendments. As a result, additional financing to replace any then-outstanding LIBOR-based debt may be unavailable, more expensive or restricted by the terms of such outstanding indebtedness.\nOur stock price may be volatile, and your investment in our stock could suffer a decline in value.\nThere has been and could continue to be significant volatility in the market price and trading volume of equity securities. For example, our closing stock price ranged from $208.49 to $303.29 per share from January 3, 2021 to January 1, 2022. Factors contributing to our stock price volatility may include our financial performance, as well as broader economic, political and market factors, including the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to the other risk factors previously discussed in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, there are many other factors that we may not be able to control that could have a significant effect on our stock price. These include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results or future prospects;\n\u2022our announcements or our competitors\u2019 announcements of new products;\n\u2022the public\u2019s reaction to our press releases, our other public announcements and our filings with the SEC;\n\u2022strategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;\n\u2022new laws or regulations or new interpretations of existing laws or regulations applicable to our business;\n\u2022changes in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u2022changes in our growth rates or our competitors\u2019 growth rates;\n\u2022developments regarding our patents or proprietary rights or those of our competitors;\n\u2022ongoing legal proceedings;\n\u2022our inability to raise additional capital as needed;\n\u2022concerns or allegations as to the safety or efficacy of our products;\n\u2022changes in financial markets or general economic conditions, including the effects of recession or slow economic growth in the U.S. and abroad;\n\u2022effects of public health crises, epidemics and pandemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022sales of stock by us or members of our management team, our Board or certain institutional stockholders; and\n\u2022changes in stock market analyst recommendations or earnings estimates regarding our stock, other comparable companies or our industry generally.\nTherefore, you may not be able to resell your shares at or above the price you paid for them.\nOur investors could experience substantial dilution of their investments as a result of subsequent exercises of our outstanding options, vesting of outstanding restricted stock units (RSUs) and performance stock units (PSUs), or the grant of future equity awards by us.\nAs of January 1, 2022, approximately 10.6 million shares of our common stock were reserved for issuance under our equity incentive plans, of which approximately 3.0 million shares were subject to options outstanding at such date at a weighted-average exercise price of $81.38 per share, approximately 2.9 million shares were subject to outstanding RSUs, approximately 0.3 million shares were subject to outstanding PSUs and approximately 4.4 million shares were available for future awards under our 2017 Equity Incentive Plan. Over the past 36 months, we have experienced higher rates of stock option exercises compared to many earlier periods, and this trend may continue. To the extent outstanding options are exercised or outstanding RSUs or PSUs vest, our existing stockholders may incur dilution.\nWe rely on equity awards to motivate current employees and to attract new employees. The grant of future equity awards by us to our employees and other service providers may further dilute our stockholders.\nFuture resales of our stock, including those by our insiders and a few investment funds, may cause our stock price to decline.\nA significant portion of our outstanding shares are held by our directors, our executive officers and a few investment funds. Resales by these stockholders of a substantial number of such shares, announcements of any proposed resale of substantial amounts of our stock or the perception that substantial resales may be made, could significantly reduce the market price of our stock. Some of our directors and executive officers have entered into Rule 10b5-1 trading plans pursuant to which they have arranged to sell shares of our stock from time to time in the future. Generally, these sales require public filings. Actual or potential sales by these insiders, including those under a pre-arranged Rule 10b5-1 trading plan, could be interpreted by the market as an indication that the insider has lost confidence in our stock and reduce the market price of our stock.\nWe have registered and expect to continue to register shares reserved under our equity plans pursuant to Registration Statements on Form S-8. All shares issued pursuant to a Registration Statement on Form S-8 can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance, subject to restrictions on our affiliates under Rule 144. If a large number of these shares are sold in the public market, the sales could reduce the trading price of our stock.\nWe may elect not to declare cash dividends on our stock, may elect to only pay dividends on an infrequent or irregular basis, or may elect not to make any additional stock repurchases. As a result, any return on your investment may be limited to the value of our stock. In addition, the payment of any future dividends or the repurchase of our stock might limit our ability to pursue other growth opportunities.\nOur Board may from time to time declare, and we may pay, dividends on our outstanding shares in the manner and upon the terms and conditions permitted under applicable law. However, we may elect to retain all future earnings for the operation and expansion of our business, rather than paying cash dividends on our stock. In addition, under certain circumstances, our Credit Facility may limit our ability to pay cash dividends, repurchase our common stock or make other distributions to stockholders. Any payment of cash dividends on our stock will be at the discretion of our Board and will depend upon our results of operations, earnings, capital requirements, financial condition, business prospects, contractual restrictions and other factors deemed relevant by our Board. In addition, our ability to pay dividends may be limited or subject to the lender\u2019s consent under our New Debt Facility. In the event our Board declares any dividends, there is no assurance with respect to the amount, timing or frequency of any such dividends.\nAny repurchase of our common stock under the stock repurchase plan authorized by our Board in October 2021 (2021 Repurchase Program) will be at the discretion of a committee comprised of our CEO and Chief Financial Officer, and will depend on several factors, including, but not limited to, results of operations, capital requirements, financial conditions, available capital from operations or other sources and the market price of our common stock. Therefore, there is no assurance with respect to the amount, price or timing of any such repurchases. We may elect to retain all future earnings for the operation and expansion of our business, rather than repurchasing additional outstanding shares. For additional information related to our 2021 Repurchase Program, please see Note 17 to our accompanying consolidated financial statements included in Part IV, Item 15(a) of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn the event we pay dividends, or make any stock repurchases in the future, our ability to finance any material expansion of our business, including through acquisitions, investments or increased capital spending, or to fund our operations, may be limited. In addition, any repurchases we may make in the future may not prove to be at optimal prices. Our Board may modify or amend the 2021 Repurchase Program, or adopt a new stock repurchase program, at any time at its discretion without stockholder approval.\nEnvironmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) regulations, global climate change, corporate citizenship and related matters/provisions may make our supply chain more complex, and our reporting of such matters and may adversely affect our business.\nThere is an increasing focus on the governance of environmental and social risks. Our customers and distributors have adopted, or may adopt, procurement policies that include ESG provisions that their suppliers or manufacturers must comply with, or they may seek to include such provisions in their terms and conditions. An increasing number of participants in the medical device industry are also joining voluntary ESG groups or organizations. These ESG provisions and initiatives are subject to change, can be unpredictable, and may be difficult and expensive for us to comply with, given the complexity of our supply chain and the outsourced manufacturing of certain components of our products. If we are unable to comply, or are unable to cause our suppliers to comply, with such policies or provisions, a customer may cease purchasing products from us, and may take legal action against us, which could harm our reputation, revenue and results of operations.\nFurther, increased public awareness and concern regarding global climate change may result in new or enhanced legal requirements. There continues to be a lack of consistent climate legislation, which creates economic and regulatory uncertainty. Such uncertainty may have an impact on our business, from the demand for our customers\u2019 products to our costs of compliance in the manufacturing and servicing of our customers\u2019 products, all of which may impact our results of operations. In addition, climate change initiatives and legislation could also disrupt our operations by impacting the availability and cost of materials within our supply chain, and could also increase insurance and other operating costs.\nInvestors, stockholders, customers, suppliers and other third parties are increasingly focusing on ESG and corporate social responsibility endeavors and reporting and transparency. Certain institutional investors, investment funds, other influential investors, customers, suppliers and other third parties are also increasingly focused on ESG practices. Companies that do not adapt to or comply with the evolving investor or stakeholder expectations and standards, or which are perceived to have not responded appropriately, may suffer from reputational damage and result in the business, financial condition and/or stock price of a company being materially and adversely affected. Further, this increased focus on ESG issues may result in new regulations and/or third-party requirements that could adversely impact our business, or certain shareholders reducing or eliminating their holdings of our stock. Additionally, an allegation or perception that we have not taken sufficient action in these areas could negatively harm our reputation.\nWe are subject to recently enacted state laws in California that require gender and diversity quotas for boards of directors of public companies headquartered in California.\nIn September 2018, California enacted Senator Bill 826 (SB 826), which generally requires public companies with principal executive offices in California to have at least two female directors on its board of directors if the company has at least five directors, and at least three female directors on its board of directors if the company has at least six directors.\nAdditionally, on September 30, 2020, California enacted Assembly Bill 979 (AB 979), which generally requires public companies with principal executive offices in California to include specified numbers of directors from \u201cunderrepresented communities\u201d. A director from an \u201cunderrepresented community\u201d means a director who self-identifies as Black, African American, Hispanic, Latino, Asian, Pacific Islander, Native American, Native Hawaiian, Alaska Native, gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender. By December 31, 2021, each public company with principal executive offices in California was required to have at least one director from an underrepresented community. By December 31, 2022, a public company with more than four but fewer than nine directors will be required to have a minimum of two directors from underrepresented communities, and a public company with nine or more directors will need to have a minimum of three directors from underrepresented communities.\nWe cannot assure that we can recruit, attract and/or retain qualified members of the board and meet gender and diversity quotas as required by SB 826 or AB 979, and our board of directors does not currently satisfy the quota required under SB 826. A failure to comply with either SB 826 or AB 979 could result in fines from the California Secretary of State, with a $100,000 fine for the first violation and a $300,000 fine for each subsequent violation of either law, and our reputation may be adversely affected.", "PERMNO": 92220, "SIC": 3845, "TIC": "MASI"}
