{"cik": "1105705", "company": "TIME WARNER INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-25", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nThe Company must respond successfully to ongoing changes in the U.S. television industry and consumer viewing patterns to remain competitive. The Company derives a substantial portion of its revenues and profits from its cable networks and premium pay television services and the production and licensing of television programming to broadcast and cable networks and premium pay television services. The U.S. television industry is evolving, with developments in technology leading to new video services that are experiencing rapid growth, resulting in higher overall video content consumption as well as a shift in consumer viewing patterns as consumers seek more control over when, where and how they view video content. These changes pose risks to the traditional U.S. television industry and some of the Company\u2019s longest-standing business models, including (i) the disruption of the traditional television content delivery model by video streaming services, some of which are growing rapidly, which could lead to further declines in subscribers to multichannel video services and to lower growth in subscription revenues; (ii) the disruption of the advertising supported television model due to increased video consumption on digital distribution platforms with no advertising or less advertising than on television networks, time shifted viewing of television programming, and the use of digital video recorders to skip advertisements; and (iii) the risk that one or more of the Company\u2019s networks will not be included in \u201cskinny bundles\u201d of networks being offered by some affiliates. As a result of some of these risks, in 2015, the U.S. television industry experienced declines in subscribers to multichannel video services and industry-wide declines in ratings for programming, which has negatively affected advertising and subscription revenues. Actions by the multichannel video services to counteract the subscriber declines, such as offering smaller bundles of networks, may not be sufficient and may present other risks to the Company\u2019s businesses. The Company\u2019s strategy to address these risks, including continuing to invest in high-quality original programming to strengthen its position within the traditional TV ecosystem, investing in technology and working with affiliates to enhance the value of multichannel video subscriptions to consumers, and selectively licensing its content to SVOD services while pursuing new opportunities for the distribution of its content, including on OTT services, may not be successful. The Company may incur significant costs to implement its strategy and respond to and mitigate the risks from these changes, and, if not successful, could experience a significant adverse impact on the Company\u2019s competitive position, businesses and results of operations.\nThe popularity of content is difficult to predict and can change rapidly, and low public acceptance of the Company\u2019s content will adversely affect its results of operations. The revenues derived from the sale, distribution and licensing of television programming, feature films, videogames and other content depend primarily on widespread public acceptance of that content, which is difficult to predict and can change rapidly. The Company must invest substantial amounts in the production and marketing of its content before it learns whether such content will reach anticipated levels of popularity with consumers. The popularity of the Company\u2019s content depends on many factors, only some of which are within the Company\u2019s control. Examples include the popularity of competing content (including locally produced content internationally), the availability of alternative forms of leisure and entertainment activities, the Company\u2019s ability to maintain or develop strong brand awareness and target key audiences, and the Company\u2019s ability to successfully anticipate (and timely adapt its content to) changes in consumer tastes in the many countries and territories in which the Company operates. Low public acceptance of the Company\u2019s content will adversely affect its results of operations.\nGenerally, feature films that perform well at the global box office also have commercial success in subsequent distribution channels. Therefore, the underperformance of a feature film, especially an \u201cevent\u201d film, at the global box office can result in lower than expected revenues for the Company from the license of the film to broadcast and cable networks and SVOD and other OTT services, sales of the film in digital and physical formats, and from the sale of videogames or licenses for consumer products based on such film. If a new \u201cevent\u201d film fails to achieve commercial success at the global box office, it would limit the Company\u2019s ability to create a new theatrical franchise based on the film or characters featured in such film. The failure to develop successful new theatrical franchises could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nLow ratings for television programming produced by the Company may lead to the cancellation of a program and can negatively affect future license fees for the cancelled program. A decline in the ratings or popularity of the television programming aired on Turner\u2019s cable networks can negatively affect advertising revenues for Turner\u2019s cable networks in the near term and, over a longer period of time, could adversely affect subscription revenues and the distribution potential of a Turner network. A decline in the popularity of HBO\u2019s and Cinemax\u2019s programming could, over a period of time, cause subscribers to cancel their subscriptions, which in turn could adversely affect both the Company\u2019s subscription and content licensing revenues. If the Company decides to no longer air programming due to low ratings or other factors, the Company\ncould incur significant programming impairments, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations in a given period.\nThe failure to renew agreements with affiliates on favorable terms or at all could cause the Company\u2019s subscription and advertising revenues to decline. The Company depends on agreements with affiliates for the distribution of the Company\u2019s cable networks, premium pay television and streaming services. Competition from SVOD and other OTT services and new distribution platforms and declines in multichannel video service subscribers is increasing the pressure on affiliates to control their programming costs in order to maintain their profitability while offering their services at prices that enable them to continue to attract and retain subscribers. As affiliates continue to try to control their programming costs, it may be more difficult for the Company to secure favorable terms, including those related to pricing, positioning and packaging, during renewal negotiations with affiliates, and the Company may face greater difficulty in achieving placement of its networks in smaller bundles being offered by affiliates. The Company\u2019s efforts to capitalize on new growth opportunities outside the traditional TV ecosystem may also make it more difficult to secure favorable terms during renewal negotiations with affiliates. An additional factor making it more difficult to secure favorable terms during renewal negotiations is the consolidation of affiliates in the U.S. and growth of large multi-territory distribution companies internationally, which increases their scale and negotiating power.\nIf the Company is not able to secure favorable terms when it renews its affiliate agreements, its subscription revenues may not increase as much as the Company expects or could decline. In addition, the inability to renew one or more of the Company\u2019s larger affiliate arrangements would reduce the number of households that have access to Turner\u2019s cable networks and result in lower ratings for programming, which could make those networks less attractive to advertisers and result in lower growth or a decline in advertising revenues.\nSome initiatives to respond to and address the changes to the U.S. television industry and consumer viewing patterns may be outside the Company\u2019s control. While the Company supports the development of better consumer interfaces, the development and implementation of these interfaces are often outside the Company\u2019s control. In addition, the Company may not be able to introduce new business models and products to enhance the value of multichannel video subscriptions to consumers without the cooperation of affiliates.\nIf the rate of decline in the number of multichannel video service subscribers increases, the Company\u2019s subscription revenues will be negatively affected. During 2014 and 2015, the number of multichannel video service subscribers in the U.S. declined slightly, and the Company expects further modest declines. If multichannel video service offerings are not attractive to consumers due to increases in rates, increased competition from SVOD and other OTT services, worse economic conditions or other factors, more consumers may (i) cancel their multichannel video service subscriptions or choose not to subscribe to multichannel video services, (ii) cancel their subscriptions to premium pay television services or (iii) elect to subscribe to lower-priced streaming services or smaller bundles of networks offered by affiliates, which may not include HBO, Cinemax or some of Turner\u2019s cable networks. The number of HBO and Cinemax subscribers could also decline if affiliates choose not to market, or reduce their marketing of, HBO or Cinemax. If the rate of decline in the number of multichannel video service subscribers increases or if subscribers shift to affiliates\u2019 lower-cost streaming services or smaller bundles of networks that do not include all of the Company\u2019s cable networks and premium pay services, the Company\u2019s subscription revenues will be negatively affected.\nA decrease in demand for the television programming produced by Warner Bros. could adversely affect the Company\u2019s revenues. Warner Bros. is a leading producer of high-quality television programming, as well as a leader in the international distribution of U.S.-produced television programming. Even with its strong competitive position, Warner Bros.\u2019 television production business is largely dependent on the strength of the U.S. broadcast networks, basic cable networks and local television stations, and their continued demand for Warner Bros.\u2019 television programming. If there is a decrease in such demand, it could decrease the overall scale of Warner Bros.\u2019 television production business, reduce the aggregate license fees for its television programming in the short-term and reduce the aggregate syndication revenues for its television programming in the long-term. The following factors could increase the likelihood of a decrease in such demand in the U.S.: (i) for vertically-integrated networks, increased reliance by such networks on their in-house and affiliated television production studios, which can provide them more control over intellectual property rights and syndication and license fees in the U.S. and internationally; (ii) technological advances and alternative viewing options that could reduce the lifetime value of television programming; and (iii) consolidation among television station groups, thereby reducing the number of buyers\nfor Warner Bros.\u2019 programming. In international territories, the increasing popularity of locally produced television content could result in decreased demand and lower license fees for the Company\u2019s U.S.-produced television programming.\nAn increase in the costs incurred by Turner and Home Box Office to acquire or produce popular programming could adversely affect the Company\u2019s operating results. Competition to acquire popular programming is intense both in the U.S. and internationally among networks and SVOD services. As more networks and SVOD services seek to offer distinctive programming, including sports programming, and are willing to invest more to do so, Turner and Home Box Office may have to increase the prices they are willing to pay for sports, original and acquired programming, including the renewal of programming they currently license. Cable networks, premium pay television services and SVOD services are increasing their investments in original programming, which could drive up talent and production costs. If increases in Turner\u2019s and Home Box Office\u2019s costs to produce or acquire popular programming are not offset by increases in affiliates\u2019 fees when affiliate agreements are renewed and increases in advertising revenues for Turner\u2019s cable networks, the Company\u2019s results of operations could be adversely affected.\nThe Company\u2019s results of operations could be adversely affected if there is a decline in advertising spending, which could be caused by a number of factors. A decline in the economic prospects of advertisers or the economy in general could cause advertisers to spend less on advertising. In addition, television advertising expenditures could be negatively affected by (i) further declines in multichannel video service subscribers; (ii) increasing audience fragmentation caused by increased availability of alternative forms of leisure and entertainment activities; (iii) shifts in consumer viewing patterns, including the increased use of digital video recorders to skip advertisements, increased numbers of consumers watching programming on demand on a time-delayed basis, and consumers watching more non-traditional and shorter-form video online; (iv) a shift of advertising to online and mobile offerings; (v) pressure from public interest groups to reduce or eliminate advertising of certain products on television; (vi) new laws and regulations that prohibit or restrict certain types of advertisements; and (vii) natural disasters, extreme weather, acts of terrorism, political uncertainty or hostilities, because there may be uninterrupted news coverage of such events that disrupts regular television programming. In addition, advertisers\u2019 willingness to purchase advertising time from the Company may be adversely affected by a decline in audience ratings for the programming aired on Turner\u2019s cable networks. If ratings decline significantly, Turner\u2019s cable networks generally will be required to provide additional advertising time to advertisers to reach agreed-on audience delivery thresholds. This may result in Turner\u2019s cable networks having less advertising time available to sell or use to promote their own programming. In addition, if the television ratings system is not changed so that it captures the viewership of programming through digital video recorders, VOD and digital platforms and devices, advertisers may not be willing to pay advertising rates based on the increasing viewership that occurs after the initial airing of a program and on digital platforms and devices. Turner\u2019s advertising revenues may be adversely affected by plans Turner has announced to reduce the amount of advertising on select programming on some of its cable networks to improve the viewing experience, if the actions do not result in improved ratings and advertising rates for the programming with fewer advertisements. Finally, Turner\u2019s advertising revenues from online and mobile offerings could be adversely affected by technology that enables consumers to block advertisements.\nThe Company\u2019s results of operations may be adversely affected if the Company\u2019s efforts to increase digital sales of its film and television content and make digital ownership of content more compelling to consumers are not successful. Several factors have contributed to an industry-wide decline in sales of home entertainment products in physical formats in recent years, including consumers shifting to SVOD and other OTT services and electronic purchases and rentals; consumers electing to rent films using discount rental kiosks, which generate significantly less profit per transaction for the Company than the sale of home entertainment products in physical formats; changing retailer strategies and initiatives (e.g., reduction in floor space devoted to home entertainment products in physical formats); retail store closures; weak economic conditions; increasing competition for consumer discretionary time and spending; and piracy. The Company\u2019s efforts to offset the decline in sales of home entertainment products in physical formats and to make digital ownership of content more attractive to consumers may not be successful or may take several more years to become successful.\nIf the Company fails to compete successfully against alternative sources of entertainment and news, there may be an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations. The Company competes with all other sources of entertainment and news, including television, premium pay television services, SVOD and other OTT services, feature films, the Internet, home entertainment products, videogames, social networking, print media, pirated content, live sports and other events, for consumers\u2019 leisure and entertainment time and discretionary spending. The increased number of media and entertainment\nchoices available to consumers has made it much more difficult to attract and obtain their attention and time. There can be no assurance that the Company will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors.\nThe Company is exposed to risks associated with weak economic conditions and increased volatility and disruption in the financial markets. The Company\u2019s financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by weak economic conditions in the U.S. and other countries where the Company does business and the impact of those conditions on advertisers, affiliates, suppliers, retailers, insurers, theater operators and others with which it does business. The global economy continues to be volatile, with slower economic growth in some large emerging economies such as China, India and Brazil and economic uncertainties arising from governmental actions in some countries such as Russia and Venezuela. These conditions could lead to lower consumer spending for the Company\u2019s content and products in these regions and countries, particularly if advertisers, licensees, retailers, theater operators and consumers reduce their demand for the Company\u2019s content and products due to the negative impact of these conditions on them. Consumer spending in these regions and countries may be further negatively impacted by governmental actions to manage national economic matters, whether through austerity or stimulus measures or initiatives intended to control wages, unemployment, credit availability, inflation, taxation and other economic drivers.\nIncreased volatility and disruptions in the financial markets could make it more difficult and more expensive for the Company to refinance outstanding indebtedness and obtain new financing. The adoption of new statutes and regulations, new interpretations of existing statutes and regulations or the enforcement of laws and regulations applicable to the financial markets or the financial services industry could result in a reduction in the amount of available credit or an increase in the cost of credit. Disruptions in the financial markets can also adversely affect the Company\u2019s lenders, insurers and counterparties, including vendors, retailers and film co-financing partners. The inability of the Company\u2019s counterparties to obtain capital on acceptable terms could impair their ability to perform under agreements with the Company and lead to negative effects on the Company, including business disruptions, decreased revenues, increases in bad debt expenses and, in the case of film co-financing partners, greater risk to the Company with respect to the performance of its feature films.\nThe Company faces risks relating to conducting business internationally that could adversely affect its businesses and operating results. It is important for the Company to achieve sufficient scale in key international territories in a cost-effective manner to be able to compete successfully in those territories. Failure to achieve sufficient scale could adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations. In addition, there are risks inherent in international business operations, including:\n\u2022\nissues related to integrating and managing international operations and investments;\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax developments;\n\u2022\nlack of sufficient protection for intellectual property in some countries;\n\u2022\nterritorial restrictions on content licensing;\n\u2022\ncurrency exchange restrictions, export controls and currency devaluation risks in some foreign countries, including, but not limited to, Argentina and Venezuela;\n\u2022\nthe existence in some countries of statutory shareholder minority rights and restrictions on foreign direct ownership;\n\u2022\nthe existence of quotas and other content-related limitations or restrictions (e.g., government censorship);\n\u2022\nrestrictions on television advertising, marketing and network packaging;\n\u2022\nissues related to occupational safety and adherence to local labor laws and regulations;\n\u2022\npolitical or social unrest;\n\u2022\nhigher than anticipated costs of entry;\n\u2022\nthe presence of corruption in certain countries;\n\u2022\nthe absence of good diplomatic relations between the U.S. and certain countries; and\n\u2022\nthe potential for government appropriation of the Company\u2019s assets.\nOne or more of these factors could harm the Company\u2019s international operations or investments and its operating results.\nSome of the Company\u2019s operations are conducted in foreign currencies, and the value of these currencies fluctuates in relation to the U.S. dollar. Although the Company hedges a portion of its foreign currency exposures, significant fluctuations in exchange rates in the past have had, and in the future could have, an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations\nin a given period. As the Company expands its international operations, its exposure to foreign currency fluctuations will increase.\nSome of the Company\u2019s businesses generate cash receipts in Venezuela. The Venezuelan government has imposed significant limits on the exchange of local currency into U.S. dollars in recent years. Although Venezuela implemented changes during 2014 and 2015 that increased the potential to convert Venezuelan Bolivars Fuertes (\u201cVEF\u201d) to U.S. dollars, the Company has been unable to exchange its VEF to U.S. dollars due to restrictions associated with the exchanges. The Company recognized a pretax foreign exchange loss during each of 2014 and 2015 related to new exchanges established by the Venezuelan government and the exchange rate used to remeasure the Company\u2019s VEF-denominated transactions and balances. There can be no assurance as to when, if or the rate at which the Company will be able to exchange its VEF to U.S. dollars and it is possible that the Venezuelan government could issue additional regulations or take other actions that could affect the Company\u2019s ability to exchange VEF to U.S. dollars or the rate at which it remeasures its VEF-denomianted transactions and balances for financial reporting purposes.\nIncreased piracy of the Company\u2019s content, products and other intellectual property may further decrease the revenues received from the legitimate sale, licensing and distribution of its content and adversely affect its business and profitability. The Company continues to be negatively affected by piracy, and an increase in the piracy of the Company\u2019s content, products and other intellectual property could reduce the revenues the Company earns from the legitimate sale, licensing and distribution of its content, products and other intellectual property. The risks relating to piracy have increased in recent years due to technological developments that have made it easier to create, distribute and store high-quality unauthorized copies of content, such as the proliferation of cloud-based storage and streaming services, increased broadband Internet speeds and penetration rates, and increased availability and speed of mobile data transmission. Piracy is particularly prevalent in countries that lack effective copyright and technical legal protections or enforcement measures, and illegitimate operators based in those parts of the world can attract viewers from anywhere in the world. The Company devotes substantial resources to protecting its content, products and intellectual property, but the Company\u2019s efforts to enforce its rights and combat piracy may not be successful.\nThe Company\u2019s operating results may suffer if it cannot continue to license and exploit its intellectual property rights. The Company relies on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks, tradenames and other proprietary rights, as well as contractual arrangements, including licenses, to establish, maintain and protect its intellectual property rights. Effective intellectual property protection may not be available in every country in which the Company does business. The Company may not be able to acquire or maintain appropriate domain names in all countries in which it does business or prevent others from acquiring domain names that are similar to, infringe on, or diminish the value of, the Company\u2019s trademarks and other proprietary rights. Companies that license the Company\u2019s intellectual property also may take actions that diminish the value of the Company\u2019s intellectual property or harm the Company\u2019s reputation.\nThe Company\u2019s intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to permit it to take advantage of some business opportunities, such as new distribution platforms. As a result, the Company may be required to change its plans or acquire the necessary intellectual property rights, which could be costly.\nThe protection of the Company\u2019s intellectual property may require the Company to spend significant amounts of money. Further, the steps the Company takes to protect its intellectual property may not adequately protect its rights or prevent others from infringing or misappropriating its intellectual proprietary rights. Any impairment of the Company\u2019s intellectual property rights, including due to changes in U.S. or foreign intellectual property laws or the absence of effective legal protections or enforcement measures, could adversely impact the Company\u2019s businesses, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company has been, and may be in the future, subject to claims that it infringed intellectual property rights of others, which could require the Company to change its business practices. Successful claims that the Company infringes on the intellectual property rights of others could require the Company to enter into royalty or licensing agreements on unfavorable terms, incur substantial monetary liability, be prohibited preliminarily or permanently from further use of the intellectual property in question or require the Company to change its business practices to stop the infringing use, which could limit its ability to compete effectively. Even if the Company believes a claim of intellectual property infringement is without merit, defending against the claim can be time-consuming and costly and divert management\u2019s attention and resources away from its businesses.\nThe Company\u2019s businesses are subject to labor interruption. The Company and some of its suppliers and business partners retain the services of writers, directors, actors, athletes, technicians, trade employees and others involved in the development and production of its television programming and feature films who are covered by collective bargaining agreements. If negotiations to renew expiring collective bargaining agreements are not successful or become unproductive, the affected unions could take actions such as strikes, work slowdowns or work stoppages. Such actions or the possibility of such actions could result in delays in the production of the Company\u2019s television programming and feature films. The Company could also incur higher costs from such actions, new collective bargaining agreements or the renewal of collective bargaining agreements on less favorable terms. Many of the collective bargaining agreements that cover individuals providing services to the Company are industry-wide agreements, and the Company may lack practical control over the negotiations and terms of these agreements. Union or labor disputes or player lock-outs relating to certain professional sports leagues may preclude the Company from producing and telecasting scheduled games or events and could negatively impact the Company\u2019s promotional and marketing opportunities. Depending on their duration, such union or labor disputes or player lock-outs could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nService disruptions or failures of the Company\u2019s or its vendors\u2019 information systems and networks as a result of computer viruses, misappropriation of data or other bad acts, natural disasters, extreme weather, accidental releases of information or other similar events, may disrupt the Company\u2019s businesses, damage its reputation or have a negative impact on its results of operations. Shutdowns or service disruptions of information systems or networks at the Company or vendors that provide information systems, networks or other services to the Company pose increasing risks. Such disruptions may be caused by third-party hacking of computers and systems; dissemination of computer viruses, worms and other destructive or disruptive software; denial of service attacks and other bad acts, as well as power outages, natural disasters, extreme weather, terrorist attacks, or other similar events. Shutdowns or disruption from such events could have an adverse impact on the Company and its customers, including degradation or disruption of service, loss of data and damage to equipment and data. System redundancy may be ineffective or inadequate, and the Company\u2019s disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient to cover everything that could happen. Significant events could result in a disruption of the Company\u2019s operations, reduced revenues, the loss of or damage to the integrity of data used by management to make decisions and operate the Company\u2019s business, customer or advertiser dissatisfaction, damage to the Company\u2019s reputation or brands or a loss of customers. The Company may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate it for any losses associated with such events.\nThe Company is also subject to risks caused by the misappropriation, misuse, falsification or intentional or accidental release or loss of data maintained in the information systems and networks of the Company or its vendors, including confidential personnel, customer or vendor data. Outside parties may attempt to penetrate the Company\u2019s systems or those of its vendors or fraudulently induce employees or customers of the Company or employees of its vendors to disclose sensitive information to obtain or gain access to the Company\u2019s data. The number and sophistication of attempted and successful information security breaches have increased in recent years. If a material breach of the Company\u2019s information systems or those of its vendors occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s information security measures could be harmed, the Company could lose customers and advertisers, and its reputation, brands and credibility could be damaged. In addition, if a material breach of its information systems occurs, the Company could be required to expend significant amounts of money and other resources to repair or replace information systems or networks or to comply with notification requirements. The Company also could be subject to actions by regulatory authorities and claims asserted in private litigation in the event of a breach of the information systems of the Company or its vendors.\nAlthough the Company develops and maintains information security practices and systems designed to prevent these events from occurring, the development and maintenance of these systems are costly and require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and tactics to overcome information security measures become more sophisticated. Moreover, despite the Company\u2019s efforts, the possibility of these events occurring cannot be eliminated entirely. As the Company distributes more of its content digitally, engages in more electronic transactions with consumers, increases the number of information technology systems used in its business operations, relies more on cloud-based services and information systems and increases its use of third-party service providers to perform information technology services, the related information security risks will continue to increase and the Company will need to expend additional resources to protect its information systems, networks and data.\nService disruptions or the failure of communications satellites or transmitter facilities relied on by the Company could have a negative impact on the Company\u2019s revenues. Turner and Home Box Office rely on communications satellites and transmitter facilities to transmit their programming to affiliates and other distributors. Shutdowns of satellites and transmitter facilities or service disruptions pose significant risks to the Company\u2019s operations. Such disruptions may be caused by power outages, natural disasters, extreme weather, terrorist attacks, failures or impairments of communications satellites or on-ground uplinks or downlinks used to transmit programming, or other similar events. If a satellite is not able to transmit the Company\u2019s programming, the Company may not be able to secure an alternative communication satellite in a timely manner, because there are a limited number of communications satellites available for the transmission of programming. If such an event were to occur, there could be a disruption in the delivery of the Company\u2019s programming, which could harm the Company\u2019s reputation and adversely affect the Company\u2019s results of operations.\nThe Company\u2019s businesses are subject to regulation in the U.S. and internationally, which could cause the Company to incur additional costs or liabilities or disrupt its business practices. The Company\u2019s businesses are subject to a variety of U.S. and international laws and regulations. See Item 1, \u201cBusiness - Regulatory Matters,\u201d for a description of significant U.S. federal, state, local and international laws, regulations, regulatory agency inquiries, rulemaking proceedings and other developments affecting the Company and its businesses. The Company could incur significant costs to comply with new laws or regulations or changes in interpretations of laws or regulations or substantial penalties or other liabilities if it fails to comply with them. Compliance with new laws or regulations also could cause the Company to change or limit its business practices in a manner that is adverse to its businesses. In addition, if there are changes in laws or regulations that provide protections that the Company relies on in conducting its businesses, these changes could subject the Company to greater risk of liability and could increase compliance costs or limit the Company\u2019s ability to operate certain lines of business.\nThe Company\u2019s enterprise efficiency initiatives present various risks, including the risk that the Company may not realize the financial and strategic goals relating to the initiatives. The Company has multi-year enterprise efficiency initiatives underway to deliver certain business support services (e.g., real estate and certain information technology functions) centrally to the Company\u2019s divisions. The Company may incur greater than anticipated expenses in connection with these initiatives, fail to realize anticipated benefits, experience business disruptions or have difficulty executing the initiatives.\nIf the separation of any of Time Inc., AOL Inc. (\u201cAOL\u201d) or Time Warner Cable Inc. (\u201cTWC\u201d) is determined to be taxable for income tax purposes, Time Warner and/or Time Warner\u2019s shareholders who received shares of Time Inc., AOL or TWC (as applicable) in connection with the respective spin-off of those companies could incur significant income tax liabilities. In connection with the separation from the Company of (i) Time Inc. in June 2014 and (ii) AOL in December 2009, Time Warner received an opinion of counsel confirming that the applicable separation transaction should not result in the recognition, for U.S. Federal income tax purposes, of gain or loss to Time Warner or its shareholders, except to the extent of cash received in lieu of fractional shares in such transaction. In connection with the separation of TWC from the Company in March 2009, Time Warner received a private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) and opinions of counsel confirming that the TWC separation should not result in the recognition, for U.S. Federal income tax purposes, of gain or loss to Time Warner or its shareholders, except to the extent of cash received in lieu of fractional shares. The IRS ruling and the opinions of counsel in connection with these transactions were based on, among other things, certain facts, assumptions, representations and undertakings that were made by Time Warner and Time Inc., AOL or TWC, as applicable, in connection with the applicable separation transaction. If any of these facts, assumptions, representations or undertakings is incorrect or not otherwise satisfied, Time Warner and its shareholders may not be able to rely on the IRS ruling (in the case of the TWC separation transaction) or opinion and could be subject to significant tax liabilities. Furthermore, opinions of counsel are not binding on the IRS or state or local tax authorities or the courts, and a tax authority or court could determine that one or more of the separation transactions should be treated as a taxable transaction. Time Warner is entitled to indemnification from Time Inc., AOL and TWC for taxes resulting from the failure of the applicable separation transaction to qualify as tax-free as a result of (i) certain actions or failures to act by the former subsidiary or (ii) the failure of certain representations made by the former subsidiary to be true. However, if transaction taxes are incurred for other reasons, Time Warner would not be entitled to indemnification.", "PERMNO": 77418, "SIC": 4888, "TIC": "TWX"}
