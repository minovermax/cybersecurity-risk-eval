You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties and the risk factors set forth in the documents and reports filed with the SEC and the risks described below before you make an investment decision regarding our common stock. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business operations.\nRisks Related to Pharmaceutical Development Segment\nEnteris\u2019 product candidates are in early stages of development and Enteris and any licensees may not be successful in efforts to develop products for many years, if ever.\nEnteris\u2019 success depends on its and any of its licensees\u2019 ability to commercialize their products that will generate revenues sufficient to sustain and grow Enteris\u2019 operations. Most of our product candidates are in early stages of development and have not been out-licensed. The development of these products is expected to take several more years. Similarly, neither Enteris nor any potential licensee may ever develop and commercialize any other peptide or small molecule product that helps us achieve profitability and growth. Even if Enteris and/or a licensee is successful in developing such a product, it is likely that development of any product will take several years. Enteris\u2019 ability to achieve growth is dependent on a number of factors, including Enteris\u2019 and its licensees\u2019 ability to complete development efforts and obtain regulatory approval for additional product candidates.\nEnteris\u2019 partners may not be successful in their efforts to gain regulatory approval for any of their product candidates and, if approved, the approval may not be on a timely basis.\nEven if any of Enteris\u2019 licensees are successful in their development efforts, they may not be able to obtain the necessary regulatory approval for their product candidates. The Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d) must approve the commercial manufacture and sale of pharmaceutical products in the United States. Similar regulatory approvals are required for the sale of pharmaceutical products outside of the United States. None of Enteris\u2019 partners\u2019 products have been approved for sale in the United States, and they may never receive the approvals necessary for commercialization. Additional human testing must be conducted on our partners\u2019 product candidates before they can be approved for commercial sale and such testing requires the investment of significant resources. Any delay in receiving, or failure to receive, these approvals would adversely affect Enteris\u2019 ability to generate product revenues.\nCurrent and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost for Enteris\u2019 partners to obtain marketing approval of and the commercialization of their product candidates. This could affect the timing as well as the amount of royalty income Enteris may earn as a result.\nIn the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been a number of legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval for Enteris\u2019 partners\u2019 product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our partners\u2019 ability to profitably sell their product candidates. Legislative and regulatory proposals have been made to expand post-approval requirements and restrict sales and promotional activities for pharmaceutical products. We do not know whether additional legislative changes will be enacted, or whether FDA regulations, guidance or interpretations will be changed, or what the impact of such changes on the marketing approvals of our partners\u2019 product candidates, if any, may be. In addition, increased scrutiny by the U.S. Congress of the FDA\u2019s approval process may significantly delay or prevent marketing approval, as well as subject our partners to more stringent product labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements.\nEnteris\u2019 technology or products could give rise to product liability claims.\nWhile Enteris does not have a commercial product, Enteris\u2019 business exposes us to the risk of product liability claims from human testing and the manufacturing of pharmaceutical tablets currently used in clinical trials. The administration of drugs to humans, whether in clinical trials or commercially, can result in product liability claims, even if Enteris\u2019 or Enteris\u2019 partners\u2019 products are not actually at fault for causing an injury. Furthermore, Enteris\u2019 products may cause, or may appear to cause, adverse side effects or potentially dangerous drug interactions that we may not learn about or understand fully until the drug is actually manufactured and sold. Product liability claims can be expensive to defend and may result in large judgments against us. Even if a product liability claim is not successful, the adverse publicity, time and expense involved in defending such a claim may interfere with our business. We may not have sufficient resources to defend against or satisfy these claims. While we currently maintain product liability insurance coverage, the amount of coverage may not be sufficient to protect us against losses or may be unavailable in the future on acceptable terms, if at all.\nBecause Enteris is a biopharmaceutical company, its operations are subject to extensive government regulation.\nOur research, development and production activities, as well as those of our collaborators and licensees, are subject to significant regulation by federal, state, local and foreign governmental authorities. The regulatory approval process for a pharmaceutical product requires substantial resources and may take many years. Our partners\u2019 inability to obtain approvals or delays in obtaining approvals would adversely affect our ability to manufacture products, and to receive revenue from milestone payments, product sales or royalties. Enteris\u2019 present and future business is, and will continue to be, subject to various other laws, rules and/or regulations applicable to us as a result of our domestic and international business.\nThe FDA and other regulatory agencies may inspect the Enteris production facility at any time to ensure compliance with current good manufacturing practice guidelines. These guidelines require that Enteris conduct its production operations in strict compliance with established rules for manufacturing and quality controls. Any of these agencies can suspend production operations and product sales if they find significant or repeated deviations from these guidelines. A suspension would likely cause Enteris to incur additional costs or delays in product development and manufacturing.\nEnteris\u2019 success depends upon its ability to protect its intellectual property rights.\nEnteris has filed applications for U.S. patents relating to proprietary peptide manufacturing technology and oral formulations that Enteris has invented in the course of its research. Enteris\u2019 most important U.S. manufacturing and delivery patents expire from 2021 to 2036 and Enteris has applications pending that could extend that protection. To date, twenty-five U.S. patents have issued and other applications are pending. Enteris has also made patent application filings in selected foreign countries and ninety-two foreign patents have issued with other applications pending. Enteris faces the risk that any of its pending applications will not be issued as patents. In addition, Enteris\u2019 patents may be found to be invalid or unenforceable. Enteris\u2019 business also is subject to the risk that its issued patents will not provide Enteris with significant competitive advantages if, for example, a competitor were to independently develop or obtain similar or superior technologies. To the extent Enteris is unable to protect its patents and patent applications, our investment in those technologies may not yield the benefits that we expect.\nIf Enteris encounters issues with its suppliers or if licensees of its technology encounter issues with their contract manufacturers, Enteris may need to qualify alternative manufacturers or suppliers, which could impair Enteris\u2019 and its licensees\u2019 ability to sufficiently and timely manufacture and supply pharmaceutical products.\nEnteris relies on third parties to supply the raw materials needed to manufacture its existing products, and expects to rely on third parties to supply raw materials for potential future products, including suppliers that are located in Asia. Enteris is undertaking efforts to validate alternate suppliers, but may be unsuccessful in these efforts. Current licensees of Enteris\u2019 technology generally rely, and future licensees are expected to rely, on third party suppliers and contract manufacturers to manufacture drug products that utilize Enteris\u2019 technology as well.\nAny business interruptions resulting from geopolitical actions, including war and terrorism, adverse public health developments such as COVID-19, or natural disasters including earthquakes, typhoons, floods and fires, and Enteris\u2019 or its licensees\u2019 inability to identify and validate alternate suppliers and contract manufacturers, could affect supply chains. Any reliance on suppliers may involve several risks, including a potential inability to obtain critical materials and reduced control over production costs, delivery schedules, reliability and quality.\nAny unanticipated disruption caused by problems at suppliers could delay shipment of any of Enteris\u2019 or its licensees\u2019 drug candidates or drug products, which could increase Enteris\u2019 or its licensees\u2019 cost of goods sold or result in lost or decreased sales, royalties or milestone payments to Enteris.\nEnteris\u2019 production facilities have been impacted by COVID-19, and any future impacts might adversely affect its operations and financial condition.\nEnteris experienced a reduction in its productivity as well as delays in receiving some of its needed supplies as a direct result of COVID-19 and the impact it had on key vendors. Enteris could experience similar delays in the future due to the impact of governmental restrictions and other impacts of COVID-19 on its vendors. Any such events may result in business disruption and reduced revenues, any of which could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are continuously monitoring our own operations and intend to take appropriate actions to mitigate the risks arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, but there can be no assurances that we will be successful in doing so. To the extent we are able to obtain information about and maintain communications with our customers, suppliers, vendors and other business partners, we will seek to minimize disruptions to our Pharmaceutical Development segment\u2019s supply chain.\nRisks Related to Finance Receivables Segment\nWe may suffer losses on our principal invested in credit and royalty transactions.\nMost of the assets of our Finance Receivables segment are, and are expected to continue to be, royalty streams or debt backed by royalty streams or revenue interests paid by small- and middle-market businesses, which are highly speculative and involve a high degree of risk of credit loss. In addition, we may own royalties or invest in debt backed by royalties or revenue interests that are derived by products that are early in their commercial launch, face intense competition or are subject to other risks, which similarly involve a high degree of risk of principal loss.\nWe operate in a highly competitive market for investment opportunities.\nA large number of entities compete with us to advance capital to the companies our Finance Receivables segment targets. We compete with non-bank financial institutions, federal or state chartered banks, venture debt funds, venture capital funds, private equity funds, pharmaceutical royalty and other investment funds, business development companies, and investment banks. Additionally, because competition for investment opportunities generally has increased among alternative investment vehicles, particularly those seeking yield investments, such as hedge funds, those entities have begun to invest in areas they have not traditionally invested in, including investments in royalties and debt backed by royalties, which may overlap with our business strategy. As a result of these new entrants, competition for investment opportunities in our target markets has intensified, which is a trend we expect to continue.\nMany of our Finance Receivables segment\u2019s existing and potential competitors are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial, technical and marketing resources than we do. For example, some competitors may have a lower cost of funds and access to funding sources that are not available to us. In addition, some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances or different risk assessments, which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and establish more or fuller relationships with potential business partners than us. Furthermore, many of our competitors are not subject to the maintenance of an exception or exemption from regulation as an investment company, which may allow them more flexibility in advancing capital to companies we may also target such as advancing debt capital that is not repaid by royalty streams or revenue interests. We cannot assure you that the competitive pressures we face will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Also, as a result of existing and increasing competition and our competitors\u2019 ability to provide a total financing package solution, inclusive of both debt and equity capital, we may not be able to take advantage of attractive business opportunities from time to time, and we can offer no assurance that we will be able to identify and make investments that are consistent with our business objectives.\nWe do not seek to compete primarily based on the cost of the capital that we provide, and we believe that some of our competitors provide capital at rates that are comparable to or lower than the rates we offer. We may lose business opportunities if we do not match our competitors\u2019 pricing, terms and structure. If we match our competitors\u2019 pricing, terms and structure, we may experience decreased net interest and royalty income and increased risk of credit loss.\nOur investments in debt backed by royalty streams and revenue interests paid by our prospective partner companies and the products underlying the royalty streams and revenue interests in which we invest may be risky, and we could lose all or part of our investment.\nMost of our finance receivables assets are expected to be royalty streams or debt backed by royalty streams or revenue interests paid by our partner companies. Some of our partner companies to which we advance debt, whether it be backed by royalties, revenue interests or be general obligations of the issuer, have relatively short or no operating histories. These companies are and will be subject to all of the business risk and uncertainties associated with any new business enterprise, including the risk that these companies may not reach their operating objectives and the value of our investment in them may decline substantially or fall to zero.\nIn addition, the small and middle-market companies to which we are targeting to advance debt are subject to a number of other significant risks, including:\n\u2022 these companies may have limited financial resources and may be unable to meet their obligations under their financial instruments that we hold, which may be accompanied by a deterioration in the value of their assets or of any collateral with respect to any financial obligations and a reduction in the likelihood of our realizing on any guarantees we may have obtained in connection with our investment;\n\u2022 they may have shorter operating histories, narrower product lines and smaller market shares than larger businesses, which tend to render them more vulnerable to competitors\u2019 actions and market conditions, as well as general economic downturns;\n\u2022 they are more likely to depend on the management talents and efforts of a small group of persons; therefore, the death, disability, resignation or termination of one or more of these persons could have a material adverse impact on our partner company, and in turn, on us;\n\u2022 they may have less predictable operating results, may from time to time be parties to litigation, may be engaged in changing businesses with products subject to a risk of obsolescence and may require substantial additional capital to support their operations, finance expansion or maintain their competitive position;\n\u2022 changes in laws and regulations, as well as their interpretations, may adversely affect their business, financial structure or prospects; and\n\u2022 they may have difficulty accessing the capital markets to meet future capital needs.\nSimilarly, the products underlying royalty streams or revenue interests in which we invest may have relatively short or no sales history, may be established products that face intense competition from newer, more innovative or better marketed products, or may be subject to additional risks. If these products do not achieve commercial success or attain lower sales than we estimate, we may lose value on our investments.\nIn addition, under circumstances where a partner company does not achieve commercial success or achieves lower sales than we anticipate, and the partner company requires additional capital that other stakeholders are not willing or are otherwise unable to provide, we may determine it is in our best interest to advance additional capital to such partner company in order to preserve the partner company\u2019s collateral value and protect our investment. Any additional capital that we decided to advance would be subject to additional risk. We could lose all of any additional investment.\nWe generally do not control our partner companies.\nWe generally only hold royalties, debt backed by royalties, and revenue interests that are issued by our partner companies. As such, we do not, and do not expect to, control any of our partner companies, even though we may have board representation or board observation rights, and the debt agreements may contain certain restrictive covenants that limit the business and operations of our partner companies. As a result, we are subject to the risk that a partner company may make business decisions with which we disagree, and the management of such company may take risks or otherwise act in ways that do not serve our interests.\nHealth crises, such as COVID-19, may have a material adverse impact on our partner companies.\nCOVID-19 has impacted, and may continue to impact the ability of our borrowers or the marketers of products upon which we derive our royalty income to raise capital in order to fund their operations during the pandemic. Disruptions to our partner companies may impair their ability to fulfill their obligations to us and could result in increased risk of delinquencies, defaults, declining collateral values associated with our existing loans, and impairments or losses on our loans. Any such impairment could increase our credit risk and adversely affect the assets and results of operations of our Finance Receivables segment.\nEconomic recessions or downturns could impair the ability of our partner companies to repay loans, which, in turn, could increase our non-performing assets, decrease the value of our assets, reduce our volume of new loans and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nGeneral economic conditions may affect our activities and the operation and value of our portfolio companies. Economic slowdowns or recessions may result in a decrease of institutional equity investment, which would limit our lending opportunities. Furthermore, many of our portfolio companies are susceptible to economic or industry centric slowdowns or recessions and may be unable to repay our debt investments during these periods. Therefore, our non-performing assets are likely to increase, and the value of our portfolio is likely to decrease during these periods. Adverse economic conditions may also decrease the value of collateral securing some of our debt investments and the value of our equity investments. Economic slowdowns or recessions could lead to financial losses in our portfolio and a material decrease in revenues, net income and assets. Unfavorable economic conditions could also increase our funding costs, limit our access to the capital markets or result in a decision by lenders not to extend credit to us.\nA portfolio company\u2019s failure to satisfy financial or operating covenants imposed by us or other lenders could lead to defaults and, potentially, termination of its loans and foreclosure on its secured assets, which could trigger cross-defaults under other agreements and jeopardize the portfolio company\u2019s ability to meet its obligations under the loans that we hold. We may incur expenses to the extent necessary to recover our investment upon default or to negotiate new terms with a defaulting portfolio company. These events could harm our financial condition and operating results.\nA period of market disruption may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, unfavorable economic conditions, including rising interest rates, may also increase our funding costs, limit our access to capital markets or negatively impact our ability to obtain financing, particularly from the debt markets.\nIf we make investments in unsecured debt backed by royalties or revenue interests, those investments might not generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations.\nWe may make investments in unsecured debt backed by royalties or revenue interests. Unsecured investments may be subordinated to other obligations of the obligor. Unsecured investments often reflect a greater possibility that adverse changes in the financial condition of the obligor or general economic conditions (including, for example, a substantial period of rising interest rates or declining earnings) or both may impair the ability of the obligor to make payment of principal and interest. If we make an unsecured investment in a partner company, that partner company may be highly leveraged, and its relatively high debt-to-equity ratio may increase the risk that its operations might not generate sufficient cash to service its debt obligations. In such cases we would not have any collateral to help secure repayment of the obligations owed to us.\nWe may have limited access to information about privately-held royalty streams and companies in which we invest.\nWe invest primarily in privately-held royalties and debt backed by royalties or revenue interests issued by private companies. Generally, little public information exists about these royalty streams and private companies, and we are required to rely on the ability of our senior management to obtain adequate information to evaluate the potential returns from investing in these assets. If we are unable to uncover all material information about these assets, we may not make a fully informed investment decision, and we may lose money on our investment.\nPrepayments of our debt investments by our partner companies could adversely impact our results of operations and reduce our return on equity.\nWe are subject to the risk that the debt we advance to our partner companies may be repaid prior to maturity. When this occurs, we will generally reinvest these proceeds in temporary investments, pending their future investment in new royalties or debt repaid by royalties or revenue interests issued by partner companies. These temporary investments will typically have substantially lower yields than the debt that was prepaid and we could experience significant delays in reinvesting these amounts. Any future asset may also have lower yields than the debt that was repaid. As a result, our results of operations could be materially adversely affected if one or more of our partner companies elect to prepay amounts owed to us. Additionally, prepayments could negatively impact our return on equity, which could result in a decline in the market price of our common stock.\nWe may not be able to complete transactions without co-investments from third parties.\nWe may co-invest with third parties through our registered investment advisory business or otherwise. In certain circumstances, we may not be able to fund transactions without the participation of such third parties. In the event that we are unable to find suitable third parties to co-invest with us or if such third party fails to close, our results of operations may be materially adversely impacted.\nOur quarterly and annual operating results are subject to fluctuation as a result of the nature of our business, and if we fail to achieve our investment objective, the market price of our common stock may decline.\nWe could experience fluctuations in our quarterly and annual operating results due to a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control, including, but not limited to, the interest rate payable on the debt assets that we acquire, the default rate on such assets, the level of our expenses, variations in and the timing of the recognition of realized and unrealized gains or losses, changes in our portfolio composition, the degree to which we encounter competition in our markets, market volatility in our publicly traded securities and the securities of our partner companies, and general economic conditions. As a result of these factors, results for any period should not be relied upon as being indicative of performance in future periods. In addition, any of these factors could negatively impact our ability to achieve our business objectives, which may cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nOur investments in royalty-related transactions depend on third parties to market royalty-generating products.\nRoyalties generally, and the royalty-related income we expect to receive in the future, will directly or indirectly depend upon the marketing efforts of third parties, particularly large pharmaceutical companies that license the right to manufacture and sell products from technology innovators in exchange for royalty payments from the licensees to the licensors, with whom we may transact. These licensees may be motivated to maximize income by allocating resources to other products, and in the future, may decide to focus less attention on the products that pay royalties in which we have an economic interest. In addition, there can be no assurance that any of the licensees has adequate resources and motivation to continue to produce, market and sell such products in which we have a royalty-related interest. Moreover, the license agreement creating the right to receive royalties may not have specific sales targets, and the licensee typically has exclusive or substantial discretion in determining its marketing plans and efforts. As a result, the licensee may not be restricted from abandoning a licensed product or from developing or selling a competitive product. In addition, in the event that a license expires or is terminated, we would be dependent upon the licensor of the license to find another marketing partner. There can be no assurance that another licensee could be found on favorable terms, or at all, or that the licensor will be able to assume marketing, sales and distribution responsibility for its own account. These factors may materially adversely affect any of our future royalty-related assets.\nAside from any limited audit rights relating to the activities of the licensees that we may have in certain circumstances, we do not have the rights or ability to manage the operations of the licensees. Poor management of operations by the licensees could adversely affect the sales of products in which we have a royalty interest, and the payment of royalty-related income to us. In addition, we have limited information on the licensees\u2019 operations. While we may be able to receive certain information relating to sales of the product in which we have a royalty-related interest through the exercise of the audit rights and review of royalty reports, we may not have the right to review or receive certain information relating to the marketed products, including the results of any studies conducted by the licensees or others or complaints from doctors or users of such products, that the licensees may have and that may impact sales levels. The market performance of such products, therefore, may be diminished by any number of factors relating to the licensees that are beyond our control.\nCurrently, our Finance Receivables segment has a limited number of assets, which subjects our aggregate returns, and the value of our common stock, to a greater risk of significant loss if any of our debt securities declines in value or if any of our royalty investments substantially underperforms our expectations.\nOur Finance Receivables segment\u2019s total investment in companies may be significant, individually or in the aggregate. A consequence of our currently limited number of assets in our Finance Receivables segment is that the aggregate returns we realize may be significantly adversely affected if one or more of our significant partner company investments perform poorly or if we need to write down the value of any one significant investment, which may be more severe than if we had made smaller investments in more companies. Our financial results could be materially adversely affected if these portfolio companies or any of our other significant portfolio companies encounter financial difficulty and fail to repay their obligations or to perform as expected.\nOur allowance for credit losses may prove inadequate.\nThe quality of our finance receivables depends on the credit-worthiness of our partner companies and their ability to fulfill their obligations to us. We maintain an allowance for credit losses on specific finance receivables to provide for credit defaults and non-performance. The amount of our allowance reflects management\u2019s judgment of losses inherent in the portfolio. However, the economic environment is dynamic, and our portfolio credit quality could decline in the future.\nOur allowance for credit losses may not keep pace with changes in the credit-worthiness of our partner companies or in collateral values. If the credit quality of our partner companies declines, if the risk profile of a market, industry, or group of partner companies changes significantly, or if the markets for finance receivables or other collateral deteriorates significantly, our allowance for credit losses may prove inadequate, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe and our subsidiaries are party to various financing arrangements, commercial contracts and other arrangements that under certain circumstances give, or in some cases may give, the counterparty the ability to exercise rights and remedies under such arrangements which, if exercised, may have material adverse consequences.\nWe and our subsidiaries are party to various financing arrangements, commercial contracts and other arrangements, such as securitization transactions, derivatives transactions, funding facilities, and agreements for the purchase or sale of assets, that give, or in some cases may give, the counterparty the ability to exercise rights and remedies upon the occurrence of certain events. Such events may include a material adverse effect or material adverse change (or similar event), a breach of representations or warranties, a failure to disclose material information, a breach of covenants, certain insolvency events, a default under certain specified other obligations, or a failure to comply with certain financial covenants. The counterparty could have the ability, depending on the arrangement, to, among other things, require early repayment of amounts owed by us or our subsidiaries and in some cases payment of penalty amounts, or require the repurchase of assets previously sold to the counterparty. Additionally, a default under financing arrangements or derivatives transactions that exceed a certain size threshold in the aggregate may also cause a cross-default under instruments governing our other financing arrangements or derivatives transactions. If the ability of any counterparty to exercise such rights and remedies is triggered and we are unsuccessful in avoiding or minimizing the adverse consequences discussed above, such consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nThe interest rates of many of our term loans to partner companies are priced using a spread over LIBOR.\nLIBOR, the London interbank offered rate, is the basic rate of interest used in lending between banks on the London interbank market and is widely used as a reference for setting the interest rate on loans globally. We typically use LIBOR as a reference rate in term loans we extend to partner companies such that the interest due to us pursuant to a term loan extended to a partner company is calculated using LIBOR. Most of our term loan agreements with partner companies contain a stated minimum value for LIBOR. As of December 31, 2020, 87 percent of the term loans with our partner companies utilized LIBOR, including a stated minimum of LIBOR, as a reference rate.\nOn July 27, 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (\u201cFCA\u201d), which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021. Further on March 5, 2021, the FCA issued an announcement confirming that all 35 LIBOR benchmark settings currently published by the Intercontinental Exchange Benchmark Administration, the authorized administrator for LIBOR (\u201cICE\u201d), will either cease to be provided or will no longer be representative after certain specified dates, with the one-month, three-month and six-month USD LIBOR settings will no longer be representative immediately after June 30, 2023; the majority of other LIBOR benchmark settings will cease immediately after December 31, 2021. The Company generally utilizes the three-month USD LIBOR rate as the reference rate in credit agreements with partner companies. While the FCA may require ICE to publish \u201csynthetic\u201d LIBOR rates after the specified cessation dates for each respective reference rate, it is unclear if after June 30, 2023 whether or not the three-month USD LIBOR rate will cease to exist or if new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after June 30, 2023. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, is considering replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR with a new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements, backed by Treasury securities, known as the Secured Overnight Funding Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d). SOFR is observed and backward looking, which stands in contrast with LIBOR under the current methodology, which is an estimated forward-looking rate and relies, to some degree, on the expert judgment of submitting panel members. Given that SOFR is a secured rate backed by government securities, it will be a rate that does not take into account bank credit risk (as is the case with LIBOR). SOFR is therefore likely to be lower than LIBOR and is less likely to correlate with the funding costs of financial institutions. In conjunction with the FCA\u2019s March 5, 2021 announcement, the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc., a trade organization of participants in the market for over-the-counter derivatives (\u201cISDA\u201d), announced a fallback protocol whereby LIBOR-priced derivatives contracts utilizing its standard derivatives contracts would replace LIBOR with SOFR plus an applicable margin for the specified LIBOR rate; ISDA\u2019s fallback margin for the three month LIBOR is 0.26161 percent. Whether or not SOFR attains market traction as a LIBOR replacement tool remains in question. As such, the future of LIBOR at this time is uncertain.\nDespite the widely-publicized pending cessation of LIBOR as a global reference rate benchmark, many financial institutions continue to leverage LIBOR in financing contracts, including SWK. If LIBOR ceases to exist, we may need to renegotiate the credit agreements with our partner companies that utilize LIBOR as a factor in determining the interest rate to replace LIBOR with the new standard that is established. Our term loans typically contain provisions to facilitate the transition to such new standard. If affected credit agreements with our partner companies are unable to be renegotiated, our investments may bear interest at a lower rate, subject to any contractual minimum LIBOR floors, which would decrease investment income and potentially the value of such investments. In addition, any further changes or reforms to the determination or supervision of LIBOR may result in a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in reported LIBOR, which could have an adverse impact on the market value for or value of any LIBOR-linked loans and other financial obligations or extensions of credit held by or due to us and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Due to the uncertainty of the replacement for LIBOR, the potential effect of any such event on our cost of capital and investment income cannot yet be determined.\nA rise in LIBOR rates could have an adverse impact on the ability of our partner companies to service their debt obligations to us.\nMany of our debt transactions contain LIBOR-based floating interest rates with minimum LIBOR floors. The minimum LIBOR floor insulates partner companies from an increase in LIBOR until the reference LIBOR rate reaches the minimum floor threshold, typically one to two percent. If LIBOR increases above the floor rate, the net effect will be an increase in the interest cost to the borrower. Most of our borrower partners do not hedge their LIBOR rate exposure, and as a result of an increase of LIBOR above the minimum floor threshold, they will experience an increase in the effective interest rate of their debt obligations to us. If LIBOR increases materially, the increased cost of debt service will similarly increase materially. If our partner companies are not adequately capitalized or are unable to generate sufficient income from operations, the increased debt burden caused by increased LIBOR rates could materially and adversely affect the operations of a partner company, which in turn, would impair our ability to timely collect principal and interest payments owed to us.\nFluctuations in the price of the common stock of our publicly traded holdings and the price at which we sell such holdings may affect the price of our common stock.\nOur Finance Receivables segment generally holds equity interests in companies that are publicly traded. Fluctuations in the market prices of the common stock of publicly traded holdings may affect the price of our common stock. Historically, the market prices of our publicly traded holdings have been highly volatile and subject to fluctuations unrelated or disproportionate to operating performance.\nIn addition, we may be unable to sell our holdings of public equities at then-quoted market prices. The trading volume and public float in the common stock of a publicly traded partner company may be small relative to our holdings. As a result, any significant open-market divestiture by us of our holdings in such a partner company, if possible at all, would likely have a material adverse effect on the market price of its common stock and on our proceeds from such a divestiture. Also, registration and other requirements under applicable securities laws and contractual restrictions also may adversely affect our ability to dispose of our partner company holdings on a timely basis.\nOur financial condition and results of operations will depend on our ability to manage future growth of our Finance Receivables segment effectively.\nOur ability to achieve our business objectives depends on our ability to grow, which depends, in turn, on our Finance Receivables segment\u2019s ability to continue to identify, analyze and invest in royalties and/or debt backed by royalties or revenue interests that meet our investment criteria. Accomplishing this result on a cost-effective basis is largely a function of our structuring of transactions and our access to financing on acceptable terms. As we continue to grow, we will need to continue to hire, train, supervise and manage new employees. Failure to manage our future growth effectively could have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Structure\nOur ability to use NOL carryforwards to offset future taxable income for U.S. federal income tax purposes may be limited, and our future cash tax liability may increase.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had NOL carryforwards for U.S. federal income tax purposes of $289.4 million. The U.S. federal NOL carryforwards, if not offset against future income, will expire by 2037, with approximately half of such NOLs expiring by December 31, 2021. We may recognize additional NOLs in the future. In order to utilize the NOLs, the Company must generate taxable income that can offset such carryforwards.\nThe Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) has not audited our tax returns for any of the years during the carryforward period. We cannot assure you that we would prevail if the IRS were to challenge the availability of the NOLs. If the IRS were successful in challenging our NOLs, all or some portion of the NOLs would not be available to offset any future consolidated income which would negatively impact our results of operations and cash flows.\nUnder Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code (the \u201cCode\u201d), a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d may be subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change NOL carryforward amounts to offset future taxable income. In general, an ownership change occurs if the aggregate stock ownership of certain stockholders (generally 5 percent stockholders, applying certain look-through and aggregation rules) increases by more than 50 percent over such stockholders\u2019 lowest percentage ownership during the testing period (generally three years). New issuances of our common stock, which is within our control, and purchases of our common stock in amounts greater than specified levels, which are beyond our control, could create an additional limitation on our ability to utilize our NOL carryforward amounts for tax purposes in the future. Limitations imposed on our ability to utilize NOL carryforward amounts could cause U.S. federal and state income taxes to be paid earlier than would be paid if such limitations were not in effect and could cause such NOL carryforward amounts to expire unused, in each case reducing or eliminating the expected benefit to us. Additionally, various states have similar limitations on the use of state NOLs following an ownership change.\nAccordingly, the extent to which we undergo an ownership change limiting the availability of our NOLs depends in part on actions taken by our large shareholders. Furthermore, our largest shareholders are investment funds affiliated with Carlson. Most investors in these funds are third parties, unaffiliated with either us or Carlson. Subscription or redemption activity by such investors is generally outside of our or Carlson\u2019s control; however, resulting changes in the ownership of these funds may contribute to, or result in, a determination that an \u201cownership change\u201d has occurred. As a result, even though we have a stockholder rights plan that is intended to protect the NOLs, whether or not an ownership change occurs is not entirely within our control.\nOn March 3, 2021, our Board determined J. Carlo Cannell and Cannell Capital LLC (together, \u201cCannell\u201d) to be an \u201cExempt Person\u201d (and not deemed to be an \u201cAcquiring Person\u201d) under the Rights Agreement. This determination was a result of a determination by the our Board that Cannell\u2019s current beneficial ownership of our common stock, as disclosed on Schedule 13G filed by Cannell with the SEC on February 16, 2021, would not jeopardize or endanger the availability to us or our NOLs. However, no assurance can be given that the IRS would agree with such determination. Our Board\u2019s determination was and is specific to the manner of ownership of our common stock disclosed on the Schedule 13G, and is contingent on Cannell, and any of its Affiliates and Associates (as defined in the Rights Agreement), not changing its manner of ownership or acquiring aggregate beneficial ownership of any shares of our common stock in addition to those disclosed on the Schedule 13G.\nIf an ownership change occurs, the amount of the taxable income for any post-change year that may be offset by a pre-change loss is subject to an annual limitation that is cumulative to the extent it is not all utilized in a year. This limitation is derived by multiplying the fair market value of the Company stock as of the ownership change by the applicable federal long-term tax-exempt rate, which was 1.10 percent for February 2021. To the extent that a company has a net unrealized built-in gain at the time of an ownership change, which is realized or deemed recognized during the five-year period following the ownership change, there is an increase in the annual limitation for each of the first five-years that is cumulative to the extent it is not all utilized in a year.\nIf an ownership change should occur in the future, our ability to use NOLs to offset future taxable income will be subject to an annual limitation and will depend on the amount of taxable income we generate in future periods. There is no assurance that we will be able to fully utilize our NOLs and we could be required to record an additional valuation allowance related to the amount of the NOLs that may not be realized, which could impact our results of operations.\nWe are dependent upon our key management personnel for our future success.\nWe depend on the diligence, skill and network of business contacts of our senior management and their access to the investment professionals and the information and deal flow generated by these investment professionals in the course of their investment and portfolio management activities. Our senior management team evaluates, negotiates, structures, closes, monitors and services our investments. Our success depends to a significant extent on the continued service of this senior management team, in particular, Winston L. Black, Chief Executive Officer. His departure could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our business objectives. In addition, we have very few employees, so the loss of any employee could be disruptive to our business. We are taking precautions to protect the safety and well-being of our employees, including enhancing our standard operating procedures at Enteris to provide for additional cleaning and hygiene measures, as well as, social distancing. However, no assurance can be given that the steps being taken will be adequate or deemed to be appropriate, nor can we predict the level of disruption which will occur to our employees\u2019 ability to service the finance receivables portfolio or Enteris\u2019 customers.\nIf we are unable to obtain additional debt or equity financing on commercially reasonable terms our business could be materially adversely affected.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we had $3.0 million of cash and cash equivalents on the balance sheet plus $8.2 million available to be borrowed under our credit facility. As of March 25, 2021, the Company drew an additional $9.0 million under the Loan Agreement (as defined in Part II, Item 8, Financial Statements, Note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements), and $10.3 million was available for borrowing. Our current credit facility matures on June 30, 2021. We have limited capital to execute our business strategy and have obtained debt financing to fund future growth and obtain funds which may be made available for investments. If we are unable to enter into new debt or equity financing arrangements on commercially reasonable terms, our liquidity may be reduced significantly, and as a result, our ability to implement and grow our business strategy could be materially impacted.\nOur use of leverage may limit our operational flexibility and increase our overall risk, which may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nAlthough the use of leverage may create an opportunity for increased returns for us, it also results in additional risks and can magnify the effect of any losses and thus could negatively impact our business and results of operations and have important adverse consequences to our investments. Our current credit facility contains, and any future credit facility, if raised, would likely contain covenants that could restrict our operating flexibility, including covenants that, among others, could limit our ability to: (i) make distributions in certain circumstances, (ii) incur additional debt, and (iii) engage in certain transactions, which collectively may prevent us from entering into transactions which we may otherwise determine are beneficial to us, and which could negatively impact our business and results of operations. In addition, we expect we would need to secure such a credit facility through the pledging of substantially all of our assets, and if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow to meet principal and interest payments on such indebtedness, we would be subject to risk that the lender seizes our assets through an acceleration of the credit facility that could require liquidation of pledged collateral at inopportune times or at prices that are not favorable to us and cause significant losses. If the lender seizes and liquidates pledged collateral, such collateral will likely be sold at distressed price levels. We will fail to realize the full value of such assets in a distressed sale.\nIf we fail to maintain adequate internal control over financial reporting, it could result in a material misstatement of the Company\u2019s annual or interim financial statements.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\u201cGAAP\u201d). If we identify material weaknesses or other deficiencies in our internal controls, or if material weaknesses or other deficiencies exist that we fail to identify, our risk will be increased that a material misstatement to our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. Any such potential material misstatement, if not prevented or detected, could require us to restate previously released financial statements and could otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nThe liquidity, market price and volume of our stock are volatile.\nOur common stock is now listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market (\u201cNasdaq\u201d). The liquidity of our common stock may be adversely affected, and purchasers of our common stock may have difficulty selling our common stock, if our common stock does not continue to trade on Nasdaq or another national securities exchange. Nasdaq maintains certain minimum continued listing standards. If we are not able to continue to satisfy the continued listing standards, or qualify for an exemption to such standards, then we could be subject non-compliance status or de-listing.\nThe trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarter-to-quarter variations in our operating results, announcements of our drilling results and other events or factors. In addition, the U.S. stock markets have from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market price for many companies and which often have been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies. These broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our securities.\nFunds affiliated with Carlson can control or exert significant influence over our management and policies through their ownership of a large amount of our common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2020, funds affiliated with Carlson owned in the aggregate 71.1 percent of our combined issued and outstanding common stock and unvested restricted stock. Due to the large percentage of ownership by funds affiliated with Carlson, including Double Black Diamond Offshore Ltd. (\u201cDouble Black\u201d), they have the ability to control or exert significant influence over our management and policies, such as the election of our directors, the appointment of new management and the approval of any other action requiring the approval of our stockholders, including any amendments to our certificate of incorporation, a sale of all or substantially all of our assets or a merger or other significant transaction. The investment objectives of Carlson and its affiliates may from time to time be different than or conflict with those of our other stockholders.\nIn addition, pursuant to the terms of a Stockholders\u2019 Agreement entered into on August 18, 2014, funds affiliated with Carlson have the right to approve specific transactions, including the incurrence of indebtedness over specified amounts, the sale of assets over specified amounts, declaration of dividends, loans, capital contributions to or investments in any third party over specified amounts, changes in the size of the board of directors, changes in our chief executive officer and repurchases of common stock.\nIf there are substantial sales of shares of our common stock, the price of our common stock could decline.\nThe price of our common stock could decline if there are substantial sales of our common stock, particularly sales by our directors, executive officers, employees, and significant stockholders including funds associated with Carlson. Carlson owns an aggregate of 71.1 percent (9,093,766, common shares). Pursuant to a Stockholders\u2019 Agreement entered into on August 18, 2014 and a Registration Rights Agreement entered into on September 6, 2013, we filed a Registration Statement on Form S-3 with the SEC on February 3, 2020, which became effective on February 19, 2020, to register all of the common stock owned by funds affiliated with Carlson for sale freely in the public market from time to time.\nThe market price of our common stock could decline as a result of the sale of a substantial number of our shares of common stock in the public market or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell their shares.\nWe have adopted provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, and a stockholder rights plan that could delay or prevent an acquisition of the Company.\nThe board of directors has the authority to issue up to 5 million shares of preferred stock. Without any further vote or action on the part of the stockholders, the board of directors has the authority to determine the price, rights, preferences, privileges, and restrictions of the preferred stock. This preferred stock, if issued, might have preference over and harm the rights of the holders of common stock. Although the ability to issue this preferred stock provides us with flexibility in connection with possible acquisitions and other corporate purposes, it can also be used to make it more difficult for a third party to acquire a majority of our outstanding voting stock. We currently have no plans to issue preferred stock.\nAdditionally, we have a stockholder rights plan, as amended, that is intended to protect our ability to utilize our NOL carryforwards and which would also make it difficult for a third party to acquire a significant number of shares of our common stock.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws include provisions that may deter an unsolicited offer to purchase us. These provisions, coupled with the provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law, may delay or impede a merger, tender offer or proxy contest. In addition, directors are only removable by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of all classes of voting stock. These factors may further delay or prevent a change of control of the Company.\nIf we were deemed an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, applicable restrictions could make it impractical for us to continue our business as contemplated and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe have not been and do not intend to become registered as an \u201cinvestment company\u201d under the Investment Company Act of 1940, or the 1940 Act, because we believe the nature of our assets and the sources of our income exclude us from the definition of an investment company pursuant to Section (3)(a)(1)(C) under the 1940 Act. Accordingly, we are not subject to the provisions of the 1940 Act, such as conflict of interest rules, requirements for disinterested directors and other substantive provisions which were enacted to protect investors in \u201cinvestment companies.\u201d\nGenerally, a company is an \u201cinvestment company\u201d if it is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities or owns or proposes to own investment securities having a value exceeding 40 percent of the value of its total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis, unless an exception, exemption or safe harbor applies. We refer to this investment company definition test as the \u201c40 percent test.\u201d\nWe monitor our compliance with the 40 percent test and seek to conduct our business activities to comply with this test. It is not feasible for us to be regulated as an investment company because the restrictions imposed by the 1940 Act rules are inconsistent with our strategy. In order to continue to comply with the 40 percent test, we may need to take various actions which we might otherwise not pursue. The actions we may need to take to address these issues while maintaining compliance with the 40 percent test (or another exception or exemption from regulation as an investment company), include restructuring or terminating the Company, could adversely affect our ability to create and realize stockholder value.\nBecause we operate through our subsidiaries, our ability to comply with the 40 percent test is dependent on the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to rely on an exclusion or exemption from investment company registration. In this regard, one of our subsidiaries currently relies on the exclusion from investment company registration provided by Section 3(c)(5)(A) under the 1940 Act. Section 3(c)(5)(A), as interpreted by the staff of the SEC, requires us to invest at least 55 percent of our assets in \u201cnotes, drafts, acceptances, open accounts receivable, and other obligations representing part or all of the sales price of merchandise, insurance, and services\u201d (or \u201cQualifying Assets\u201d).\nIn complying with Section 3(c)(5)(A), one of our subsidiaries, SWK Funding LLC (\u201cSWK Funding\u201d), relies on an interpretation that royalty interests that entitle SWK Funding to collect royalty receivables that are directly based on the sales price of specific biopharmaceutical products that use intellectual property covered by specific license agreements are Qualifying Assets under Section 3(c)(5)(A). This interpretation was promulgated by the SEC staff in a no-action letter issued to Royalty Pharma on August 13, 2010. The assets acquired by SWK Funding therefore, are limited by the provisions of the 1940 Act and SEC staff interpretations thereunder. If the SEC or its staff in the future adopts a contrary interpretation or otherwise restricts the conclusions in the staff\u2019s no-action letter such that royalty interests are no longer treated as Qualifying Assets for purposes of Section 3(c)(5)(A), SWK Funding could be required to restructure its activities or sell certain of its assets, potentially negatively affecting our performance. As a result, our business will be material and adversely affected if SWK Funding fails to qualify for Section 3(c)(5)(A).\nThe rules and interpretations of the SEC and the courts, relating to the definition of \u201cinvestment company\u201d are highly complex in numerous respects. While we intend to conduct our operations so that we will not be deemed an investment company, we can give no assurances that we will not be deemed an \u201cinvestment company\u201d and be required to register under the 1940 Act. If we were to be deemed an \u201cinvestment company,\u201d restrictions imposed by the 1940 Act, including limitations on our capital structure and our ability to transact with affiliates, could make it impractical for us to continue our business as contemplated and would have a material adverse effect on our business and the price of our shares. In addition, we could be subject to legal actions by regulatory authorities and others and could be forced to dissolve. The costs of defending any such actions could constitute a material part of our assets and dissolution could have materially adverse effects on our company and the value of our common stock.\nRisks Associated with Investments in the Health Care and Life Sciences Industries\nPublic health epidemics, pandemics or outbreaks, including COVID-19, could adversely affect our business.\nPublic health epidemics, pandemics or outbreaks, and the resulting business or economic disruptions resulting therefrom, could adversely impact our business as well as our ability to raise capital. The impact of COVID-19 has been and will likely continue to be extensive in many aspects of society, which has resulted in and will likely continue to result in significant disruptions to the global economy, as well as businesses and capital markets around the world.\nThe extent to which COVID-19 impacts our business will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the duration of the pandemic, new information that may emerge concerning the severity of COVID-19 and public and private actions to contain COVID-19 or treat its impact. COVID-19 has and will likely continue to result in social, economic and labor instability in the countries in which we or our partner companies operate.\nAny abrupt and substantial change in economic conditions also may decrease the value of collateral securing some of our loans and the value of our equity investments. Any sustained disruption in the capital markets from the COVID-19 pandemic could negatively impact our and our partner companies\u2019 ability to raise capital.\nSeveral measures are currently being proposed by the US and other governments to address the current COVID-19 pandemic and its economic impacts. At this time, it is impossible to predict the success of these measures and whether or not they will have unforeseen negative consequences for our business. For example, some proposals in the US Congress contemplate a debt-servicing holiday for borrowers for an unspecified period of time. If this type of measure becomes law, our partner companies may defer making payments under our term loans, which would decrease our cash flows, revenues, net income, assets and liquidity.\nHealthcare and life science industries are subject to extensive government regulation, litigation risk, reimbursement risk and certain other risks particular to those industries.\nWe have invested and plan to continue investing in cash flow streams produced by life science products that are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA, similar foreign regulatory authorities, and to a lesser extent, other federal and state agencies. If any of these products and the companies which manage such products fails to comply with applicable regulations, they could be subject to significant penalties and claims that could materially and adversely affect their sales levels and operations. Medical devices and drugs are subject to the expense, delay and uncertainty of the regulatory approval process in order to reach the market and, even if approved, these products may not be accepted in the marketplace. In addition, governmental budgetary constraints effecting the regulatory approval process, new laws, regulations or judicial interpretations of existing laws and regulations might adversely affect a partner company or product in this industry.\nThe products and services provided by pharmaceutical, medical device and diagnostics companies are generally subject to the ability to obtain and maintain adequate reimbursement from governmental and other third-party payors for such products and services. The commercial success of such products and services could be compromised if governmental or third-party payors do not provide coverage and reimbursement, breach, rescind or modify their contracts or reimbursement policies or delay payments for such products and services.\nCompanies in the life science industry may also have a limited number of suppliers of necessary components or a limited number of manufacturers for their products, and therefore face a risk of disruption to their manufacturing process if they are unable to find alternative suppliers when needed.\nAny of these factors could materially and adversely affect the operations of a partner company in this industry or the licensee\u2019s operations, which in turn, would impair our ability to timely collect principal and interest payments owed to us or decrease our royalty-related income.\nSome of our partner companies may be unable to protect their proprietary rights and may infringe on the proprietary rights of others.\nOur partner companies assert various forms of intellectual property protection. Intellectual property may constitute an important part of partner company assets and competitive strengths, particularly for royalty monetization transactions. Federal law, most typically copyright, patent, trademark and trade secret laws, generally protects intellectual property rights. Although we expect that our partner companies will take reasonable efforts to protect the rights to their intellectual property, third parties may develop similar intellectual property independently or attempt to abandon intellectual property licenses if it is determined such intellectual property from a partner company is no longer needed. Moreover, the complexity of international trade secret, copyright, trademark and patent law, coupled with the limited resources of our partner companies and the demands of quick delivery of products and services to market, create a risk that partner company efforts to prevent misappropriation of their technology will prove inadequate.\nSome of our partner companies also license intellectual property from third parties and it is possible that they could become subject to infringement actions based upon their use of the intellectual property licensed from those third parties. Our partner companies generally obtain representations as to the origin and ownership of such licensed intellectual property. However, this may not adequately protect them. Any claims against our partner companies\u2019 proprietary rights, with or without merit, could subject the companies to costly litigation and divert their technical and management personnel from other business concerns. If our partner companies incur costly litigation and their personnel are not effectively deployed, the expenses and losses incurred by our partner companies will increase and their profits, if any, will decrease.\nThird parties have and may assert infringement or other intellectual property claims against our partner companies based on their patents or other intellectual property rights. Even though we believe our partner companies\u2019 products do not infringe any third party\u2019s patents, they may have to pay substantial damages, possibly including treble damages, if it is ultimately determined that they do. They may have to obtain a license to sell their products if it is determined that their products infringe on another person\u2019s intellectual property. Our partner companies might be prohibited from selling their products before they obtain a license, which, if available at all, may require them to pay substantial royalties. Even if infringement claims against our partner companies are without merit, defending these types of lawsuits takes significant time, is expensive and may divert management attention from other business concerns.\nFuture legislation, and/or regulations and policies adopted by the FDA or other U.S. or foreign regulatory authorities may increase the time and cost required by some of our partner companies to conduct and complete clinical trials for the product candidates that they develop, and there is no assurance that these companies will obtain regulatory approval to market and commercialize their products in the U.S. and in foreign countries.\nThe FDA and other foreign and U.S. regulatory authorities have established regulations, guidelines and policies to govern the drug development and approval process which affect some of our partner companies. Any change in regulatory requirements due to the adoption by the FDA and/or foreign or other U.S. regulatory authorities of new legislation, regulations, or policies may require some of our partner companies to amend existing clinical trial protocols or add new clinical trials to comply with these changes. Such amendments to existing protocols and/or clinical trial applications or the need for new ones, may significantly impact the cost, timing and completion of the clinical trials.\nIn addition, increased scrutiny by the U.S. Congress of the FDA\u2019s and other authorities approval processes may significantly delay or prevent regulatory approval, as well as impose more stringent product labeling and post-marketing testing and other requirements. Foreign regulatory authorities may also increase their scrutiny of approval processes resulting in similar delays. Increased scrutiny and approval processes may limit the ability of our partner companies to market and commercialize their products in the U.S. and in foreign countries.\nThe pharmaceutical industry is subject to numerous risks, including competition, extensive government regulation, product liability, patent exclusivity and commercial difficulties.\nOur assets include royalties and royalty-linked debt that are paid on sales of pharmaceutical products, which are subject to numerous risks. The successful and timely implementation of the business model of our specialty pharmaceutical and drug discovery partner companies depends on their ability to adapt to changing technologies and introduce new products. As competitors continue to introduce competitive products, the ability of our partner companies to continue effectively marketing their existing product portfolio, and to develop and acquire innovative products and technologies that improve efficacy, safety, patients\u2019 and clinicians\u2019 ease of use and cost-effectiveness is important to the success of such partner companies. The success of new product offerings will depend on many factors, including the ability to properly anticipate and satisfy customer needs, obtain regulatory approvals on a timely basis, develop and manufacture products in an economic and timely manner, obtain or maintain advantageous positions with respect to intellectual property, and differentiate products from competitors. Failure by our partner companies to successfully commercialize existing or planned products, or acquire other new products, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, the ability of generic manufactures to invalidate a partner company\u2019s patents protecting its products or to invalidate the patents supporting products in which we receive royalty-related income could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe development of products by life science companies requires significant research and development, clinical trials and regulatory approvals.\nThe development of products by life science companies requires significant research and development, clinical trials and regulatory approvals. In addition, similar activities and costs may be required to support products that have already been commercialized. The results of product development efforts may be affected by a number of factors, including the ability to innovate, develop and manufacture new products, complete clinical trials, obtain regulatory approvals and reimbursement in the U.S. and abroad, or gain and maintain market approval of products. In addition, regulatory review processes by U.S. and foreign agencies may extend longer than anticipated as a result of decreased funding and tighter fiscal budgets. Further, patents attained by others can preclude or delay the commercialization of a product. There can be no assurance that any products now in development will achieve technological feasibility, obtain regulatory approval, or gain market acceptance. Failure can occur at any point in the development process, including after significant funds have been invested. Products may fail to reach the market or may have only limited commercial success because of efficacy or safety concerns, failure to achieve positive clinical outcomes, inability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals, failure to achieve market adoption, limited scope of approved uses, excessive costs to manufacture, the failure to establish or maintain intellectual property rights, or the infringement of intellectual property rights of others. Failure by our partner companies to successfully commercialize pipeline products in which we have an economic interest could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in healthcare laws and other regulations applicable to some of our partner companies\u2019 businesses may constrain their ability to offer their products and services.\nChanges in healthcare or other laws and regulations applicable to the businesses of some of our partner companies may occur that could increase their compliance and other costs of doing business, require significant systems enhancements, or render their products or services less profitable or obsolete, any of which could have a material adverse effect on their results of operations. There has also been an increased political and regulatory focus on healthcare laws in recent years, and new legislation could have a material effect on the business and operations of some of our partner companies.\nWe also anticipate that Congress, state legislatures, and third-party payors may continue to review and assess alternative healthcare delivery and payment systems and may in the future propose and adopt legislation or policy changes or implementations effecting additional fundamental changes in the healthcare delivery system. We cannot assure you as to the ultimate content, timing, or effect of changes, nor is it possible at this time to estimate the impact of any such potential legislation on certain of our portfolio companies, our business model, prospects, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe potential inability of our partner companies\u2019 and counterparties marketing pharmaceutical products from which we receive royalty payments to charge desired prices with respect to prescription drugs could impact their revenues and in turn their ability to repay us or the magnitude of their payments to us.\nOur pharmaceutical portfolio companies and pharmaceutical royalties are subject to risks associated with the pricing for prescription drugs. It is uncertain whether pharmaceutical products customers generally will continue to utilize established prescription drug pricing methods, or whether other pricing benchmarks will be adopted for establishing prices within the industry. Legislation may lead to changes in the pricing for Medicare and Medicaid programs. Regulators have conducted investigations into the use of prescription drug pricing methods for federal program payment, and whether such methods have inflated drug expenditures by the Medicare and Medicaid programs. Federal and state proposals have sought to change the basis for calculating payment of certain drugs by the Medicare and Medicaid programs. We cannot predict the ultimate content, timing or effect of any such legislation or executive action or the impact of potential legislation or executive action on us. Any changes to the method for calculating prescription drug costs may reduce the revenues of our pharmaceutical portfolio companies, which could in turn impair their ability to timely make any principal and interest payments owed to us. Additionally, any such changes to pharmaceutical product reimbursement similarly could reduce the revenues of the pharmaceutical products from which we receive royalties.", "PERMNO": 87241, "SIC": 6159, "TIC": "SWKH"}
