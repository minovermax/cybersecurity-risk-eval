{"cik": "949039", "company": "DIAMOND OFFSHORE DRILLING, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-10", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nOur business is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows (including negative cash flows), prospects and the trading price of our securities. You should carefully consider these risks when evaluating us and our securities. The following material risks and uncertainties are not the only ones facing our company. We are also subject to other risks and uncertainties not known to us or not described below as well as a variety of risks that affect many other companies generally that may also have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows (including negative cash flows), prospects and the trading price of our securities.\nRisk Factors Summary\nThe following is a summary of the principal risks that could adversely affect our business, operations and financial results.\nRisks Related to Our Chapter 11 Cases\n\u2022\nIf we are not able to obtain confirmation of the Plan or another Chapter 11 plan of reorganization, or if current liquidity is insufficient or exit financing is not available, we could be required to liquidate under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.\n\u2022\nThe Plan is, and any other plan of reorganization would be, based in large part upon assumptions and analyses developed by us; if these assumptions and analyses prove to be incorrect, our Plan or such other plan may be unsuccessful in its execution.\n\u2022\nThe Chapter 11 Cases may have a material adverse impact on us and on the trading price of, and may result in the cancellation and discharge of, our securities, including our common stock. If approved by the Bankruptcy Court, a plan of reorganization will govern distributions to and the recoveries of holders of our securities.\n\u2022\nWe are subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with our Chapter 11 proceedings.\n\u2022\nAs a result of the Chapter 11 Cases, the realization of our assets and liquidation of our liabilities are subject to uncertainty, and our historical financial information will not be indicative of our future financial performance.\n\u2022\nWe may be subject to claims that will not be discharged in the Chapter 11 Cases, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\n\u2022\nOperating under Chapter 11 may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies.\n\u2022\nThe pursuit of the Chapter 11 Cases has consumed, and will continue to consume, a substantial portion of the time and attention of our corporate management and will impact how our business is conducted, which may have a material adverse effect on us, and we may face increased levels of employee attrition.\n\u2022\nEven if a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization is consummated, we may not be able to achieve our stated goals and continue as a going concern.\n\u2022\nTrading in our securities during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases is highly speculative and poses substantial risks. The NYSE has delisted our common stock. It is likely that our common stock will be\ncancelled and that holders of such common stock will not receive any distribution with respect to, or be able to recover any portion of, their investments.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Operations\n\u2022\nThe impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and efforts to mitigate the spread of the virus have had a material adverse effect on and are expected to continue to have a material adverse effect on us.\n\u2022\nThe current protracted downturn in our industry may continue into the foreseeable future, and we cannot predict if or when it will end.\n\u2022\nThe worldwide demand for drilling services has historically been dependent on the price of oil and, as a result of low oil prices, demand continued to be depressed in 2020 as the protracted downturn in our industry continues.\n\u2022\nOur business depends on the level of activity in the offshore oil and gas industry, which has been cyclical, is currently in a protracted downturn and is significantly affected by many factors outside of our control.\n\u2022\nOur industry is highly competitive, with an oversupply of drilling rigs and intense price competition.\n\u2022\nWe can provide no assurance that our drilling contracts will not be terminated early or that our current backlog of contract drilling revenue ultimately will be realized.\n\u2022\nWe may not be able to renew or replace expiring contracts for our rigs.\n\u2022\nOur customer base is concentrated.\n\u2022\nOur contract drilling expense includes fixed costs that will not decline in proportion to decreases in rig utilization and dayrates.\n\u2022\nWe must make substantial capital and operating expenditures to reactivate, build, maintain and upgrade our drilling fleet.\n\u2022\nOur business involves numerous operating hazards that could expose us to significant losses and significant damage claims. We are not fully insured against all of these risks and our contractual indemnity provisions may not fully protect us.\n\u2022\nAny significant cyber-attack or other interruption in network security or the operation of critical information technology systems could materially disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business.\n\u2022\nActs of terrorism, piracy and political and social unrest could affect the markets for drilling services, which may have a material adverse effect on us.\n\u2022\nWe rely on third parties to secure and service equipment, components and parts used in rig operations, conversions, upgrades and construction.\n\u2022\nContracts for our drilling rigs are generally fixed dayrate contracts, and increases in our operating costs could adversely affect our profitability.\n\u2022\nFailure to obtain and retain highly skilled personnel could hurt our operations.\nFinancial and Tax Risks\n\u2022\nWe may incur additional asset impairments and/or rig retirements as a result of reduced demand for certain offshore drilling rigs.\n\u2022\nChanges in tax laws and policies, effective income tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our tax returns could adversely affect our financial results.\n\u2022\nOur consolidated effective income tax rate may vary substantially from one reporting period to another.\n\u2022\nChanges in accounting principles and financial reporting requirements could adversely affect us.\nRegulatory and Legal Risks\n\u2022\nWe are subject to extensive domestic and international laws and regulations that could significantly limit our business activities and revenues and increase our costs.\n\u2022\nAny future regulations relating to greenhouse gases and climate change could have a negative impact on our business.\n\u2022\nIf we, or our customers, are unable to acquire or renew permits and approvals required for drilling operations, we may be forced to delay, suspend or cease our operations.\n\u2022\nSignificant portions of our operations are conducted outside the U.S. and involve additional risks not associated with U.S. domestic operations.\n\u2022\nWe may be subject to litigation and disputes that could have a material adverse effect on us.\nFor a more complete discussion of the material risks facing our business, see below.\nRisks Related to Our Chapter 11 Cases\nIf we are not able to obtain confirmation of the Plan or another Chapter 11 plan of reorganization, or if current liquidity is insufficient or exit financing is not available, we could be required to liquidate under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.\nIn order to successfully emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, we must obtain confirmation of a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization by the Bankruptcy Court. If confirmation by the Bankruptcy Court does not occur, we could be forced to liquidate under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.\nThere can be no assurance that our current cash position and amounts of cash from future operations will be sufficient to fund operations. In the event that we do not have sufficient cash to meet our liquidity requirements or exit financing is not available, we may be required to seek additional financing. There can be no assurance that such additional financing would be available, or, if available, would be available on acceptable terms. Failure to secure any necessary exit financing or additional financing would have a material adverse effect on our operations and ability to continue as a going concern.\nUpon a showing of cause, the Bankruptcy Court may convert our Chapter 11 Cases to a case under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. In such event, a Chapter 7 trustee would be appointed or elected to liquidate our assets for distribution in accordance with the priorities established by the Bankruptcy Code. We believe that liquidation under Chapter 7 would result in significantly smaller distributions being made to our creditors than those provided for in the Plan or another Chapter 11 plan of reorganization because of (i) the likelihood that the assets would have to be sold or otherwise disposed of in a distressed fashion over a short period of time rather than in a controlled manner and as a going concern, (ii) additional administrative expenses involved in the appointment of a Chapter 7 trustee, and (iii) additional expenses and claims, some of which would be entitled to priority, that would be generated during the liquidation and from the rejection of leases and other executory contracts in connection with a cessation of operations.\nThe Plan is, and any other plan of reorganization would be, based in large part upon assumptions and analyses developed by us; if these assumptions and analyses prove to be incorrect, our Plan or such other plan may be unsuccessful in its execution.\nThe Plan that we are seeking to implement will affect both our capital structure and the ownership, structure and operation of our businesses and reflects assumptions and analyses based on our experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions and expected future developments, as well as other factors that we consider appropriate under the circumstances. Whether actual future results and developments will be consistent with our expectations and assumptions depends on a number of factors, including but not limited to:\n\u2022\nour ability to substantially change our capital structure;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain adequate liquidity and access financing sources;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain customers\u2019 confidence in our viability as a continuing entity and to attract and retain sufficient business from them;\n\u2022\nour ability to retain key employees; and\n\u2022\nthe overall strength and stability of general economic and financial conditions and the oil and gas industries, both in the U.S. and in global markets.\nThe failure of any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on the successful reorganization of our business.\nIn addition, the Plan relies upon, and any other plan would rely upon, financial projections, including with respect to revenues, earnings, capital expenditures, debt service and cash flow. Financial forecasts are necessarily\nspeculative, and it is likely that one or more of the assumptions and estimates that are the basis of these financial forecasts will not be entirely accurate. The forecasts may be even more speculative than normal, because they involve fundamental changes in our capital structure. Accordingly, we expect that our actual financial condition and results of operations will differ, perhaps materially, from what we have anticipated. Consequently, there can be no assurance that the results or developments contemplated by the Plan or any other plan of reorganization we may implement will occur or, even if they do occur, that they will have the anticipated effects on us and our subsidiaries or our business or operations. The failure of any such results or developments to materialize as anticipated could have a material adverse effect on the successful execution of the Plan or any other plan of reorganization.\nThe Chapter 11 Cases may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. In addition, the Chapter 11 Cases may have a material adverse impact on the trading price and may result in the cancellation and discharge of our securities, including our common stock. If approved by the Bankruptcy Court, a plan of reorganization will govern distributions to and the recoveries of holders of our securities.\nWe commenced our Chapter 11 Cases in the Bankruptcy Court on April 26, 2020 and filed our Plan of reorganization with the Bankruptcy Court on January 22, 2021. The Plan has not yet been confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court.\nThe Chapter 11 Cases could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. So long as the Chapter 11 Cases continue, our management may be required to spend a significant amount of time and effort dealing with the restructuring while at the same time attending to our business operations. Bankruptcy Court protection and operating as debtors in possession also may make it more difficult to retain management and the key personnel necessary to the success and growth of our business. In addition, during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases, our customers and suppliers might lose confidence in our ability to reorganize our business successfully and may seek to establish alternative commercial relationships, which may cause, among other things, our suppliers, vendors, counterparties and service providers to renegotiate the terms of our agreements, attempt to terminate their relationship with us or require financial assurances from us. Customers may lose confidence in our ability to provide them the level of service they expect, resulting in a significant decline in our revenues and cash flow.\nWe are subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with our Chapter 11 proceedings.\nAs more fully described elsewhere in this report, the Debtors filed voluntary petitions to reorganize under Chapter 11 on April 26, 2020. During our Chapter 11 Cases, we continue to operate our business as debtors-in-possession under the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court and in accordance with the applicable provisions of Chapter 11. As a consequence of our Chapter 11 filing, our operations, including our ability to develop and execute our business plan, and our continuation as a going concern, will be subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with bankruptcy. These risks include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022\nour ability to successfully develop, prosecute, confirm and consummate a plan of reorganization with respect to the Chapter 11 proceedings;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain the Bankruptcy Court\u2019s approval with respect to motions or other requests made to the Bankruptcy Court in the Chapter 11 Cases, including maintaining strategic control as debtors-in-possession;\n\u2022\nthe high costs of bankruptcy proceedings and related fees\u037e\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain acceptable and sufficient financing to allow us to emerge from bankruptcy and execute our business plan post-emergence, and our ability to comply with the terms and conditions of that financing\u037e\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain contracts that are critical to our operations on reasonably acceptable terms and conditions;\n\u2022\nour ability to execute our business plan in the current depressed commodity price environment;\n\u2022\nthe ability of third parties to seek and obtain court approval to terminate contracts and other agreements with us\u037e and\n\u2022\nthe possibility that the Chapter 11 proceedings will disrupt or impede our international operations.\nDelays in the Chapter 11 proceedings increase the risks of our inability to reorganize our business and emerge from bankruptcy and may increase our costs associated with the bankruptcy process.\nThese risks and uncertainties could affect our business and operations in various ways. For example, negative publicity associated with the Chapter 11 proceedings could adversely affect our relationships with our vendors, suppliers, service providers, customers, employees and other third parties, which in turn could adversely affect our operations and financial condition. In particular, critical suppliers, vendors and customers may determine not to do business with us due to the Chapter 11 proceedings. In addition, certain transactions may also require the consent of lenders under any subsequent debtor-in-possession financing. Also, during the pendency of any Chapter 11 proceedings, we will need the prior approval of the Bankruptcy Court for certain transactions outside the ordinary course of business, which may limit our ability to respond timely to certain events or take advantage of certain opportunities. Additionally, losses of key personnel or erosion of employee morale could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet customer expectations, thereby adversely affecting our business and results of operations. Because of the risks and uncertainties associated with a voluntary filing for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code and the related proceedings, we cannot accurately predict or quantify the ultimate impact that events that occur during our Chapter 11 Cases may have on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and there is no certainty as to our ability to continue as a going concern.\nAs a result of the Chapter 11 Cases, the realization of our assets and liquidation of our liabilities are subject to uncertainty, and our historical financial information will not be indicative of our future financial performance.\nIf a plan of reorganization, including the Plan, is ultimately confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court, our capital structure will likely be significantly altered under such plan (whether or not following a sale of our business or certain of our material assets pursuant to Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code). Under fresh-start accounting rules that may apply to us upon the effective date of a plan of reorganization, our assets and liabilities would be adjusted to fair values and our accumulated earnings would be restated to zero. Accordingly, if fresh-start accounting rules apply, our financial condition and results of operations following our emergence from Chapter 11 would not be comparable to the financial condition and results of operations reflected in our historical financial statements. Further, a plan of reorganization, including the Plan, could materially change the amounts and classifications reported in our consolidated historical financial statements, which do not give effect to any adjustments to the carrying value of assets or amounts of liabilities that might be necessary as a consequence of confirmation of a plan of reorganization.\nWhile operating under the protection of the Bankruptcy Code, and subject to Bankruptcy Court approval or otherwise as permitted in the normal course of business, we may seek a sale of our business or certain of our material assets pursuant to Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code in conjunction with, or instead of, a plan of reorganization, including the Plan. Any sales or disposals of assets and liquidations or settlements of liabilities may be for amounts other than those reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements. In connection with the Chapter 11 Cases, it is also possible that additional restructuring and related charges may be identified and recorded in future periods. Such sales, disposals, liquidations, settlements or charges could be material to our consolidated financial position and results of operations in any given period.\nWe may be subject to claims that will not be discharged in the Chapter 11 Cases, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Bankruptcy Code provides that the confirmation of a plan of reorganization discharges a debtor from, among other things, substantially all debts arising prior to consummation of a plan of reorganization. With few exceptions, all claims against the Debtors that arose prior to the commencement of the bankruptcy proceedings or before consummation of the plan of reorganization (i) would be subject to compromise and/or treatment under the plan of reorganization and/or (ii) would be discharged in accordance with the Bankruptcy Code and the terms of the plan of reorganization. Subject to the terms of the plan of reorganization and orders of the Bankruptcy Court, any claims not ultimately discharged pursuant to the plan of reorganization could be asserted against the reorganized\nentities and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations on a post-reorganization basis.\nOperating under Chapter 11 may restrict our ability to pursue our business strategies.\nUnder Chapter 11, transactions outside the ordinary course of business will be subject to the prior approval of the Bankruptcy Court, which may limit our ability to respond in a timely manner to certain events or take advantage of certain opportunities. We must obtain Bankruptcy Court approval to, among other things:\n\u2022\nsell assets outside the ordinary course of business;\n\u2022\nconsolidate, merge, sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of our assets;\n\u2022\ngrant liens; and\n\u2022\nfinance our operations, investments or other capital needs or to engage in other business activities that would be in our interest.\nThe pursuit of the Chapter 11 Cases has consumed, and will continue to consume, a substantial portion of the time and attention of our corporate management and will impact how our business is conducted, which may have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations, and we may face increased levels of employee attrition.\nThe requirements of the Chapter 11 Cases have consumed and will continue to consume a substantial portion of our corporate management\u2019s time and attention and leave them with less time to devote to the operations of our business. This diversion of corporate management\u2019s attention may have a material adverse effect on the conduct of our business, and, as a result, on our financial condition and results of operations, particularly if the Chapter 11 Cases are protracted.\nDuring the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases, our employees will face considerable distraction and uncertainty, and we may experience increased levels of employee attrition. A loss of key personnel or material erosion of employee morale could have a material adverse effect on our ability to effectively, efficiently and safely conduct our business, and could impair our ability to execute our strategy and implement operational initiatives, thereby having a material adverse effect on our business and on our financial condition and results of operations. The loss of the services of any members of our senior management could impair our ability to execute our strategy and, as a result, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nEven if a Chapter 11 plan of reorganization is consummated, we may not be able to achieve our stated goals and continue as a going concern.\nEven if the Plan, or any other Chapter 11 plan of reorganization, is consummated, we may continue to face a number of risks, such as further deterioration in oil prices or other changes in economic conditions, changes in our industry, changes in demand for our services and increasing expenses. Accordingly, we cannot guarantee that the Plan, or any other Chapter 11 plan of reorganization, will achieve our stated goals.\nFurthermore, even if our debts are reduced through the Plan, or any other Chapter 11 plan of reorganization, we may need to raise additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing or other various means to fund our business after the completion of the Chapter 11 Cases. Our access to additional financing may be limited, if it is available at all. Therefore, adequate funds may not be available when needed or may not be available on favorable terms.\nIt is likely at this time that our common stock will be cancelled and that holders of such common stock will not receive any distribution with respect to, or be able to recover any portion of, their investments.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness that is senior to our common stock in our capital structure. Although the Plan contemplates no distributions with respect to our common stock, the Plan has not yet been approved by the Bankruptcy Court. Accordingly, it is unclear at this stage of the Chapter 11 Cases if any distributions will ultimately be made with respect to our common stock and other outstanding equity interests. It is possible that these equity interests may be cancelled and extinguished upon the approval of the Bankruptcy Court\nand the holders thereof would not be entitled to receive, and would not receive or retain, any property or interest in property on account of such equity interests. In the event of a cancellation of these equity interests, amounts invested by such holders in our outstanding equity securities will not be recoverable. Consequently, our currently outstanding common stock would have no value. Trading prices for our common stock are very volatile and may bear little or no relationship to the actual recovery, if any, by the holders of such securities in the Chapter 11 Cases. Accordingly, we urge that extreme caution be exercised with respect to existing and future investments in our equity securities and any of our other securities.\nThe NYSE has delisted our common stock. Trading in our securities during the pendency of the Chapter 11 Cases is highly speculative and poses substantial risks.\nThe NYSE delisted our common stock because we are no longer suitable for listing pursuant to the NYSE Listed Company Manual Section 802.01D as a result of the filing of the Chapter 11 Cases. Since April 28, 2020, our common stock has been quoted on the OTC Pink Open Market under the symbol \u201cDOFSQ.\u201d We can provide no assurance that our common stock will continue to trade on this market, whether broker-dealers will continue to provide public quotes of our common stock on this market, whether the trading volume of our common stock will be sufficient to provide for an efficient trading market, or whether quotes for our common stock will continue on this market in the future. These developments could result in significantly lower trading volumes and reduced liquidity for investors seeking to buy or sell shares of our common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Operations\nThe impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and efforts to mitigate the spread of the virus have had a material adverse effect on and are expected to continue to have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial results.\nThe COVID-19 outbreak and its development into a pandemic in March 2020 continue to significantly impact our business and the geographical areas in which we operate. These events continue to result in various actions by governmental authorities in many parts of the world to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, such as imposing mandatory closures of all non-essential business facilities, seeking voluntary closures of business facilities, declaring border closings, and imposing restrictions on, or advisories with respect to, travel, business operations and public gatherings or interactions. Moreover, any resurgence in COVID-19 infections could result in the imposition of new governmental lockdowns, quarantine requirements or other restrictions in an effort to slow the spread of the virus. In addition, the risk of infection and health risk associated with COVID-19, and the related death or illness of many individuals across the globe, continue to result in actions by individuals and companies seeking to curtail the spread of COVID-19, such as companies requiring employees to work remotely, suspending all non-essential travel for employees and discouraging employee attendance at in-person work-related meetings, as well as individuals voluntarily social distancing and self-quarantining. Although vaccines for COVID-19 have been developed and are being distributed, the phased rollout by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, or CDC, and delays in distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine could result in new governmental lockdowns, quarantine requirements or other restrictions.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and the actions taken by businesses and governments in response to it have significantly slowed global economic activity as a result of, among other things, the dramatic decrease in the number of businesses open for operation and a substantial reduction in the number of people across the world that have been leaving their residence to commute to work or to purchase goods and services. This reduction has also resulted in airlines dramatically reducing flights. As a result, there has also been a sharp reduction in the demand for oil and a precipitous decline in oil prices. In the first half of 2020, oil price volatility was exacerbated by disputes over production levels among oil-producing countries, the significant increase in production levels by such countries and limited storage capacity for crude oil and refined products. In addition, the global economy has been further impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic through the disruption of financial markets and international trade, resulting in increased unemployment levels and significantly impacting global supply chains and travel networks.\nThese events have had a material adverse effect on and are expected to continue to have a material adverse effect on our business. Any prolonged period of depressed oil prices could have significant adverse consequences for the financial condition of our customers and result in reductions to their drilling and production expenditures and\ndelays or cancellations of projects, thus decreasing demand for our drilling services. We have already experienced customers delaying drilling projects as a result of COVID-19 restrictions and complications. Such conditions have resulted in an increased risk that our customers may seek price reductions or more favorable economic terms for our services, seek to terminate our drilling contracts or otherwise be unable to timely pay outstanding receivables owed to us, or could result in us having to enter into lower dayrate contracts or to idle, stack or retire more of our drilling rigs. To the extent our suppliers experience a deterioration in financial condition or operational capability as a result of such depressed industry conditions or we or other suppliers incur delays in moving personnel to and from drilling rigs, we may experience disruptions in supply, which could increase our operating costs and increase rig downtime. The occurrence of any such events with respect to our customers, contracts or suppliers could have material adverse consequences for our business and financial position.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and impact, we have implemented certain changes to our operational processes. For example, we have asked our rig crews in certain locations to quarantine in-country before offshore rotations, as well as to remain in country after their offshore rotation. We have also adopted COVID-19 testing requirements based on the regions in which our rigs are operating that primarily require testing of all personnel prior to an offshore rotation or travel from the U.S. to an international location. Additionally, for most of our rigs we have implemented other health protocols once personnel are on board a rig such as increased social distancing, requiring twice daily temperature checks and increased frequency in cleaning/disinfecting common areas on our rigs. We cannot guarantee that any actions taken by us, including the precautionary measures noted above, will be effective in preventing either an outbreak of COVID-19 on one or more of our rigs or other adverse effects related to COVID-19. Furthermore, we cannot predict when our personnel will be able to obtain a COVID-19 vaccine in accordance with the CDC phased allocation guidelines. To the extent there is an outbreak of COVID-19 on one or more of our rigs, we may have to temporarily shut down operations of such rig or rigs, which could result in significant downtime or contract termination and have substantial adverse consequences for our business and results of operations.\nMany governmental authorities worldwide have implemented travel restrictions and mandatory quarantine measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19, and, in complying with such governmental actions, we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, increased difficulties, delays and costs in moving our personnel in and out of, and to work in, the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Such difficulties and delays may result in a shortage of available experienced rig personnel or rig personnel working unusually long periods before rotating off the rig. We may be unable to recover these increased costs from our customers. We may also experience permitting and regulatory delays attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic or reduced staffing at various regulatory agencies. Additionally, disruptions to or restrictions on the ability of our suppliers, manufacturers and service providers to supply parts, equipment or services in the jurisdictions in which we operate, whether as a result of government actions, labor shortages, the inability to source parts or equipment from affected locations, or other effects related to the COVID-19 outbreak, may have significant adverse consequences on our ability to meet our commitments to customers, including by increasing our operating costs and increasing the risk of rig downtime and could result in contract delays or terminations.\nIn spite of the fact that COVID-19 vaccines are being distributed, the situation surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic remains fluid. Due to delays in the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines and potential resurgences in COVID-19 infections, we cannot reasonably estimate the period of time that the COVID-19 pandemic and related market conditions will persist, the extent of the impact they will have on our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, or the pace or extent of any subsequent recovery. The ultimate extent of the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak on our business and financial position will continue to depend significantly on future developments, including the speed of distribution and efficacy of the COVID-19 vaccine, the future duration, spread or containment of the outbreak, particularly within the geographic locations where we operate, and the related impact on overall economic activity and demand for oil and gas, all of which continue to remain highly uncertain at this time. The depressed market and industry conditions have placed significant pressure on the liquidity and solvency of many offshore drilling contractors, which have led some of our competitors to pursue restructuring transactions. We are unable to predict the timing or impact of any such restructurings, if completed, on the capital structure and competitive dynamics among offshore drilling companies.\nMany of the other risks we face are, and will be, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and any worsening of the business and economic environment as a result of it.\nThe current protracted downturn in our industry may continue into the foreseeable future, and we cannot predict if or when it will end.\nCrude oil prices, which peaked at $115 per barrel in 2014, have declined to a five-year average of $55 per barrel. Oil prices continue to remain low with Brent crude oil prices in the $60-per-barrel range as of the date of this report. As a result of, among other things, the depressed commodity price and its uncertain future, the offshore drilling industry has experienced, and is continuing to experience, a substantial decline in demand for its services, as well as a significant decline in dayrates for contract drilling services. The decline in demand for our contract drilling services and the dayrates for those services has had, and if the industry downturn continues, will continue to have, a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including negative cash flows. The protracted downturn in our industry will exacerbate many of the other risks included below and other risks that we face, and we cannot predict if or when the downturn will end.\nThe worldwide demand for drilling services has historically been dependent on the price of oil and, as a result of low oil prices, demand continued to be depressed in 2020 as the protracted downturn in our industry continues.\nDemand for our drilling services depends in large part upon the oil and natural gas industry\u2019s offshore exploration and production activity and expenditure levels, which are directly affected by oil and gas prices and market expectations of potential changes in oil and gas prices. Beginning in the second half of 2014, oil prices declined significantly, resulting in a sharp decline in the demand for offshore drilling services, including services that we provide, and have had a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows compared to years before the decline. The continuation of low oil prices would make more severe the downturn in our industry and would continue to have a material adverse effect on many of our customers and, therefore, demand for our services and our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, including negative cash flows.\nOil prices have been, and are expected to continue to be, volatile and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control, including:\n\u2022\nworldwide supply and demand for oil and gas, including the oversupply of oil and gas as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022\nthe level of economic activity in energy-consuming markets;\n\u2022\nthe worldwide economic environment and economic trends, including recessions and the level of international trade activity;\n\u2022\nthe ability of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, and 10 other oil producing countries, including Russia and Mexico, or OPEC+, to set and maintain production levels and pricing;\n\u2022\nthe level of production in non-OPEC+ countries, including U.S. domestic onshore oil production;\n\u2022\ncivil unrest and the worldwide political and military environment, including uncertainty or instability resulting from an escalation or additional outbreak of armed hostilities involving the Middle East, Russia, Myanmar, where the Ocean Monarch is operating as of the date of this report, other oil-producing regions or other geographic areas or further acts of terrorism in the U.S. or elsewhere;\n\u2022\nthe cost of exploring for, developing, producing and delivering oil and gas, both onshore and offshore;\n\u2022\nthe discovery rate of new oil and gas reserves;\n\u2022\nthe rate of decline of existing and new oil and gas reserves and production;\n\u2022\navailable pipeline and other oil and gas transportation and refining capacity;\n\u2022\nthe ability of oil and gas companies to raise capital;\n\u2022\nweather conditions, including hurricanes, which can affect oil and gas operations over a wide area;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters or incidents resulting from operating hazards inherent in offshore drilling, such as oil spills;\n\u2022\nthe policies of various governments regarding exploration and development of their oil and gas reserves;\n\u2022\ninternational sanctions on oil-producing countries, or the lifting of such sanctions;\n\u2022\ntechnological advances affecting energy consumption, including development and exploitation of alternative fuels or energy sources;\n\u2022\nlaws and regulations relating to environmental or energy security matters, including those addressing alternative energy sources, the phase-out of fossil fuel vehicles or the risks of global climate change;\n\u2022\ndomestic and foreign tax policy; and\n\u2022\nadvances in exploration and development technology.\nAlthough, historically, higher sustained commodity prices have generally resulted in increases in offshore drilling projects, short-term or temporary increases in the price of oil and gas will not necessarily result in an increase in offshore drilling activity or an increase in the market demand for our rigs. The timing of commitment to offshore activity in a cycle depends on project deployment times, reserve replacement needs, availability of capital and alternative options for resource development, among other things. Timing can also be affected by availability, access to, and cost of equipment to perform work.\nOur business depends on the level of activity in the offshore oil and gas industry, which has been cyclical, is currently in a protracted downturn and is significantly affected by many factors outside of our control.\nDemand for our drilling services depends upon the level of offshore oil and gas exploration, development and production in markets worldwide, and those activities depend in large part on oil and gas prices, worldwide demand for oil and gas and a variety of political and economic factors. The level of offshore drilling activity is adversely affected when operators reduce or defer new investment in offshore projects, reduce or suspend their drilling budgets or reallocate their drilling budgets away from offshore drilling in favor of other priorities, such as shale or other land-based projects, which have reduced, and may in the future further reduce demand for our rigs. As a result, our business and the oil and gas industry in general are subject to cyclical fluctuations.\nAs a result of the cyclical fluctuations in the market, there have been periods of lower demand, excess rig supply and lower dayrates, followed by periods of higher demand, shorter rig supply and higher dayrates. We cannot predict the timing or duration of such fluctuations. Periods of lower demand or excess rig supply, such as the current protracted downturn in our industry that is ongoing and may continue into the foreseeable future, intensify the competition in the industry and often result in periods of lower utilization and lower dayrates. During these periods, our rigs may not be able to obtain contracts for future work and may be idle for long periods of time or may be able to obtain work only under contracts with lower dayrates or less favorable terms. Additionally, prolonged periods of low utilization and dayrates (such as we are currently experiencing) have in the past resulted in, and may in the future result in, the recognition of further impairment charges on certain of our drilling rigs if future cash flow estimates, based upon information available to management at the time, indicate that the carrying value of these rigs may not be recoverable. See \u201c- We may incur additional asset impairments and/or rig retirements as a result of reduced demand for certain offshore drilling rigs.\u201d\nOur industry is highly competitive, with an oversupply of drilling rigs and intense price competition.\nThe offshore contract drilling industry is highly competitive with numerous industry participants, and such competitiveness may be exacerbated by the current protracted downturn in our industry. Some of our competitors are larger companies, have larger or more technologically advanced fleets and have greater financial or other resources than we do. The drilling industry has experienced consolidation and may experience additional consolidation, which could create additional large competitors. Moreover, as a result of the significant reduced demand for oil and natural gas services due to the global COVID-19 pandemic, certain of our competitors may\nengage in bankruptcy proceedings, debt refinancing transactions, management changes or other strategic initiatives in an attempt to reduce operating costs to maintain a position in the market. This could result in such competitors emerging with stronger or healthier balance sheets and in turn an improved ability to compete with us in the future.\nDrilling contracts are traditionally awarded on a competitive bid basis. Price is typically the primary factor in determining which qualified contractor is awarded a job; however, rig availability and location, a drilling contractor\u2019s safety record and the quality and technical capability of service and equipment are also considered.\nAs of the date of this report, based on industry data, there are approximately 210 floater rigs currently available to meet customer drilling needs in the offshore contract drilling market, and many of these rigs are not currently contracted and/or are cold stacked. Although there have been over 130 floater rigs scrapped since 2014, the market remains oversupplied as new rig construction, upgrades of existing drilling rigs, cancelation or termination of drilling contracts and established rigs coming off contract have contributed to the current oversupply, intensifying price competition. In addition, some shipyards own rigs recently constructed or under construction, which are not currently marketed, which, if acquired by us or our competitors, would further exacerbate the oversupply of rigs.\nIn addition, during industry downturns like the one we are currently experiencing, rig operators may take lower dayrates and shorter contract durations to keep their rigs operational.\nWe can provide no assurance that our drilling contracts will not be terminated early or that our current backlog of contract drilling revenue ultimately will be realized.\nOur customers may terminate our drilling contracts under certain circumstances, such as the destruction or loss of a drilling rig, our suspension of drilling operations for a specified period of time as a result of a breakdown of major equipment, excessive downtime for repairs, failure to meet minimum performance criteria (including customer acceptance testing) or, in some cases, due to other events beyond the control of either party.\nIn addition, some of our drilling contracts permit the customer to terminate the contract after specified notice periods, often by tendering contractually specified termination amounts, which may not fully compensate us for the loss of the contract. In some cases, our drilling contracts may permit the customer to terminate the contract without cause, upon little or no notice or without making an early termination payment to us. During depressed market conditions, such as those currently in effect, certain customers have utilized, and may in the future utilize, such contract clauses to seek to renegotiate or terminate a drilling contract or claim that we have breached provisions of our drilling contracts in order to avoid their obligations to us under circumstances where we believe we are in compliance with the contracts. Additionally, because of depressed commodity prices, restricted credit markets, economic downturns, changes in priorities or strategy or other factors beyond our control, a customer may no longer want or need a rig that is currently under contract or may be able to obtain a comparable rig at a lower dayrate. For these reasons, customers have sought and may in the future seek to renegotiate the terms of our existing drilling contracts, terminate our contracts without justification or repudiate or otherwise fail to perform their obligations under our contracts. As a result of such contract renegotiations or terminations, our contract backlog has been and may in the future be adversely impacted. We might not recover any compensation (or any recovery we obtain may not fully compensate us for the loss of the contract) and we may be required to idle one or more rigs for an extended period of time. Each of these results in some cases has had, and may in the future have, a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. See \u201c- Our industry is highly competitive, with an oversupply of drilling rigs and intense price competition\u201d.\nWe may not be able to renew or replace expiring contracts for our rigs.\nAs of the date of this report, one of our drilling rigs has contract backlog that provides for continuous work until December 2021, seven of our drilling rigs have contract backlog that provides for continuous work until sometime in 2022 and one of our drilling rigs has contract backlog that provides for continuous work until January 2024. One of our drilling rigs is not currently contracted for continuous utilization between contracts and is being actively marketed for the uncontracted periods. Backlog for this rig extends until May 2023. Our ability to renew or replace expiring contracts or obtain new contracts, and the terms of any such contracts, will depend on various factors, including market conditions and the specific needs of our customers, at such times. Given the historically cyclical and highly competitive nature of our industry and the likelihood that the current protracted downturn in our industry continues, we may not be able to renew or replace the contracts or we may be required to renew or replace expiring contracts or obtain new contracts at dayrates that are below existing dayrates, or that have terms that are less favorable to us, including shorter durations, than our existing contracts. Moreover, we may be unable to secure contracts for these rigs. Failure to secure contracts for a rig may result in a decision to cold stack the rig, which puts the rig at risk for impairment and may competitively disadvantage the rig as many customers, during the current protracted market downturn, have expressed a preference for ready or warm-stacked rigs over cold-stacked rigs. If a decision is made to cold stack a rig, our operating costs for the rig are typically reduced; however, we will incur additional costs associated with cold stacking the rig (particularly if we cold stack a newer rig, such as a drillship or other DP semisubmersible rig, for which cold-stacking costs are typically substantially higher than for an older non-DP rig). In addition, the costs to reactivate a cold-stacked rig may be substantial. See \u201c- We must make substantial capital and operating expenditures to reactivate, build, maintain and upgrade our drilling fleet.\u201d\nOur customer base is concentrated.\nWe provide offshore drilling services to a customer base that includes major and independent oil and gas companies and government-owned oil companies. During 2020, our three customers in the GOM and our five largest customers in the aggregate accounted for 46% and 83%, respectively, of our annual total consolidated revenues. In addition, the number of customers we have performed services for has declined from 35 in 2014 to ten in 2020. Of our current contracted backlog for the years 2021 and 2022, $0.3 billion and $0.2 billion, respectively, or 46% and 62%, respectively, are attributable to future operations with two customers. Contracted backlog aggregating $0.1 billion for the years 2023 and 2024 is attributable to future operations from a single customer. The loss of a significant customer could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, especially in a declining market (like the current protracted industry downturn) where the number of our working drilling rigs is declining along with the number of our active customers. In addition, if a significant customer experiences liquidity constraints or other financial difficulties, or elects to terminate one of our drilling contracts, it could have a material adverse effect on our utilization rates in the affected market and also displace demand for our other drilling rigs as the resulting excess supply enters the market.\nOur contract drilling expense includes fixed costs that will not decline in proportion to decreases in rig utilization and dayrates.\nOur contract drilling expense includes all direct and indirect costs associated with the operation, maintenance and support of our drilling equipment, which is often not affected by changes in dayrates and utilization. During periods of reduced revenue and/or activity (like the current protracted industry downturn), certain of our fixed costs will not decline and often we may incur additional operating costs, such as fuel and catering costs, for which the customer generally reimburses us when a rig is under contract. During times of reduced dayrates and utilization, like the current protracted industry downturn, reductions in costs may not be immediate as we may incur additional costs associated with cold stacking a rig (particularly if we cold stack a newer rig, such as a drillship or other DP semisubmersible rig, for which cold-stacking costs are typically substantially higher than for an older non-DP rig), or we may not be able to fully reduce the cost of our support operations in a particular geographic region due to the need to support the remaining drilling rigs in that region. Accordingly, a decline in revenue due to lower dayrates and/or utilization may not be offset by a corresponding decrease in contract drilling expense.\nWe must make substantial capital and operating expenditures to reactivate, build, maintain and upgrade our drilling fleet.\nOur business is highly capital intensive and dependent on having sufficient cash flow and/or available sources of financing in order to fund our capital expenditure requirements. Our expenditures could increase as a result of changes in offshore drilling technology; the cost of labor and materials; customer requirements; the cost of replacement parts for existing drilling rigs; the geographic location of the rigs; and industry standards. Changes in offshore drilling technology, customer requirements for new or upgraded equipment and competition within our industry may require us to make significant capital expenditures in order to maintain our competitiveness. In addition, changes in governmental regulations, safety or other equipment standards, including those relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as compliance with standards imposed by maritime self-regulatory organizations, may require us to make additional unforeseen capital expenditures. As a result, we may be required to take our rigs out of service for extended periods of time, with corresponding losses of revenues, in order to make such alterations or to add such equipment. Depending on the length of time that a rig has been cold-stacked, we may incur significant costs to restore the rig to drilling capability, which may also include capital expenditures due to the possible technological obsolescence of the rig. Market conditions, such as the current protracted industry downturn, may not justify these expenditures or enable us to operate our older rigs profitably during the remainder of their economic lives. We can provide no assurance that we will have access to adequate or economical sources of capital to fund our capital and operating expenditures.\nOur business involves numerous operating hazards that could expose us to significant losses and significant damage claims. We are not fully insured against all of these risks and our contractual indemnity provisions may not fully protect us.\nOur operations are subject to the significant hazards inherent in drilling for oil and gas offshore, such as blowouts, reservoir damage, loss of production, loss of well control, unstable or faulty sea floor conditions, fires and natural disasters such as hurricanes and the frequency and severity of such natural disasters could be increased due to climate change. The occurrence of any of these types of events could result in the suspension of drilling operations, damage to or destruction of the equipment involved and injury or death to rig personnel and damage to producing or potentially productive oil and gas formations, oil spillage, oil leaks, well blowouts and extensive uncontrolled fires, any of which could cause significant environmental damage. In addition, offshore drilling operations are subject to marine hazards, including capsizing, grounding, collision and loss or damage from severe weather. Operations also may be suspended because of machinery breakdowns, abnormal drilling conditions, failure of suppliers or subcontractors to perform or supply goods or services or personnel shortages. Any of the foregoing events could result in significant damage or loss to our properties and assets or the properties and assets of others, injury or death to rig personnel or others, significant loss of revenues and significant damage claims against us.\nOur drilling contracts with our customers provide for varying levels of indemnity and allocation of liabilities between our customers and us with respect to the hazards and risks inherent in, and damages or losses arising out of, our operations, and we may not be fully protected. Our contracts are individually negotiated, and the levels of indemnity and allocation of liabilities in them can vary from contract to contract depending on market conditions, particular customer requirements and other factors existing at the time a contract is negotiated. We may incur liability for significant losses or damages under such provisions.\nAdditionally, the enforceability of indemnification provisions in our contracts may be limited or prohibited by applicable law or such provisions may not be enforced by courts having jurisdiction, and we could be held liable for substantial losses or damages and for fines and penalties imposed by regulatory authorities. The indemnification provisions in our contracts may be subject to differing interpretations, and the laws or courts of certain jurisdictions may enforce such provisions while other laws or courts may find them to be unenforceable. The law with respect to the enforceability of indemnities varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and is unsettled under certain laws that are applicable to our contracts. There can be no assurance that our contracts with our customers, suppliers and subcontractors will fully protect us against all hazards and risks inherent in our operations. There can also be no assurance that those parties with contractual obligations to indemnify us will be financially able to do so or will otherwise honor their contractual obligations.\nWe maintain liability insurance, which generally includes coverage for environmental damage; however, because of contractual provisions and policy limits, our insurance coverage may not adequately cover our losses and claim costs. In addition, certain risks and contingencies related to pollution, reservoir damage and environmental risks are generally not fully insurable. Also, we do not typically purchase loss-of-hire insurance to cover lost\nrevenues when a rig is unable to work. There can be no assurance that we will continue to carry the insurance we currently maintain, that our insurance will cover all types of losses or that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates we consider to be reasonable or that we will be able to obtain insurance against some risks. In addition, our insurance may not cover losses associated with pandemics such as the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe are self-insured for physical damage to rigs and equipment caused by named windstorms in the GOM. This results in a higher risk of material losses that are not covered by third party insurance contracts. In addition, certain of our shore-based facilities are located in geographic regions that are susceptible to damage or disruption from hurricanes and other weather events. Future hurricanes or similar natural disasters that impact our facilities, our personnel located at those facilities or our ongoing operations may negatively affect our financial position and operating results.\nIf an accident or other event occurs that exceeds our insurance coverage limits or is not an insurable event under our insurance policies, or is not fully covered by contractual indemnity, it could result in a significant loss to us and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nAny significant cyber-attack or other interruption in network security or the operation of critical information technology systems could materially disrupt our operations and adversely affect our business.\nOur business has become increasingly dependent upon information technologies, computer systems and networks, including those maintained by us and those maintained and provided to us by third parties (for example, \u201csoftware-as-a-service\u201d and cloud solutions), to conduct day-to-day operations, and we are placing greater reliance on information technology to help support our operations and increase efficiency in our business functions. We are dependent upon our information technology and infrastructure, including operational and financial computer systems, to process the data necessary to conduct almost all aspects of our business. Computer, telecommunications and other business facilities and systems could become unavailable or impaired from a variety of causes including, among others, storms and other natural disasters, terrorist attacks, utility outages, theft, design defects, human error or complications encountered as existing systems are maintained, repaired, replaced or upgraded. It has been reported that known or unknown entities or groups have mounted so-called \u201ccyber-attacks\u201d on businesses and other organizations solely to disable or disrupt computer systems, disrupt operations and, in some cases, steal data. In addition, the U.S. government has issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of cybersecurity threats. Cybersecurity risks and threats continue to grow and may be difficult to anticipate, prevent, discover or mitigate. A breach, failure or circumvention of our computer systems or networks, or those of our customers, vendors or others with whom we do business, including by ransomware or other attacks, could materially disrupt our business operations and our customers\u2019 operations and could result in the alteration, loss, theft or corruption of data, and unauthorized release of, unauthorized access to, or our loss of access to confidential, proprietary, sensitive or other critical data or systems concerning our company, business activities, employees, customers or vendors. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, most of our non-operational employees, including employees at our corporate headquarters, are working remotely, as of the date of this report, which increases various logistical challenges, inefficiencies and operational risks. Working remotely has significantly increased the use of remote networking and online conferencing services that enable employees to work outside of our corporate infrastructure and, in some cases, use their own personal devices. This \u201cremote work\u201d model has resulted in increased demand for information technology resources and may expose us to risk of security breaches or other cyber-incidents or attacks, loss of data, fraud and other disruptions as a consequence of more employees accessing sensitive and critical information from remote locations. Any such breach, failure or circumvention could result in loss of customers, financial losses, regulatory fines, substantial damage to property, bodily injury or loss of life, or misuse or corruption of critical data and proprietary information and could have a material adverse effect on our operations, business or reputation. Further, as cyber incidents continue to evolve, we may be required to incur additional costs to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate or remediate the effects of cyber incidents.\nActs of terrorism, piracy and political and social unrest could affect the markets for drilling services, which may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nActs of terrorism and social unrest, brought about by world political events or otherwise, have caused instability in the world\u2019s financial and insurance markets in the past and may occur in the future. Such acts could be directed against companies such as ours. In addition, acts of terrorism, piracy and social unrest could lead to increased volatility in prices for crude oil and natural gas and could adversely affect the market for offshore drilling services. Insurance premiums could increase and coverage may be unavailable in the future. Government regulations may effectively preclude us from engaging in business activities in certain countries. These regulations could be amended to cover countries where we currently operate or where we may wish to operate in the future.\nWe rely on third-party suppliers, manufacturers and service providers to secure and service equipment, components and parts used in rig operations, conversions, upgrades and construction.\nOur reliance on third-party suppliers, manufacturers and service providers to provide equipment and services exposes us to volatility in the quality, price and availability of such items. Certain components, parts and equipment that we use in our operations may be available only from a small number of suppliers, manufacturers or service providers. The failure of one or more third-party suppliers, manufacturers or service providers to provide equipment, components, parts or services, whether due to capacity constraints, production or delivery disruptions, price increases, quality control issues, recalls or other decreased availability of parts and equipment, is beyond our control and could materially disrupt our operations or result in the delay, renegotiation or cancellation of drilling contracts, thereby causing a loss of contract drilling backlog and/or revenue to us, as well as an increase in operating costs and an increased risk of additional asset impairments.\nAdditionally, our suppliers, manufacturers and service providers could be negatively impacted by the current protracted industry downturn, global economic conditions or COVID-19 pandemic. If certain of our suppliers, manufacturers or service providers were to experience significant cash flow issues, become insolvent or otherwise curtail or discontinue their business as a result of such conditions, it could result in a reduction or interruption in supplies, equipment or services available to us and/or a significant increase in the price of such supplies, equipment and services.\nContracts for our drilling rigs are generally fixed dayrate contracts, and increases in our operating costs could adversely affect our profitability on those contracts.\nOur contracts for our drilling rigs generally provide for the payment of an agreed dayrate per rig operating day, although some contracts do provide for a limited escalation in dayrate due to increased operating costs we incur on the project. Over the term of a drilling contract, our operating costs may fluctuate due to events beyond our control. In addition, equipment repair and maintenance expenses vary depending on the type of activity the rig is performing, the age and condition of the equipment and general market factors impacting relevant parts, components and services. The gross margin that we realize on these fixed dayrate contracts will fluctuate based on variations in our operating costs over the terms of the contracts. In addition, for contracts with dayrate escalation clauses, we may not be able to fully recover increased or unforeseen costs from our customers.\nFailure to obtain and retain highly skilled personnel could hurt our operations.\nWe require highly skilled personnel to operate and provide technical services and support for our business. A well-trained, motivated and adequately-staffed work force has a positive impact on our ability to attract and retain business. As a result, our future success depends on our continuing ability to identify, hire, develop, motivate and retain skilled personnel for all areas of our organization. To the extent that demand for drilling services and/or the size of the active worldwide industry fleet increases, shortages of qualified personnel could arise, creating upward pressure on wages and difficulty in staffing and servicing our rigs. Our continued ability to compete effectively depends on our ability to attract new employees and to retain and motivate our existing employees. Heightened competition for skilled personnel could materially and adversely limit our operations and further increase our costs. In addition, the unexpected loss of members of management, qualified personnel or a significant number of employees due to disease, including COVID-19, disability or death, could have a material adverse effect on us.\nFinancial and Tax Risks\nWe may incur additional asset impairments and/or rig retirements as a result of reduced demand for certain offshore drilling rigs.\nThe current oversupply of drilling rigs in the offshore drilling market has resulted in numerous rigs being idled and, in some cases, retired and/or scrapped. We evaluate our property and equipment for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable, and we have incurred impairment charges in the past, and may incur additional impairment charges in the future related to the carrying value of our drilling rigs. Impairment write-offs could result if, for example, any of our rigs become obsolete or commercially less desirable due to changes in technology, market demand or market expectations or their carrying values become excessive due to the condition of the rig, cold stacking the rig, the expectation of cold stacking the rig in the near future, contracted backlog of less than one year for a rig, a decision to retire or scrap the rig, or spending in excess of budget on a newbuild, construction project, reactivation or major rig upgrade. We utilize an undiscounted probability-weighted cash flow analysis in testing an asset for potential impairment, reflecting management\u2019s assumptions and estimates regarding the appropriate risk-adjusted dayrate by rig, future industry conditions and operations and other factors. Asset impairment evaluations are, by their nature, highly subjective. The use of different estimates and assumptions could result in materially different carrying values of our assets, which could impact the need to record an impairment charge and the amount of any charge taken. From 2012 to the date of this report, we have retired and sold 36 drilling rigs and recorded impairment losses aggregating $2.6 billion. Historically, the longer a drilling rig remains cold stacked, the higher the cost of reactivation and, depending on the age, technological obsolescence and condition of the rig, the lower the likelihood that the rig will be reactivated at a future date. The current oversupply of rigs in our industry, together with the current protracted downturn, heightens the risk of future rig impairments. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Critical Accounting Estimates - Property, Plant and Equipment\u201d in Item 7 of this report and Note 4 \u201cAsset Impairments\u201d to our Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report.\nWe can provide no assurance that our assumptions and estimates used in our asset impairment evaluations will ultimately be realized or that the current carrying value of our property and equipment will ultimately be realized.\nChanges in tax laws and policies, effective income tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from examination of our tax returns could adversely affect our financial results.\nTax laws and regulations are highly complex and subject to interpretation and disputes. We conduct our worldwide operations through various subsidiaries in a number of countries throughout the world. As a result, we are subject to highly complex tax laws, regulations and income tax treaties within and between the countries in which we operate as well as countries in which we may be resident, which may change and are subject to interpretation. In addition, in several of the international locations in which we operate, certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries enter into agreements with each other to provide specialized services and equipment in support of our foreign operations. In such cases, we apply an intercompany transfer pricing methodology to determine the arm\u2019s length amount to be charged for providing the services and equipment. In most cases, there are alternative transfer pricing methodologies that could be applied to these transactions and, if applied, could result in different chargeable amounts.\nAs a result, we determine our income tax expense based on our interpretation of the applicable tax laws and regulations in effect in each jurisdiction for the period during which we operate and earn income. Our overall effective tax rate could be adversely affected by lower than anticipated earnings in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated earnings in countries where we have higher statutory rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities or by changes in tax laws, tax treaties, regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof in one or more countries in which we operate. In addition, changes in laws, treaties and regulations and the interpretation of such laws, treaties and regulations may put us at risk for future tax assessments and liabilities which could be substantial.\nOur income tax returns are subject to review and examination. We recognize the benefit of income tax positions we believe are more likely than not to be sustained on their merit should they be challenged by a tax authority. If any tax authority successfully challenges any tax position taken or any of our intercompany transfer pricing policies, or\nif the terms of certain income tax treaties are interpreted in a manner that is adverse to us or our operations, or if we lose a material tax dispute in any country, our effective tax rate on our worldwide earnings could increase substantially.\nOur consolidated effective income tax rate may vary substantially from one reporting period to another.\nOur consolidated effective income tax rate is impacted by the mix between our domestic and international pre-tax earnings or losses, as well as the mix of the international tax jurisdictions in which we operate. We cannot provide any assurance as to what our consolidated effective income tax rate will be in the future due to, among other factors, uncertainty regarding the nature and extent of our business activities in any particular jurisdiction in the future and the tax laws of such jurisdictions, as well as potential changes in U.S. and foreign tax laws, regulations or treaties or the interpretation or enforcement thereof, changes in the administrative practices and precedents of tax authorities or any reclassification or other matter (such as changes in applicable accounting rules) that increases the amounts we have provided for income taxes or deferred tax assets and liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. This variability may cause our consolidated effective income tax rate to vary substantially from one reporting period to another.\nChanges in accounting principles and financial reporting requirements could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nWe are required to prepare our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S., or GAAP, as promulgated by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. It is possible that future accounting standards that we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nRegulatory and Legal Risks\nWe are subject to extensive domestic and international laws and regulations that could significantly limit our business activities and revenues and increase our costs.\nCertain countries are subject to restrictions, sanctions and embargoes imposed by the U.S. government or other governmental or international authorities. These restrictions, sanctions and embargoes may prohibit or limit us from participating in certain business activities in those countries. Our operations are also subject to numerous local, state and federal laws and regulations in the U.S. and in foreign jurisdictions concerning the containment and disposal of hazardous materials, the remediation of contaminated properties and the protection of the environment. Laws and regulations protecting the environment have become increasingly stringent, and may in some cases impose \u201cstrict liability,\u201d rendering a person liable for environmental damage without regard to negligence or fault on the part of that person. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could subject us to civil or criminal enforcement action, for which we may not receive contractual indemnification or have insurance coverage, and could result in the issuance of injunctions restricting some or all of our activities in the affected areas. We may be required to make significant expenditures for additional capital equipment or inspections and recertifications thereof to comply with existing or new governmental laws and regulations. It is also possible that these laws and regulations may in the future add significantly to our operating costs or result in a substantial reduction in revenues associated with downtime required to install such equipment or may otherwise significantly limit drilling activity.\nIn addition, these laws and regulations require us to perform certain regulatory inspections, which we refer to as a special survey. For most of our rigs, these special surveys are due every five years, although the inspection interval for our North Sea rigs is two-and-one-half years. Our operating income is negatively impacted during these special surveys. These special surveys are generally performed in a shipyard and require scheduled downtime, which can negatively impact operating revenue. Operating expenses increase as a result of these special surveys due to the cost to mobilize the rigs to a shipyard, and inspection, repair and maintenance costs. Repair and maintenance activities may result from the special survey or may have been previously planned to take place during this mandatory downtime. The number of rigs undergoing a special survey will vary from year to year, as well as from quarter to quarter. Operating income may also be negatively impacted by intermediate surveys, which are performed at interim\nperiods between special surveys. Although an intermediate survey normally does not require shipyard time, the survey may require some downtime for the rig. We can provide no assurance as to the exact timing and/or duration of downtime and/or the costs or lost revenues associated with regulatory inspections, planned rig mobilizations and other shipyard projects.\nIn addition, the offshore drilling industry is dependent on demand for services from the oil and gas exploration industry and, accordingly, can be affected by changes in tax and other laws relating to the energy business generally. In early 2021, the newly-elected U.S. President and administration took actions to temporarily suspend the issuance of new oil and gas permits on federal lands and waters in the U.S. for 60 days and signed an executive order directing a pause in new oil and gas leasing on public lands and offshore waters, concurrent with a comprehensive review of the federal oil and gas program. A timeline for the review period has not been specified. We are unable to predict the direct impact of these measures, but such measures could materially adversely impact domestic drilling activities should they be prolonged. In addition, the energy sector could be negatively impacted by additional executive orders and suspensions, as the administration focuses on the impact of climate change, targeting a fully clean energy economy and net-zero emissions by 2050.\nGovernments in some countries are increasingly active in regulating and controlling the ownership of concessions, the exploration for oil and gas and other aspects of the oil and gas industry. The modification of existing laws or regulations or the adoption of new laws or regulations curtailing exploratory or developmental drilling for oil and gas for economic, environmental or other reasons could limit drilling opportunities.\nU.S. federal, state, foreign and international laws and regulations address oil spill prevention and control and impose a variety of obligations on us related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills. Some of these laws and regulations have significantly expanded liability exposure across all segments of the oil and gas industry. For example, the United States Oil Pollution Act of 1990 imposes strict and, with limited exceptions, joint and several liability upon each responsible party for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages. Failure to comply with such laws and regulations could subject us to civil or criminal enforcement action, for which we may not receive contractual indemnification or have insurance coverage, and could result in the issuance of injunctions restricting some or all of our activities in the affected areas. In addition, legislative and regulatory developments may occur that could substantially increase our exposure to liabilities that might arise in connection with our operations.\nAny future regulations relating to greenhouse gases and climate change could have a negative impact on our business.\nGovernments around the world are increasingly considering and adopting laws and regulations to address climate change issues. Lawmakers and regulators in the U.S. and other jurisdictions where we operate have focused increasingly on restricting the emission of carbon dioxide, methane and other \u201cgreenhouse\u201d gases. This may result in new environmental regulations that may unfavorably impact us, our suppliers and our customers. Moreover, there is increased focus, including by governmental and non-governmental organizations, investors and other stakeholders on these and other sustainability matters. In addition, efforts have been made and continue to be made in the international community toward the adoption of international treaties or protocols that would address global climate change issues and impose reductions of hydrocarbon-based fuels. We may be exposed to risks related to new laws, regulations, treaties or international agreements pertaining to climate change, greenhouse gases, carbon emissions or energy use that could decrease the use of oil or natural gas, thus reducing demand for hydrocarbon-based fuel and our drilling services. Governments may also pass laws or regulations incentivizing or mandating the use of alternative energy sources, such as wind power and solar energy, or the phase-out of fossil fuel vehicles, which may reduce demand for oil and natural gas and our drilling services. Such laws, regulations, treaties or international agreements could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions, or adversely affect the demand for hydrocarbons, which may have a negative impact on our business, and could have a material adverse effect on our operations by limiting drilling opportunities.\nIf we, or our customers, are unable to acquire or renew permits and approvals required for drilling operations, we may be forced to delay, suspend or cease our operations.\nOil and natural gas exploration and production operations require numerous permits and approvals for us and our customers from governmental agencies in the areas in which we operate or expect to operate. Depending on the area of operation, the burden of obtaining such permits and approvals to commence such operations may reside with us, our customers or both. Obtaining all necessary permits and approvals may necessitate substantial expenditures to comply with the requirements of these permits and approvals, future changes to these permits or approvals, or any adverse change in the interpretation of existing permits and approvals. In addition, such regulatory requirements and restrictions could also delay or curtail our operations.\nSignificant portions of our operations are conducted outside the U.S. and involve additional risks not associated with U.S. domestic operations.\nOur operations outside the U.S. accounted for approximately 54%, 47% and 41% of our total consolidated revenues for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and include, or have included, operations in South America, Australia and Southeast Asia, Europe and Mexico. Because we operate in various regions throughout the world, we are exposed to a variety of risks inherent in international operations, including risks of war or conflicts; political and economic instability and disruption; civil disturbance; acts of piracy, terrorism or other assaults on property or personnel; corruption; possible economic and legal sanctions (such as possible restrictions against countries that the U.S. government may consider to be state sponsors of terrorism); changes in global monetary and trade policies, laws and regulations; fluctuations in currency exchange rates; restrictions on currency exchange; controls over the repatriation of income or capital; and other risks. We may not have insurance coverage for these risks, or we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage for such events at reasonable rates. Our operations may become restricted, disrupted or prohibited in any country in which any of these risks occur.\nOn February 1, 2021, Myanmar\u2019s military seized control of the government and reportedly placed the country\u2019s civilian leader under house arrest. Although the United Nations Security Council has declined to issue a statement condemning the coup, the U.S. State Department has concluded that the military takeover in Myanmar constituted a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat. The Ocean Monarch commenced drilling operations offshore Myanmar in December 2020 and is located there as of the date of this report. While we continue to monitor the political environment in Myanmar, the situation there is fluid and the potential impact of the military takeover on our business, including the Ocean Monarch, remains uncertain as of the date of this report. Any loss of property or interruption of our business plans resulting from political instability, civil unrest or changes in law or policy enacted by the military government could have a significant negative impact on our business operations, earnings and cash flow. In addition, we may not have sufficient insurance to cover any loss of property or other claims resulting from these risks.\nOn January 29, 2020, the European Parliament approved the U.K.\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union, commonly referred to as Brexit. The U.K. officially left the European Union on January 31, 2020. In December 2020, the U.K. and the European Union announced they had entered into a post-Brexit agreement regarding certain aspects of trade and other strategic and political issues, potentially avoiding some of the anticipated disruption of a no-deal Brexit. The impact of Brexit, the December 2020 post-Brexit agreement between the U.K. and the European Union, and the terms of their post-Brexit relationship not addressed in that agreement, as well as the future relationship between the U.K. and the European Union, remain uncertain for companies that do business in the U.K. and the overall global economy. Approximately 16% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 were generated in the U.K. The effects of Brexit and the December 2020 post-Brexit agreement between the U.K. and the European Union, or similar events in other jurisdictions, could depress economic activity or impact global markets, including foreign exchange and securities markets, which may have an adverse impact on our business and operations as a result of changes in currency exchange rates, tariffs, treaties and other regulatory matters.\nWe are also subject to the following risks in connection with our international operations:\n\u2022\nkidnapping of personnel;\n\u2022\nseizure, expropriation, nationalization, deprivation, malicious damage or other loss of possession or use of property or equipment;\n\u2022\nrenegotiation or nullification of existing contracts;\n\u2022\ndisputes and legal proceedings in international jurisdictions;\n\u2022\nchanging social, political and economic conditions;\n\u2022\nimposition of wage and price controls, trade barriers, export controls or import-export quotas;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in currency exchange rates and restrictions on currency exchange;\n\u2022\nregulatory or financial requirements to comply with foreign bureaucratic actions;\n\u2022\nrestriction or disruption of business activities;\n\u2022\nlimitation of our access to markets for periods of time;\n\u2022\ntravel limitations or operational problems caused by public health threats, including the COVID-19 pandemic, or changes in immigration policies;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in supplying, repairing or replacing equipment or transporting personnel in remote locations;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in obtaining visas or work permits for our employees on a timely basis; and\n\u2022\nchanging taxation policies and confiscatory or discriminatory taxation.\nWe are also subject to the regulations of the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control and other U.S. laws and regulations governing our international operations in addition to domestic and international anti-bribery laws and sanctions, trade laws and regulations, customs laws and regulations, and other restrictions imposed by other governmental or international authorities. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in criminal and civil penalties, economic sanctions, seizure of shipments and/or the contractual withholding of monies owed to us, among other things. We have operated and may in the future operate in parts of the world where strict compliance with anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Any failure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 or other anti-corruption laws due to our own acts or omissions or the acts or omissions of others, including our partners, agents or vendors, could subject us to substantial fines, sanctions, civil and/or criminal penalties and curtailment of operations in certain jurisdictions. In addition, international contract drilling operations are subject to various laws and regulations in countries in which we operate, including laws and regulations relating to the equipping and operation of drilling rigs; import-export quotas or other trade barriers; repatriation of foreign earnings or capital; oil and gas exploration and development; local content requirements; taxation of offshore earnings and earnings of expatriate personnel; and use and compensation of local employees and suppliers by foreign contractors.\nWe may be subject to litigation and disputes that could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe are, from time to time, involved in litigation and disputes. These matters may include, among other things, contract disputes, personal injury claims, environmental claims or proceedings, asbestos and other toxic tort claims, employment and tax matters, claims of infringement of patent and other intellectual property rights, and other litigation that arises in the ordinary course of our business. We cannot predict with certainty the outcome or effect of any dispute, claim or other litigation matter, and there can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome of any litigation. We may not have insurance for litigation or claims that may arise, or if we do have insurance coverage it may not be sufficient, insurers may not remain solvent, other claims may exhaust some or all of the insurance available to us or insurers may interpret our insurance policies such that they do not cover losses for which we make claims or may otherwise dispute claims made. Litigation may have a material adverse effect on us because of potential adverse outcomes, defense costs, the diversion of our management\u2019s resources and other risk factors inherent in litigation or relating to the claims that may arise.", "PERMNO": 82298, "SIC": 1381, "TIC": "DOFSQ"}
