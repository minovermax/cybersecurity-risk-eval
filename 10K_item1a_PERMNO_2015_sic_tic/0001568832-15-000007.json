{"cik": "1568832", "company": "RCS Capital Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-11", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider each of the risks described below, together with all the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before deciding to invest in shares of our Class A common stock. If any of the following risks develop into actual events, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected, the market price of your shares could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment. You should also refer to the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including \u201cCautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\u201d\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have a limited operating history in the businesses we are currently engaged in.\nDuring 2014, we completed the acquisitions or launched the operations of ten businesses that operate independently under separate brands and management. We have also entered into agreements to acquire VSR and Girard, which we also expect will continue to operate independently under separate brands and management following the completion of their acquisitions by us, which we expect will close during March 2015. We refer to the businesses we have acquired or launched during 2014 and expect to acquire in March 2015, collectively, as the \u201cacquired businesses\u201d and to the transactions in which they were or will be acquired as the \u201crecent and pending acquisitions.\u201d\nThe acquired businesses are predominantly the Retail Firms that comprise Cetera Financial Group. Prior to the completion of the Cetera acquisition in April 2014, we had not previously engaged in the independent retail advice business.\nOur investment banking, capital markets, transaction management services and transfer agency businesses were launched during the period from November 2012 through January 2013.\nOur lack of an operating history in these businesses may also increase the challenges inherent in the difficult process of integrating and realizing the expected benefits of the recent and pending acquisitions and any future complementary acquisitions we may pursue. See \u201c-Risks Related to Our Acquisitions.\u201d We also are now exposed to operational risks and regulatory risks that we had not previously been exposed to. See \u201c-Risks Related to Our Retail Firms\u201d and \u201c-Regulatory Risks.\u201d\nBecause of our limited operating history in the businesses we are currently engaged in, you should not rely on our past performance to predict our future results.\nRCS Capital Corporation and Subsidiaries\nDecember 31, 2014\nA failure to protect our reputation could adversely affect our businesses.\nOur ability to attract and retain clients, investors, employees and financial advisors is highly dependent upon external perceptions of us and our businesses. Damage to our reputation could cause significant harm to our business and prospects and may arise from numerous sources, including litigation or regulatory actions, failing to deliver acceptable standards of service and quality, compliance failures, any perceived or actual weakness in our financial strength or liquidity, unethical behavior and the misconduct of our employees, executive officers, financial advisors, sponsors of financial products we offer or distribute and other third parties we rely on or partner with to conduct our businesses. Negative perceptions or publicity regarding these matters could damage our reputation among existing and potential clients, investors, employees and financial advisors. Adverse developments with respect to our industry may also, by association, negatively impact our reputation or result in greater regulatory or legislative scrutiny or litigation against us.\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and may limit our ability to use debt to fund future capital needs.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we had total indebtedness of $804.4 million. Our level of indebtedness could increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions. It could also require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes.\nWe may not be able to maintain a level of cash flows from operating activities sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness. In addition, we are limited in the amount of capital that we can draw from our broker-dealer subsidiaries. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to sell assets, seek additional capital or seek to restructure or refinance our indebtedness. These alternative measures may not be successful or feasible and may not be on as favorable terms. The secured term loans and revolving credit facility, which we refer to as the \u201cbank facilities,\u201d entered into in connection with the closing of the acquisition of Cetera, and the indenture governing the convertible notes issued on April 29, 2014 in connection with the acquisition of Cetera, which we refer to as the \u201cconvertible notes,\u201d restrict our ability to sell assets. Even if we could sell our assets, the proceeds that we realize from such sales may not be adequate to meet any debt service obligations then due. Furthermore, if an event of default were to occur with respect to our outstanding indebtedness, our creditors could, among other things, accelerate the maturity of our indebtedness.\nIn addition, our level of indebtedness may limit our flexibility in planning for changes in our business and the industry in which we operate, and limit our ability to borrow additional funds. Furthermore, the bank facilities and the indenture governing the convertible notes permit us to incur additional indebtedness. Although the bank facilities and the indenture governing the convertible notes contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, and the indebtedness incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. Also, these restrictions will not prevent us from incurring certain other obligations that do not constitute \u201cindebtedness\u201d as defined in the bank facilities and the indenture governing the convertible notes. To the extent new debt or other obligations are added to our currently anticipated debt levels, the substantial indebtedness risks described above would increase.\nWe may require additional financing, which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all.\nIn order for us to have the opportunity for future success and profitability, we periodically may need to obtain additional financing, either through borrowings, public offerings, private offerings, or some type of business combination. We may need to seek to raise additional capital through other available sources, which may include borrowing additional funds or raising additional capital from third parties, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in obtaining required funds on favorable terms, or at all. Our ability to raise capital may also be limited by restrictions on, among other things, incurring indebtedness, that are contained in the bank facilities, the indenture governing the convertible notes, the certificate of designation (the \u201cSeries B COD\u201d) governing our 11% Series B preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share (the \u201cSeries B preferred stock\u201d), and the certificate of designation (the \u201cSeries C COD\u201d), governing our 7% Series C convertible preferred stock, par value $0.001 per share (the \u201cSeries C convertible preferred stock\u201d).\nAdditionally, the issuance of new securities to raise capital may cause the dilution of shares of Class A common stock held by current stockholders.\nIn addition to cash required to operate our businesses, we have other cash requirements including the payment of interest on our indebtedness and the cash component of consideration, including post-completion consideration, to be paid in connection with the recent and pending acquisitions. If we are unable to generate adequate cash from our operations, or from financing activities, our liquidity and results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nRCS Capital Corporation and Subsidiaries\nDecember 31, 2014\nThe bank facilities and the indenture governing the convertible notes contain restrictions that may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business.\nThe bank facilities and the indenture governing the convertible notes contain customary restrictions on our activities, including covenants that may restrict us from:\n\u2022\nincurring additional indebtedness or issuing disqualified stock or preferred stock;\n\u2022\npaying dividends on, redeeming or repurchasing our capital stock, subject to certain limited exceptions set forth in the agreements governing the bank facilities;\n\u2022\nmaking investments or acquisitions;\n\u2022\ncreating liens;\n\u2022\nselling assets;\n\u2022\nreceiving dividends or other payments to us;\n\u2022\nguaranteeing indebtedness;\n\u2022\nengaging in transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022\nconsolidating, merging or transferring all or substantially all our assets.\nWe also are required to comply with financial covenants regarding a maximum total leverage ratio, a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio and minimum regulatory net capital. These restrictions may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business. Our ability to comply with these restrictive covenants will depend on our future performance, which may be affected by events beyond our control.\nIf we violate any of these covenants and are unable to obtain waivers, we would be in default under the bank facilities or indenture and payment of our indebtedness could be accelerated. The acceleration of our indebtedness under one agreement may permit acceleration of indebtedness under other agreements that contain cross-default or cross-acceleration provisions. If our indebtedness is accelerated, we may not be able to repay that indebtedness or borrow sufficient funds to refinance it. Even if we are able to obtain new financing, it may not be on commercially reasonable terms or on terms that are acceptable to us. If our indebtedness is in default for any reason, our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nComplying with these covenants may also cause us to take actions that are not favorable to holders of our Class A common stock and may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete against companies that are not subject to such restrictions.\nIn addition, the approval of the majority of the outstanding Series B preferred stock and Series C convertible preferred stock is also required for us to (i) issue certain securities, including certain new series or additional shares of preferred stock; (ii) enter into certain affiliate transactions; and (iii) incur any indebtedness or guarantee with an aggregate value of more than 4.0 times LTM Adjusted EBITDA (as defined in the Series B COD and the Series C COD).\nOur ability to attract and retain qualified professionals is critical to our success.\nWe depend on the skills and expertise of the qualified professionals who work for us and our success depends on our ability to retain existing and attract new qualified professionals. The qualified professionals of our operating subsidiaries are generally direct, full-time employees of our operating subsidiaries. The professionals and senior marketing personnel of our operating subsidiaries have direct contact with our clients, financial advisors and retail broker-dealers, and with other key individuals, and the loss of these personnel could jeopardize those relationships and result in the loss of managed accounts. If we lose the services of any key personnel, we may not be able to manage and grow our operations effectively, enter new markets, develop new products or effectively integrate businesses we acquire, including the acquired businesses and any future acquisitions, into our operations.\nWe also anticipate that it will be necessary for us to hire additional professionals as we further diversify our products and strategies. Competition for employees with the requisite qualifications is intense and we may not be successful in our efforts to recruit and retain the required personnel. Our ability to retain and attract such personnel will depend heavily on the amount of compensation we can offer. Compensation levels in the securities industry are highly competitive. Consequently, our profitability could decline as we compete for personnel. An inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel could affect our ability to provide appropriate levels of service to our clients and hinder our ability to attract new clients, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRCS Capital Corporation and Subsidiaries\nDecember 31, 2014\nThe continued services of our executive officers and other key management personnel, including executive officers and senior managers of the acquired businesses, are critical to our success.\nWe depend on our executive officers and other key management personnel to manage our businesses. We have entered into agreements with certain of these individuals, including certain executive officers and senior managers of the acquired businesses, pursuant to which they have remained employed by us following the completion of the recent and pending acquisitions.\nTo the extent we depend on agreements to retain executive officers and other key management personnel, the agreements are terminable contracts and do not ensure that key executive officers and senior managers will remain employed by us for as long as their services would be beneficial to us. The loss of one or more of these individuals, and the failure to recruit a suitable replacement or replacements, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe announcement concerning certain accounting errors by ARCP has affected sales by RCAP of public, non-traded REITs sponsored directly or indirectly by American Realty Capital that are distributed by us and there can be no assurance that it will not continue to affect equity capital raised and have additional adverse impacts on our results of operations or the market price of our Class A common stock.\nOn October 29, 2014, ARCP announced that its audit committee had concluded that the previously issued financial statements and other financial information contained in certain public filings should no longer be relied upon. This conclusion was based on the preliminary findings of an investigation conducted by ARCP\u2019s audit committee which concluded that certain accounting errors were made by ARCP personnel that were not corrected after being discovered, resulting in an overstatement of adjusted funds from operations (\u201cAFFO\u201d) and an understatement of ARCP\u2019s net loss for the three and six months ended June 30, 2014. ARCP also announced the resignation of its chief accounting officer and its chief financial officer, who is a member of our controlling stockholder, RCAP Holdings, LLC (\u201cRCAP Holdings\u201d), and a member of American Realty Capital, and also served as our chief financial officer until December 2013. Such former chief financial officer also served as a member of our board of directors until July 2014, but he does not currently have a role in the management of our business. Although ARCP was previously sponsored by an entity under common control with RCAP Holdings and was advised by such entity until January 2014, ARCP is a separate company that is no longer sponsored or advised by an entity under common control with RCAP Holdings. The former executive chairman of our board of directors, who resigned on December 29, 2014, was the chairman of the board of directors of ARCP until his resignation on December 12, 2014.\nAs a result of the announcement concerning certain accounting errors by ARCP, a number of broker-dealer firms that had been participating in the distribution of offerings of public, non-traded REITs sponsored directly or indirectly by American Realty Capital that are distributed by us have temporarily suspended their participation in the distribution of those offerings and such suspensions have adversely impacted equity capital raised. Although certain of these broker-dealer firms have reinstated their participation in the distribution of our offerings, we cannot predict the length of time these temporary suspensions will continue, whether all such participating broker-dealers will reinstate their participation in the distribution of our offerings or whether there will be additional suspensions. While monthly equity capital raised has increased subsequent to the month after the announcement, equity capital raised subsequent to the announcement has declined in comparison to prior periods. Although the amount of the decline may have been affected by factors in addition to the ARCP announcement, such as absence of liquidity events and the stages of the offerings of individual direct investment programs, the ARCP announcement has had a material adverse effect on equity capital raised by direct investment programs distributed by us during this period, and, accordingly, has had an adverse impact on our results of operations for the period subsequent to the ARCP announcement.\nOn March 2, 2015, ARCP announced the completion of its audit committee\u2019s investigation and filed amendments to its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2013 and its Form 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2014 and June 30, 2014, which are available at the internet site maintained by the SEC, www.sec.gov. These amendments corrected errors in ARCP\u2019s financial statements and in its calculation of AFFO that resulted in overstatements of AFFO for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2012 and 2013 and the quarters ended March 31, 2013 and 2014 and June 30, 2014 and described certain results of its investigations, including matters relating to payments to, and transactions with, affiliates of American Realty Capital and certain equity awards to certain officers and directors. ARCP also disclosed that the SEC has commenced a formal investigation and that the United States Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York contacted counsel for both ARCP\u2019s audit committee and ARCP with respect to the matter.\nRCS Capital Corporation and Subsidiaries\nDecember 31, 2014\nWe received subpoenas requiring the production of certain documents and other materials relating to sales of certain non-traded REITs and similar products sponsored, co-sponsored or advised by American Realty Capital (\u201cARC Issuers\u201d). We complied with the subpoenas and intend to comply with any additional subpoenas received in the future. In addition, certain ARC Issuers have received inquiries from certain state securities regulators for information regarding their relationship with ARCP in connection with the annual qualification of such ARC Issuers\u2019 offerings under the state blue sky laws, which is required for the offerings to continue in such states. The ARC Issuers have responded and are continuing to respond to those inquiries. If such ARC Issuers are not successful in responding to these inquiries, it could delay or prevent the offering of securities of such ARC issuers in certain states.\nWe are also aware of two lawsuits, one filed in December 2014 and one filed in January 2015, which name us as a defendant and allege that we, and certain of our affiliates, made materially false and misleading public statements and violated the securities laws in connection with matters described above. We believe these lawsuits are without merit and intend to defend ourselves vigorously, but there can be no assurance that any such defense will be successful. See \u201cItem 3. Legal Proceedings.\u201d\nThere can be no assurance that the announcement concerning certain accounting errors by ARCP, the disclosures in ARCP\u2019s SEC filings on March 2, 2015 and any future related disclosures or events will not have additional adverse impact on equity capital raised by direct investment programs distributed by us, our results of operations or the market price of our Class A common stock. In addition, such events could affect the timing of the commencement of new offerings of direct investment programs sponsored, co-sponsored or advised by American Realty Capital and their demand for capital markets transactions and transaction services, which could materially adversely affect our revenues and results of operations.\nWe are subject to various risks associated with the securities industry.\nWe are subject to uncertainties that are common in the securities industry. These uncertainties include but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nthe volatility of domestic and international financial, bond and stock markets;\n\u2022\nextensive governmental and industry regulation;\n\u2022\nlitigation;\n\u2022\nexposure to significant legal liability;\n\u2022\nintense competition;\n\u2022\nsubstantial fluctuations in the volume and price level of securities; and\n\u2022\ndependence on the solvency of various third parties.\nAs a result, revenues and earnings may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and from year to year. In periods of low volume, profitability is impaired, because certain expenses remain relatively fixed. In the event of a market downturn, our business could be adversely affected in many ways. Our revenues are likely to decline in such circumstances and, if we are unable to reduce expenses at the same pace, our profit margins would erode.\nOur business and profitability could be adversely affected by downturns and volatility in the financial markets.\nOur business is materially affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally, both in the United States and elsewhere around the world. Many factors or events could lead to a breakdown or deterioration in the financial markets including war, terrorism, political uncertainty, natural catastrophes and other types of disasters, rising interest rates, the rate of inflation, currency exchange rates, changes in the regulatory environment or other factors or events. These types of events could cause people to begin to lose confidence in the financial markets and their ability to function effectively. If the financial markets are unable to effectively prepare for these types of events and ease public concern over their ability to function, our revenues are likely to decline and our operations are likely to be adversely affected. Difficult market and economic conditions, the level and volatility of interest rates, investor sentiment and political events have in the past adversely affected and may in the future adversely affect our business and profitability in many ways.\nUnfavorable financial or economic conditions may reduce the number and size of the transactions in which we provide underwriting services, mergers and acquisitions consulting and other services. Our investment banking revenues, in the form of financial advisory, placement agent and underwriting fees, are directly related to the number and size of the transactions in which we participate and would therefore be adversely affected by a sustained market downturn. Additionally, a downturn in market conditions could lead to a decline in the volume of transactions that we execute for our clients and that our financial advisors execute on behalf of their clients and, therefore, to a decline in the revenues we receive from commissions and spreads. Lower securities price levels may also result in a reduced volume of transactions and lower levels of assets under management and assets under administration, any of which could adversely affect our business and profitability.\nRCS Capital Corporation and Subsidiaries\nDecember 31, 2014\nDemand for investment products, such as direct investment programs and mutual funds, is materially affected by conditions in the global financial markets and economic conditions throughout the world. A decrease in the demand for investment products also could adversely affect our business and profitability.\nWe face competition from other financial firms.\nWe compete directly with national and regional full-service broker-dealers and a broad range of other financial services firms, including banks, asset management companies, investment advisers, insurance companies and brokerage and investment banking firms. Competition has increased as smaller securities firms have either ceased doing business or have been acquired by or merged into other firms. Mergers and acquisitions have increased competition from these firms, many of which have significantly greater financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we do. Many of these firms offer their clients more products and services than we do. These competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or changing opportunities, technologies and client requirements. These competitors may have lower costs or provide more services, and they may offer their clients more favorable commissions, fees or other terms than those offered by us.\nOur exposure to legal liability is significant, and damages and other costs that we may be required to pay in connection with litigation and regulatory inquiries, and the reputational harm that could result from legal action against us, could adversely affect our businesses.\nWe face significant legal risks in connection with our businesses and, in recent years, the volume of claims and amount of damages sought in litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial services businesses have been increasing. We face potential liability under securities and other laws for, among other things, materially false or misleading statements made in connection with securities offerings or other transactions, employment claims, as well as potential liability in connection with the provision of advice to participants in strategic transactions. Moreover, our role as advisor to clients on important underwriting or mergers and acquisitions transactions involves complex analysis and the exercise of professional judgment. These activities may subject us to the risk of significant legal liability to our clients and aggrieved third parties, including our clients\u2019 stockholders who could bring securities class action suits against us. We could also become subject to claims or legal proceedings alleging that we have infringed or misappropriated intellectual property or other proprietary rights of others. We are also subject to claims, litigation and regulatory proceedings involving our Retail Firms resulting from, among other things, alleged and actual errors and omissions, breach of fiduciary or other duties owed to clients, misconduct in effecting securities transactions, rendering investment advice or placing insurance, and criminal misconduct. See \u201c-Risks Related to Our Retail Firms- We are exposed to significant legal liabilities from the operations of our Retail Firms.\u201d\nThere is also a risk that our employees could engage in misconduct that adversely affects our business. It is not always possible to deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in all cases. If our employees engage in misconduct, our ability to attract and retain clients could be impaired and subjecting us to significant legal liability and reputational harm.\nThere can be no assurance that indemnities and other provisions to limit our exposure to legal claims relating to our services will protect us or be enforceable in all cases. As a result, we may incur significant legal and other expenses in defending against litigation and may be required to pay substantial damages for settlements and adverse judgments.\nSubstantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against any of our businesses could harm our results of operations or harm our reputation, which could adversely affect our business and prospects.\nInternet and internal computer systems failures and degradations could harm our business.\nA portion of our business is conducted through the Internet and through our internal computer system, either of which could experience system failures and degradations in the future due to circumstances beyond our control, which include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nhuman error;\n\u2022\nsubsystem, component or software failure;\n\u2022\na power or telecommunications failure;\n\u2022\nan earthquake, fire, or other natural disaster or act of God;\n\u2022\nhacker attacks or other intentional acts of vandalism; or\n\u2022\nacts of terror or war.\nAny of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAny of these events could also interfere with our ability to comply with financial reporting and other regulatory requirements, exposing us to potential disciplinary action by regulators.\nRCS Capital Corporation and Subsidiaries\nDecember 31, 2014\nSecurity breaches of our systems, or those of our clients, our financial advisors or third parties, may subject us to significant liability and damage our reputation.\nOur businesses involve the storage and transmission of our clients\u2019 and our financial advisors\u2019 clients proprietary information. The secure storage and transmission of confidential information over public networks is a critical element of our operations. Cyber attacks on our systems or the systems of our financial advisors or third-party service providers could expose us to a risk of misappropriation of this information, leading to litigation and possible liability. If our security measures are breached as a result of third-party action, employee error, malfeasance or otherwise, and, as a result, someone obtains unauthorized access to confidential information, our reputation could be damaged, our business may suffer and we could incur significant liability. Any such breach could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed, publicly disclosed, lost or stolen. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or to sabotage computer systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures.\nA cyber attack or security breach on our system or that of a financial advisor or a third-party service provider could manifest in different ways and could lead to any number of harmful consequences, including but not limited to:\n\u2022misappropriation of financial assets, intellectual property or sensitive information belonging to us, our clients, our financial advisors, our financial advisors\u2019 clients or our third-party service providers;\n\u2022corruption of data or causing operational disruption through computer viruses or phishing; and\n\u2022denial of service attacks to prevent users from accessing our platform.\nOur remediation costs and lost revenues could be significant if we fall victim to a cyber attack. We may be required to expend significant resources to repair system damage, protect against the threat of future security breaches or to alleviate problems, including reputational harm, loss of clients and revenues and litigation, caused by any breaches. At this time our cyber insurance only covers the Cetera broker-dealers. We are in the process of expanding this coverage to the rest of the Retail Firms. Security breaches could also result in and could subject us to significant liability or loss that may not be covered by insurance, actions by regulators, damage to our reputation, or a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could harm our business. We also may be found liable for any stolen assets or misappropriated confidential information. Although we intend to continue to implement industry-standard security measures, we cannot assure you that those measures will be sufficient.\nOur risk management policies and procedures, and the risk management policies and procedures of certain third parties, may leave us exposed to unidentified risks or an unanticipated level of risk.\nThe policies and procedures we employ to identify, monitor and manage risks may not be fully effective. Some methods of risk management are based on the use of observed historical market behavior. As a result, these methods may not accurately predict future risk exposures, which could be significantly greater than the historical measures indicate. Other risk management methods depend on evaluation of information regarding markets, clients or other matters that are publicly available or otherwise accessible by us. This information may not be accurate, complete, up-to-date or properly evaluated. Management of operational, legal and regulatory risks requires, among other things, policies and procedures to properly record and verify a large number of transactions and events. There can be no assurance that our policies and procedures will effectively and accurately record and verify this information.\nAlthough we have not previously experienced significant or material losses to date due to gaps in our risk management policies and procedures, our ability to manage risk exposure can never be completely or accurately predicted or fully assured. For example, unexpectedly large or rapid movements or disruptions in one or more financial markets or other unforeseen developments could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, although the agreements that we enter into with third-party selling group members in connection with our wholesale distribution business require them to certify that they have implemented their own appropriate risk management policies and procedures, we do not independently review those third-party selling group members\u2019 risk management policies and procedures or supervise their management of their financial advisors. Similarly, our transfer agent business utilizes a third-party vendor to perform back-office transfer agency functions. Although the services agreement between our transfer agent and the third-party vendor establishes minimum standards of performance for the vendor, including a requirement to implement risk management policies and procedures, we do not review these risk management policies and procedures.\nOur risk management policies and procedures may not identify potential risks in the operations of our distribution partners or third-party vendors that could impact our business. Our registered broker-dealer and investment adviser subsidiaries are engaged in the sale of products, such as insurance products, including annuities and life insurance, or the provision of financial advice related to such products, and significant risk management and supervisory systems and controls and surveillance protocols are in place for the oversight of these activities. To the extent that our systems and controls are ineffective in assuring compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations, we could be exposed to significant regulatory or other sanctions.\nRCS Capital Corporation and Subsidiaries\nDecember 31, 2014\nOur risk management policies and procedures also monitor operational, legal and regulatory risk of the acquired businesses, which continue to operate independently under separate brands and management, and our financial advisors, most of whom operate through independent offices. This decentralization in our management and operations presents additional challenges to our risk management policies and procedures, which may not be fully effective or adequate to address the challenges we face and prevent material loss.\nIf we do not continue to develop and enhance our services in a timely manner, our business may be harmed.\nOur future success will depend on our ability to develop and enhance our services and add new services. There are significant risks in the development of new or enhanced services, including the risk that we will be unable to effectively use new technologies, adapt our services to emerging industry or regulatory standards or market new or enhanced services.\nIf we are unable to develop and introduce new or enhanced services quickly enough to respond to market or client requirements or to comply with emerging industry standards, including regulatory standards, or if these services do not achieve market acceptance, our business could be seriously harmed.\nRisks Related to Our Retail Firms\nAny decrease in assets under administration or assets under management may decrease our revenue.\nManagement fees are primarily based on assets under management. The results of operations of our Retail Firms also depend on our level of assets under administration. Assets under management and assets under administration balances are impacted by both the flow of client assets in and out of accounts and changes in market values. Poor investment performance by financial products and financial advisors could result in reduced levels of assets under management or administration or a loss of managed accounts and could result in reputational damage that could make it more difficult to attract new investors. If our Retail Firms experience a reduction in assets under administration or assets under management, our revenues may decline.\nOur Retail Firms face significant competition for financial advisors.\nIf our Retail Firms fail to attract new financial advisors or to retain and motivate existing financial advisors, our results of operations may suffer. The market for experienced and productive financial advisors is highly competitive, and significant resources must be devoted to attracting and retaining the most qualified financial advisors. If our Retail Firms are not successful in retaining highly qualified financial advisors, they may not be able to retain their clients or recover the expense associated with attracting and training financial advisors. They also may be unable to recruit suitable replacements. A loss of a materially large group of financial advisors (measured based on either number of financial advisors or assets under administration) could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nFinancial advisors face significant competition for their clients.\nPoor service by our financial advisors, or poor performance of financial products offered by our financial advisors, could result in the loss of managed accounts. In addition, we must monitor the pricing of services and financial products we offer in relation to competitors and periodically may need to adjust commission and fee schedules to remain competitive. Competitive pressures on the pricing of services or products can cause clients to shift their accounts and investments to a different financial advisor or financial product. The development and increased adoption of alternatives to the services provided by financial advisors, such as automated or computerized wealth management services that provide asset allocation strategies and other financial advice, could also exert competitive pricing pressure on us and affect the demand for the services provided by our financial advisors. If we experience losses of managed accounts for any reason, or fail to attract new ones, our revenues would decline.\nOur Retail Firms\u2019 relationships with sponsors of financial products may be disrupted.\nOur Retail Firms have relationships with most of the leading industry sponsors of financial and insurance products pursuant to selling agreements, including strategic partnership arrangements, that may be terminated upon notice. These relationships are driven by many factors, such as our ability to facilitate sufficient sales volume through their distribution networks, and can be damaged for many reasons. For example, it is possible that our ownership and control of a wholesale distribution business and the fact that we are under common ownership and control with American Realty Capital could create the perception that our financial advisors favor products sponsored by American Realty Capital over products sponsored by other sponsors, which could affect the willingness of other sponsors to enter into, or maintain existing, selling agreements with the Retail Firms.\nAny loss or damages to a relationship with a product sponsor for any reason, resulting in termination of a selling agreement or otherwise, could adversely affect our Retail Firms.\nRCS Capital Corporation and Subsidiaries\nDecember 31, 2014\nOur Retail Firms compete based on highly specialized and, in many cases, proprietary technologies that are difficult and costly to maintain.\nHighly specialized and, in many cases, proprietary technologies are required to support certain essential operational functions of our Retail Firms, including portfolio management, client service, accounting and internal financial processes and controls, and regulatory compliance and reporting. These technology platforms also are necessary to enable our Retail Firms to serve the needs of, and attract, financial advisors and enable them to serve the needs of their clients. Moreover, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and should enable our Retail Firms to reduce costs. There can be no assurance that we will be able to effectively adopt or develop new or adapt existing technologies to meet client, industry and regulatory demands made upon our Retail Firms, and any failure to do so could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nMoreover, we might be required to make significant capital expenditures to maintain competitive technology and retain skilled information technology employees, although there can also be no assurance that we will retain such skilled information technology employees or that our investments in staff and technology will successfully meet the needs of financial advisors and their clients. Additionally, if the emergence of new industry standards and practices render our existing systems obsolete or uncompetitive, any upgrades or expansions may also require significant expenditures of funds and may also cause us to suffer system degradations, outages and failures. If our technology systems were to fail and we were unable to recover in a timely way, we might be unable to fulfill critical business functions, which could lead to a loss of financial advisors and their clients and could harm our business reputation. A technological breakdown could also interfere with our ability to comply with financial reporting and other regulatory requirements, exposing us to disciplinary action and to liability to our financial advisors and their clients.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to establish or maintain a competitive advantage based on our technology.\nA change in the \u201cindependent contractor\u201d status of financial advisors could adversely affect us.\nOur Retail Firms rely on the treatment of financial advisors as independent contractors. Financial advisors operate from their own offices and are responsible in large part for the costs and expenses involved in their operations. A determination that the financial advisors are not independent contractors or the enactment of any legislation that would affect the eligibility requirements for independent contractor status could have a significant effect on this business model and lead to additional costs and expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on our Retail Firms and our results of operations.\nWe are exposed to significant legal liabilities from the operations of our Retail Firms.\nWe are subject to claims, litigation and regulatory proceedings involving our Retail Firms resulting from, among other things, alleged and actual errors and omissions, breach of fiduciary or other duties owed to clients, misconduct in effecting securities transactions, rendering investment advice or placing insurance, and criminal misconduct.\nBases for such legal liability could include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\nrecommending transactions that are not suitable for the client or in the client\u2019s best interests;\n\u2022\nengaging in unauthorized or excessive trading to the detriment of clients;\n\u2022\nengaging in \u201creverse churning\u201d by placing clients who trade infrequently in fee-based rather than commission-based accounts;\n\u2022\nengaging in fraudulent or otherwise improper activity;\n\u2022\nbinding us to transactions that exceed authorized limits;\n\u2022\nhiding unauthorized or unsuccessful activities, resulting in unknown and unmanaged risks or losses;\n\u2022\ntheft, bribery or other criminal activities;\n\u2022\nimproperly using or disclosing confidential information;\n\u2022\nfailure, whether negligent or intentional, to effect securities transactions on behalf of clients;\n\u2022\nfailure to perform reasonable diligence on a security, product or strategy;\n\u2022\nfailure to supervise a financial advisor;\n\u2022\nfailure to provide insurance carriers with complete and accurate information; or\n\u2022\notherwise not complying with regulatory requirements or control procedures.\nThe nature of some of the matters, the aggregate volume of claims and potential damages and penalties resulting from these claims, litigation and regulatory proceedings could have an adverse impact our business and financial condition and could cause us serious reputational harm. Defending against such claims, litigation and regulatory proceedings may also involve significant defense costs.\nRCS Capital Corporation and Subsidiaries\nDecember 31, 2014\nMisconduct and errors by employees and financial advisors, who operate in a decentralized environment, could harm our Retail Firms.\nOur Retail Firms generally operate through small, decentralized offices, largely with financial advisors who are not direct employees. We will not always be able to prevent misconduct (intentional or otherwise) or errors by financial advisors, and the precautions taken to prevent and detect these activities may not be effective in all cases. SEC and FINRA rules require our broker-dealer subsidiaries and our investment adviser subsidiaries to supervise the activities of their financial advisors. However, a substantial number of the offices are supervised by registered principals off-site, which may make supervision more challenging.\nMisconduct (intentional or otherwise) or errors by our financial advisors, either as affects their clients or otherwise, and any failure to adequately supervise them, could subject us to liability and result in violations of law, regulatory sanctions, damage awards, limitations on activities or other serious reputational or financial harm to us.\nWe are largely dependent on Pershing LLC to provide clearing services.\nA majority of our financial advisors rely on Pershing LLC to provide clearing services, as well as other operational and support functions that they cannot provide internally, pursuant to an agreement we entered into with Pershing LLC in September 2014. If this agreement were terminated, there can be no assurance that the functions previously provided could be replaced on comparable economic terms and, depending on the circumstances, we could be required to pay a termination fee to Pershing LLC, which could be substantial. Some of our Retail Firms also have agreements with other third-party clearing brokers which provide similar clearance and custody services.\nFurthermore, in accordance with industry practice, these agreements require our broker-dealer subsidiaries acting as introducing brokers to indemnify Pershing LLC and other third-party clearing brokers against losses from unsettled securities transactions by customers. Because we are liable to the extent of the net losses on any unsettled trades, we are required to post a clearing deposit with Pershing LLC and other third-party clearing brokers. However, there can be no assurance that the amount of any indemnified loss would not exceed the amount of any clearing deposit. Furthermore, in periods of extreme market volatility, it is possible that there could be an increase in the number of unsettled trades, which could cause the loss of any clearing deposit as well as additional amounts.\nA failure to preserve the reputations for independence of the acquired businesses could adversely affect our Retail Firms.\nThe preservation of the reputations for independence of our Retail Firms is important to our future success. Following the completion of their acquisitions by us, our Retail Firms, and any companies engaged in a similar business we may acquire in the future, continue to be operated independently under separate brands and management, subject to our oversight. Currently, our Retail Firms, and any companies engaged in a similar business we may acquire in the future, offer interests in direct investment programs and other products sponsored by American Realty Capital, and we expect they will continue to do so. There is a risk that continuing, or increasing, the level of sales of American Realty Capital products following acquisition by us could affect our Retail Firms\u2019 reputations for independence, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur multi-brand strategy may not be successful.\nOur Retail Firms were independent businesses prior to their acquisitions by us, and they have continued to operate independently under a variety of different brands as part of our multi-brand strategy to allow us to preserve the value of their brands. We believe that broader recognition and positive perception of these multiple brands individually, as well as collectively under the \u201cCetera Financial Group\u201d brand, are essential to our future success. Our successful positioning of our brands depends in large part on the success of our advertising and promotional efforts and our ability to continue to provide products and services that are useful to our clients. Accordingly, we have pursued, and intend to continue to pursue, an aggressive brand enhancement strategy, which includes multimedia advertising, promotional programs and public relations activities. These initiatives have required and may continue to require significant expenditures. If our multi-brand strategy is unsuccessful, these expenses may never be recovered. Any failure of our other marketing efforts could also have an adverse impact on us.\nThe securities settlement process exposes us to risks that may expose our advisors and us to adverse movements in price.\nCetera Financial Institutions, one of our broker-dealer subsidiaries, is a self-clearing broker-dealer that provides clearing services and trade processing for certain financial institutions. Broker-dealers that clear and settle trades are subject to substantial regulatory requirements relating to these functions. Errors in performing clearing functions, including clerical, technological and other errors related to the handling of customer funds and securities, could lead to censures, fines or other sanctions by regulatory authorities as well as liability and losses in related lawsuits or other proceedings brought by our advisors\u2019 clients and others. Any unsettled securities transactions or erroneous transactions could expose us to adverse movements in the prices of such securities.\nRCS Capital Corporation and Subsidiaries\nDecember 31, 2014\nRisks Related to Wholesale Distribution and Our Other Businesses\nA significant portion of the revenues of our wholesale distribution and other businesses are derived from American Realty Capital, which is under common control with us, and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our long-term strategy of expanding our service offerings to clients other than American Realty Capital.\n$658.8 million of the $681.6 million in wholesale distribution revenues generated by us in 2014 (including the results of StratCap following the completion of the acquisition and excluding Hatteras which is part of the investment management segment) resulted from equity capital raised by direct investment programs or other entities sponsored, co-sponsored or advised by American Realty Capital, which is controlled, directly or indirectly, by Messrs. Schorsch and Kahane (who also, directly or indirectly, control RCAP Holdings and RCS Capital Management, LLC (\u201cRCS Capital Management\u201d), the company that provides strategic planning and consulting services to assist us and our subsidiaries in implementing our business strategies, subject to oversight, directly or indirectly, by our board of directors) and accounted for 31.0% of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2014. In addition, $104.0 million of the $126.7 million in revenues in 2014 from our investment banking, capital markets, transaction management and transfer agency businesses were derived from direct investment programs or other entities sponsored, co-sponsored or advised by American Realty Capital.\nA key component of our long-term business strategy is to expand our wholesale distribution, investment banking, capital markets, transaction management services and transfer agency businesses to sponsors and other participants in the management and sale of direct investment programs other than programs sponsored by American Realty Capital. There can be no assurance that this strategy will be successful. Other direct investment program sponsors may not want to retain us for a variety of reasons, including our common ownership with American Realty Capital and the fact that we may be competing with affiliates, including broker-dealer affiliates, of the other sponsors. If we fail to increase or diversify our market share of direct investment programs, our results of operations and future prospects may be adversely affected.\nAs a result of our dependence upon revenue derived from American Realty Capital, any adverse impact on the revenue and other results of operations of American Realty Capital would have an adverse impact on our revenue and other results of operations.\nWe rely on direct investment programs for a significant portion of our revenues.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2014, a significant portion of our revenues were derived from investment banking, transaction management and transfer agency services provided to direct investment programs, wholesale distribution of equity securities of direct investment programs and retail distribution of equity securities of direct investment programs, and it is anticipated that a substantial portion of our revenues will continue to be derived from direct investment programs in the future. Many factors and events, particularly increased regulatory scrutiny and rising interest rates, may have an adverse impact on the performance of direct investment programs.\nRecent scrutiny from FINRA, the SEC and state securities regulators has caused, and could continue to cause, negative publicity about direct investment programs. In recent years, various actions that have been taken against direct investment programs, none of which involved us or our affiliates, have received substantial publicity, much of it negative. In addition, the SEC and FINRA issued bulletins in 2011 and 2012, respectively, urging investors to conduct careful reviews before investing in non-traded REITs, which have also generated negative publicity.\nAs with other yield-oriented securities, shares of direct investment programs, particularly those marketed to \u201cmass affluent\u201d investors, who we believe seek products with \u201cdurable income\u201d characteristics, are impacted by their level of distributions to their stockholders. The distribution rate is often used by investors to compare and rank similar yield-oriented securities for investment decision-making purposes. Changes in interest rates, either positive or negative, may affect the level of distributions that direct investment programs may make and influence the decisions of investors who are considering investing in their securities. A rising interest rate environment, could have an adverse impact on the demand for direct investment programs, their ability to issue additional equity and the cost to them of any such issuance. A rising interest rate environment could also adversely affect the relative attractiveness of direct investment programs to existing and potential investors as compared to other investments with returns that would be expected to benefit from rising interest rates.\nIn addition to negative publicity due to regulatory scrutiny and the impact of rising interest rates, our exposure to direct investment programs leaves us vulnerable to adverse developments including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\na reduction in the popularity of direct investment programs among retail investors or financial advisors;\n\u2022\ncontinued or increasing negative publicity concerning non-traded REITs due to reasons other than regulatory scrutiny;\n\u2022\nchanges in tax law;\n\u2022\nincreased, costly or burdensome regulation from the SEC, state securities regulators or FINRA; and\n\u2022\nmalfeasance by sponsors, wholesale distributors or retail distributors of direct investment programs, including by our competitors.\nRCS Capital Corporation and Subsidiaries\nDecember 31, 2014\nAn adverse development relating to direct investment programs for these or any other reason could reduce our sources of revenue and negatively impact the market price of our Class A common stock.\nIn addition, state securities regulators require that investors in direct investment programs meet certain minimum income and/or net worth standards. These standards may vary from state to state and change frequently. Changes to suitability standards may require us to expend resources familiarizing ourselves, as well as the financial advisors with whom we do business, with the new standards. If a financial advisor does not ensure that customers satisfy the requirements with regards to suitability standards, we could be subject to substantial liability, including fines, penalties and possibly rescission of transactions.\nAlong with suitability requirements, state regulators have also imposed limitations on an investor\u2019s exposure to direct investment programs. The breadth and scope of these limitations have varied considerably and may operate to limit the exposure that a resident of a certain state has to a product, sponsor or direct investment programs generally. These concentration limitations have been applied with increasing frequency and have increasingly targeted all direct investment programs.\nRealty Capital Securities and StratCap are subject to risks that are particular to the role as dealer manager for direct investment program offerings.\nIn connection with their role as dealer manager for direct investment program offerings, Realty Capital Securities and StratCap provide substantial promotional support to the broker-dealers selling a particular offering, including by providing sales literature, forums, webinars, press releases and other forms of mass communication. Due to the volume of materials that Realty Capital Securities and StratCap may provide throughout the course of an offering, much of which may be scrutinized by regulators, Realty Capital Securities and StratCap may be exposed to significant liability under federal and state securities laws, and subject to fines by the SEC, FINRA and state securities regulators, or even suspension from the securities industry.\nWe face significant competition for wholesalers.\nWe are dependent upon our employees, whom we refer to as our wholesalers, who are responsible for promoting sales of products for which we serve as dealer-manager and recruiting new retail broker-dealers and registered investment advisers to sell our products. We are exposed to the risk that our wholesalers could leave or decide to affiliate with one of our competitors and that we would be unable to recruit suitable replacements. A loss of a large group of wholesalers could have a material adverse impact on our wholesale distribution business.\nRealty Capital Securities, StratCap and Hatteras are prohibited from raising money for U.S. Net Lease REITs sponsored by American Realty Capital.\nDuring 2013 and 2014, 35.3% and 0.1%, respectively, of equity capital raised by non-traded REITs distributed by us consisted of sales of interests in those non-traded REITs with a primary investment strategy of investing in U.S. single-tenant, net-leased properties (\u201cU.S. Net Lease REITs\u201d), sponsored by American Realty Capital. In connection with the merger between ARCP and Cole Real Estate Investments, Inc. (\u201cCole\u201d), American Realty Capital and Nicholas Schorsch, our former executive chairman and one of the controlling members of our controlling stockholder, agreed that neither American Realty Capital nor any of its affiliates, which include Realty Capital Securities, StratCap and Hatteras, would be permitted to sponsor or raise capital for any U.S. Net Lease REITs sponsored by American Realty Capital. Mr. Schorsch and other persons affiliated with American Realty Capital are former directors and executive officers of ARCP.\nAlthough this restriction does not prohibit Realty Capital Securities, StratCap and Hatteras from raising money for U.S. Net Lease REITs that are not affiliates of American Realty Capital, Mr. Schorsch or any of their affiliates, there can be no assurance that Realty Capital Securities, StratCap and Hatteras will be able to sell interests in other types of REITs or U.S. Net Lease REITs sponsored by unaffiliated sponsors to replace the loss of sales in U.S. Net Lease REITs sponsored by American Realty Capital.\nWe are exposed to risks due to our investment banking activities.\nParticipation in an underwriting syndicate or a selling group involves both economic and regulatory risks. An underwriter may incur losses if it is unable to resell the securities it is committed to purchase, or if it is forced to liquidate its commitment at less than the purchase price. In addition, under the federal securities laws and other laws relating to underwriters\u2019 liability and limitations on the indemnification of underwriters by issuers, an underwriter is subject to substantial potential liability for misstatements or omissions of material facts in prospectuses and other communications with respect to offerings. Acting as a managing underwriter increases these risks. Underwriting commitments constitute a charge against net capital and our ability to make underwriting commitments may be limited by the requirement that our broker-dealer subsidiaries must at all times be in compliance with the net capital rule.\nRCS Capital Corporation and Subsidiaries\nDecember 31, 2014\nProviding transaction management services involves providing services that meet the legal needs of our clients and, as a result, we are subject to a variety of complex and evolving laws and regulations.\nProviding transaction management services involves providing services that meet the legal needs of our clients, which may subject us to allegations of unauthorized practice of law (\u201cUPL\u201d). UPL generally refers to an entity or person giving legal advice who is not licensed to practice law. However, laws and regulations defining UPL, and the governing bodies that enforce UPL rules, differ among the various jurisdictions in which we operate. We are unable to acquire a license to practice law in the United States, or employ licensed attorneys to provide legal advice to our clients, because we do not meet the regulatory requirement of being exclusively owned by licensed attorneys. We also may be subject to laws and regulations that govern business transactions between attorneys and non-attorneys, including those related to the ethics of attorney fee-splitting and the corporate practice of law. We may incur costs associated with responding to, defending and settling proceedings related to UPL, and the provision of our services more generally. We can give no assurance that we would prevail in such regulatory inquiries, claims, suits or prosecutions on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Responding to, defending and/or settling regulatory inquiries, claims, suits and prosecutions may be time consuming and divert management and financial resources or have other adverse effects on our business. A negative outcome in any of these proceedings may result in changes to or discontinuance of some of our services, potential liabilities or additional costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and future prospects.\nHatteras may be affected by the poor investment performance of the mutual funds it sponsors.\nHatteras is dependent on the performance of the mutual funds it sponsors, which can be adversely impacted by many factors, including general market conditions or underperformance relative to competitors or benchmarks, any of which may decrease sales and increase redemptions. If Hatteras experiences a reduction in assets under management, our revenues may decline.\nMoreover, because the Hatteras closed-end fund is a fund of funds, which means it generally invests its assets in underlying investment funds, the performance of the fund is affected by the performance of the underlying investment funds, which are outside our control. There can be no assurance that asset allocation of Hatteras or the performance of the underlying investment funds will be successful. Anything that adversely affects the investment funds of Hatteras could adversely affect our results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Acquisitions\nIntegration of the acquired businesses or any future acquisitions into our business will be challenging and difficult, and we may be unable to profitably operate the acquired businesses and realize the expected benefits of the recent and pending acquisitions or any future acquisitions.\nOur success depends in large part on our success in integrating the operations, strategies, technologies and personnel of the acquired businesses. We may fail to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of the recent and pending acquisitions or any future acquisitions if the integration process takes longer or is more costly than expected or otherwise fails to meet our expectations. In addition, the overall integration of the acquired businesses is a time-consuming and expensive process that could significantly disrupt the operations of our businesses, including the operations of the acquired businesses, even if it is effectively and efficiently planned and implemented, particularly given the size of the acquired businesses relative to our size prior to the initiation of the recent and pending acquisitions and the fact that we have made multiple acquisitions in a short period of time.\nPotential difficulties and challenges we may encounter in the integration process include the following:\n\u2022\nthe integration of management teams, strategies, technologies and operations, products and services;\n\u2022\nthe disruption of ongoing businesses and distraction of our management team and the management teams of the acquired businesses from ongoing business concerns;\n\u2022\nthe creation of a need for additional compliance, documentation, risk management and internal control procedures, which could involve the hiring of additional personnel to develop, implement and monitor the effectiveness of such procedures;\n\u2022\ndevelopment and implementation of public company internal control systems for our acquired companies, most of which were previously private enterprises;\n\u2022\nadjustments or revisions in the allocated value of corporate assets (whether tangible or intangible) of acquired business;\n\u2022\nthe retention of clients, key employees, and financial advisors of our business, the acquired businesses or any future acquisitions;\n\u2022\nthe maintenance of an appropriate level of compliance and operational oversight over the acquired businesses, which continue to operate independently under separate brands and management following their acquisitions by us, and financial advisors, who continue to operate through small and decentralized branch offices;\n\u2022\nthe creation of uniform standards, controls, procedures, policies and information systems appropriate for a public company;\nRCS Capital Corporation and Subsidiaries\nDecember 31, 2014\n\u2022\nthe consolidation and rationalization of information technology platforms and administrative infrastructures;\n\u2022\nthe integration of corporate cultures and acquired management teams and maintenance of employee morale;\n\u2022\nthe integration of accounting, human resources and other administrative systems, and coordination of trading, sales and marketing functions; and\n\u2022\nthe realization of anticipated synergies and cost savings expected from integrating the acquired businesses and any future acquisitions in our business.\nIntegration difficulties, or any other factors that make operating the acquired businesses or our other businesses more challenging following the completion of the recent and pending acquisitions, may prevent us from realizing the benefits from the recent and pending acquisitions or any future acquisitions to the extent, or in the time frame, anticipated by us. We have incurred, and expect to continue incurring, substantial expenses related to the recent and pending acquisitions. These transaction and integration expenses could, particularly in the near term, exceed the savings and synergies that we expect to achieve from the elimination of duplicative expenses and the realization of economies of scale and cost savings related to the integration of the acquired businesses following the completion of the recent and pending acquisitions. Any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition or cash flows.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be successful in pursuing our long-term strategy of expanding into complementary businesses or manage our growth effectively.\nWe have significantly expanded our operations during 2014 through the recent and pending acquisitions as part of our long-term strategy to expand into complementary businesses. It is also anticipated that we will continue pursuing this strategy through additional acquisitions.\nThis recent growth, and any future growth if it occurs through the completion of future complementary acquisitions or otherwise, will place significant demands on our management\u2019s attention, infrastructure and other resources. There are many factors that may also prevent us from profitably operating the acquired businesses and realizing the expected benefits of the recent and pending acquisitions or any future acquisitions:\n\u2022\nthe substantial debt and preferred equity we incurred and issued to finance the recent and pending acquisitions, and any financing of any future acquisitions we obtain, may limit our ability to deploy capital for other purposes;\n\u2022\nour failure to successfully further develop the acquired businesses or any future acquisitions;\n\u2022\nharm to the key business relationships, brands and reputations of the acquired businesses and our other businesses;\n\u2022\nlitigation in connection with the activities of the acquired businesses or any future acquisitions, including claims from terminated employees, customers, former stockholders or other third parties;\n\u2022\ncosts necessary to establish and maintain effective internal controls for the acquired businesses or any future acquisitions; and\n\u2022\nincreased fixed costs.\nIf we do not effectively manage our growth we may not be able to meet the needs of our clients and our financial advisors, which could adversely affect our revenues and operations.\nTo the extent we pursue additional acquisitions, uncertainty regarding whether or not they will be completed may adversely affect our businesses and the businesses to be acquired.\nAny additional acquisitions we make will be conditioned on certain closing conditions, and there can be no assurance that such acquisitions will be completed on a timely basis, or at all. In particular, any transaction involving a change in ownership or control of a broker-dealer likely would require an application to FINRA for approval of such change of ownership or control and that approval might not be granted. Accordingly, we may not be able to consummate acquisition transactions requiring FINRA approval that we negotiate in the future. Moreover, FINRA may restrict any proposed business expansion by either an acquisition candidate or one of our existing broker-dealer subsidiaries, further inhibiting our growth opportunities.\nStockholder litigation may also delay or disrupt the completion of future pending acquisitions. Stockholders of certain of the acquired businesses filed two lawsuits related to the recent and pending acquisitions, both of which were settled, and additional lawsuits may be filed challenging the recent and pending acquisitions or any future acquisitions, which name or may name us as a defendant. An adverse judgment in a lawsuit challenging any of our acquisitions may prevent such acquisition from becoming effective within the expected timeframe, or at all, or may subject us to monetary damages. Whether or not any plaintiffs\u2019 claims are successful, this type of litigation is often expensive and diverts management\u2019s attention and resources, which could adversely affect the operation of our business.\nRCS Capital Corporation and Subsidiaries\nDecember 31, 2014\nUncertainty regarding whether or not any future acquisition we enter into will be completed may inhibit our ability to fully execute our growth strategy or otherwise adversely affect our businesses and any businesses we seek to acquire. Moreover, if any future acquisition is not completed on a timely basis, or at all, we may not realize the expected benefits from such acquisition, which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nThe recent and pending acquisitions may expose us to unknown liabilities.\nWe are, or will be, subject to all of the liabilities of the acquired businesses, other than certain liabilities not assumed pursuant to the agreements related to the recent and pending acquisitions. If there are unknown liabilities or other obligations, including contingent liabilities, our business could be materially affected.\nMoreover, we do not have the right to be indemnified under all of the agreements related to the recent and pending acquisitions, and, to the extent there is indemnification against such losses and liabilities in certain of the agreements, the amount of such indemnification is limited and may not be sufficient to cover the actual losses we may suffer.\nRegulatory Risks\nExtensive or frequent changes in regulations could adversely affect our business.\nThe financial services industry is subject to extensive and frequently changing regulatory requirements under federal and state laws and regulations and self-regulatory organization (\u201cSRO\u201d) rules. Such regulation continues to grow more extensive and complex, and regulatory proceedings continue to become more frequent and sanctions more severe. The SEC, FINRA, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (\u201cMSRB\u201d) securities exchanges and other governmental authorities and SROs continue to propose new regulatory initiatives which may result in the adoption of new or revised regulations, as well as changes to interpretations of existing regulations. We may be adversely affected by new regulations, changes in regulatory interpretations, or more rigorous enforcement of applicable regulations, any of which could limit our business activities, increase our costs, adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition and harm our reputation.\nRegulatory changes that may have an adverse impact on our business include potential new regulations resulting from the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the \u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d). These may include the development of alternative standards of conduct for broker-dealers and investment advisers when providing personalized investment advice about securities to retail investors, including the imposition of a fiduciary standard on broker-dealers. The SEC is also considering the potential harmonization of certain other aspects of the regulation of broker-dealers and investment advisers. Additionally, the Department of Labor (the \u201cDOL\u201d) announced in February 2015 that it had submitted a re-proposal of a regulation under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (\u201cERISA\u201d) to the Office of Management and Budget for review prior to public release, and that the re-proposal would expand the scope of those who become fiduciaries to capture more of the current services of 401(k) and IRA providers. The adoption of any such SEC or DOL regulations could require changes to certain business practices and require us to invest significant management attention and resources to evaluate and make necessary changes, which could impact our business and financial results.\nAdditionally, the SEC has approved amendments to the FINRA and NASD rules that address values of certain direct investment programs referred to as direct participation programs (\u201cDPPs\u201d) and unlisted REIT securities. The amendments, which will become effective in 2016, modify the requirements for inclusion of per share estimated values of DPP and REIT securities in customer account statements and make corresponding changes to the requirements applicable to participation by broker-dealers in public offerings of DPP and REIT securities. These rule amendments may result in changes to the values of DPP and REIT securities which appear on customer account statements. If investors or financial advisors react negatively to the new disclosure regime, the demand for these products could be reduced, which could harm our results of operations.\nWe may also be adversely affected by other evolving regulatory standards, such as FINRA\u2019s new supervision rules, which became effective in December 2014, suitability requirements and enhanced regulatory oversight over incentive compensation.\nBroker-dealers and other financial services firms are subject to extensive regulations.\nBroker-dealer and other financial services firms are subject to extensive regulatory requirements under federal and state laws and regulations and SRO rules. Our broker-dealer subsidiaries are registered with the SEC as broker-dealers under the Exchange Act and in the states in which they conduct securities business and are members of FINRA and other SROs. Some of our broker-dealers also conduct business involving commodities, futures and/or insurance, in which case they may also be registered or licensed with or members of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (the \u201cCFTC\u201d), the National Futures Association (the \u201cNFA\u201d), and/or state insurance regulatory authorities. Our broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to regulation, examination and disciplinary action by the SEC, FINRA and state securities regulators, as well as other governmental authorities and SROs with which they are registered or licensed or of which they are members.\nRCS Capital Corporation and Subsidiaries\nDecember 31, 2014\nThe regulations applicable to broker-dealers cover all aspects of the securities business, including, among other things, sales practices, fee arrangements, disclosures to clients, capital adequacy, use and safekeeping of clients\u2019 funds and securities, recordkeeping and reporting and the qualification and conduct of officers, employees and independent contractors. As part of this regulatory scheme, broker-dealers are subject to regular and special examinations by the SEC and FINRA intended to determine their compliance with securities laws, regulations and rules. Following an examination\u2019s conclusion, a broker-dealer may receive a deficiency letter identifying potential compliance or supervisory weaknesses or rule violations which the firm must address.\nThe SEC, FINRA and other governmental authorities and SROs may bring enforcement proceedings against firms and place other limitations on firms subject to their jurisdiction, as well as their officers, directors, employees and independent contractors, whether arising out of an examination or otherwise, for violations of the securities laws, regulations and rules. Sanctions can include cease-and-desist orders, censures, fines, civil monetary penalties and disgorgement, limitations on a firm\u2019s business activities, suspension, revocation of FINRA membership or even expulsion of the firm from the securities industry. Criminal actions are referred to the appropriate criminal law enforcement agency. Any such proceeding against one of our broker-dealers, or any of their associated persons could harm our reputation, cause us to lose clients or fail to gain new clients and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nFinancial services firms are subject to numerous conflicts of interest or perceived conflicts of interest. The SEC, FINRA, DOL and other governmental authorities and SROs have increased their scrutiny of potential conflicts of interest. We have adopted, and regularly review and update, policies, procedures and controls designed to address or limit actual or perceived conflicts, but there can be no assurance of the effectiveness of these protocols. Addressing conflicts of interest adequately is complex and difficult and our reputation could be damaged if we fail, or appear to fail, to identify and successfully manage these conflicts of interest. The development and implementation of policies, procedures and controls to address or limit actual or perceived conflicts may also result in increased costs. Failure to identify and successfully manage conflicts of interest procedures could subject us to disciplinary sanctions or litigation or could harm our reputation.\nFinancial services firms are also subject to rules and regulations relating to the prevention and detection of money laundering. The USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 (the \u201cPATRIOT Act\u201d) mandates that financial institutions, including broker-dealers and investment advisers, establish and implement anti-money laundering (\u201cAML\u201d) programs reasonably designed to achieve compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 and the rules thereunder. Financial services firms must maintain AML policies, procedures and controls, designate an AML compliance officer to oversee the firm\u2019s AML program, implement appropriate employee training and provide for annual independent testing of the program. We have established AML programs but there can be no assurance of the effectiveness of these programs. Failure to comply with AML requirements could subject us to disciplinary sanctions and other penalties.\nFinancial services firms must also comply with applicable privacy and data protection laws and regulations, including SEC Regulation S-P and applicable provisions of the 1999 Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1970 and the 2003 Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act. Any violations of laws and regulations relating to the safeguarding of private information could subject us to fines and penalties, as well as to civil action by affected parties.\nOur ability to comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations is largely dependent on our establishment and maintenance of compliance, supervision, recordkeeping and reporting and audit systems and procedures, as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance, audit and risk management personnel. While we have adopted policies and procedures we believe are reasonably designed to comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations, these systems and procedures may not be fully effective, and there can be no assurance that regulators or third parties will not raise material issues with respect to our past or future compliance with applicable regulations.\nInvestment advisers are also subject to extensive regulation.\nInvestment advisers are also subject to extensive regulation. Depending on factors such as assets under management and geographic location, investment advisers are primarily regulated by the SEC or state securities regulators. The SEC oversees the activities of its registered investment advisers under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (the \u201cAdvisers Act\u201d). State-registered advisers are regulated by the applicable state regulatory authority. SK Research and certain subsidiaries of our independent retail advice businesses are registered as investment advisers either with the SEC or state securities regulators, and they and their associated persons are subject to the requirements of the Advisers Act and state securities laws, as applicable, including examination and enforcement authority. Our investment advisers are subject to laws and regulations related to, among other things, fiduciary duties to clients, performance fees, maintaining an effective compliance program, solicitation arrangements, conflicts of interest, advertising, limitations on agency cross and principal transactions between the adviser and advisory clients, recordkeeping and reporting requirements, disclosure requirements and general anti-fraud provisions.\nFailure to comply with the Advisers Act or other federal and state regulations could lead to regulatory investigations and enforcement proceedings which could result in monetary penalties, cease and desist orders or even termination of an adviser\u2019s registration. Criminal actions are referred to the appropriate criminal law enforcement agency. Any such proceedings against one of our investment advisers, or any of their associated persons could harm our reputation, cause us to lose clients or fail to gain new clients and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nRCS Capital Corporation and Subsidiaries\nDecember 31, 2014\nAdditionally, our investment adviser subsidiaries have fiduciary obligations that require their financial advisors to act in the best interests of their retail clients. Our investment adviser subsidiaries and/or their financial advisors may face liability for actual or alleged breaches of duties owed to their clients including their fiduciary duty, the suitability of the financial products they recommend, the investment advice they provide and the adequacy of disclosure, including with respect to conflicts of interest, among other things.\nCertain of our broker-dealer and investment adviser subsidiaries are subject to regulatory investigations and proceedings and may not be successful in defending against such proceedings.\nCertain of our broker-dealer and investment adviser subsidiaries and/or their financial advisors are subject to civil and/or criminal investigations or proceedings.\nFor example, during March 2014, a broker-dealer subsidiary of ICH entered into a Letter of Acceptance, Waiver, and Consent with FINRA. Without admitting or denying the findings, the broker-dealer subsidiary of ICH accepted and consented to FINRA\u2019s findings that: (i) from about June 2009 through April 2011, the broker-dealer subsidiary of ICH failed to provide prospectuses to customers who purchased ETFs, (ii) the broker-dealer subsidiary of ICH failed to establish, maintain and enforce an adequate supervisory system, including WSPs, concerning the sale of ETFs and its obligations to provide ETF prospectuses to customers, and (iii) by reason of the foregoing, the broker-dealer subsidiary of ICH acted in contravention of Section 5(b)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 (the \u201cSecurities Act\u201d) and thereby violated FINRA Rule 2010, and also violated NASD Conduct Rule 3010. The broker-dealer subsidiary of ICH also consented to a censure and a $100,000 fine.\nIn addition, during 2014, Hatteras was subject to a SEC Staff examination. The Staff of the Division of Investment Management has asserted, among other things, various potential violations by Hatteras of the anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws, including Section 206 of the Advisers Act, Section 34(b) of the Investment Company Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Section 17(a) of the Securities Act. The Staff of the Division of Investment Management referred the examination findings to the SEC\u2019s Division of Enforcement. While this investigation closed with no further action taken, there can be no assurance that future investigations will similarly be resolved in our favor.\nSuch proceedings can require the expenditure of significant resources. Predicting the outcome of such matters is inherently difficult, particularly when investigations are at an early stage. While we maintain insurance designed to lessen the cost of defending and/or settling covered matters (including certain regulatory actions) and paying fines which may be imposed, our insurance policies have limitations and deductibles, do not cover all matters and do not fully insulate our businesses from the costs and other adverse consequences of covered matters. There can be no assurance that the findings of a governmental authority or SRO will not result in disciplinary action against our broker-dealer or investment adviser subsidiaries and/or their officers, directors, employees and independent contractors, including fines, censures, limitations on activities or other civil or criminal sanctions. Any such disciplinary action could cause reputational harm and adversely affect our results and financial condition.\nOur Retail Firms engage in regulated activities that are different from those previously undertaken by us and expose us to different risks.\nThe business we conduct through our Retail Firms is a highly regulated business in which we had not been engaged prior to our acquisition of Cetera in April 2014. This business involves servicing retail clients through networks of financial advisors that operate through multiple separate branch offices. We are responsible for the conduct of a network of independent Retail Firms, including the management and supervision of branch office operations and the supervision of retail activities. Our broker-dealer subsidiaries and investment adviser subsidiaries and their officers, directors, employees and independent contractors, have significant obligations to their clients and are subject to laws, regulations and rules, governmental authorities and SROs to which we had not previously been subject. Engaging in this business has increased our exposure to claims, litigation and regulatory proceedings resulting from, among other things, alleged and actual errors and omissions, breaches of fiduciary or other duties owed to clients, misconduct in effecting securities transactions, rendering investment advice or placing insurance, and criminal misconduct.\nIn addition, businesses we acquire in the future may engage in regulated activities that are different from those currently undertaken by us and thus may expose us to different risks.\nRCS Capital Corporation and Subsidiaries\nDecember 31, 2014\nFailure to comply with net capital requirements could subject us to sanctions imposed by the SEC or FINRA.\nThe SEC\u2019s uniform net capital rule requires each of our broker-dealer subsidiaries to maintain a specified minimum amount of net capital at all times. The net capital rule focuses on liquidity and is designed to protect securities customers, counterparties and creditors by requiring that broker-dealers have sufficient liquid resources on hand at all times to satisfy claims promptly. The rule also limits the ability of broker-dealers to pay dividends, make payments on certain indebtedness, such as subordinated debt, or make unsecured loans to related persons if any such payment would reduce the firm\u2019s net capital below a specified threshold. Broker-dealers are expected to be able to demonstrate moment-to-moment compliance with the net capital rule. In addition to the minimum net capital requirements, the SEC and FINRA have established early warning levels of capital that exceed a broker-dealer\u2019s minimum capital requirement. A broker-dealer whose capital falls below the early warning level must notify the SEC and FINRA. If the broker-dealer\u2019s net capital falls below its minimum net capital requirement, the SEC or FINRA can require the firm to cease operations. Our broker-dealer subsidiaries may not be able to maintain adequate levels of net capital, or their net capital may fall below the requirements established by the SEC and FINRA, which may subject them to disciplinary action in the form of fines, suspension or expulsion. Even in circumstances where a broker-dealer does not violate its applicable early warning level or minimum net capital requirements, if there is an unusually large charge against one of our broker-dealer subsidiary\u2019s net capital, operations that are capital intensive, such as underwriting may be limited. A large operating loss or other charge against net capital could limit the affected broker-dealer subsidiary\u2019s ability to expand or even maintain its present levels of business, which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We may not be able to predict the amount of regulatory capital our broker-dealer subsidiaries may require and there can be no assurances that the sources of funding we have in place to manage their regulatory capital requirements will always be sufficient.\nThere are risks involved in acting as a fiduciary.\nFiduciary risk is the potential for financial or reputational loss through breach of fiduciary duties to a client. Our investment adviser subsidiaries and their financial advisors have a fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of their retail clients when providing personalized investment advice. As a result of the Dodd-Frank Act, a fiduciary standard may also be imposed on broker-dealers when they provide personalized advice to retail investors. Also, certain of our subsidiaries are subject to ERISA and Section 4975 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), and to regulations promulgated thereunder. ERISA and applicable provisions of the Code impose duties on persons who are considered fiduciaries with respect to benefit plan clients. ERISA and applicable provisions of the Code also prohibit specified transactions involving benefit plan clients, including, with respect to ERISA, employee benefit plans and, with respect to the Code, individual retirement accounts and Keogh plans, and impose monetary penalties, including excise taxes, for violations of these duties and restrictions. The DOL is considering re-proposal of a regulation under ERISA that would expand the scope of those who become fiduciaries to capture more of the current services of 401(k) and IRA providers. Any failure to comply with current or expanded fiduciary duties could result in significant liabilities, and potentially limit or restrict the ability of our subsidiaries to act as fiduciaries for any plans.\nThe SEC may limit 12b-1 fees.\n\u201c12b-1\u201d fees are fees paid by a mutual fund out of fund assets (thus, indirectly by investors) to cover distribution expenses and shareholder servicing expenses. 12b-1 fees get their name from the SEC rule that authorizes a fund to pay them. During the year ended December 31, 2014, we received $250.0 million in 12b-1 fees. In 2010, the SEC proposed new rules and disclosure requirements that, if adopted, would significantly change the existing regulatory framework governing distribution and servicing fees, and ongoing sales charges. The proposal could have significant implications for the mutual fund industry, including broker-dealers and investment advisers that sell mutual fund shares. If adopted, the new rules could result in our broker-dealer subsidiaries receiving reduced 12b-1 fees, which could negatively impact our revenues and earnings and have an adverse effect on our growth strategy and our business. The DOL has also proposed changes that would eliminate third-party incentive payments, such as 12b-1 and other revenue sharing fees on mutual funds held in IRA accounts. If adopted, the proposal would also adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur ability to raise capital in a timely manner in the amount that we may require and to effect changes in ownership is limited by the operation of NASD (FINRA) Rule 1017.\nNASD (FINRA) Rule 1017 requires that any member of FINRA file an application for approval of any change in ownership that would result in one person or entity directly or indirectly owning or controlling 25% or more of a member firm\u2019s equity capital. The application must be filed at least 30 days prior to effecting a change. The approval process under Rule 1017 can take six months or more to complete.\nThe required process under NASD (FINRA) Rule 1017, including the required 30-day notice period before effecting a change in ownership, could hinder or delay us in any effort to raise capital, where, as a result of the capital raised, any person or entity would own or control 25% of more of any of our broker-dealer subsidiaries. A denial of any application we have made under NASD (FINRA) Rule 1017 could also have a material adverse effect on us.\nRCS Capital Corporation and Subsidiaries\nDecember 31, 2014\nRisks Related to Our Structure\nThe structure of our Class B common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control over us in RCAP Holdings and, indirectly, in those who control RCAP Holdings.\nFor so long as any of our Class B common stock remains outstanding, the holders of our Class B common stock always will have a majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock. This concentrated control will limit or preclude your ability to influence corporate matters as a holder of Class A common stock. RCAP Holdings - which is directly or indirectly controlled by Messrs. Schorsch and Kahane - holds the sole outstanding share of our Class B common stock and thereby controls a majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock, retains effective control of our board of directors and has the ability to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval.\nOn December 30, 2014, we announced that Mr. Schorsch and William M. Kahane, the controlling members of our controlling stockholder, had resigned from their positions as, respectively, the executive chairman and a member of our board of directors as part of an initiative to simplify our governance structure, reduce complexity and minimize perceived conflicts of interest among related parties and affiliates, but there can be no assurance that this initiative will be successful.\nDue to their control over the sole outstanding share of Class B common stock, Messrs. Schorsch and Kahane currently have the ability to control or influence all matters affecting us, including:\n\u2022\nthe composition of our board of directors and, through our board of directors, any determination with respect to our business plans and policies;\n\u2022\nany determinations with respect to mergers, acquisitions and other business combinations;\n\u2022\nour acquisition or disposition of assets;\n\u2022\nour financing activities;\n\u2022\ncertain changes to our certificate of incorporation;\n\u2022\namendments to any agreements between us and RCAP Holdings;\n\u2022\ncorporate opportunities that may be suitable for us, RCAP Holdings or Messrs. Schorsch and Kahane and the other members of RCAP Holdings;\n\u2022\ndeterminations with respect to enforcement of rights we may have against third parties;\n\u2022\nthe payment of dividends, if any, and to the extent permitted by the negative covenants contained in the bank facilities and the indenture governing the convertible notes, on our Class A common stock and any preferred stock we have issued or may issue, including the Series B preferred stock and the Series C convertible preferred stock; and\n\u2022\nthe number of shares available for issuance under our stock plans for prospective and existing employees, as well as the number of shares available under any future stock purchase program.\nIf RCAP Holdings does not provide any requisite consent allowing us to conduct activities requiring stockholder consent when requested, we will not be able to conduct such activities and, as a result, our business and our operating results may be harmed. Messrs. Schorsch and Kahane also control RCS Capital Management the company that provides strategic planning and consulting services to assist us and our subsidiaries in implementing our business strategies, subject to oversight, directly or indirectly, by our board of directors. This means that these individuals may have an even greater influence over our affairs than their control over RCAP Holdings and direct ownership of shares of our Class A common stock alone would dictate.\nRCAP Holdings\u2019 ability to control our board of directors may also make it difficult for us to recruit high-quality independent directors. Persons who would otherwise have accepted an invitation to join our board of directors may decline to do so, which makes the recruitment of the most qualified independent directors more difficult.\nOn April 29, 2014, RCAP Holdings pledged substantially all of its assets, including the sole outstanding share of our Class B common stock, to secure the bank facilities. An event of a default under the bank facilities and operation of the pledge with respect to the sole outstanding share of Class B common stock could give rise to a change in control of our company.\nIn the event RCAP Holdings is acquired or otherwise undergoes a change of control, any acquiror or successor will be entitled to exercise the voting control and contractual rights of RCAP Holdings, and may do so in a manner that could vary significantly from that of RCAP Holdings.\nRCS Capital Corporation and Subsidiaries\nDecember 31, 2014\nFollowing the redemption of the sole outstanding share of our Class B common stock, the concentration of ownership of our Class A common stock in the members of RCAP Holdings and Luxor could continue to limit other stockholders\u2019 ability to influence corporate matters.\nRCAP Holdings holds the sole outstanding share of our Class B common stock and thereby controls a majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock, retains effective control of our board of directors and has the ability to control all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval. Luxor Capital Group LP and its affiliates (\u201cLuxor\u201d) currently hold shares of Class A common stock and certain other securities and rights that can be converted into or exercised for newly issued shares of our Class A common stock, namely Series C convertible preferred stock, convertible notes and a put right, which we refer to as the \u201cLuxor put,\u201d with respect to Luxor\u2019s 19.46% membership interest in RCS Capital Management under a put/call agreement entered into on April 29, 2014. For so long as it holds a majority of the Series C convertible preferred stock outstanding, Luxor is also entitled to appoint at least one member to our board of directors and has other rights. The number of shares of Class A common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series C convertible preferred stock or the convertible notes or upon exercise of the Luxor put is restricted by the ownership limitations described under Note 11 of our consolidated financial statements, which we refer to as the \u201cownership limitations.\u201d\nLuxor, RCAP Holdings and the members of RCAP Holdings have agreed to use their reasonable best efforts to cause the rights of our Class B common stock to be amended to allow us, at any time after July 1, 2016, to redeem any outstanding Class B common stock owned by RCAP Holdings for $50.0 million in cash, subject to proportionate increase if the market price of our Class A common stock is above $30.00 per share, although we would be prohibited from doing so by the restricted payments covenant contained in the bank facilities currently in effect. Any such redemption would also be subject to our obtaining the affirmative vote of those holders of Class A common stock owning a majority of the outstanding Class A common stock.\nAssuming the redemption occurred as of March 6, 2015, Messrs. Schorsch and Kahane and the other members of RCAP Holdings would control 41.52% of our combined voting power through their direct ownership of 30,584,427 shares of our Class A common stock and Luxor would control 12.15% of our combined voting power through its direct ownership of 8,952,312 shares of our Class A common stock. Assuming the redemption occurred and assuming conversion of the Series C convertible preferred stock and convertible notes held by Luxor and exercise of the Luxor put (without giving effect to the ownership limitations applicable to Luxor), Messrs. Schorsch and Kahane and the other members of RCAP Holdings, would control 33.75% of our combined voting power through their direct ownership of 30,584,427 shares of our Class A common stock and Luxor would control 28.59% of our combined voting power through its direct ownership of 25,906,703 shares of our Class A common stock.\nThe potential for continued significant concentration of share ownership and control through Messrs. Schorsch and Kahane and the other members of RCAP Holdings, Luxor or all of them, acting together, may adversely affect the trading price for our Class A common stock because investors often perceive disadvantages in owning stock in companies with controlling stockholders. Moreover, this concentrated voting control would have similar effects to the current concentrated voting control of Messrs. Schorsch and Kahane, as described in more detail above in \u201c- The structure of our Class B common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control over us in RCAP Holdings and, indirectly, in those who control RCAP Holdings.\u201d\nThere are various conflicts of interest arising out of our relationship with RCAP Holdings and RCS Capital Management, which could result in decisions that are not in the best interests of our stockholders.\nWe are subject to conflicts of interest arising out of our relationship with RCAP Holdings and RCS Capital Management, both of which are controlled by Mr. Schorsch, the former executive chairman of our board of directors, and Mr. Kahane, our former chief executive officer and a former director. Peter Budko, one of our directors, and Mr. Weil, our chief executive officer and one of our directors, are also executives and members of both RCAP Holdings and RCS Capital Management. These individuals have conflicts between their duties to us and their duties to, and interests in, RCAP Holdings, RCS Capital Management and other affiliates of RCAP Holdings and RCS Capital Management, and these conflicts may not be resolved in our favor.\nConflicts may arise with respect to the interpretation, continuation, renewal or enforcement of our agreements with RCS Capital Management, RCAP Holdings and their affiliates. The resolution of any such conflict in favor or RCAP Holdings, RCS Capital Management or any of their affiliates may materially harm our results of operations and the value of your shares of our Class A common stock.\nFor example, we have provided certain non-traded REITs sponsored by American Realty Capital, which are affiliates of RCAP Holdings, with a variety of support, advisory and other services in connection with preparation for and execution of their proposed and completed strategic transactions, namely their listings on national securities exchanges, under agreements that provide for fixed advisory fees and fixed fees due at the time of completion of the transaction. We expect that we will enter into similar arrangements on similar terms with other non-traded REITs sponsored by American Realty Capital in the future. A conflict could arise over the rates that we earn under these arrangements, and we could earn less under these arrangements in the future if the individuals who control the non-traded REITs sponsored by American Realty Capital and us make such a determination. Similar conflicts that are not resolved in our favor could occur in connection with the mergers and acquisitions advisory and capital markets services we provide to other related parties.\nRCS Capital Corporation and Subsidiaries\nDecember 31, 2014\nIt may be difficult to favorably resolve any disputes that arise between us, RCAP Holdings and RCS Capital Management.\nDisputes may arise between us, RCAP Holdings and RCS Capital Management, which is controlled by the controlling members of RCAP Holdings, in a number of areas relating to our ongoing relationships, including:\n\u2022\nemployee retention and recruiting;\n\u2022\nbusiness combinations involving us;\n\u2022\nour ability to engage in activities with certain potential clients;\n\u2022\nsales or dispositions by RCAP Holdings and its members of all or any portion of their ownership interest in us; and\n\u2022\nbusiness development or marketing activities by us which may require the consent of RCAP Holdings.\nWe may not be able to resolve any potential conflicts, and even if we do, the resolution may be less favorable than if the conflict were between two unaffiliated parties. The agreements we have entered into with RCAP Holdings, RCS Capital Management and their affiliates may only be amended upon agreement between the parties. While we are controlled by RCAP Holdings, we may not have the leverage to negotiate amendments to these agreements, if required, on terms as favorable to us as those we would negotiate with an unaffiliated third party.\nWe have elected to take advantage of the \u201ccontrolled company\u201d exemption to the corporate governance rules for NYSE-listed companies, which could make our Class A common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price.\nBecause we qualify as a \u201ccontrolled company\u201d under the corporate governance rules for NYSE-listed companies, we are not required to have a majority of our board of directors be independent, nor are we required to have a compensation committee or an independent nominating function. In light of our status as a controlled company, our board of directors has determined not to have an independent nominating function or to have the full board of directors be directly responsible for nominating members of our board of directors. We have established a compensation committee, although our compensation committee does not meet the independence requirements which would have been required under corporate governance rules for NYSE-listed companies if we were not a controlled company. We have, however, elected a majority of independent members to our board of directors, although there can be no assurance that our board of directors will continue to have a majority of independent directors, as this is not required by corporate governance rules for NYSE-listed companies for controlled companies. Should the interests of our controlling stockholder differ from those of other stockholders, the other stockholders may not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all the corporate governance rules for NYSE-listed companies. Our status as a controlled company could make our Class A common stock less attractive to some investors or otherwise harm our stock price.\nIf we were able to redeem the sole outstanding share of our Class B common stock pursuant to our redemption agreement with RCAP Holdings, we would no longer qualify as a controlled company under corporate governance rules for NYSE-listed companies. See \u201c- Following the redemption of the sole outstanding share of our Class B common stock, the concentration of ownership of our Class A common stock in the members of RCAP Holdings and Luxor could continue to limit other stockholders\u2019 ability to influence corporate matters.\u201d\nWe are dependent on RCS Capital Management and its officers, who provide services to us through the services agreement.\nWe rely heavily on RCS Capital Management to conduct day-to-day business operations of our company, and to provide strategic planning and consulting services to us and our operating subsidiaries. Accordingly, the success of our businesses depends to a significant extent upon the efforts, experience, diligence, judgment, skill and network of business contacts of the officers of RCS Capital Management. The departure of any of the officers of RCS Capital Management could have a material adverse effect on our performance and slow our future growth.\nWhile the qualified professionals of our operating subsidiaries generally are the direct employees of those operating subsidiaries and provide services for them on a full-time basis, RCS Capital Management is not obligated to dedicate any of its officers exclusively to us. In addition, none of our officers or the officers of RCS Capital Management is obligated to dedicate any specific portion of his time to our business. Each of these individuals has significant responsibilities for other business segments currently managed by affiliates of American Realty Capital, including as a result of being part of the senior management or key personnel of other American Realty Capital-sponsored entities and their advisors. For example, nine of the American Realty Capital-sponsored or co-sponsored REITs have registration statements that became effective during 2014. Additionally, one American Realty Capital-sponsored program was currently in registration as of December 31, 2014. As a result, these individuals may not always be able to devote sufficient time to the management of our business. Further, when there are turbulent conditions in the real estate markets or distress in the credit markets that affect American Realty Capital, the attention of RCS Capital Management\u2019s principals and executive officers will also be required by the other entities and businesses managed by affiliates of American Realty Capital. In such situations, we may not receive the level of support and assistance that we might receive if we were internally managed.\nRCS Capital Corporation and Subsidiaries\nDecember 31, 2014\nIn addition, no assurance can be given that RCS Capital Management will continue to provide services to us. The initial term of the services agreement extends until June 10, 2033, with automatic five-year renewals, subject to termination by nonrenewal upon a 180-day prior written notice. If the services agreement is terminated and no suitable replacement is found to provide the services needed by us under that agreement, we may not be able to execute our business plan.\nThe services agreement was not negotiated on an arm\u2019s-length basis and may not be as favorable as a services agreement negotiated with an unaffiliated third party.\nOur chief executive officer and two of our six directors are also members of RCAP Holdings, RCS Capital Management and American Realty Capital. Our services agreement was negotiated between related parties and its terms, including amounts payable thereunder, may not be as favorable as if it had been negotiated with an unaffiliated third party.\nOur ability to terminate the services agreement without cause is limited, and would be difficult to exercise. During the initial term, we, together with RCS Capital Holdings, LLC (\u201cRCS Holdings\u201d), an intermediate holding company wholly owned by us, formed in 2014 to own our operating subsidiaries, may terminate the services agreement only for cause. Effective at the expiry of the initial 20-year term or any subsequent five-year renewal term, we, together with RCS Holdings, may terminate the services agreement without cause upon the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of our independent directors based upon: (1) RCS Capital Management\u2019s unsatisfactory performance that is materially detrimental to us; or (2) a determination that the quarterly fees, incentive fees or performance-based awards payable to RCS Capital Management are not fair, subject to RCS Capital Management\u2019s right to prevent termination based on unfair fees or awards by accepting a reduction of quarterly fees, incentive fees or awards agreed to by at least two-thirds of our independent directors. RCS Capital Management must be provided 180 days\u2019 prior written notice of any such termination. These provisions may adversely affect our ability to terminate RCS Capital Management\u2019s services without cause.\nRCS Capital Management is not contractually committed to serve us beyond June 10, 2033. Thereafter, the services agreement will be renewable for five-year terms; provided, however, that RCS Capital Management may terminate the services agreement before the end of any five-year term at will upon 180 days\u2019 prior written notice. If the services agreement is terminated and no suitable replacement is found, we may not be able to execute our business plan.\nPursuant to the services agreement, RCS Capital Management does not assume any responsibility other than to render the services called for thereunder and is not responsible for any action of our board of directors in following or declining to follow its advice or recommendations. RCS Capital Management maintains a contractual as opposed to a fiduciary relationship with us. Under the terms of the services agreement, none of RCS Capital Management or any of its respective officers, members or personnel, any person controlling or controlled by RCS Capital Management or any person providing sub-advisory services to RCS Capital Management will be liable to us, any subsidiary of ours, our directors, our stockholders or any of our subsidiaries\u2019 stockholders or partners for acts or omissions performed in accordance with and pursuant to the services agreement, except because of acts constituting bad faith, willful misconduct or gross negligence. In addition, we have agreed to indemnify RCS Capital Management and each of its officers, stockholders, members, managers, directors and personnel, any person controlling or controlled by RCS Capital Management and any person providing sub-advisory services to RCS Capital Management with respect to all expenses, losses, damages, liabilities, demands, charges and claims arising from acts or omissions of RCS Capital Management not constituting bad faith, willful misconduct or gross negligence.\nPayment of fees to RCS Capital Management reduces cash available for business investment and stockholder distribution.\nRCS Capital Management provides certain services to us pursuant to a services agreement. RCS Capital Management is paid substantial fees for these services, which reduces the amount of cash available for investment in our business or distribution to our stockholders. Such fees consist of: (i) a quarterly fee; and (ii) an incentive fee. For the period from the closing of our initial public offering on June 10, 2013 to December 31, 2013 and the year ended December 31, 2014, the aggregate of the quarterly and incentive fees was $6.2 million and $2.0 million, respectively. During 2014, RCS Capital Management also received performance-based awards under the Amended and Restated 2013 Manager Multi-Year Outperformance Agreement among the Company, RCS Holdings and RCS Capital Management (the \u201cOPP\u201d) as further described in Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements. In the future we may contract with RCAP Holdings and/or RCS Capital Management to perform other services for us for which we will pay additional fees.\nIn connection with the closing of the acquisition by Luxor of an interest in RCS Capital Management, the OPP was amended, which resulted in 310,947 LTIP units being earned as of April 28, 2014, and 1,014,053 LTIP Units being forfeited. Following this amendment, no more LTIP Units can be issued under the OPP. On December 31, 2014, the OPP was amended again to provide for the early vesting of the earned LTIP Units such that all the earned LTIP Units became fully vested on December 31, 2014 and were converted into Class C Units in RCS Holdings on a one-for-one basis which, in turn, were converted into shares of Class A common stock on a one-for-one basis. Accordingly, on December 31, 2014, 310,947 shares of Class A common stock were issued pro rata to the individual holders of earned LTIP Units, the members of RCS Capital Management who are also members of RCAP Holdings and American Realty Capital. Following this conversion, no more LTIP Units are outstanding.\nRCS Capital Corporation and Subsidiaries\nDecember 31, 2014\nIn general, we and our subsidiaries are permitted to deduct all ordinary and necessary business expenses incurred in the operation of our businesses. The quarterly fee payable by us and RCS Holdings to RCS Capital Management, a related party, is allocated among us and RCS Holdings based on any reasonable method determined by our independent directors, such as the relative value of the services provided during the relevant period or the relative amount of time spent by RCS Capital Management providing management services to us, on the one hand, and to RCS Holdings and our operating subsidiaries, on the other hand. The Internal Revenue Service (\u201cIRS\u201d) could challenge the allocation of the quarterly fee among us and RCS Holdings or the deductibility of the quarterly fee by us or RCS Holdings if, for example, the amount of the quarterly fee is not reasonable relative to the services provided. If the deduction were successfully denied, in whole or in part, we or RCS Holdings, as applicable, would compute taxable income without deducting the quarterly fee, thereby increasing taxable income (or reducing losses) despite the reduction in our or RCS Holdings\u2019 cash due to the payment of the quarterly fee to RCS Capital Management.\nThe quarterly fees payable to RCS Capital Management under the services agreement may cause RCS Capital Management to engage in risky behavior in order to increase its compensation.\nUnder the services agreement, RCS Capital Management is entitled to receive: (i) quarterly fees based on our GAAP pre-tax income; and (ii) incentive fees based on our Core Earnings. Core Earnings is a non-GAAP measure and is defined as our after-tax GAAP net income (loss), before the incentive fee plus non-cash equity compensation expense, depreciation and amortization, any unrealized gains, losses or other non-cash items recorded in net income for the period, regardless of whether such items are included in other comprehensive income or loss, or in net income (loss).\nIn providing services to us under the terms of the services agreement, the opportunity to earn compensation based on our GAAP pre-tax income and based on Core Earnings may lead RCS Capital Management to place undue emphasis on the maximization of our aggregate GAAP pre-tax income and Core Earnings at the expense of other criteria that would be beneficial to our business, such as preservation of capital, in order to obtain more compensation. Additionally, RCS Capital Management might engage in risky or speculative behavior in order to maximize Total Return, even if such behavior might put us at risk.\nAny material weaknesses in our internal controls may impede our ability to produce timely and accurate financial statements, which could cause us to fail to file our periodic reports timely, result in inaccurate financial reporting or restatements of our financial statements, subject our stock to delisting and materially harm our business, results of operations, financial condition and the price of our Class A common stock.\nAs a public company, we are required to file annual and quarterly periodic reports containing our financial statements with the SEC within prescribed time periods. As part of the NYSE listing requirements, we are also required to provide our periodic reports, or make them available, to our stockholders within prescribed time periods. We may not be able to produce reliable financial statements or file these financial statements as part of a periodic report in a timely manner with the SEC or comply with NYSE listing requirements. In addition, we could make errors in our financial statements that could require us to restate our financial statements. If we are required to restate our financial statements in the future for any reason, any specific adjustment may be adverse and may cause our results of operations and financial condition, as restated, to be materially adversely impacted. As a result, we could be the subject of adverse publicity, stockholder lawsuits and investigations and sanctions by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC. Any of the above consequences could cause the price of our Class A common stock to decline and could impose significant unanticipated costs on us.\nAs of December 31, 2014, we no longer qualified as a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d or an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. As a result, beginning with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2014, our independent registered public accounting firm is now required to evaluate and report on our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and, beginning with our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ending March 31, 2015, we will become subject to more rigorous disclosure requirements that are applicable to publicly reporting companies that do not qualify as smaller reporting companies or emerging growth companies, including compensation discussion and analysis. The increased personnel requirements and other obligations related to these new requirements will cause an increase in public company reporting and internal and external auditing expenses, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nTo the extent we, or our independent registered public accounting firm, find material weaknesses in our internal controls, we, or our independent registered public accounting firm, may determine that we have ineffective internal controls over financial reporting as of any particular fiscal year end. Any material weaknesses or other deficiencies in our internal controls may delay the conclusion of an annual audit or a review of our quarterly financial results.\nRCS Capital Corporation and Subsidiaries\nDecember 31, 2014\nIf we are not able to issue our financial statements in a timely manner, or if we are not able to obtain the required audit or review of our financial statements by our independent registered public accounting firm in a timely manner, we will not be able to comply with the periodic reporting requirements of the SEC and the listing requirements of the NYSE. If these events occur, the listing of our Class A common stock on the NYSE could be suspended or terminated and the price of our Class A common stock could materially suffer. In addition, we could be subject to investigation and sanction by the SEC and other regulatory authorities and to stockholder lawsuits, which could impose significant additional costs on us, divert management attention and materially harm our business, results of operations, financial condition and the price of our Class A common stock.\nWe would be required to pay to RCAP Holdings most of the tax benefit of any depreciation or amortization deductions we may claim as a result of the step up in tax basis we would receive if the exchange by RCAP Holdings of substantially all of its Operating Subsidiaries Units is characterized as a taxable exchange.\nIf the exchange by RCAP Holdings of substantially all of its Operating Subsidiaries Units for shares of our Class A common stock (and cancellation of its corresponding shares of our Class B common stock) through the exchange transactions qualifies as a tax-free contribution to us under Section 351 of the Code, we would obtain carryover tax basis in the tangible and intangible assets of Realty Capital Securities, RCS Advisory and ANST connected with such Operating Subsidiaries Units. Accordingly, we would not be required to make any payments under the tax receivable agreement we have entered into with RCAP Holdings.\nHowever, if the exchange were treated as a taxable transaction, each of Realty Capital Securities, RCS Advisory and ANST intends to have an election under Section 754 of the Code which would result in us receiving a step up in the tax basis in the tangible and intangible assets of each of Realty Capital Securities, RCS Advisory and ANST with respect to such Operating Subsidiaries Units acquired by us in such exchanges. The increase in tax basis would be expected to reduce the amount of tax that we would otherwise be liable for in the future. Pursuant to the tax receivable agreement we have entered into with RCAP Holdings, we would be required to pay RCAP Holdings 85% of the amount of the reduction, if any, in U.S. federal, state and local income tax liabilities that we realize as a result of this increase in tax basis resulting from the exchange. The amount and timing of any payments under the tax receivable agreement would vary depending on a number of factors, including the extent to which the exchange is taxable, the amount and timing of our income and the tax rates then applicable.\nRisks Related to our Class A Common Stock\nThe market price and trading volume of our Class A common stock may be volatile, which could result in rapid and substantial losses for our stockholders.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock may be volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations. In addition, the trading volume of Class A common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. If the market price of our Class A common stock declines significantly, you may be unable to resell your shares of our Class A common stock at or above your purchase price, if at all. There can be no assurance that the market price of our Class A common stock will not fluctuate or decline significantly in the future. Some of the factors that could negatively affect the price of our Class A common stock, or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of Class A common stock, include:\n\u2022\nadverse publicity about direct investment programs, generally, or individual scandals specifically, including due to the events relating to the announcement concerning certain accounting errors by ARCP;\n\u2022\ngeneral market and economic conditions;\n\u2022\nvariations in our quarterly operating results;\n\u2022\nour failure to meet the market\u2019s earnings expectations;\n\u2022\ndepartures of principals or additions/departures of other key personnel;\n\u2022\nadverse market reaction to any indebtedness we may incur or securities we may issue in the future;\n\u2022\nactions by our stockholders;\n\u2022\nchanges in market valuations of similar companies;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated poor performance in our underlying investment strategies;\n\u2022\npublication of research reports about us or the securities industry, or the failure of securities analysts to cover our Class A common stock;\n\u2022\nchanges or proposed changes in laws or regulation, or differing interpretations thereof, affecting our business, or enforcement of these laws and regulations, or announcements relating to these matters; and\n\u2022\nlitigation and governmental investigations, including due to the events relating to the announcement concerning accounting errors by ARCP.\nRCS Capital Corporation and Subsidiaries\nDecember 31, 2014\nPublic perceptions of the actual or expected risks or benefits of our recent and pending acquisitions could also affect the price of our Class A common stock. If we do not achieve the perceived benefits of our recent and pending acquisitions as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by financial or industry analysts, or the effect of our recent and pending acquisitions on our financial results is otherwise not consistent with the expectations of financial or industry analysts, the market price of our Class A common stock may decline. In addition, our stock price has been, and may continue to be, materially adversely impacted by the developments described under \u201c-The announcement concerning certain accounting errors by ARCP has affected sales by RCAP of public, non-traded REITs sponsored directly or indirectly by American Realty Capital that are distributed by us and there can be no assurance that it will not continue to affect equity capital raised and have additional adverse impacts on our results of operations or the market price of our Class A common stock.\u201d The market price of our Class A common stock has declined by 40.03% from the closing price on October 28, 2014, the trading date immediately preceding the announcement by ARCP, through the closing price on March 6, 2015. Uncertainty about the completion of our pending acquisitions, which are subject to conditions, may also affect the market price of our Class A common stock.\nFuture sales of our Class A common stock in the public market or future issuances in connection with acquisitions of businesses could lower the market price of our Class A common stock.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our Class A common stock or the perception that such sales could occur. Issuances of our Class A common stock will also occur to pay consideration at the completion of the acquisitions of VSR and Girard and to pay post-completion consideration due in connection with the acquisitions of Docupace, StratCap and Trupoly. These sales or issuances, or the possibility that these sales or issuances may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital by selling equity securities in the future, at a time and price that we deem appropriate.\nFuture issuances could also occur upon conversion of the convertible notes or the Series C convertible preferred stock or upon the exercise of the Luxor put.\nThere can be no assurance as to the size or price of future issuances of our Class A common stock or the effect, if any, that such future issuances and future sales of shares of our Class A common stock, including future sales by the selling stockholders, may have on the market price of our Class A common stock. Sales or distributions of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock (including shares issued in connection with an acquisition), or the perception that such sales could occur, may cause the market price of our Class A common stock to decline.\nYou may suffer immediate and substantial dilution in connection with the conversion of the Series C convertible preferred stock and the convertible notes, the exercise of the Luxor put option and upon the issuance of securities in connection with certain of our acquisitions.\nSignificant dilution may occur due to the 14,384,461 shares of our Class A common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series C convertible preferred stock and the convertible notes as of March 6, 2015. This amount is expected to increase because we do not expect to pay cash dividends on the Series C convertible preferred stock, which will accrue additional liquidation preference and be convertible into additional shares of Class A common stock. Furthermore, in connection with the Cetera acquisition, Luxor purchased a membership interest in RCS Capital Management and received the Luxor put, the right to require us to purchase the interest in exchange for, at our election, either cash, shares of our Class A common stock or a combination thereof. As of March 6, 2015, 2,569,930 shares of our Class A common stock would be issuable upon exercise of the Luxor put. An exercise of the Luxor put that requires us to issue additional shares of our Class A common stock could also cause dilution.\nCollectively, the potential issuances to Luxor described above would constitute 23.02% of our outstanding Class A common stock as of March 6, 2015.\nAdditional dilution to existing stockholders may also occur in connection with the issuance of additional shares of our Class A common stock to pay consideration at the completion of the acquisitions of VSR and Girard and to pay post-completion consideration due in connection with the acquisitions of Docupace, StratCap and Trupoly.\nThese issuances will also increase the number of shares that may be issued under our equity plan, pursuant to which the number of shares of our Class A common stock equal to 10% of our issued and outstanding Class A common stock (on a fully diluted basis) at any time may be granted as awards. Issuances of awards under our equity plan or sales of shares and grants of warrants under our stock purchase program may result in dilution of the economic interests of our public stockholders.\nAny additional capital raised by us through the sale of equity or convertible securities or any equity or convertible securities issued as consideration in future acquisitions may also dilute your ownership in us. Furthermore, if we issue additional equity securities, our stockholders will experience dilution and the new equity securities could have rights senior to those of our Class A common stock and the Series C convertible preferred stock. Because our decision to issue securities in any future offering may depend on market conditions and other factors beyond our control, we cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of our future offerings. As a result, our stockholders bear the risk of our future securities offerings reducing the market price of our Class A common stock and diluting their interest in us.\nRCS Capital Corporation and Subsidiaries\nDecember 31, 2014\nOur ability to pay dividends is restricted.\nWe paid cash dividends to our Class A common stockholders on a quarterly basis as approved by our board of directors commencing in July 2013 (with respect to the second quarter of 2013) through July 2014 (with respect to the second quarter of 2014). We did not pay a cash dividend with respect to subsequent quarters and, at the present time, we do not expect to pay dividends in the near term, as our ability to pay cash dividends is restricted due to the negative covenants that are contained in the bank facilities and the indenture governing the convertible notes, which prohibit payment of dividends by us and our operating subsidiaries, subject to certain limited exceptions. We also do not expect to pay cash dividends on the Series B preferred stock and the Series C convertible preferred stock in future subsequent quarters for the same reason.\nOur stockholders also may not receive the same dividends for other reasons, including the following:\n\u2022\nwe may not have enough cash to pay such dividends due to changes in our cash requirements, capital spending plans, cash flow or financial position;\n\u2022\nwe may desire to retain cash to maintain or improve our credit rating;\n\u2022\nour stockholders have no contractual or other legal right to dividends that have not been declared and decisions on whether, when and in which amounts to make any future distributions will remain at all times entirely at the discretion of our board of directors, which reserves the right to change our dividend practices at any time and for any reason; and\n\u2022\nthe amount of dividends that our operating subsidiaries may distribute to us may be subject to restrictions imposed by state law, or regulators and any restrictions imposed by the terms of any current or future indebtedness that these subsidiaries may incur.\nAs a consequence, we also may have to limit or eliminate payment of dividends on our Class A common stock without regard for the negative covenants described above.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws could discourage a change of control that our stockholders may favor, which could negatively affect the market price of our Class A common stock.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws may make it more difficult and expensive for a third party to acquire control of us even if a change of control would be beneficial to the interests of our stockholders. For example, our certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of preferred stock that could be issued by our board of directors to thwart a takeover attempt. In addition, the holders of the majority of the outstanding shares of our Class B common stock always will have a majority of the voting power of our outstanding common stock, and we could issue additional shares of Class B common stock without the consent of our stockholders. The market price of our Class A common stock could be adversely affected to the extent that the provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by-laws discourage potential takeover attempts that our stockholders may favor.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price and trading volume of our Class A common stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us. If few or no securities or industry analysts cover us, the market price of our Class A common stock could be negatively impacted. If securities or industry analysts cover us and if one or more of such analysts downgrades our Class A common stock or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, the price of our Class A common stock may decline. If one or more of the analysts covering us fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our Class A common stock could decline, which could cause the price and trading volume of our Class A common stock to decline.\nAll our debt obligations and outstanding preferred stock, and any future indebtedness or preferred stock we may incur or issue, will have priority over our Class A common stock with respect to payment in the event of a liquidation, dissolution or winding up.\nIn any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of our company, our Class A common stock would rank below all debt claims against us, such as claims by holders of the convertible notes, and equity securities that rank senior to our Class A common stock, such as the Series B preferred stock and the Series C convertible preferred stock. In addition, any convertible or exchangeable securities or other equity securities that we have issued, such as the Series B preferred stock and the Series C convertible preferred stock, or may issue in the future, may have rights, preferences and privileges more favorable than those of our Class A common stock. As a result, holders of our Class A common stock will not be entitled to receive any payment or other distribution of assets upon the liquidation or dissolution until after our obligations to our debt holders and holders of equity securities that rank senior to our Class A common stock have been satisfied.\nRCS Capital Corporation and Subsidiaries\nDecember 31, 2014\nWe could be subject to claims based on the delegation by our board of directors of the authority to grant restricted stock under our equity plan to our officers, which delegation has been ratified by our board of directors.\nOur board of directors or our Executive Committee delegated to our officers the authority to designate the grantees of up to 2,158,000 restricted shares of Class A common stock authorized to be issued by the board of directors or Executive Committee under our equity plan. During the period from March 17, 2014 to March 31, 2014, our officers authorized and documented the issuance of an aggregate of 1,817,238 restricted shares of Class A common stock under our equity plan. Because the Delaware General Corporate Law (\u201cDGCL\u201d) does not permit the delegation to officers of the right to issue common stock, these grants were either void or voidable under the DGCL. On May 27, 2014, our board of directors ratified the grants made under our equity plan. Under certain authority, common law ratification by our board of directors would have caused the grants to be valid stock issuances by us at the time of the respective grants. However, a recent decision of the Delaware Chancery Court (which is currently being appealed to the Delaware Supreme Court) suggests that such ratification may not be effective unless we also follow a statutory procedure provided for under Section 204 of the DGCL, which became effective after that decision of the Delaware Chancery Court. We have not followed the statutory procedure under Section 204 of the DGCL. There can be no assurance that stockholders will not assert claims that the defective corporate act or putative stock ratified is void or voidable due to the identified failure of authorization, as well as other claims related thereto, and, if asserted, that any such claims will not be successful. If the ratification were not effective, then the issuance of the shares of restricted stock would be invalid and we could have liability to grantees of the restricted stock.", "PERMNO": 14004, "SIC": 6282, "TIC": "RCAPQ"}
