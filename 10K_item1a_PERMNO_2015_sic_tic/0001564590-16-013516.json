{"cik": "350563", "company": "TECO ENERGY INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-26", "item_1A": "Item 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nRisks Associated with the Pending Acquisition by Emera\nTECO Energy and its subsidiaries are subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the Merger is pending that could adversely affect TECO Energy\u2019s financial results.\nUncertainty about the effect of the Merger on employees or vendors and others, including contractors, may have an adverse effect on TECO Energy. Although TECO Energy intends to take steps designed to reduce any adverse effects, these uncertainties may impair TECO Energy\u2019s and its subsidiaries\u2019 ability to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the Merger is completed, and could cause vendors and others, including contractors, that deal with TECO Energy to seek to change existing business relationships. Employee retention and recruitment may be particularly challenging prior to the completion of the Merger, as current employees and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their future roles with the combined company. If, despite TECO Energy\u2019s retention and recruiting efforts, key employees depart or fail to accept employment with TECO Energy or its subsidiaries due to the uncertainty of employment and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain with the combined company, following completion of the Merger. TECO Energy may incur significant costs in identifying, hiring, and retaining replacements for departing employees, which could have a material adverse effect on TECO Energy\u2019s business operations and financial results.\nTECO Energy expects that matters relating to the Merger and integration-related issues will place a significant burden on management, employees and internal resources, which could otherwise have been devoted to other business opportunities. The diversion of management time on Merger-related issues could affect TECO Energy\u2019s financial results.\nIn addition, the Merger Agreement restricts TECO Energy and its subsidiaries, from taking specified actions until the Merger occurs or the Merger Agreement is terminated, without Emera\u2019s prior written consent, including, without limitation: (i) making certain material acquisitions and dispositions of assets or businesses; (ii) making any capital expenditures in excess of specified amounts; (iii) incurring indebtedness, subject to certain exceptions; (iv) issuing equity or equity equivalents; and (v) paying quarterly cash dividends in excess of levels agreed upon in the Merger Agreement. These restrictions may prevent TECO Energy from pursuing otherwise attractive business opportunities and making other changes to its business prior to consummation of the Merger or termination of the Merger Agreement.\nFailure to complete the Merger could negatively impact the market price of TECO Energy\u2019s common stock.\nThere can be no assurance that the Merger will occur. Failure to complete the Merger may negatively impact the future trading price of TECO Energy\u2019s common stock. If the Merger is not completed, the market price of TECO Energy\u2019s common stock may decline to the extent that the current market price of TECO Energy\u2019s stock reflects a market assumption that there is a high probability that the Merger will be completed.\nAdditionally, whether or not the Merger is completed, TECO Energy will have incurred significant costs, as well as the diversion of the time and attention of management. A failure to complete the Merger may also result in negative publicity, litigation against TECO Energy or its directors and officers, and a negative impression of TECO Energy in the investment community. The occurrence of any of these events individually or in combination could have a material adverse effect on TECO Energy\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and its stock price.\nTECO Energy and Emera may be unable to obtain the required, governmental, regulatory, and other approvals required to complete the Merger.\nConsummation of the Merger is subject to the satisfaction or waiver of specified closing conditions, including (i) receipt of the remaining required regulatory approvals, including from the NMPRC, and the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States; (iii) the absence of any law or judgement that prevents, makes illegal or prohibits the closing of the Merger; (iv) the absence of any material adverse effect with respect to TECO Energy; (v) subject to certain exceptions, the accuracy of the representations and warranties of, and compliance with covenants by, each of the parties to the Merger Agreement; and (vi) other customary closing conditions. The governmental, regulatory, and other approvals required to consummate the Merger may not be obtained at all, or may not be obtained on the proposed terms and schedules as contemplated by the parties. Satisfaction of the closing conditions may delay the consummation of the Merger, such delay may cause uncertainty or other negative consequences that may have an adverse effect on TECO Energy\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations, cash flows and common stock price, and if certain closing conditions are not satisfied prior to the outside date specified in the Merger Agreement, Emera will not be obligated to consummate the Merger.\nIn the event that the Merger Agreement is terminated prior to the completion of the Merger, TECO Energy could incur significant transaction costs that could materially impact its financial performance and results of operations.\nTECO Energy will incur significant transaction costs, including legal, accounting, financial advisory, filing, printing, and other costs relating to the Merger. The Merger Agreement provides that upon termination of the Merger Agreement under certain specified circumstances, TECO Energy will be required to pay Emera a termination fee of $212.5 million from cash on hand, short-term borrowings or a combination of those sources. Any fees due as a result of termination could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nWe have been and may continue to be the target of securities class action suits and derivative suits which could result in substantial costs and divert management attention and resources.\nSecurities class action suits and derivative suits are often brought against companies who have entered into mergers and acquisition transactions. Following the announcement of the execution of the Merger Agreement, 12 putative stockholder class actions were filed challenging the Merger. In November 2015, the defendants party to the litigation entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (the \u201cMOU\u201d) with the various shareholder plaintiffs to settle, subject to court approval, all of the pending shareholder lawsuits challenging the proposed Merger. As a result of the MOU, TECO Energy made additional disclosures related to the proposed Merger in a proxy supplement filed on Nov. 18, 2015. The MOU provides for the parties to enter into a formal settlement agreement which will be submitted to the Hillsborough Circuit Court Judge for approval after completion of the Merger. Additionally the judge will consider the award of attorneys\u2019 fees to the plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers. See Note 12 to the TECO Energy Consolidated Financial Statements. Defending against these claims, even if meritless, can result in substantial costs to us and could divert the attention of our management.\nGeneral Risks\nNational and local economic conditions can have a significant impact on the results of operations, net income and cash flows at TECO Energy and its subsidiaries.\nThe business of TECO Energy is concentrated in Florida and New Mexico. While economic conditions in Florida and New Mexico have improved since the worst of the economic downturn in 2008, if they do not continue to improve or if they should worsen, retail customer growth rates may stagnate or decline, and customers\u2019 energy usage may further decline, adversely affecting TECO Energy\u2019s results of operations, net income and cash flows.\nA factor in our customer growth in both Florida and New Mexico is net in migration of new residents, both domestic and non-U.S. A slowdown in the U. S. economy could reduce the number new residents and slow customer growth. In addition, New Mexico has significant oil and natural gas production from the San Juan and Permian production basins. The current low oil and natural gas-price environment has reduced drilling activity and oil and natural gas production in some producing regions, which has reduced employment in those industries and industries that serve them. A continuation of these conditions could slow growth in the New Mexico economy, which could reduce earnings and cash flow from NMGC.\nDevelopments in technology could reduce demand for electricity and gas.\nResearch and development activities are ongoing for new technologies that produce power or reduce power consumption. These technologies include renewable energy, customer-oriented generation, energy storage, energy efficiency and more energy-efficient appliances and equipment. Advances in these or other technologies could reduce the cost of producing electricity or transporting gas, or otherwise make the existing generating facilities of Tampa Electric uneconomic. In addition, advances in such technologies could reduce demand for electricity or natural gas, which could negatively impact the results of operations, net income and cash flows of TECO Energy.\nTECO Energy\u2019s businesses are sensitive to variations in weather and the effects of extreme weather, and have seasonal variations.\nTECO Energy\u2019s utility businesses are affected by variations in general weather conditions and unusually severe weather. Energy sales by its electric and gas utilities are particularly sensitive to variations in weather conditions. Those companies forecast energy sales on the basis of normal weather, which represents a long-term historical average. If climate change or other factors cause significant variations from normal weather, this could have a material impact on energy sales.\nPGS and NMGC, which typically have short but significant winter peak periods that are dependent on cold weather, are more weather-sensitive than Tampa Electric, which has both summer and winter peak periods. NMGC typically earns all of its net income in the first and fourth quarters, due to winter weather. Mild winter weather could negatively impact results at TECO Energy.\nTECO Energy\u2019s electric and gas utilities are highly regulated; changes in regulation or the regulatory environment could reduce revenues or increase costs or competition.\nTECO Energy\u2019s electric and gas utilities operate in highly regulated industries. Their retail operations, including the prices charged, are regulated by the FPSC in Florida and the NMPRC in New Mexico, and Tampa Electric\u2019s wholesale power sales and transmission services are subject to regulation by the FERC. Changes in regulatory requirements or adverse regulatory actions could have an adverse effect on TECO Energy\u2019s utilities\u2019 financial performance by, for example, reducing revenues, increasing competition or costs, threatening investment recovery or impacting rate structure.\nIf Tampa Electric or PGS earn returns on equity above their respective allowed ranges, indicating an overearnings trend, those earnings could be subject to review by the FPSC. Ultimately, prolonged overearnings could result in credits or refunds to customers, which could reduce earnings and cash flow.\nVarious factors relating to the integration of NMGC could adversely affect TECO Energy\u2019s business and operations.\nThe anticipated accretion to earnings from NMGC during the original three-year integration period was based on estimates of synergies from the transaction and growth in the New Mexico economy, which are dependent on local and global economic conditions, normal weather and other factors, which may materially change, including:\n\u2022\nTECO Energy\u2019s estimate of NMGC\u2019s expected operating performance after the completion of the\nintegration may vary significantly from actual results.\n\u2022\nOver time, TECO Energy will be making significant capital investments to convert several\nNMGC computer systems to the systems that TECO Energy uses in Florida. These conversions\nmay not be accomplished on time or on budget, which would increase costs for NMGC. In\naddition, the time required to convert these systems will cause NMGC to operate the existing\nsystems past the end of their normal lives, which could reduce reliability.\n\u2022\nThe potential loss of key employees of TECO Energy or NMGC who may be uncertain\nabout their future roles in the TECO Energy/NMGC organization.\nNegative impacts from these factors could have an adverse effect on TECO Energy\u2019s business, financial condition, and results of operations. Accordingly, the synergies expected from the acquisition of NMGC may not be achievable in the anticipated amount or timeframe, or at all.\nChanges in the environmental laws and regulations affecting its businesses could increase TECO Energy\u2019s costs or curtail its activities.\nTECO Energy\u2019s businesses are subject to regulation by various governmental authorities dealing with air, water and other environmental matters. Changes in compliance requirements or the interpretation by governmental authorities of existing requirements may impose additional costs on TECO Energy, requiring cost-recovery proceedings and/or requiring it to curtail some of its businesses\u2019 activities.\nRegulations on the disposal and/or storage of CCRs could add to Tampa Electric\u2019s operating costs.\nThe U.S. EPA published a new CCR rule in the U.S. Federal Register on April 17, 2015, setting federal standards for companies that dispose of CCRs in onsite landfills and impoundments. The rule went into effect on Oct. 19, 2015, and contains design and operating standards for CCR management units. Tampa Electric is currently evaluating various options for demonstrating compliance with the rule. The initial assessment is that activities in 2016 will consist primarily of monitoring and testing of the two existing CCR impoundments that are affected by this rule. Potential capital expenditures that may be required to comply with this rule are not expected to be significant. This rule is likely to face continued legal challenges by the utility industry and environmental groups, and legislation is required to fix certain portions of the rule. At this time, the ultimate outcome of any litigation or legislation is uncertain, so that it is not possible to predict the ultimate impact on Tampa Electric. While certain costs related to environmental compliance are currently recoverable from customers under Florida\u2019s ECRC, TECO Energy cannot be assured that any increased costs associated with the new regulations will be eligible for such treatment.\nFederal or state regulation of GHG emissions, depending on how they are enacted, could increase TECO Energy\u2019s costs or the rates charged to TECO Energy customers, which could curtail sales.\nAmong TECO Energy\u2019s companies, Tampa Electric has the most significant number of stationary sources with air emissions.\nCurrent regulation in Florida allows utility companies to recover from customers prudently incurred costs for compliance with new state or federal environmental regulations. Tampa Electric would expect to recover from customers the costs of power plant modifications or other costs required to comply with new GHG emission regulation. If the regulation allowing cost recovery is changed and the cost of compliance is not recovered through the ECRC, Tampa Electric could seek to recover those costs through a base-rate proceeding, but TECO Energy cannot be assured that the FPSC would grant such recovery. Under the Clean Power Plan, each state is responsible for implementing its own regulations to accord to the federal standards. Accordingly, a change in Florida\u2019s regulatory landscape could significantly increase Tampa Electric\u2019s costs. Changes in compliance requirements or the interpretation by governmental authorities of existing requirements may impose additional costs on TECO Energy requiring FPSC cost recovery proceedings and/or requiring it to curtail some of its business activities.\nThe Clean Power Plan establishes state-specific emission rate and mass-based goals measured against a 2012 baseline. As Tampa Electric\u2019s investments in lower-GHG production largely occurred before 2012 and are factored into Florida\u2019s baseline generating capacity, Tampa Electric may encounter more difficulty than its competitors in achieving cost-effective GHG emission reductions. Because the ultimate form of Florida\u2019s state plan remains unknown, the increased compliance costs that Tampa Electric may face as a result of the Clean Power Plan are currently uncertain.\nOn Feb. 9, 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a stay against enforcement of the Clean Power Plan for the electricity sector pending resolution of the legal challenges before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The timing of the resolution of the legal challenges and the removal of the stay by the U.S. Supreme Court is uncertain, but it is likely to delay further actions by the states until 2018.\nIn 2015, there was a proposed constitutional ballot initiative for the 2016 election approved by the Florida Supreme Court to promote increased direct sale and use of solar energy to generate electricity which has now been delayed to the 2018 election.\nThere is a corresponding legislative proposal for the current 2016 legislative session that could, if successful, promote increased direct sale and use of solar energy to generate electricity.\nThe potential amendment to the Florida constitution in 2018 and potential corresponding 2016 legislation would encourage the installation of solar arrays to generate electricity by retail customers and third parties, and to allow sales of electricity by non-utility generators. Increased use of solar generation and sales by third parties would reduce energy sales and revenues at Tampa Electric. In addition, Tampa Electric could make investments in facilities to serve customers during periods that solar energy is not available that would not be profitable.\nNMGC operates high-pressure natural gas transmission pipelines, which involve risks that may result in accidents or otherwise affect its operations.\nThere are a variety of hazards and operating risks inherent in operating high-pressure natural gas transmission pipelines, such as leaks, explosions, mechanical problems, activities of third parties and damage to pipelines, facilities and equipment caused by floods, fires and other natural disasters that may cause substantial financial losses. In addition, these risks could result in significant injury, loss of life, significant damage to property, environmental pollution and impairment of operations, any of which could result in substantial losses. For pipeline assets located near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers, industrial sites and other public gathering areas, known as High Consequence Areas, the level of damage resulting from these risks could be greater. NMGC does not maintain insurance coverage against all of these risks and losses, and any insurance coverage it might maintain may not fully cover damages caused by those risks and losses. Therefore, should any of these risks materialize, it could have a material adverse effect on TECO Energy\u2019s business, earnings, financial condition and cash flows.\nNMGC\u2019s high-pressure transmission pipeline operations are subject to pipeline safety laws and regulations, compliance with which may require significant capital expenditures, increase TECO Energy\u2019s cost of operations and affect or limit its business plans.\nTECO Energy\u2019s pipeline operations are subject to pipeline safety regulation administered by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (\u201cPHMSA\u201d) of the U.S. Department of Transportation. These laws and regulations require TECO Energy to comply with a significant set of requirements for the design, construction, maintenance and operation of its pipelines. These regulations, among other things, include requirements to monitor and maintain the integrity of its pipelines. The regulations determine the pressures at which its pipelines can operate.\nPHMSA is designing an Integrity Verification Process intended to create standards to verify maximum allowable operating pressure, and to improve and expand pipeline integrity management processes. There remains uncertainty as to how these standards will be implemented, but it is expected that the changes will impose additional costs on new pipeline projects as well as on existing operations. Pipeline failures or failures to comply with applicable regulations could result in reduction of allowable operating pressures as authorized by PHMSA, which would reduce available capacity on TECO Energy\u2019s pipelines. Should any of these risks materialize, it may have a material adverse effect on TECO Energy\u2019s operations, earnings, financial condition and cash flows.\nResults at TECO Energy\u2019s utilities may be affected by changes in customer energy-usage patterns.\nFor the past several years, at Tampa Electric, and electric utilities across the United States, weather-normalized electricity consumption per residential customer has declined due to the combined effects of voluntary conservation efforts, economic conditions, and improvements in lighting and appliance efficiency.\nForecasts by TECO Energy\u2019s utilities are based on normal weather patterns and historical trends in customer energy-usage patterns. The ability of TECO Energy\u2019s utilities to increase energy sales and earnings could be negatively impacted if customers continue to use less energy in response to increased energy efficiency, economic conditions or other factors.\nTECO Energy\u2019s computer systems and the infrastructure of its utility companies are subject to cyber- (primarily electronic or internet-based) or physical attacks, which could disrupt operations, cause loss of important data or compromise customer-, employee-related or other critical information or systems, or otherwise adversely affect its business and financial results and condition.\nThere have been an increasing number of cyberattacks on companies around the world, which have caused operational failures or compromised sensitive corporate or customer data. These attacks have occurred over the Internet, through malware, viruses, attachments to e-mails, through persons inside of the organization or through persons with access to systems inside of the organization.\nTECO Energy has security systems and infrastructure in place that are designed to prevent such attacks, and these systems are subject to internal, external and regulatory audits to ensure adequacy. Despite these efforts, TECO Energy cannot be assured that a cyberattack will not cause electric or gas system operational problems, disruptions of service to customers, compromise important data or systems, or subject it to additional regulation, litigation or damage to its reputation.\nThere have also been physical attacks on critical infrastructure at other utilities. While the transmission and distribution system infrastructure of TECO Energy\u2019s utility companies are designed and operated in a manner intended to mitigate the impact of this type of attack, in the event of a physical attack that disrupts service to customers, revenues would be reduced and costs would be incurred to repair any damage. These types of events, either impacting TECO Energy\u2019s facilities or the industry in general, could also cause TECO Energy to incur additional security- and insurance-related costs, and could have adverse effects on its business and financial results and condition.\nPotential competitive changes may adversely affect TECO Energy\u2019s regulated electric and gas businesses.\nThere is competition in wholesale power sales across the United States. Some states have mandated or encouraged competition at the retail level and, in some situations, required divestiture of generating assets. While there is active wholesale competition in Florida, the retail electric business has remained substantially free from direct competition. Although not expected in the foreseeable future, changes in the competitive environment occasioned by legislation, regulation, market conditions or initiatives of other electric power providers, particularly with respect to retail competition, could adversely affect Tampa Electric\u2019s business and its expected performance.\nThe gas distribution industry has been subject to competitive forces for a number of years. Gas services provided by TECO Energy\u2019s gas utilities are unbundled for all non-residential customers. Because its gas utilities earn margins on distribution of gas but not on the commodity itself, unbundling has not negatively impacted TECO Energy\u2019s results. However, future structural changes could adversely affect PGS and NMGC.\nIncreased customer use of distributed generation could adversely affect TECO Energy\u2019s regulated electric utility business.\nIn many areas of the United States, there is growing use of rooftop solar panels, small wind turbines and other small-scale methods of power generation, called distributed generation, by individual residential, commercial and industrial customers. Distributed generation is encouraged and supported by various special interest groups, tax incentives, renewable portfolio standards and special rates designed to support such generation. Additionally, the EPA\u2019s Clean Power Plan could have the effect of providing greater incentives for distributed generation in order to meet state-based emission reduction targets under the proposed rule.\nIncreased usage of distributed generation, particularly in those states where solar or wind resources are the most abundant, is reducing utility electricity sales but not reducing the need for ongoing investment in infrastructure to maintain or expand the transmission and distribution grid to reliably serve customers. Continued utility investment that is not supported by increased energy sales causes rates to increase for customers, which could further reduce energy sales and reduce profitability.\nThe value of TECO Energy\u2019s existing deferred tax benefits are determined by existing tax laws and could be negatively impacted by changes in these laws.\n\u201cComprehensive tax reform\u201d remains a topic of discussion in the U.S. Congress. Such legislation could significantly alter the existing tax code, including a reduction in corporate income tax rates. Although a reduction in the corporate income tax rate could result in lower future tax expense and tax payments, it would reduce the value of TECO Energy\u2019s existing deferred tax asset and could result in a charge to earnings from the write-down of that asset, and it would reduce future tax payments received by TECO Energy from its subsidiaries.\nTECO Energy relies on some natural gas transmission assets that it does not own or control to deliver natural gas. If transmission is disrupted, or if capacity is inadequate, TECO Energy\u2019s ability to sell and deliver natural gas and supply natural gas to its customers and its electric generating stations may be hindered.\nTECO Energy depends on transmission facilities owned and operated by other utilities and energy companies to deliver the natural gas it sells to the wholesale and retail markets, as well as the natural gas it purchases for use in its electric generation facilities. If transmission is disrupted, or if capacity is inadequate, its ability to sell and deliver products and satisfy its contractual and service obligations could be adversely affected.\nDisruption of fuel supply could have an adverse impact on the financial condition of TECO Energy.\nTampa Electric, PGS and NMGC depend on third parties to supply fuel, including natural gas and coal. As a result, there are risks of supply interruptions and fuel-price volatility. Disruption of fuel supplies or transportation services for fuel, whether because of weather-related problems, strikes, lock-outs, break-downs of locks and dams, pipeline failures or other events, could impair the ability to deliver electricity or gas or generate electricity and could adversely affect operations. Further, the loss of coal suppliers or the inability to renew existing coal and natural gas contracts at favorable terms could significantly affect the ability to serve customers and have an adverse impact on the financial condition and results of operations of TECO Energy.\nCommodity price changes may affect the operating costs and competitive positions of TECO Energy\u2019s businesses.\nTECO Energy\u2019s businesses are sensitive to changes in coal, gas, oil and other commodity prices. Any changes in the availability of these commodities could affect the prices charged by suppliers as well as suppliers\u2019 operating costs and the competitive positions of their products and services.\nIn the case of Tampa Electric, fuel costs used for generation are affected primarily by the cost of coal and natural gas. Tampa Electric is able to recover prudently incurred costs of fuel through retail customers\u2019 bills, but increases in fuel costs affect electric prices and, therefore, the competitive position of electricity against other energy sources.\nThe ability to make sales of, and the margins earned on, wholesale power sales are affected by the cost of fuel to Tampa Electric, particularly as it compares to the costs of other power producers.\nIn the case of PGS and NMGC, costs for purchased gas and pipeline capacity are recovered through retail customers\u2019 bills, but increases in gas costs affect total retail prices and, therefore, the competitive positions of PGS and NMGC as compared to electricity, other forms of energy and other gas suppliers.\nThe facilities and operations of TECO Energy could be affected by natural disasters or other catastrophic events.\nTECO Energy\u2019s facilities and operations are exposed to potential damage and partial or complete loss resulting from environmental disasters (e.g. floods, high winds, fires and earthquakes), equipment failures, vandalism, potentially catastrophic events such as the occurrence of a major accident or incident at one of the sites, and other events beyond the control of TECO Energy. The operation of transmission and distribution systems involves certain risks, including gas leaks, fires, explosions, pipeline ruptures and other hazards and risks that may cause unforeseen interruptions, personal injury or property damage. Any such incident could have an adverse effect on TECO Energy and any costs relating to such events may not be recoverable through insurance or recovered in rates. In certain cases, there is potential that such an event may not excuse TECO Energy\u2019s utility companies from servicing customers as required by their respective tariffs.\nThe franchise rights held by TECO Energy\u2019s utilities could be lost in the event of a breach by such TECO Energy utilities or could expire and not be renewed.\nTECO Energy\u2019s utilities hold franchise rights that are memorialized in agreements with selected counterparties throughout their service areas. In some cases these rights could be lost in the event of a breach of these agreements by the applicable TECO Energy utility. In addition, these agreements are for set periods and could expire and not be renewed upon expiration of the then-current terms. Some agreements also contain provisions allowing municipalities to purchase the portion of the applicable utility\u2019s system located within a given municipality\u2019s boundaries under certain conditions.\nTampa Electric, PGS and NMGC may not be able to secure adequate rights of way to construct transmission lines, gas interconnection lines and distribution-related facilities and could be required to find alternate ways to provide adequate sources of energy and maintain reliable service for their customers.\nTampa Electric, PGS and NMGC rely on federal, state and local governmental agencies and, in New Mexico, cooperation with local Native American tribes and councils, to secure rights of way and siting permits to construct transmission lines, gas interconnection lines and distribution-related facilities. If adequate rights of way and siting permits to build new transportation and transmission lines cannot be secured:\n\u2022\nTampa Electric, PGS and NMGC may need to remove or abandon its facilities\non the property covered by rights of way or franchises and seek alternative locations for its\ntransmission or distribution facilities;\n\u2022\nTampa Electric, PGS and NMGC may need to rely on more costly alternatives to provide\nenergy to their customers;\n\u2022\nTampa Electric, PGS and NMGC may not be able to maintain reliability in their service areas; and/or\n\u2022\nTampa Electric\u2019s, PGS\u2019s and NMGC\u2019s ability to provide electric or gas service to new\ncustomers may be negatively impacted.\nImpairment testing of certain long-lived assets could result in impairment charges.\nTECO Energy assesses long-lived assets and goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances occur that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of those assets below their carrying values. To the extent the value of goodwill or a long-lived asset becomes impaired, TECO Energy may be required to record non-cash impairment charges that could have a material adverse impact on TECO Energy\u2019s financial condition and results from operations. In connection with the NMGC acquisition, TECO Energy recorded additional goodwill and long-lived assets that could become impaired.\nTECO Energy has substantial indebtedness, which could adversely affect its financial condition and financial flexibility.\nTECO Energy has substantial indebtedness, which has resulted in fixed charges it is obligated to pay. The level of TECO Energy\u2019s indebtedness and restrictive covenants contained in its debt obligations could limit its ability to obtain additional financing (see Management\u2019s Discussion & Analysis - Significant Financial Covenants section).\nTECO Energy, TECO Finance, TEC, NMGC and NMGI must meet certain financial covenants as defined in the applicable agreements to borrow under their respective credit facilities. Also, TECO Energy and its subsidiaries have certain restrictive covenants in specific agreements and debt instruments.\nAlthough TECO Energy was in compliance with all required financial covenants as of Dec. 31, 2015, it cannot assure compliance with these financial covenants in the future. TECO Energy\u2019s failure to comply with any of these covenants or to meet its payment obligations could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of other outstanding debt obligations. TECO Energy may not have sufficient working capital or liquidity to satisfy its debt obligations in the event of an acceleration of all or a portion of its outstanding obligations. If TECO Energy\u2019s cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund its debt service obligations, it may be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, or to sell assets, seek additional capital or restructure or refinance its indebtedness. TECO Energy\u2019s ability to restructure or refinance its debt will depend on the condition of the capital markets and TECO Energy\u2019s financial condition at such time. Any refinancing of TECO Energy\u2019s debt could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants, which could further restrict our business operations. The terms of existing or future debt instruments may restrict TECO Energy from adopting some of these alternatives.\nTECO Energy also incurs obligations in connection with the operations of its subsidiaries and affiliates that do not appear on its balance sheet. Such obligations include guarantees, letters of credit and certain other types of contractual commitments.\nFinancial market conditions could limit TECO Energy\u2019s access to capital and increase TECO Energy\u2019s costs of borrowing or refinancing, or have other adverse effects on its results.\nTECO Finance and TEC have debt maturing in 2016 and subsequent years, which may need to be refinanced. Future financial market conditions could limit TECO Energy\u2019s ability to raise the capital it needs and could increase its interest costs, which could reduce earnings. If TECO Energy is not able to issue new debt, or TECO Energy issues debt at interest rates higher than expected, its financial results or condition could be adversely affected.\nTECO Energy enters into derivative transactions, primarily with financial institutions as counterparties. Financial market turmoil could lead to a sudden decline in credit quality among these counterparties, which could make in-the-money positions uncollectable.\nTECO Energy enters into derivative transactions with counterparties, most of which are financial institutions, to hedge its exposure to commodity price and interest rate changes. Although TECO Energy believes it has appropriate credit policies in place to manage the non-performance risk associated with these transactions, turmoil in the financial markets could lead to a sudden decline in credit quality among these counterparties. If such a decline occurs for a counterparty with which TECO Energy has an in-the-money position, TECO Energy could be unable to collect from such counterparty.\nDeclines in the financial markets or in interest rates used to determine benefit obligations could increase TECO Energy\u2019s pension expense or the required cash contributions to maintain required levels of funding for its plan.\nUnder calculation requirements of the Pension Protection Act, as of the Jan. 1, 2015, measurement date, TECO Energy\u2019s pension plan was essentially fully funded. Under MAP 21, TECO Energy is not required to make additional cash contributions over the next five years; however, TECO Energy may make additional cash contributions from time to time. Any future declines in the financial markets or further declines in interest rates could increase the amount of contributions required to fund its pension plan in the future, and could cause pension expense to increase.\nTECO Energy\u2019s financial condition and results could be adversely affected if its capital expenditures are greater than forecast.\nIn 2016, TECO Energy is forecasting capital expenditures at Tampa Electric to support the current levels of customer growth, to comply with the design changes mandated by the FPSC to harden transmission and distribution facilities against hurricane damage, to maintain transmission and distribution system reliability, to maintain coal-fired generating unit reliability and efficiency, and to add generating capacity at the Polk Power Station. TECO Energy is forecasting capital expenditures at PGS to support customer growth, system reliability, conversion of customers from other fuels to natural gas and to replace bare steel and cast iron pipe. Forecasted capital expenditures at NMGC are expected to support customer and system reliability and expansion.\nIf TECO Energy\u2019s capital expenditures exceed the forecasted levels, it may need to draw on credit facilities or access the capital markets on unfavorable terms. TECO Energy cannot be sure that it will be able to obtain additional financing, in which case its financial position could be adversely affected.\nTECO Energy\u2019s financial condition and ability to access capital may be materially adversely affected by multiple ratings downgrades to below investment grade, and TECO Energy cannot be assured of any rating improvements in the future.\nTECO Energy\u2019s senior unsecured debt is rated as investment grade by S&P at \u2018BBB\u2019, by Moody\u2019s at \u2018Baa1\u2019, and by Fitch at \u2018BBB\u2019. The senior unsecured debt of TEC is rated by S&P at \u2018BBB+\u2019, by Moody\u2019s at \u2018A2\u2019 and by Fitch at \u2018A-\u2019. The senior unsecured debt of NMGC is rated by S&P at BBB+. A downgrade to below investment grade by the rating agencies, which would require a two-notch downgrade by S&P and Fitch, and a three-notch downgrade by Moody\u2019s, may affect TECO Energy\u2019s ability to borrow, may change requirements for future collateral or margin postings, and may increase financing costs, which may decrease earnings. TECO Energy may also experience greater interest expense than it would have otherwise if, in future periods, it replaces maturing debt with new debt bearing higher interest rates due to any downgrades. In addition, downgrades could adversely affect TECO Energy\u2019s relationships with customers and counterparties.\nAt current ratings, TEC and NMGC are able to purchase electricity and gas without providing collateral. If the ratings of TEC or NMGC decline to below investment grade, Tampa Electric, PGS or NMGC, as applicable, could be required to post collateral to support their purchases of electricity and gas.\nTECO Energy is a holding company with no business operations of its own and depends on cash flow from its subsidiaries to meet its obligations.\nTECO Energy is a holding company with no business operations of its own or material assets other than the stock of its subsidiaries. Accordingly, all of TECO Energy\u2019s operations are conducted by its subsidiaries. As a holding company, TECO Energy requires dividends and other payments from its subsidiaries to meet its cash requirements. If TECO Energy\u2019s subsidiaries are unable to pay it dividends or make other cash payments to it, TECO Energy may be unable to pay dividends or satisfy its obligations.\nIn connection with the sale of TECO Coal to Cambrian, TECO Energy temporarily retained obligations under letters of indemnity that guarantee payments on bonds posted for the reclamation of mines prior to the completion of the transfer of all permits to the purchaser by the Commonwealths of Kentucky and Virginia.\nThese letters of indemnity guarantee payments to certain surety companies that issued reclamation bonds to the Commonwealths of Kentucky and Virginia in connection with TECO Coal's mining operations. Payments by TECO Energy to the surety companies would be triggered if the reclamation bonds are called upon by either of these states and the permit holder or TECO Coal or one of the affiliates transferred to Cambrian as part of the sale did not pay the surety company. Pursuant to the SPA, Cambrian is obligated to file applications required in connection with the change of ownership and control of TECO Coal and its affiliates with the appropriate governmental entities with respect to the coal mining permits. Pursuant to the terms of the SPA, Cambrian is obligated to post a bond or other appropriate collateral necessary to obtain the release of the corresponding bond(s) secured by the TECO Energy indemnity for that permit. Until the bonds secured by TECO Energy's indemnity are released, TECO Energy's indemnity will remain effective. The company is working with Cambrian on the process of replacing the bonds and expects the process to be completed in 2016.", "PERMNO": 37161, "SIC": 4931, "TIC": "TE"}
