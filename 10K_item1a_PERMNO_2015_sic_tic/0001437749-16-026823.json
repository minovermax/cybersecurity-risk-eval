Most of Bancorp\u2019s customers are in the Louisville, Indianapolis, and Cincinnati metropolitan areas. Compared to regional or national financial institutions, we are less able to spread the risks of unfavorable local economic conditions across a large number of diversified economies. Some of Bancorp\u2019s customers are directly impacted by the local economy while others have more national or global business dealings. Some of the factors influencing general economic conditions include tepid economic recovery, and government regulation. Poor economic conditions have an unfavorable impact on the demand of customers for loans and the ability of some borrowers to repay these loans. Deterioration in the quality of the credit portfolio could have a material adverse effect on financial condition, results of operations, and ultimately capital.\nFinancial condition and profitability depend on real estate values in our market area.\nBancorp offers a variety of secured loans, including commercial lines of credit, commercial term loans, real estate, construction, home equity, consumer and other loans. Bancorp\u2019s loans are secured by real estate (both residential and commercial) primarily in Bancorp\u2019s market area. In instances where borrowers are unable to repay their loans from us and there has been deterioration in the value of the loan collateral, Bancorp could experience higher loan losses which could have a material adverse effect on financial condition, results of operations, and ultimately capital.\nIf actual loan losses are greater than Bancorp\u2019s assumption for loan losses, earnings could decrease.\nBancorp\u2019s loan customers may not repay their loans according to the terms of these loans, the collateral securing the payment of these loans may be insufficient to ensure repayment and the wealth of guarantors providing guarantees to support these loans may be insufficient to aid in the repayment of these loans. Accordingly, Bancorp may experience significant credit losses which could have a material adverse effect on operating results. Bancorp makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of the loan portfolio, including the creditworthiness of borrowers and the value of collateral for repayment of many loans. In determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, Bancorp considers, among other factors, an evaluation of economic conditions and Bancorp\u2019s loan loss experience. If Bancorp\u2019s assumptions prove to be incorrect or economic problems are worse than projected, the current allowance may not be sufficient to cover loan losses and adjustments may be necessary to allow for different economic conditions or adverse developments in the loan portfolio. Such additions to the allowance, if necessary, could have a material adverse impact on financial results.\nIn addition, federal and state regulators annually review Bancorp\u2019s allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the provision for loan losses or loan charge-offs. If the regulatory agencies require any increase in the provision for loan losses or loan charge-offs for which Bancorp had not allocated, it would have a negative effect on net income.\nFluctuations in interest rates could reduce profitability.\nOur primary source of income is from the net interest spread, the difference between interest earned on loans and investments and the interest paid on deposits and borrowings. Bancorp expects to periodically experience gaps in the interest rate sensitivities of Bancorp\u2019s assets and liabilities, meaning that either interest-bearing liabilities will be more sensitive to changes in market interest rates than interest-earning assets, or vice versa. In either event, if market interest rates should move contrary to Bancorp\u2019s position, this gap will work against Bancorp and earnings will be negatively affected.\nMany factors affect the fluctuation of market interest rates, including, but not limited to the following:\n\u25cf\ninflation or deflation\n\u25cf\nrecession\n\u25cf\na rise in unemployment\n\u25cf\ntightening money supply\n\u25cf\ninternational disorder and instability in foreign financial markets\n\u25cf\nthe Federal Reserve\u2019s actions to control interest rates\nBancorp\u2019s interest rate sensitivity analysis indicates an increase in interest rates of up to 4% would decrease net interest income, primarily because the majority of Bancorp\u2019s variable rate loans have floors of 4% or higher, and are indexed to the prime rate. Since the prime rate is currently 3.50%, rates would have to increase more than 50 bp before the rates on such loans will rise. This effect negatively impacts the effect of rising rates. Deposit rates generally do not reprice as quickly as loans which negatively affects earnings as rates decline. Bancorp\u2019s asset-liability management strategy, which is designed to mitigate risk from changes in market interest rates, may not be able to prevent changes in interest rates from having a material adverse effect on Bancorp\u2019s results of operations and financial condition. Bancorp\u2019s most recent earnings simulation model estimating the impact of changing interest rates on earnings indicates net interest income will decrease approximately 3.1% if interest rates immediately decrease 100 basis points for the next 12 months and decrease approximately 1.9% if rates increase 100 basis points.\nSignificant stock market volatility could negatively affect Bancorp\u2019s financial results.\nCapital and credit markets experience volatility and disruption from time to time. These conditions place downward pressure on credit availability, credit worthiness and customers\u2019 inclinations to borrow. Prolonged volatility or a significant disruption could negatively impact customers\u2019 ability to seek new loans or to repay existing loans. The personal wealth of many borrowers and guarantors has historically added a source of financial strength to certain loans and would be negatively impacted by severe market declines. Sustained reliance on their personal assets to make loan payments would result in deterioration of their liquidity, and could result in loan defaults.\nIncome from investment management and trust services constitutes approximately 45% of non-interest income. Trust assets under management are expressed in terms of market value, and a significant portion of fee income is based upon those values. A large majority of investment management and trust fees are based on market values which generally fluctuate with the overall stock market.\nCompetition with other financial institutions could adversely affect profitability.\nBancorp operates in a highly competitive industry that could become even more so as a result of earnings pressure of contending banks, legislative, regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation. Bancorp faces vigorous competition in price and structure of financial products from banks and other financial institutions. Bancorp also competes with other non-traditional providers of financial services, such as brokerage firms and insurance companies. As internet-based financial services continue to grow in acceptance, Bancorp must remain relevant as a place where consumers and businesses value personal service while our competition offers these services without human interaction. These sources of competition may reduce or limit margins on banking services, reduce market share and adversely affect results of operations and financial condition.\nCredit unions continue to grow in popularity and size, and their expansion into business lending is growing. Because credit unions are not subject to federal income tax, and Bancorp pays federal income tax at a marginal rate of 35%, these companies have a significant competitive advantage over Bancorp. This advantage may have a negative impact on Bancorp\u2019s growth and resultant financial results as these credit unions continue to expand.\nDecreased residential mortgage origination, volume and pricing decisions of competitors could affect net income\nBancorp originates, sells and services residential mortgage loans. Changes in interest rates and pricing decisions by our loan competitors affect demand for Bancorp\u2019s residential mortgage loan products, the revenue realized on the sale of loans and revenues received from servicing such loans for others, ultimately reducing Bancorp\u2019s net income. New regulations, increased regulatory reviews, and/or changes in the structure of the secondary mortgage markets which Bancorp utilizes to sell mortgage loans may be introduced and may increase costs and make it more difficult to operate a residential mortgage origination business.\nAn extended disruption of vital infrastructure or a security breach could negatively impact Bancorp\u2019s business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nBancorp\u2019s operations depend upon, among other things, infrastructure, including equipment and facilities. Extended disruption of vital infrastructure by fire, power loss, natural disaster, telecommunications failure, information systems breaches, terrorist activity or the domestic and foreign response to such activity, or other events outside of Bancorp\u2019s control could have a material adverse impact on the financial services industry as a whole and on Bancorp\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition. Bancorp\u2019s business continuity plan may not work as intended or may not prevent significant interruption of operations. The occurrence of any failures, interruptions, or security breaches of information systems could damage Bancorp\u2019s reputation, result in the loss of customer business, subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny, or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability, any of which could have an adverse effect on Bancorp\u2019s financial condition and results of operation.\nBancorp\u2019s assets which are at risk for cyber-attacks include financial assets and non-public information belonging to customers. Cyber security risks include cyber espionage, blackmail, ransom, theft, and corporate account takeovers. Bancorp employs many preventive and detective controls to protect its assets, and provides mandatory recurring information security training to all employees. Bancorp utilizes multiple third-party vendors who have access to our assets via electronic media. Bancorp requires third parties to have similar or superior controls in place.\nBancorp\u2019s accounting policies and methods are critical to how Bancorp reports its financial condition and results of operations. They require management to make estimates about matters that are uncertain.\nAccounting policies and methods are fundamental to how Bancorp records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. Bancorp must exercise judgment in selecting and applying these accounting policies and methods so they comply with United States generally accepted accounting principles (\u201cUS GAAP\u201d).\nBancorp has identified certain accounting policies as being critical because they require management\u2019s judgment to ascertain the valuations of assets, liabilities, commitments and contingencies. A variety of factors could affect the ultimate value that is obtained either when earning income, recognizing an expense, recovering an asset, or reducing a liability. Bancorp has established detailed policies and control procedures that are intended to ensure these critical accounting estimates and judgments are well controlled and applied consistently.\nA credit impairment standard based on the current expected credit loss (CECL) model is expected to be issued in a future period and could significantly change the way Bancorp recognizes credit impairment on financial assets. The initial recognition of CECL differs from current US GAAP because recognition of credit losses will not be based on any triggering event. This should generally result in credit impairment being recognized earlier and immediately after the financial asset is originated or purchased. Under current US GAAP, credit impairment losses are determined using an incurred-loss model, which recognizes credit losses only when it is probable that all contractual cash flows will not be collected. Bancorp may need to develop or revise accounting processes and internal controls. These processes and controls will require significant judgment, collection of additional data, and use of estimates. Technology also may need to be upgraded or modified to capture additional data to support the accounting and disclosure requirements.\nThe policies and procedures are intended to ensure that the process for changing methodologies occurs in an appropriate manner. Because of the uncertainty surrounding Bancorp\u2019s judgments and the estimates pertaining to these matters, there can be no assurances that actual results will not differ from those estimates. See the \u201cCritical Accounting Policies\u201d in the \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d for more information.\nBancorp operates in a highly regulated environment and may be adversely affected by changes in federal, state and local laws and regulations.\nBancorp is subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by federal and state banking authorities. Any change in applicable regulations or federal or state legislation could have a substantial impact on Bancorp and its operations. Additional legislation and regulations may be enacted or adopted in the future that could significantly affect Bancorp\u2019s powers, authority and operations, which could have a material adverse effect on Bancorp\u2019s financial condition and results of operations. The exercise of regulatory power may have negative impact on Bancorp\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nBancorp\u2019s ability to stay current on technological changes in order to compete and meet customer demands is constantly being challenged.\nThe financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes, with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. The future success of Bancorp will depend, in part, upon its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands for convenience, as well as to create additional operational efficiencies and greater privacy and security protection for customers and their personal information. Many of Bancorp\u2019s competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. Bancorp may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services as quickly as competitors or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers. Failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could impair Bancorp\u2019s ability to effectively compete to retain or acquire new business and could have an adverse impact on its business, financial position, results of operations and liquidity.\nBancorp may not be able to attract and retain skilled people.\nBancorp\u2019s success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain key people. Competition for the best people in the industry and the markets in which we engage can be intense, and we may not be able to retain or hire the people we want or need. In order to attract and retain qualified employees, we must compensate them at market levels. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain qualified employees, or do so at rates necessary to maintain our competitive position, our performance, including our competitive position, could suffer, and, in turn, adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.", "PERMNO": 79013, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "SYBT"}
