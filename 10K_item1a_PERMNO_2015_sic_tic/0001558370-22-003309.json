{"cik": "1160791", "company": "GOLD RESOURCE CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-10", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS\nOur business and the mining industry in general are influenced by significant risk and uncertainties. These risks include those described below and may include additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial. Our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by any of these risks, and the trading price of our common stock could decline by virtue of these risks. These risks should be read in conjunction with the other information in this annual report on Form 10-K.\nFinancial Risks\nOur results of operations, cash flows and the value of our properties are highly dependent on the market prices of gold, silver and certain base metals, and these prices can be volatile.\nThe profitability of our mining operations and the value of our mining properties are directly related to the market price of gold, silver, copper, lead, and zinc. The price of gold and silver may also have a significant influence on the market price of our common stock. The market price of these metals historically has fluctuated significantly and are affected by numerous factors beyond our control, including (i) global or regional consumption patterns; (ii) supply of and demand for\nsilver and gold on a worldwide basis; (iii) speculative and hedging activities; (iv) expectations for inflation; (v) political and economic conditions; (vi) supply of, and demand for, consumables required for extraction and processing of metals, and (vii) general economic conditions worldwide. Over the last five years, gold prices (as reported on the London Metal Exchange) have fluctuated from a low of $1,151 per ounce to a high of $2,067 per ounce, and silver prices have fluctuated from a low of $12.01 per ounce to a high of $29.59 per ounce. On March 9, 2022, gold and silver prices were $1,989 per ounce and $26.18 per ounce, respectively.\nWe do not currently use hedging transactions with respect to any of our gold and silver production, and we do not expect to do so in the future. Accordingly, we are fully exposed to price fluctuations in precious metals. Effective May 18, 2021, the Company entered into a Trading Agreement with Auramet International LLC that govern non-exchange traded, over-the-counter, spot, forward, and option transactions on both a deliverable and non-deliverable basis involving various metals and currencies. Subsequently the Company entered into zinc zero cost collars. These derivatives are not designated as hedges. The zero cost collars are used to manage the Company\u2019s near-term exposure to cash flow variability from zinc price risks. We do not currently use financial instruments with respect to any of the other base metal production.\nIn the event metal prices decline or remain low for prolonged periods of time, we might be unable to develop our exploration properties, which may materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial performance, and cash flows. An asset impairment charge may result from the occurrence of unexpected adverse events that impact our estimates of expected cash flows generated from our mining operations or the market value of our non-producing properties, including a material diminution in the price of metals.\nWe may not continue to be profitable.\nOur single producing asset may not generate sufficient cash flow to cover our operating, development, exploration, and other costs due to certain risk factors. Unexpected interruptions in our mining business may cause us to incur losses, or the revenue that we generate from extraction may not be sufficient to fund continuing operations, including exploration and mine development costs. Our failure to generate future profits may materially adversely affect the price of our common stock, and stockholders may lose all or part of their investment. Metal prices have a significant impact on our profit margin, and there is no assurance that we will be profitable in the future. See \u201cRisk Factors - Our results of operations, cash flows and the value of our properties are highly dependent on the market prices of gold, silver and certain base metals and these prices can be volatile.\u201d\nWe may not have access to sufficient future capital.\nWe may be required to expend significant funds to determine if Mineral Reserves exist at any of our non-producing properties, continue exploration, and if warranted, develop our existing properties and identify and acquire additional properties to diversify our property portfolio.\nOur ability to obtain necessary funding for these purposes, in turn, depends upon a number of factors, including our historical and prospective results of operations, the status of the national and worldwide economy, the price of gold, silver, and other metals, the condition of the debt and equity markets, and the costs associated with extracting minerals. We may not be successful in generating or obtaining the required financing, or if we can obtain such financing, such financing may not be on terms that are favorable to us. We also may not be able to obtain funding by monetizing additional non-core exploration or other assets at an acceptable price.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain financing to fund our general and administrative costs and other working capital needs to fund our continuing business activities in the future on favorable terms or at all. Failure to obtain financing could result in delay or indefinite postponement of further mining operations, exploration, and construction, as well as the possible partial or total loss of our interest in our properties.\nOur ability to recognize the benefits of deferred tax assets is dependent on future cash flows and taxable income.\nWe recognize deferred tax assets when the tax benefit is considered to be more likely than not of being realized; otherwise, a valuation allowance is applied against deferred tax assets. Assessing the recoverability of deferred tax assets requires management to make significant estimates related to expectations of future taxable income. Estimates of future taxable income are based on forecasted cash flows from operations and the application of existing tax laws in each jurisdiction. To the extent that future cash flows and taxable income differ significantly from estimates, our ability to realize the deferred tax assets could be impacted. Additionally, future changes in tax laws could limit our ability to realize the future tax benefits represented by our deferred tax assets.\nOur accounting and other estimates may be imprecise.\nPreparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and related disclosure of assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reporting periods. The more significant areas requiring the use of management assumptions and estimates relate to:\n\u25cf\nMineral Resources and other resources that are the basis for future income and cash flow estimates and units-of-production depreciation, depletion and amortization calculations;\n\u25cf\nFuture ore grades, throughput, and recoveries;\n\u25cf\nFuture metals prices;\n\u25cf\nFuture capital and operating costs;\n\u25cf\nEnvironmental, reclamation, and closure obligations;\n\u25cf\nGold and Silver Stream Agreements;\n\u25cf\nPermitting and other regulatory considerations;\n\u25cf\nAsset impairments;\n\u25cf\nAsset acquisition accounting, including the valuation of the transaction and related instruments;\n\u25cf\nFuture foreign exchange rates, inflation rates, and applicable tax rates; and\n\u25cf\nDeferred tax asset valuation allowance.\nFuture estimates and actual results may differ materially from these estimates as a result of using different assumptions or conditions. For additional information, see Item 7. Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nWe may be required to repay a significant amount if we default under certain gold and silver stream agreements.\nWith the successful acquisition of Aquila Resources Inc. on December 10, 2021, the Company assumed substantial liabilities related to the gold and silver stream agreements with Osisko Bermuda Limited (\u201cOsisko\u201d). Under the agreements, Osisko deposited a total of $37.2 million upfront in exchange for a portion of the future gold and silver production from the Back Forty Project. The stream agreements contain customary provisions regarding default and security. In the event that our subsidiary defaults under the stream agreements, including achieving commercial production at an agreed upon date, it may be required to repay the deposit plus accumulated interest at a rate agreed with Osisko. If the Company fails to do so, Osisko may be entitled to enforce their remedies as a secured party and take possession of the assets that comprise the Back Forty Project.\nOperational Risks\nOur production is primarily derived from a single operating unit and any interruptions or stoppages in our mining activities at that operating unit would materially adversely affect our revenue.\nWe are largely dependent on revenues from a single operating unit to fund our operations. Any interruption in our ability to mine this location, such as a labor strike, natural disaster, or loss of permits would negatively impact our ability to generate revenue following such interruption. Additionally, if we are unable to economically develop additional mines, we will eventually deplete the body of mineralized material and will no longer generate cash flow sufficient to fund our operations. A decrease in, or cessation of, our mining operations at this operating unit would materially adversely affect our financial performance and may eventually cause us to cease operations.\nSince our current property portfolio is limited to one operating unit, our ability to remain profitable over the long-term will depend on our ability to 1) expand the known Arista and Switchback vein systems and /or identify, explore, and develop additional properties in Mexico, and 2) successfully develop the Back Forty Project in Michigan, USA.\nGold and silver producers must continually replace reserves depleted by production to maintain production levels over the long-term and provide a return on invested capital. Depleted reserves can be replaced in several ways, including expanding known ore bodies, locating new deposits, or acquiring interests in reserves from third parties. Exploration is highly speculative in nature, capital intensive, involves many risks, and frequently unproductive. Our current or future exploration programs may not result in new mineralization. Even if significant mineralization is discovered, it will likely take many years from the initial phases of exploration until commencement of production, during which time the economic feasibility of production may change.\nFrom time to time, we may acquire mineral interests from other parties. Such acquisitions are based on an analysis of a variety of factors including historical exploration results, estimates of and assumptions regarding the extent of mineralized material, and/or reserves, the timing of production from such reserves and cash and other operating costs. In addition, we may rely on data and reports prepared by third parties which may contain information or data that we are unable to independently verify or confirm. All of these factors are uncertain and may have an impact on our ability to develop the minerals interests.\nAs a result of these uncertainties, our exploration programs and any acquisitions which we may pursue may not result in the expansion or replacement of our current production with new ore reserves or operations, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, results of operations, and financial position.\nIncreased operating and capital costs could materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nCosts at our mining properties are subject to fluctuation due to a number of factors, such as variable ore grade, changing metallurgy and revisions to mine plans in response to the physical shape and location of the ore body, as well as the age and utilization rates for the mining and processing-related facilities and equipment. In addition, costs are affected by the price and availability of input commodities, such as fuel, electricity, labor, chemical reagents, explosives, steel, concrete, and mining and processing related equipment and facilities. Commodity costs are, at times, subject to volatile price movements, including increases that could make mineral extraction less profitable. Further, changes in laws and regulations can affect commodity prices, uses and transport. Reported costs may also be affected by changes in accounting standards. A material increase in costs could have a significant effect on our results of operations and operating cash flow.\nWe could have significant increases in capital and operating costs over the next several years in connection with the development of new projects in challenging jurisdictions and in the sustaining and/or expansion of existing mining and processing operations. Costs associated with capital expenditures may increase in the future as a result of factors beyond\nour control, such as inflation. Increased capital expenditures may have an adverse effect on the results of operations and cash flow generated from existing operations, as well as the economic returns anticipated from new projects, or may make the development of future projects uneconomic.\nCompetition in the mining industry is intense, and we have limited financial and personnel resources with which to compete.\nCompetition in the mining industry for desirable properties, investment capital, and human capital is intense. Numerous companies headquartered in the United States, Canada, and elsewhere throughout the world compete for properties and human capital on a global basis. We are a small participant in the mining industry due to our limited financial and human capital resources. We presently operate with a limited number of people, and we anticipate operating in the same manner going forward. We compete with other companies in our industry to hire qualified employees and consultants when needed to successfully operate our mines and to advance our exploration properties. We may be unable to attract the necessary human capital to fully explore, and if warranted, develop our properties and be unable to acquire other desirable properties. We believe that competition for acquiring mineral properties, as well as the competition to attract and retain qualified human capital, will continue to be intense in the future.\nEstimates of proven and probable Mineral Reserves and measured and indicated Mineral Resources are uncertain, and the volume and grade of ore actually recovered may vary from our estimates.\nThe proven and probable Mineral Reserves stated in this report represent the amount of gold, silver, copper, lead, and zinc that we estimated at December 31, 2021, could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of the reserve determination. Estimates of proven and probable reserves and measured and indicated Mineral Resources are subject to considerable uncertainty. Such estimates are, to a large extent, based on the prices of gold, silver, copper, lead, and zinc, as well as interpretations of geologic data obtained from drill holes and other exploration techniques. These prices and interpretations are subject to change. If we determine that certain of our estimated Mineral Reserves or Mineral Resources have become uneconomic, we may be forced to reduce our estimates. Actual production from proven and probable reserves may be significantly less than we expect. There can be no assurance that estimates of Mineral Resources will be upgraded to Mineral Reserves or may ultimately be extracted.\nAny material changes in Mineral Reserve or Mineral Resource estimates and grades of mineralization may affect the economic viability of our current operations, our decision to place a new property into production, and/or such property\u2019s return on capital. There can be no assurance that mineral recoveries in small scale laboratory tests will be duplicated in a large-scale on-site operation in a production environment. Declines in market prices for contained metals may render portions of our Mineral Reserve or Mineral Resource estimates uneconomic and result in reduced reported mineralization or materially adversely affect the commercial viability of one or more of our properties. Any material reductions in estimates of mineralization, or of our ability to extract this mineralization, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nProducts processed from our operating mines or other mines in the future could contain higher than expected contaminants, thereby negatively impacting our financial condition.\nContracts for treatment charges paid to smelters and refineries include penalties for certain deleterious elements that exceed contract limits. If the material mined from our operating mines includes higher than expected contaminants, this would result in higher treatment expenses and penalty charges that could increase our costs and negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. This could occur due to unexpected variations in the occurrence of these elements in the material mined, problems that occur during blending of material from various locations in the mine prior to processing and other unanticipated events.\nContinuation of our mining and processing activities is dependent on the availability of sufficient water supplies to support our mining activities.\nWater is critical to our business, and the increasing pressure on water resources requires us to consider both current and future conditions in our management approach. Across the globe, water is a shared and regulated resource. Mining operations require significant quantities of water for mining, ore processing and related support facilities. Many of our properties in Mexico are in areas where water is scarce, and competition among users for continuing access to water is significant. Continuous production and mine development are dependent on our ability to acquire and maintain water rights and to defeat claims adverse to current water uses in legal proceedings. Although we believe that our operations currently have sufficient water rights and claims to cover operating demands, we cannot predict the potential outcome of future legal proceedings relating to water rights, claims and uses. Water shortages may also result from weather or environmental and climate impacts beyond our control. Shortages in water supply could result in production and processing interruptions. In addition, the scarcity of water in certain regions could result in increased costs to obtain sufficient quantities of water to conduct our operations. The loss of some or all water rights, in whole or in part, or ongoing shortages of water to which we have rights or significantly higher costs to obtain sufficient quantities of water (or the failure to procure sufficient quantities of water) could result in our inability to maintain mineral extraction at current or expected levels, require us to curtail or shut down mining operations, and prevent us from pursuing expansion or any development opportunities. Laws and regulations may be introduced in some jurisdictions in which we operate, which could also limit access to sufficient water resources, thus materially adversely affecting our operations\nThe nature of mineral exploration, mining, and processing activities involves significant hazards, a high degree of risk, and the possibility of uninsured losses.\nExploration for and the production of minerals is highly speculative and involves greater risk than many other businesses. Many exploration programs do not result in the discovery of mineralization, and any mineralization discovered may not be of sufficient quantity or quality to be profitably mined. Our operations are, and any future mining operations or construction we may conduct will be, subject to all of the operating hazards and risks normally incident to exploring for and mining of mineral properties, such as, but not limited to:\n\u25cf\nFluctuation in production costs that make mining uneconomic;\n\u25cf\nLabor disputes;\n\u25cf\nUnanticipated variations in grade and other geologic problems;\n\u25cf\nEnvironmental hazards, noxious fumes, and gases;\n\u25cf\nWater conditions;\n\u25cf\nDifficult surface or underground conditions;\n\u25cf\nIndustrial accidents;\n\u25cf\nMetallurgical and other processing problems;\n\u25cf\nMechanical and equipment performance problems;\n\u25cf\nFailure of pit walls, dams, declines, drifts, and shafts;\n\u25cf\nUnusual or unexpected rock formations;\n\u25cf\nPersonal injury, fire, flooding, cave-ins, seismic activity, and landslides; and\n\u25cf\nDecrease in the value of mineralized material due to lower gold, silver, and metal prices.\nThese occurrences could result in damage to, or destruction of, mineral properties or processing facilities, equipment, personal injury or death, environmental damage, reduced extraction and processing and delays in mining, asset write-downs, monetary losses, and possible legal liability. Although we maintain insurance for general commercial liability claims and the physical assets at our Arista and Alta Gracia mines and against risks inherent in the conduct of our business in amounts that we consider reasonable, this insurance contains exclusions and limitations on coverage and will not cover all potential risks associated with mining and exploration activities, and related liabilities might exceed policy limits. As a result of any or all of the forgoing, we could incur significant liabilities and costs that may exceed the limits of our\ninsurance coverage or that we may elect not to insure against because of premium costs or other reasons, which could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. We may also not be insured against all interruptions to our operations. Losses from these or other events may cause us to incur significant costs which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to fund activities on our properties. A significant loss could force us to reduce or suspend our operations and development.\nRevenue from the sale of metal concentrate may be materially adversely affected by loss or damage during shipment and storage at our buyer\u2019s facilities.\nWe rely on third-party transportation companies to transport our metal concentrate to the buyer\u2019s facilities for processing and further refining. The terms of our sales contracts with the buyers require us to rely, in part, on assay results from samples of our metal concentrate that are obtained at the buyer\u2019s warehouse to determine the final sales value for our metals. Once the metal concentrate leaves our processing facility, we no longer have direct custody and control of these products. Theft, loss, road accidents, improper storage, fire, natural disasters, tampering or other unexpected events while in transit or at the buyer\u2019s location may lead to the loss of all or a portion of our metal concentrate products. Such losses may not be covered by insurance and may lead to a delay or interruption in our revenue and as a result, our operating results may be materially adversely affected.\nA significant delay or disruption in sales of dor\u00e9 or concentrates as a result of the unexpected disruption in services provided by smelters or refiners could have a material adverse effect on results of operations.\nWe rely on third party smelters and refiners to refine and process and, in some cases, purchase, the gold and silver dor\u00e9 and copper, lead, and zinc concentrate produced from our mines. Access to smelters and refiners on economic terms is critical to our ability to sell our products to buyers and generate revenues. We periodically enter into agreements with smelters and refiners, some of which operate their smelting or refining facilities outside the United States, and we believe we currently have contractual arrangements with a sufficient number of smelters and refiners so that the loss of any one refiner or smelter would not significantly or materially impact our operations or our ability to generate revenues. Nevertheless, services provided by a refiner or smelter may be disrupted by operational issues, new or increased tariffs, duties or other cross-border trade barriers, the bankruptcy or insolvency of one or more smelters, or refiners or the inability to agree on acceptable commercial or legal terms with a refiner or smelter. Such an event or events may disrupt an existing relationship with a refiner or smelter or result in the inability to create a contractual relationship with a refiner or smelter, which may leave us with limited, uneconomical, or no access to smelting or refining services for short or long periods of time. Any such delay or loss of access may significantly impact our ability to sell dor\u00e9 and concentrate products. We cannot ensure that alternative smelters or refiners would be available or offer comparable terms if the need for them were to arise or that we would not experience delays or disruptions in sales that would materially and materially adversely affect results of operations.\nWe rely on contractors to conduct a significant portion of our development construction projects.\nA significant portion of our development and construction projects are currently conducted in whole or in part by contractors. As a result, our operations are subject to a number of risks, some of which are outside our control, including:\n\u25cf\nThe difficulty and inherent delay in replacing a contractor and its equipment in the event that either party terminates the agreement;\n\u25cf\nReduced control and oversight over those aspects of the work which are the responsibility of the contractor;\n\u25cf\nFailure of a contractor to perform under its agreement;\n\u25cf\nInterruption of development and construction or increased costs in the event that a contractor ceases its business due to insolvency or other unforeseen events;\n\u25cf\nInjuries or fatalities on the job as a result of the failure to implement or follow adequate safety measures;\n\u25cf\nFailure of a contractor to comply with applicable legal and regulatory requirements, to the extent it is responsible for such compliance; and\n\u25cf\nProblems of a contractor with managing its workforce, labor unrest or other related employment issues.\nIn addition, we may incur liability to third parties as a result of the actions of our contractors. The occurrence of one or more of these risks could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial position.\nRisks Related to our Exploration Activities\nThe exploration of our mineral properties is highly speculative in nature, involves substantial expenditures, and is frequently non-productive.\nMineral exploration is highly speculative in nature and frequently results in no or very little return on amounts invested to evaluate a particular property. The probability of an individual prospect ever having a \u201creserve\u201d that meets the requirements of Regulation S-K 1300 is low. Even if we do eventually discover a mineral reserve on our exploration properties, there can be no assurance that we can develop a mine and extract those minerals. Substantial expenditures are required to (i) establish the existence of a potential ore body through drilling and metallurgical and other testing techniques; (ii) determine metal content and metallurgical recovery processes to process metal from the ore; (iii) determine the feasibility of mine development and production; and (iv) construct, renovate or expand mining and processing facilities. If we discover a deposit or ore at a property, it usually takes several years from the initial phases of exploration until mineral extraction is possible, if at all. During this time, the economic feasibility of a project may change because of increased costs, lower metal prices or other factors. As a result of these uncertainties, our exploration programs may not result in the identification of proven and probable Mineral Reserves in sufficient quantities to justify developing a particular property.\nWe have and may acquire additional mining properties and our business may be negatively impacted if reserves are not located on acquired properties or if we are unable to successfully execute and/or integrate the acquisitions.\nWe have in the past, and may in the future, acquire additional mining properties. There can be no assurance that reserves will be identified on any properties that we acquire. We may experience negative impacts on the trading price of our common stock or on our ability to access capital if we successfully complete acquisitions of additional properties and reserves are not located on these properties.\nIn December 2021, we acquired the Back Forty Project when we purchased Aquila Resources Inc. The acquisition may result in various material adverse impacts on our business and the trading price of our common stock. Adverse impacts may include, without limitation, the risk that the acquisition does not achieve the expected benefits, increased cash outflows, the availability of capital, the risk of potential material adverse tax consequences for our company and shareholders. Additional risks, difficulties, and uncertainties may result from the separation of businesses that were previously co-mingled, including necessary ongoing relationships. We are conducting a definitive feasibility study to establish Mineral Reserves on the property. While we have invested significant time, money, and equity into the acquisition of the Back Forty Project, there can be no assurance that the Back Forty Project will be permitted or will ultimately be productive.\nThe success of any future acquisition would depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u25cf\nIdentifying suitable candidates for acquisition and negotiating acceptable terms;\n\u25cf\nObtaining approval from regulatory authorities and potentially our shareholders;\n\u25cf\nImplementing our standards, controls, procedures, and policies at the acquired business and addressing any pre-existing liabilities or claims involving the acquired business; and\n\u25cf\nTo the extent the acquired operations are in a country in which we have not operated historically, understanding the regulations and challenges of operating in that new jurisdiction.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully conclude any acquisitions, or that any acquisition will achieve the anticipated synergies or other anticipated positive results. Any material problems that we encounter in connection with such an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position. These factors may materially adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nRegulatory Risks\nOur operations are subject to ongoing permitting requirements which could result in the delay, suspension, or termination of our operations.\nOur operations, including our ongoing exploration drilling programs and mining, require ongoing permits from governmental and local authorities. We may also be required to obtain certain property rights to access or use our properties. Obtaining or renewing licenses and permits, and acquiring property rights, can be complex and time-consuming processes. There can be no assurance that we will be able to acquire all required licenses, permits or property rights on reasonable terms or in a timely manner, or at all, and that such terms will not be adversely changed, that required extensions will be granted, or that the issuance of such licenses, permits or property rights will not be challenged by third parties. If we cannot obtain or maintain the necessary permits or if there is a delay in receiving future permits, our timetable and business plan will be materially adversely affected.\nOur operating properties located in Mexico are subject to changes in political or economic conditions and regulations in that country.\nThe risks with respect to operating in Mexico or other developing countries include, but are not limited to: nationalization of properties, military repression, extreme fluctuations in currency exchange rates, increased security risks, labor instability or militancy, mineral title irregularities, and high rates of inflation. In addition, changes in mining or investment policies or shifts in political attitude in Mexico may materially adversely affect our business. We may be affected in varying degrees by government regulation with respect to restrictions on production, price controls, export controls, income taxes, expropriation of property, maintenance of claims, environmental legislation, land use, land claims of local people, opposition from non-governmental organizations, labor legislation, water use, and mine safety. The effect of these factors cannot be accurately predicted and may adversely impact our operations.\nMost of our properties are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations which could materially adversely affect our business.\nOur exploration and mining operations are subject to extensive laws and regulations governing land use and the protection of the environment, which control the exploration and mining of mineral properties and their effects on the environment, including air and water quality, mine reclamation, waste generation, handling and disposal, the protection of different species of flora and fauna and the preservation of lands. These laws and regulations require us to acquire permits and other authorizations for conducting certain activities. In many countries, there is relatively new comprehensive environmental legislation, and the permitting and the authorization process may not be established or predictable. We may not be able to acquire necessary permits or authorizations on a timely basis, if at all. Delays in acquiring any permit or authorization could increase the cost of our projects and could suspend or delay the commencement of extraction and processing of mineralized material.\nEnvironmental legislation in Mexico and in many other countries is evolving in a manner which will require stricter standards and enforcement, increased fines and penalties for non-compliance, more stringent environmental assessments of proposed projects, and a heightened degree of responsibility for companies and their officers, directors, and employees. Future changes in environmental regulation in the jurisdictions where our properties are located may materially adversely\naffect our business, make our business prohibitively expensive, or prohibit it altogether. We cannot predict what environmental legislation or regulations will be enacted or adopted in the future or how future laws and regulations will be administered or interpreted. Compliance with more stringent laws and regulations, as well as potentially more vigorous enforcement policies or regulatory agencies or stricter interpretation of existing laws, may (i) necessitate significant capital outlays, (ii) cause us to delay, terminate or otherwise change our intended activities with respect to one or more projects, or (iii) materially adversely affect our future exploration activities.\nClimate change and climate change legislation or regulations could impact our business.\nWe are subject to physical risks associated with climate change, which could seriously harm our results of operations and increase our costs and expenses. The occurrence of severe adverse weather conditions, including increased temperatures and droughts, fires, longer wet or dry seasons, increased precipitation, floods, hail, snow, or more severe storms may have a potentially devastating impact on our operations. Adverse weather may result in physical damage to our operations, instability of our infrastructure and equipment, washed-out roads to our properties, and alter the supply of water and electricity to our projects. Increased temperatures may also decrease worker productivity at our projects and raise ventilation and cooling costs. Should the impacts of climate change be material in nature or occur for lengthy periods of time in the areas in which we operate, our financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nChanges in the quantity of water, whether in excess or deficient amounts, may impact exploration and development activities, mining and processing operations, water storage and treatment facilities, tailings storage facilities, closure and reclamation efforts, and may increase levels of dust in dry conditions and land erosion and slope stability in case of prolonged wet conditions. Increased precipitation, extreme rainfall events may potentially impact tailings storage facilities through flooding of the water management infrastructure, exceeding surface water runoff network capacity, overtopping the facility, or undermining the slope stability of the structure. Further, increased amounts of water may result in extended periods of flooding to the mine pits and site infrastructure; or may exceed current water treatment facility capacity to store and treat water physical conditions resulting in an unintended overflow either on or off of the mine site property.\nU.S. and international legislative and regulatory action intended to ensure the protection of the environment are constantly changing and evolving in a manner expected to result in stricter standards and enforcement, larger fines and liability, and potentially increased capital expenditures and operating costs. Transitioning our business to meet regulatory, societal and investor expectations may cause us to incur higher costs and lower economic returns than originally estimated for new exploration projects and development plans of existing operations.\nOur continuing reclamation obligations at our operations could require significant additional expenditures.\nWe are responsible for the reclamation obligations related to disturbances located on all of our properties and have recorded a liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheets to cover the estimated reclamation obligation. However, there is a risk that any reserve could be inadequate to cover the actual costs of reclamation when carried out. Continuing reclamation obligations will require a significant amount of capital. There is a risk that we will be unable to fund these additional obligations and further, that the regulatory authorities may increase reclamation requirements to such a degree that it would not be commercially reasonable to continue mining and exploration activities, which may materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial performance, and cash flows.\nTitle to mineral properties can be uncertain and in the event of a dispute regarding title to our Mexican properties, it will likely be necessary for us to resolve the dispute in Mexico, where we would be faced with unfamiliar laws and procedures.\nOur ability to explore and operate our properties depends on the validity of our title to that property. Uncertainties inherent in mineral properties relate to such things as the sufficiency of mineral discovery, proper posting and marking of\nboundaries, assessment work and possible conflicts with other claims not determinable from public record. There may be valid challenges to the title to our properties which, if successful, could impair development and/or operations. The resolution of disputes in foreign countries can be costly and time consuming. In a foreign country, we face the additional burden of understanding unfamiliar laws and procedures. We may not be entitled to a jury trial, as we might be in the U.S. Further, to litigate in any foreign country, we would be faced with the necessity of hiring lawyers and other professionals who are familiar with the foreign laws. For these reasons, we may incur unforeseen costs if we are forced to resolve a dispute in Mexico or any other foreign country.\nIn most of the countries in which we operate, failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations relating to mineral right applications and tenure could result in loss, reduction or expropriation of entitlements, or the imposition of additional local or foreign parties as joint venture partners. Any such loss, reduction, or imposition of partners could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and prospects.\nUnder the laws of Mexico, mineral resources belong to the state, and government concessions are required to explore for or exploit mineral reserves. Mineral rights derive from concessions granted, on a discretionary basis, by the Ministry of Economy, pursuant to the Mexican mining law and regulations thereunder. Our concessions in Mexico are subject to continuing government regulation, and failure to adhere to such regulations will result in termination of the concession. A title defect could result in losing all or a portion of our right, title, and interest in and to the properties to which the title defect relates.\nAdditionally, in 2014, new mining concessions became subject to additional review and approval by the Mexico Ministry of Energy, and in recent years, the federal government has been reluctant to issue new mining concessions at all.\nMining concessions in Mexico give exclusive exploration and exploitation rights to the minerals located in the concessions but do not include surface rights to the real property, which requires that we negotiate the necessary agreements with surface landowners. Many of our mining properties are subject to the Mexican ejido system, requiring us to contract with the local communities surrounding the properties in order to obtain surface rights to land needed in connection with our mining exploration activities. See \u201cRisk Factors- Our ability to develop our Mexican properties is subject to the rights of the Ejido (agrarian cooperatives) who use or own the surface for agricultural purposes.\u201d\nOur ability to develop our Mexican properties is subject to the rights of the Ejido (agrarian cooperatives) who use or own the surface for agricultural purposes.\nOur ability to mine minerals is subject to maintaining satisfactory arrangements and relationships with the Ejido for access and surface disturbances. Ejidos are groups of local inhabitants who were granted rights to conduct agricultural activities on the property. We must negotiate and maintain a satisfactory arrangement with these residents in order to disturb or discontinue their rights to farm. While we have successfully negotiated and signed such agreements related to the Arista and Alta Gracia mines, our inability to maintain these agreements or consummate similar agreements for new projects could impair or impede our ability to successfully explore, develop, and mine the properties, which in turn could materially adversely affect our future cash flow.\nA significant amount of our mining properties are subject to exchange control policies, the effects of inflation, and currency fluctuations between the U.S. dollar and the Mexican peso.\nOur revenue and external funding are primarily denominated in U.S. dollars. However, certain mining, processing, maintenance, and exploration costs are denominated in Mexican pesos. These costs principally include electricity, labor, water, maintenance, local contractors, and fuel. The appreciation of the peso against the U.S. dollar increases expenses and the cost of purchasing capital assets in U.S. dollar terms in Mexico, which can adversely impact our operating results and cash flows. Conversely, depreciation of the Mexican peso decreases operating costs and capital asset purchases in U.S. dollar terms. When inflation in Mexico increases without a corresponding devaluation of the Mexican peso, our financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. The annual average inflation rate in Mexico was approximately 5.53% in 2021, 3.40% in 2020, and 3.64% in 2019. At the same time, the peso has been subject to fluctuation, which may not have been proportionate to the inflation rate and may not be proportionate to the inflation rate in the future. The value of the peso decreased by 3.08% in 2021, decreased by 5.53% in 2020, and increased by 4.45% in 2019. In addition, fluctuations in currency exchange rates may have a significant impact on our financial results. There can be no assurance that the Mexican government will maintain its current policies with regard to the peso or that the peso's value will not fluctuate significantly in the future. We cannot assure you that currency fluctuations, inflation and exchange control policies will not have an adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations, earnings, and cash flows.\nLack of infrastructure could forestall or prevent further exploration and advancement.\nExploration activities, as well as any advancement activities, depend on adequate infrastructure. Reliable roads, bridges, power sources, and water supply are important factors that affect capital and operating costs and the feasibility and economic viability of a project. Unanticipated or higher than expected costs and unusual or infrequent weather phenomena, or government or other interference in the maintenance or provision of such infrastructure, could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nOur stock price may be volatile and as a result shareholders could lose part or all of their investment.\nIn addition to other risk factors identified and due to volatility associated with equity securities in general, the value of a shareholder\u2019s investment could decline due to the impact of numerous factors upon the market price of our common stock, including:\n\u25cf\nChanges in the worldwide price for the metals we mine;\n\u25cf\nAdverse results from our exploration, development, or production efforts;\n\u25cf\nProducing at rates lower than those targeted;\n\u25cf\nPolitical and regulatory risks;\n\u25cf\nWeather conditions, including unusually heavy rains;\n\u25cf\nFailure to meet our revenue or profit goals or operating budget;\n\u25cf\nDecline in demand for our common stock;\n\u25cf\nDownward revisions in securities analysts\u2019 estimates or changes in general market conditions;\n\u25cf\nTechnological innovations by competitors or in competing technologies;\n\u25cf\nInvestor perception of our industry or our prospects;\n\u25cf\nLawsuits;\n\u25cf\nEconomic impact from spread of disease;\n\u25cf\nActions by government or central banks; and\n\u25cf\nGeneral economic trends.\nStock markets in general have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations and the market prices of individual securities have been highly volatile. These fluctuations are often unrelated to operating performance and may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock. As a result, shareholders may be unable to sell their shares at a desired price.\nPast payments of dividends on our common stock are not a guaranty of future payments of dividends.\nIn 2010, we began paying cash dividends to the holders of our common stock. However, our ability to continue to pay dividends in the future will depend on a number of factors, including, free cash flow, mine construction requirements and strategies, other acquisition and/or construction projects, spot metal prices, taxation, government-imposed royalties, and general market conditions. Further, a portion of our cash flow is expected to be retained to finance our operations and explorations and development of mineral properties. Any material change in our operations may affect future dividends which may be modified or canceled at the discretion of our Board of Directors. Any decrease in our dividend would likely have an adverse impact on the price of our common stock.\nIssuances of our stock in the future could dilute existing shareholders and materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe have the authority to issue up to 200,000,000 shares of common stock, 5,000,000 shares of preferred stock, and to issue options and warrants to purchase shares of our common stock, in some cases without shareholder approval. As of March 9, 2022, there were 88,338,774 shares of common stock outstanding. Future issuances of our securities could be at prices substantially below the price paid for our common stock by our current shareholders. We can issue significant blocks of our common stock without further shareholder approval. Because we have issued less common stock than many of our larger peers, the issuance of a significant amount of our common stock may have a disproportionately large impact on our share price compared to larger companies.\nFailure to meet the maintenance criteria of the NYSE American may result in the delisting of our common stock, which could result in lower trading volumes and liquidity, lower prices of our common shares, and make it more difficult for us to raise capital.\nOur common stock is currently listed on the NYSE American. In order to maintain that listing, we must meet certain requirements, including maintaining a minimum amount of shareholders\u2019 equity and a minimum number of public shareholders. In addition to objective standards, the NYSE American may delist the securities of any issuer if, in its opinion, the issuer\u2019s financial condition and/or operating results appear unsatisfactory; if it appears that the extent of public distribution or the aggregate market value of the security has become so reduced as to make continued listing on the NYSE American inadvisable; if the issuer sells or disposes of principal operating assets or ceases to be an operating company; if an issuer fails to comply with the NYSE American\u2019s listing requirements; if an issuer\u2019s common stock sells at what the NYSE American considers a \u201clow selling price\u201d and the issuer fails to correct this via a reverse split of shares after notification by the NYSE American; or if any other event occurs or any condition exists which makes continued listing on the NYSE American, in its opinion, inadvisable.\nIf we are unable to remain in compliance with the NYSE American continued listing requirements, our common stock may be suspended from trading on and/or delisted from the NYSE American. Although we have not been notified of any delisting proceedings, there is no assurance that we will not receive such notice in the future or that we will be able to then comply with NYSE American listing standards. If the NYSE American delists our common stock, investors may face material adverse consequences, including, but not limited to, a lack of trading market for our securities, reduced liquidity, decreased analyst coverage of our securities, and an inability for us to obtain additional financing to fund our operations.\nGeneral Risks\nOur operations may be further disrupted, and our financial results may be materially adversely affected by the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.\nThe novel strain of coronavirus known as COVID-19, which was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization in March 2020, poses a risk to our business and operations. If a significant portion of our workforce becomes unable to work or travel to our operations due to illness or state or federal government restrictions (including travel restrictions and \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d and similar orders restricting certain activities that may be issued or extended by authorities), we may be forced to reduce or suspend exploration activities and/or development projects which may impact liquidity and financial results. These restrictions have significantly disrupted economic activity in both the world, national and local economies and have caused volatility in capital markets. Our operations at the Arista mine in Oaxaca were temporarily suspended, and our cash flows were negatively impacted during 2020 and 2021 as a result. The various government restrictions arising due to the virus have curtailed the travel of our executives, which might materially adversely affect our operations on a long-term basis. The effects of the continued outbreak of COVID-19 and related government responses have caused and could continue to cause disruptions to supply chains and capital markets, reduced labor availability and productivity and a prolonged reduction in economic activity. These effects could have a variety of adverse impacts on us, including reduced demand for our products; impairment of goodwill or long-lived assets; impairment of our ability to develop and construct new mines, to operate existing projects, and to access funds from financial institutions and capital markets. In particular, these effects could disrupt or delay mining at our operating projects, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our operations, cash flow and financial condition. Due to circumstances beyond our control, including the availability and distribution of the COVID-19 vaccine, we are unable to determine the long-term impact that the COVID-19 outbreak will have on operations.\nTo the extent the COVID-19 pandemic materially adversely affects our business and financial results as discussed above, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, such as those relating to our operation and indebtedness and financing. Because of the highly uncertain and dynamic nature of events relating to the COVID-19 pandemic, it is not currently possible to estimate the impact of the pandemic on our business. However, these effects could have a material impact on our operations, and we will continue to monitor the COVID-19 situation closely.\nWe may not be able to operate successfully if we are unable to recruit, hire, retain, and develop key personnel and a qualified and diverse workforce. In addition, we are dependent upon our employees being able to safely perform their jobs, including the potential for physical injuries or illness.\nWe depend upon the services of a number of key executives and management personnel. These individuals include our executive officers and other key employees. If any of these individuals were to die, become disabled, or leave our company, we would be forced to identify and retain individuals to replace them. We may be unable to hire a suitable replacement on favorable terms should that become necessary.\nOur success is also dependent on the contributions of our highly skilled and experienced workforce. Our ability to achieve our operating goals depend upon our ability to recruit, hire, retain, and develop qualified and diverse personnel to execute on our strategy. There continues to be competition over highly skilled personnel in our industry. If we lose key personnel or one or more members of our senior management team; or if we fail to develop adequate succession plans; or if we fail to hire, retain, and develop qualified and diverse employees; our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be harmed. COVID-19 vaccine mandates and other COVID-19 related laws and policies could make hiring and retaining highly skilled key employees more difficult in the future.\nOur business is dependent upon our workforce being able to safely perform their jobs, including the potential for physical injuries or illness. If we experience periods where our employees are unable to perform their jobs for any reason,\nincluding as a result of illness (such as COVID-19), our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially adversely affected. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced temporary workforce disruptions and periods where we temporarily placed our Mexican operations in care and maintenance. These events, or if similar events occur in the future, could have a material adverse impact on the business in the future.\nWe are dependent on information technology systems, which are subject to certain risks, including cybersecurity risks, data leakage risks, and risks associated with implementation and integration.\nWe are dependent upon information technology systems in the conduct of our business. Any significant breakdown, invasion, virus, cyberattack, security breach, destruction, or interruption of these systems by employees, others with authorized access to our systems, or unauthorized persons could negatively impact our business. To the extent any invasion, cyberattack, or security breach results in disruption to our business; such as loss or disclosure of, or damage to our data or confidential information; our reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. We have implemented various measures to manage our risks related to information technology systems and network disruptions. However, given the unpredictability of the timing, nature, and scope of information technology disruptions, we could potentially be subject to production downtimes, operational delays, the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of our systems, and networks or financial losses from remedial actions, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, competitive position, financial condition, or results of operations. Our systems and insurance coverage for protecting against cyber security risks may not be sufficient. Although to date we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyberattacks, we may suffer such losses in the future. We may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures. We also may be subject to significant litigation, regulatory investigation, and remediation costs associated with any information security vulnerabilities, cyberattacks or security breaches.\nWe may also be materially adversely affected by system or network disruptions if new or upgraded information technology systems are defective, not installed properly, or not properly integrated into our operations. If we are unable to successfully implement system upgrades or modifications, we may have to rely on manual reporting processes and controls over financial reporting that have not been planned, designed, or tested. Various measures have been implemented to manage our risks related to the system upgrades and modifications, but system upgrades and modification failures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and could, if not successfully implemented, adversely impact the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting.\nOur business is subject to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws, a breach or violation of which could lead to civil and criminal fines and penalties, loss of licenses or permits and reputational harm.\nWe operate in certain jurisdictions that have experienced some degree of governmental and private sector corruption, and in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with certain local customs and practices. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or other commercial advantage. Our Code of Ethics and other corporate governance mandate compliance with these anti-bribery laws, which often carry substantial penalties. However, there can be no assurance that our internal control policies and procedures will always protect us from recklessness, fraudulent behavior, dishonesty, or other inappropriate acts committed by our affiliates, employees, contractors, or agents. As such, our corporate policies and processes may not prevent all potential breaches of law or other governance practices. Violations of these laws, or allegations of such violations, could lead to civil and criminal fines and penalties, litigation, loss of operating licenses or permits, and may damage our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position, and results of operations, or cause the market value of our common stock to decline.", "PERMNO": 12049, "SIC": 1040, "TIC": "GORO"}
