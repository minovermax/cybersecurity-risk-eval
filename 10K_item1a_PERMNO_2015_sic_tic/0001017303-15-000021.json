{"cik": "1017303", "company": "TRANSACT TECHNOLOGIES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-03-30", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInvestors should carefully consider the risks, uncertainties and other factors described below, as well as other disclosures in Management\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, because they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, and growth prospects. The risks described below are not the only ones facing our Company. Additional risks not known to us now or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations.\nWe assume no obligation (and specifically disclaim any such obligation) to update these Risk Factors or any other forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report to reflect actual results, changes in assumptions or other factors affecting such forward-looking statements, except as required by law.\nOur operating results and financial condition may fluctuate.\nOur operating results and financial condition may fluctuate from quarter to quarter and year to year and are likely to continue to vary due to a number of factors, many of which are not within our control. If our operating results do not meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors, who may derive their expectations by extrapolating data from recent historical operating results, the market price of our common stock will likely decline. Fluctuations in our operating results and financial condition may be due to a number of factors, including, but not limited to, those identified throughout this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section:\n\u00b7\nmarket acceptance of our products, both domestically and internationally;\n\u00b7\ndevelopment of new competitive products by others;\n\u00b7\nour responses to price competition;\n\u00b7\nour level of research and development activities;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the amount that we spend to develop, acquire or license new products, consumables, technologies or businesses;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the amount we spend to promote our products and services;\n\u00b7\nchanges in the cost of satisfying our warranty obligations and servicing our installed base of printers;\n\u00b7\ndelays between our expenditures to develop and market new or enhanced products and consumables and the generation of sales from those products;\n\u00b7\nthe geographic distribution of our sales;\n\u00b7\navailability of third-party components at reasonable prices;\n\u00b7\ngeneral economic and industry conditions, including changes in interest rates affecting returns on cash balances and investments, that affect customer demand;\n\u00b7\nsevere weather events (such as hurricanes) that can disrupt or interrupt the operation of our customers or suppliers facilities; and\n\u00b7\nchanges in accounting rules.\nDue to all of the foregoing factors, and the other risks discussed in this report, quarter-to-quarter comparisons of our operating results may not be an indicator of future performance.\nOur revenue and profitability depend on our ability to continue to develop, on a timely basis, new products and technologies which are free from hardware or software anomalies and cannot be fraudulently manipulated.\nThe success of newer products such as the Ithaca\u00ae 9700 food safety terminal and the Printrex\u00ae 920 and Printrex\u00ae 980 oil and gas color printers is dependent on how quickly customers in the related markets accept them given the very little market penetration these products have experienced since they are new and innovative and have limited competition. Additionally, the success of innovative technology, such as printing coupons and promotions at the slot machine using EPICENTRAL\u2122, is dependent on our casino customers' acceptance of such technology. While we have designed EPICENTRAL\u2122 to support our customers' existing investment in our Epic 950\u00ae thermal casino printers, such acceptance may nevertheless only build gradually over time or not at all. Delays in acceptance by our customers of new technologies may adversely affect our operations.\nOur success depends upon our ability to adapt our capabilities and processes to meet the demands of producing new and innovative products. Because our newer products are generally more technologically sophisticated than those we have produced in the past, we must continually refine our capabilities to meet the needs of our product innovation. If we cannot efficiently adapt our infrastructure to meet the needs of our product innovations in a timely manner, our business could be negatively impacted.\nInfringement on the proprietary rights of others could put us at a competitive disadvantage, and any related litigation could be time consuming and costly.\nThird parties may claim that we violated their intellectual property rights. To the extent of a violation of a third party\u2019s patent or other intellectual property right, we may be prevented from operating our business as planned and may be required to pay damages, to obtain a license, if available, or to use a non-infringing method, if possible, to accomplish our objectives. Any of these claims, with or without merit, could result in costly litigation and divert the attention of key personnel. If such claims are successful, they could result in costly judgments or settlements. Refer to Item 3. \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d for discussion surrounding litigation we were involved in regarding alleged misappropriation of unspecified trade secrets and confidential information.\nGeneral economic conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nGlobal economic growth has slowed and has resulted in recessions in numerous countries, including many of those in North America, Europe and Asia, where the Company does substantially all of its business. If these economic conditions continue to persist, or if they worsen, a number of negative effects on our business could result, including customers or potential customers reducing or delaying orders, the insolvency of key suppliers which could result in production delays, the inability of customers to obtain credit, and the insolvency of one or more customers. Any of these effects could impact our ability to effectively manage inventory levels and collect receivables, create unabsorbed costs due to lower net sales, and ultimately decrease our net sales and profitability including write-downs of assets.\nWe rely on resellers to sell our products and services.\nWe use a variety of distribution channels, including OEMs and distributors, to market our products. We may be adversely impacted by any conflicts that could arise between and among our various sales channels.\nOur dependence upon resellers exposes us to numerous risks, including:\n\u00b7\nloss of channel and the ability to bring new products to market;\n\u00b7\nconcentration of credit risk, including disruption in distribution should the resellers\u2019 financial condition deteriorate;\n\u00b7\nreduced visibility to end user demand and pricing issues which makes forecasting more difficult;\n\u00b7\nresellers leveraging their buying power to change the terms of pricing, payment and product delivery schedules; and\n\u00b7\ndirect competition should a reseller decide to manufacture printers internally or source printers from a competitor.\nWe cannot guarantee that resellers will not reduce, delay or eliminate purchases from us, which could have a material adverse effect upon the business, consolidated results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have outsourced a large portion of the assembly of our printers to four contract manufacturers and will be dependent on them for the manufacturing of such printers. A failure by these contract manufacturers, or any disruption in such manufacturing or the flow of product from these manufacturers, may adversely affect our business results.\nIn an effort to achieve additional cost savings and operation benefits, we have continued to outsource the manufacturing and assembly of our printers to contract manufacturers in Asia. Approximately 80% of our printer manufacturing is conducted by one third party manufacturer in Asia.\nHowever, to the extent we rely on a third-party service provider for manufacturing services, we may incur increased business continuity risks. We will no longer be able to exercise control over the assembly of certain of our products or any related operations or processes, including the internal controls associated with operations and processes conducted and the quality of our products assembled by contract manufacturers. If we are unable to effectively develop and implement our outsourcing strategy, we may not realize cost structure efficiencies and our operating and financial results could be materially adversely affected.\nIn addition, if any of our contract manufacturers experiences business difficulties or fails to meet our manufacturing needs, then we may be unable to meet production requirements, may lose revenue and may not be able to maintain relationships with our customers. Without the contract manufacturers continuing to manufacture our products and the continuing operation of the contract manufacturers\u2019 facilities, we will have limited means for the final assembly of a majority of our products until we are able to secure the manufacturing capability at another facility or develop an alternative manufacturing facility, which could be costly and time consuming and have a material adverse effect on our operating and financial results.\nThe increased elements of risk that arise from conducting certain operating processes in foreign jurisdictions may lead to an increase in reputational risk.\nAlthough we carry business interruption insurance to cover lost revenue and profits in an amount we consider adequate, this insurance does not cover all possible situations. In addition, the business interruption insurance would not compensate us for the loss of opportunity and potential adverse impact, both short-term and long-term, on relations with our existing customers resulting from our inability to produce products for them.\nThe contract manufacturers have access to our intellectual property, which increases the risk of infringement or misappropriation of this intellectual property.\nPolitical, social or economic instability in regions in which our manufacturers are located, could cause disruptions in trade, including exports to the U.S.\nA significant portion of our printers are manufactured by contract manufacturers overseas and are exported to the U.S. Any such disruption in trade, including exports to the U.S., could adversely affect our business results. Events that could cause disruptions to such exports to the U.S. include:\n\u00b7\nthe imposition of additional trade law provisions or regulations;\n\u00b7\nreliance on a limited number of shipping and air carriers who may experience capacity issues that adversely affect our ability to ship inventory in a timely manner or for an acceptable cost;\n\u00b7\nthe imposition of additional duties, tariffs and other charges on imports and exports;\n\u00b7\neconomic uncertainties and adverse economic conditions (including inflation and recession);\n\u00b7\nfluctuations in the value of the U.S. Dollar against foreign currencies;\n\u00b7\nsignificant labor disputes, such as dock strikes;\n\u00b7\nsignificant delays in the delivery of cargo due to port security considerations;\n\u00b7\nfinancial or political instability in any of the countries in which our printers are manufactured.\nWe source some of our component parts and consumable products from sole source suppliers; any disruptions may impact our ability to manufacture and sell our products.\nA disruption in the supply of such component parts and consumable products could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results.\nWe sell a significant portion of our products internationally and purchase important components from foreign suppliers. These circumstances create a number of risks.\nWe sell a significant amount of our products to customers outside the United States. Shipments to international customers are expected to continue to account for a material portion of net sales. Risks associated with sales and purchases outside the United States include:\n\u00b7\nfluctuating foreign currency rates could restrict sales, or increase costs of purchasing, in foreign countries;\n\u00b7\nforeign governments may impose burdensome tariffs, quotas, taxes, trade barriers or capital flow restrictions;\n\u00b7\npolitical and economic instability may reduce demand for our products or put our foreign assets at risk;\n\u00b7\nrestrictions on the export or import of technology may reduce or eliminate the ability to sell in or purchase from certain markets; and\n\u00b7\npotentially limited intellectual property protection in certain countries, such as China, may limit recourse against infringing products or cause us to refrain from selling in certain geographic territories.\nWe face risks associated with manufacturing forecasts.\nIf we fail to predict our manufacturing requirements accurately, we could incur additional costs or experience manufacturing delays, which could cause us to lose orders or customers and result in lower net sales. We currently use a rolling 12-month forecast based primarily on our anticipated product orders and our product order history to help determine our requirements for components and materials. It is very important that we accurately predict both the demand for our products and the lead-time required to obtain the necessary components and raw materials.\nLead times for materials and components that we order vary significantly and depend on factors such as the specific supplier, the size of the order, contract terms, and demand for each component at a given time. If we underestimate our requirements, we may have inadequate manufacturing capacity or inventory, which could interrupt manufacturing of our products and result in delays in shipments and net sales. If we overestimate our requirements, we could have excess inventory of parts. In addition, delays in the manufacturing of our products could cause us to lose orders or customers.\nIn the lottery market, we have been dependent on sales to one large customer; the loss of this customer or reduction in orders from this customer could materially affect our sales.\nWe expect that sales to one large customer will continue to represent a material percentage of our net sales for the foreseeable future. A reduction, delay or cancellation in orders from this customer, including reductions or delays due to market, economic, or competitive conditions in the industries in which we serve, could have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations.\nOur success will depend on our ability to sustain and manage growth.\nAs part of our business strategy, we intend to pursue a growth strategy. Assuming this growth occurs, it will require the expansion of distribution relationships in international markets, the successful development and marketing of new products for our existing and new markets, expanded customer service and support, and the continued implementation and improvement of our operational, financial and management information systems.\nTo the extent that we seek growth through acquisitions, our ability to manage our growth will also depend on our ability to integrate businesses that have previously operated independently. We may not be able to achieve this integration without encountering difficulties or experiencing the loss of key employees, customers or suppliers. It may be difficult to design and implement effective financial controls for combined operations and differences in existing controls for each business may result in weaknesses that require remediation when the financial controls and reporting functions are combined. As we pursue acquisitions, we may incur legal, accounting and other transaction related expenses for unsuccessful acquisition attempts that could adversely affect our results of operations in the period in which they are incurred.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement our growth strategy, or that we can successfully manage expanded operations, if they occur. As we expand, we may from time to time experience constraints that will adversely affect our ability to satisfy customer demand in a timely fashion. Failure to manage growth effectively could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nWe compete in highly competitive markets, which are likely to become more competitive. Competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technology and changes in customer requirements.\nWe face significant competition in developing and selling our printers, terminals, software, transaction supplies and services. Our principal competitors have substantial marketing, financial, development and personnel resources. To remain competitive, we believe we must continue to provide:\n\u00b7\ntechnologically advanced products that satisfy the user demands;\n\u00b7\nsuperior customer service;\n\u00b7\nhigh levels of quality and reliability; and\n\u00b7\ndependable and efficient distribution networks.\nWe cannot ensure we will be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors. Increased competition may result in price reductions, lower gross profit margins and loss of market share, and could require increased spending on research and development, sales and marketing and customer support. Some competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships with suppliers or companies that produce complementary products. Any of these factors could reduce our earnings.\nWe depend on key personnel, the loss of which could materially impact our business.\nOur future success will depend in significant part upon the continued service of certain key management and other personnel and our continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified managerial, technical and sales and marketing personnel. There can be no assurance that we will be able to recruit and retain such personnel. The loss of either Bart C. Shuldman, the Company's Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, or Steven A. DeMartino, the Company\u2019s President, Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Secretary, or the loss of certain groups of key employees, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIf we are unable to enforce our patents or if it is determined that we infringe patents held by others it could damage our business.\nProsecuting and defending patent lawsuits is very expensive. We are committed to aggressively asserting and defending our technology and related intellectual property, which we have spent a significant amount of money to develop. These factors could cause us to become involved in new patent litigation in the future. The expense of prosecuting or defending these future lawsuits could also have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we were to lose a patent lawsuit in which another party is asserting that our products infringe its patents, we would likely be prohibited from marketing those products and could also be liable for significant damages. Either or both of these results may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we lose a patent lawsuit in which we are claiming that another party\u2019s products are infringing our patents and thus, are unable to enforce our patents, it may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition to disputes relating to the validity or alleged infringement of other parties' rights, we may become involved in disputes relating to our assertion of our own intellectual property rights. Whether we are defending the assertion of intellectual property rights against us or asserting our intellectual property rights against others, intellectual property litigation can be complex, costly, protracted, and highly disruptive to business operations by diverting the attention and energies of management and key technical personnel. Plaintiffs in intellectual property cases often seek injunctive relief, and the measures of damages in intellectual property litigation are complex and often subjective or uncertain. Thus, any adverse determinations in this type of litigation could subject us to significant liabilities and costs. During the course of these lawsuits there may be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions, and other interim proceedings or developments in the litigation. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could harm the market price of our stock.\nThe inability to protect intellectual property could harm our reputation, and our competitive position may be materially damaged.\nOur intellectual property is valuable and provides us with certain competitive advantages. Copyrights, patents, trade secrets and contracts are used to protect these proprietary rights. Despite these precautions, it may be possible for third parties to copy aspects of our products or, without authorization, to obtain and use information which we regard as trade secrets.\nOur stock price may fluctuate significantly.\nThe market price of our common stock could fluctuate significantly in response to variations in quarterly operating results and other factors, such as:\n\u00b7\nchanges in our business, operations or prospects;\n\u00b7\ndevelopments in our relationships with our customers;\n\u00b7\nannouncements of new products or services by us or by our competitors;\n\u00b7\nannouncement or completion of acquisitions by us or by our competitors;\n\u00b7\nchanges in existing or adoption of additional government regulations;\n\u00b7\nunfavorable or reduced analyst coverage; and\n\u00b7\nprevailing domestic and international market and economic conditions.\nIn addition, the stock market has experienced significant price fluctuations in recent years. Broad market fluctuations, general economic conditions and specific conditions in the industries in which we operate may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nLimited trading volume and a reduction in analyst coverage of our capital stock may contribute to its price volatility.\nOur common stock is traded on the NASDAQ Global Market. During the year ended December 31, 2014, the average daily trading volume for our common stock as reported by the NASDAQ Global Market was approximately 24,000 shares. We are uncertain whether a more active trading market in our common stock will develop. In addition, many investment banks no longer find it profitable to provide securities research on micro-cap and small-cap companies. As a result, relatively small trades may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock, which could increase the volatility and depress the price of our common stock.\nFuture sales of our common stock may cause our stock price to decline.\nIn the future, we may sell additional shares of our common stock in public or private offerings, and we may also issue additional shares of our common stock to finance future acquisitions. Shares of our common stock are also available for future sale pursuant to stock options that we have granted to our employees, and in the future we may grant additional stock options and other forms of equity compensation to our employees. Sales of our common stock or the perception that such sales could occur may adversely affect prevailing market prices for shares of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through future offerings.\nIf market conditions deteriorate or future results of operations are less than expected, a valuation allowance may be required for all or a portion of our deferred tax assets.\nWe currently have deferred tax assets, which may be used to reduce taxable income in the future. We assess the realization of these deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis, and if we determine that it is more likely than not that some portion of these assets will not be realized, an income tax valuation allowance is recorded. If market conditions deteriorate or future results of operations are less than expected, or there is a change to applicable tax rules, future assessments may result in a determination that it is more likely than not that some or all of our net deferred tax assets are not realizable. As a result, we may need to establish a valuation allowance for all or a portion of our net deferred tax assets, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe cannot provide any assurance that current laws, or any laws enacted in the future, will not have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur operations are subject to laws, rules, regulations, including environmental regulations, government policies and other requirements in each of the jurisdictions in which we conduct business. Changes in laws, rules, regulations, policies or requirements could result in the need to modify our products and could affect the demand for our products, which may have an adverse impact on our future operating results. If we do not comply with applicable laws, rules and regulations we could be subject to costs and liabilities and our business may be adversely impacted.\nIntangible computer software costs may not be recoverable.\nCosts incurred in researching and developing a computer software product are charged to expense until technological feasibility has been established, at which point all material software costs are capitalized within Intangible assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets until the product is available for general release to customers. While judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established, we have determined that it is reached after all high-risk development issues have been documented in a formal detailed plan design. The amortization of these costs will be included in cost of sales over the estimated life of the product. To the extent technological feasibility of products is not achieved, related capitalized computer software costs may not be recoverable.\nOur business could be adversely affected by actual or threatened terrorist attacks or the related heightened security measures, military actions and other efforts to combat terrorism.\nOur business could be adversely affected by actual or threatened terrorist attacks or the related heightened security measures, military actions and other efforts to combat terrorism. It is possible that terrorist attacks could be directed at important locations for the gaming industry. Heightened security measures and other efforts to combat terrorism may also have an adverse effect on the gaming industry by reducing tourism. Any of these developments could also negatively affect the general economy and consumer confidence. Any downturn in the economy or in the gaming industry in particular could reduce demand for our products and adversely affect our business and results of operations. In addition, heightened security measures may cause certain governments to restrict the import/export of goods, which may have an adverse effect on our ability to buy/sell goods.\nAdditional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial also may adversely impact our business. Should any risks or uncertainties develop into actual events, these developments could have material adverse effects on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 83910, "SIC": 3577, "TIC": "TACT"}
