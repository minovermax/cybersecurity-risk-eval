{"cik": "1411906", "company": "Ampio Pharmaceuticals, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-21", "item_1A": "Item 1A.Risk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Business\nManagement has performed an analysis of our ability to continue as a going concern. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm has expressed substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern.\nBased on their assessment, management has raised concerns about our ability to continue as a going concern. In addition, our independent registered public accounting firm expressed substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going\nconcern in their report accompanying our audited financial statements. A \u201cgoing concern\u201d opinion could impair our ability to finance our operations through the sale and issuance of debt or equity securities or through bank financing. We believe that we will be able to raise additional equity or debt financing in the future; however, any future financing could be dilutive to our current stockholders. Our ability to continue as a going concern will depend on our ability to obtain additional financing. Additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms, or at all. If adequate financing is not available, we would be required to terminate or significantly curtail our operations or enter into arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain aspects of Ampion, or potential markets that we would not otherwise relinquish. If we are unable to achieve these goals, our business would be jeopardized, and we may not be able to continue operations.\nWe have incurred significant losses since inception, expect to incur net losses for the foreseeable future and may never achieve or sustain profitability.\nWe are a pre-revenue development stage biopharmaceutical company that has not generated operating revenues or profits and have therefore incurred an accumulated deficit totaling $184.6 million as of December 31, 2019. We expect to continue generating operating losses for the foreseeable future but intend to limit the extent of these losses by entering into licensing, collaboration or similar type of agreements with one or more strategic partners, which may provide us with potential fixed or contingent licensing fees and/or milestone/royalty payments. We cannot be certain that any licensing or collaboration arrangements will be obtained, or that the terms of those arrangements will result in us receiving material revenues. To obtain revenues from Ampion, we must succeed, either alone or with others, in a range of challenging activities, including successful completion of all requisite clinical trials, filing of the BLA with the FDA, obtaining marketing approval, manufacturing and commercialization, satisfying any post-marketing requirements and obtaining appropriate level of reimbursement from both private insurance and government payors. We, and/or our collaborators, may never succeed in these activities and, even if we do, or one of our collaborators does, we may never generate revenues that are significant enough to achieve profitability.\nWe will need additional capital to fund our future operations. If we do not obtain the capital necessary to fund our operations, we will be unable to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval of, and commercialize Ampion and may need to cease operations.\nDeveloping and commercializing biopharmaceutical products is a very time-consuming, expensive and uncertain process that takes years to complete. We expect our expenses could increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we finalize our current clinical trial, prepare to file our Ampion BLA with the FDA and seek marketing approval for Ampion.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we had $6.5 million of cash and cash equivalents which we expect can fund our operation into the second quarter of 2020.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on and could increase significantly as a result of many factors including:\n\u00b7\nprogress in and the costs of our clinical trials and research and development;\n\u00b7\nincremental costs should we be required to or determine to increase patient sample size beyond 1,034 patients;\n\u00b7\nprogress in and the costs of applying for regulatory approval for Ampion;\n\u00b7\nthe costs of sustaining our corporate overhead requirements and hiring and retaining necessary personnel;\n\u00b7\nthe scope, prioritization, and number of our research and development programs;\n\u00b7\nthe achievement of milestones or occurrence of other developments that trigger payments under any collaboration agreements we obtain;\n\u00b7\nthe extent to which we are obligated to reimburse, or entitled to reimbursement of, clinical trial costs under future collaboration agreements, if any;\n\u00b7\nthe costs involved in filing, prosecuting, enforcing, and defending patent claims and other intellectual property rights;\n\u00b7\nthe costs of securing manufacturing arrangements for commercial production;\n\u00b7\nthe costs of defending lawsuits and other claims by third parties or responding to various government agencies that we are required to report to or respond to inquiries from;\n\u00b7\nthe costs associated with obtaining Directors and Officers (\u201cD&O\u201d) insurance, which may be higher due to our industry and due to our current shareholder litigation and government investigation concerning trading in our publicly listed securities; and\n\u00b7\nthe likely increase in the future level of D&O policy retention amounts given the industry trend and our current experience with increased legal costs associated with our current litigation and government investigation.\nUntil we can generate ongoing operating profit on an ongoing and reliable basis, we expect to satisfy our future ongoing cash and liquidity needs through one or more of the following: (i) third-party collaboration arrangements, (ii) private or public sales of our securities, which we expect will include an \u201cat-the-market\u201d (\u201cATM\u201d) equity program, or (iii) debt financings. We cannot be certain that additional funding and incremental working capital will be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all, or that it will exist in a timely and/or adequate manner to allow for the proper execution of our near and long-term business strategy. In addition, we are subject to certain restrictions under our agreement with an investment banker that we entered into in June 2019, which may prevent us from conducting an ATM or continuous equity financing in the near term until June 2021. The investment banker may also exercise a right of first refusal to act as the investment banker or placement agent on certain future transactions. Therefore, it is possible funds may not be available on terms and conditions acceptable to management and stockholders of the Company due to these limitations or otherwise and we may be required to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate further development of Ampion and the planned filing of the BLA and/or substantially curtail or close our operations altogether.\nEven if we obtain requisite financing, it may be on terms not favorable to us, it may be costly and it may require us to agree to covenants or other provisions that will favor new investors over existing stockholders or other restrictions that may adversely affect our business. Additional funding, if obtained, may also result in significant dilution to our stockholders.\nWe may be limited in our ability to access sufficient funding through a public or private equity offering or convertible debt offering.\nNYSE American rules impose restrictions on our ability to raise funds through a private offering of our common stock, convertible debt or similar instruments without obtaining stockholder approval. Under NYSE American rules, an offering of more than 20% of our total shares outstanding at a price per share less than the greater of book or market value of the stock requires stockholder approval unless the offering qualifies as a \u201cpublic offering\u201d for purposes of the NYSE American rules. In June 2019, we sold 30.0 million shares of our common stock in a public offering, which was more than 20% of our total shares outstanding at that time at a price per share less than the greater of book or market value of the stock at that time, and if we had not been able to sell through a public offering at that time, such offering would have required stockholder approval. Under current SEC regulations, if immediately following the filing of this Annual Report, our public float is less than $75 million, and for so long as our non-affiliated public float is less than $75 million, the amount we will be able to raise through primary public offerings of securities in the twelve-month period using our current shelf registration statement on Form S-3, which was declared effective by the SEC in April 2017, or a newly filed shelf registration statement on Form S-3 will be limited to an aggregate of one-third of our non-affiliated public float, which is referred to as the baby shelf rules.\nAs of February 14, 2020, our non-affiliated public float was approximately $107.4 million, based on 156,250,310 shares of outstanding common stock held by non-affiliates at a price of $0.69 per share, which was the last reported sale price of the Company\u2019s common stock on the NYSE American Market on February 14, 2020. While we do not anticipate that we will be subject to the baby shelf rules immediately after filing our Annual Report, we have been subject to the baby shelf rules in the past and it is possible that we will be subject to the baby shelf rules in the future. In such event, the amount of financing the Company could raise may be limited.\nWe received an SPA agreement from the FDA relating to our product candidate. This SPA agreement does not guarantee approval of Ampion or any other particular outcome from regulatory review.\nWe requested agreement from the FDA under an SPA for our AP-013 study of Ampion, which we received in writing from the FDA in June 2019. The FDA\u2019s SPA process is designed to facilitate the FDA\u2019s review and approval of biologics by allowing the FDA to evaluate the proposed design and size of certain clinical trials that are intended to form the primary basis for determining a biologic\u2019s efficacy. Upon specific request by a clinical trial sponsor, the FDA will evaluate the protocol and respond to a sponsor\u2019s questions regarding, among other things, primary efficacy endpoints, trial conduct and data analysis. The FDA ultimately assesses whether the protocol design and planned analysis of the trial are acceptable to support regulatory approval of the product candidate with respect to the effectiveness of the indication studied. Based on their review, the FDA will then issue a SPA Agreement letter, or a SPA No Agreement letter.\nAs stated in the FDA\u2019s guidance for industry regarding SPAs (published in April 2018), a SPA agreement does not guarantee approval of a product candidate, even if the trial is conducted in accordance with the protocol. Moreover, the FDA may revoke or alter our SPA agreement in certain circumstances. In particular, a SPA agreement is not binding on the FDA if public health concerns emerge that were unrecognized at the time of the SPA agreement, other new scientific concerns regarding product safety or efficacy arise, we fail to comply with the agreed upon trial protocols, or the relevant data, assumptions, or information provided by us in our request for the SPA change or are found to be false or omit relevant facts. In addition, even after an SPA agreement is finalized, the SPA agreement may be modified, and such modification will be deemed binding on the FDA review division, except under the circumstances described above, if the FDA and the sponsor agree in writing to modify the protocol and such modification is intended to improve the study. The FDA retains significant latitude and discretion in interpreting the terms of the SPA agreement and the data and results from any study that is the subject of the SPA agreement.\nEven though we obtained an agreement on our SPA, we cannot assure you that our AP-013 study of Ampion will succeed or will result in any FDA approval for Ampion. Moreover, if the FDA revokes or alters its agreement under our SPA, or interprets the data collected from the AP-013 Study differently than we do, the FDA may not deem the data sufficient to support an application for regulatory approval, or the FDA may require additional clinical trials to support a BLA for Ampion\u2019s treatment of severe OAK, both of which could materially impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOur business is dependent on the success of Ampion. If Ampion does not receive regulatory approval or is not successfully commercialized, our business is likely to be harmed.\nA substantial portion of our business and future success depends solely on our ability to develop, obtain regulatory approval for and successfully commercialize Ampion. We currently have no products that are approved for commercial sale and may never be able to develop marketable products. We are devoting all of our resources to the development of Ampion. We cannot be certain that Ampion will be successful in ongoing or future clinical trials, receive regulatory approval or be successfully commercialized even if we receive regulatory approval.\nIf clinical trials of Ampion fail to satisfactorily demonstrate safety and efficacy to the FDA and other regulators, the FDA or other regulators may require additional clinical trials and we, or our collaborators, may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of Ampion.\nClinical trials are long, expensive, and unpredictable processes that can be subject to extensive delays. We cannot guarantee that any clinical studies will be conducted as planned or completed on schedule, if at all. It may take several years to complete clinical development necessary to commercialize a biologic, and delays or failure can occur at any stage. Success in pre-clinical testing and the results of earlier clinical trials do not necessarily predict clinical success, and larger and later-stage clinical studies may not produce the same results as earlier-stage clinical studies. In addition, clinical studies of potential products often reveal that it is not possible or practical to continue development efforts for these product candidates. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in advanced clinical trials even after promising results in earlier trials and we cannot be certain that we will not face similar setbacks. The design of a clinical trial can determine whether its results will support\napproval of a product for a desired indication and flaws in the design of a clinical trial may not become apparent until the clinical trial is well advanced.\nWe continue to work toward completion and analysis of clinical trials for Ampion\u2019s treatment of severe OAK. Any unfavorable outcome of our current AP-013 Study of Ampion, which we anticipate will be the last clinical trial that we conduct prior to BLA submission, would be a major set-back for the development program and for us. Due to our limited financial resources, an unfavorable outcome in the AP-013 Study may require us to delay, reduce the scope of, or eliminate our only active product development program, which we expect would have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition and on the value of our common stock.\nIn connection with clinical testing and trials, we face a number of risks, including, but not limited to the following:\n\u00b7\nAmpion is ineffective, or is considered inferior to existing approved medicines;\n\u00b7\npatients may die or suffer other adverse effects for reasons that may or may not be related to Ampion;\n\u00b7\nthe results may not confirm the positive results of earlier testing or trials;\n\u00b7\nthe results may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the FDA or other regulatory agencies to establish the safety and efficacy of Ampion;\n\u00b7\nthe FDA may require additional clinical testing and trials, which are costly and time consuming; and\n\u00b7\nas a result of the interim review of 724 patients achieving the 12-week endpoint, we may determine to increase the size of the patient sample size beyond 1,034 patients, which would result in a delay of concluding the current AP-013 study and could result in additional costs.\nIf we do not successfully complete clinical development, file our BLA and receive marketing approval from the FDA, we will be unable to market and sell products derived from Ampion and generate revenues. Even if we do successfully complete the AP-013 study, the results may not be sufficient for FDA approval of our BLA for Ampion\u2019s treatment of severe OAK, the FDA may not deem the data sufficient to support an application for regulatory approval, or if the FDA required additional clinical trials to support a BLA, the results may not necessarily be predictive of results of additional trials that may be needed before a BLA is submitted to the FDA. Although there are a large number of biologics in the development stage in the United States and other countries, only a small percentage result in the submission of a BLA to the FDA, even fewer are approved for commercialization, and only a small number achieve widespread physician and consumer acceptance following regulatory approval. If our current clinical study is substantially delayed or fails to satisfactorily address the safety and effectiveness of Ampion in development, we may not receive regulatory approval of Ampion and our business and financial condition will be materially harmed.\nWe rely on third parties to conduct our clinical trials and perform data collection and analysis, which may result in costs and delays that prevent us from successfully commercializing Ampion.\nWe currently rely, and will rely in the future, on medical institutions, clinical investigators, contract research organizations, contract laboratories, and collaborators to perform data collection and analysis and other aspects of our clinical trials.\nOur clinical trials conducted by third parties may be delayed, suspended, or terminated if:\n\u00b7\nthe third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or fail to meet regulatory obligations or expected deadlines;\n\u00b7\nwe replace a third party; or\n\u00b7\nthe quality or accuracy of the data obtained by third parties is compromised due to their failure to adhere to clinical protocols, regulatory requirements, or for other reasons.\nThird party performance failures may increase our development costs, delay our ability to obtain regulatory approval, and delay or prevent the commercialization of Ampion. If we seek alternative sources to provide these services, we may not be able to enter into replacement arrangements without incurring delays or additional costs.\nRelying on third-party suppliers may result in delays in our ongoing clinical trial and introduction of our product to the market.\nWe currently obtain the raw material needed to produce Ampion for our clinical trials from one supplier in the United States. Our current agreement with this supplier expires in December 2020 and we are in the process of securing a long-term supply agreement. Future clinical trials, if required, and FDA approval may be delayed if we are unable to obtain a sufficient quantity of the raw material needed to produce Ampion on a timely basis or if we need to establish an alternative source of supply for the raw material.\nOnce regulatory approval is obtained, a marketed product and its suppliers and manufacturers are subject to continual review. The discovery of previously unknown problems with a product or supplier and manufacturers may result in restrictions on the product, supplier, or manufacturing facility, including withdrawal of the product from the market. Our raw material supplier is required to operate in accordance with cGMPs. A failure of any of our contract suppliers to establish and follow cGMPs and to document their adherence to such practices may lead to significant delays in the launch of Ampion into the market. Failure by third-party suppliers to comply with applicable regulations could result in sanctions being imposed on us, including fines, injunctions, civil penalties, revocation or suspension of marketing approval for our product, seizures or recalls of our product, operating restrictions, and criminal prosecutions.\nWe currently, and from time to time in the future may, outsource portions of our internal business functions to third-party providers. Outsourcing these functions has significant risks, and our failure to manage these risks successfully could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe currently, and from time to time in the future may, outsource portions of our internal business functions to third-party providers including information technology, human resources, internal audit testing, legal services and certain calculations and other information that support our accounting and financial reporting, among other things. Third-party providers may not comply on a timely basis with all of our requirements or may not provide us with an acceptable level of service. In addition, our reliance on third-party providers could have significant negative consequences, including significant disruptions in our operations and significantly increased costs to undertake our operations. For example, any failure by the third-party providers that assist us with financial reporting to provide us with accurate information or implement and maintain effective controls may cause us to be unable to meet our reporting obligations as a publicly traded company and we could experience deficiencies in our operations that could have an adverse effect on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. As a result of our outsourcing activities, it may be more difficult for us to recruit and retain qualified employees for our business needs at any time and if we have a failure in our outsourced financial reporting activities, our independent registered public accounting firm may not be able to provide us with an unqualified report regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, which may cause investors to lose confidence in the reliability of our financial statements and could result in a decrease in the value of our common stock. Our failure to successfully outsource any material portion of our business functions could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nIf we do not receive marketing approval for Ampion, we may not realize the investment we have made in our manufacturing facility.\nIn May 2014, we commenced a 125- month lease of a multi-purpose facility containing approximately 19,000 square feet. We have built out this facility in anticipation of receiving approval of our BLA and commencing commercialization of Ampion for treatment of severe OAK. If the submission of our BLA for Ampion is significantly delayed, the FDA does not approve our BLA for Ampion, and/or does not approve of our manufacturing operation, we will not be able to manufacture Ampion for commercial sale in our facility and we will remain obligated to make payments under our lease, which is set to expire in 2024. Any delay or failure to receive BLA approval for Ampion could have a material adverse effect on the carrying value of the manufacturing facility as well as on our results of operations.\nWhile the likelihood of the use hazardous materials is deemed minimal, in the unlikely instance we use hazardous and/or biological materials in a manner that causes injury or violates applicable law, we may be liable for damages or fines.\nThe use of hazardous and biological materials is deemed unlikely. However, the activities conducted at our facility (i.e. research and development and manufacturing) may, from time to time, involve the controlled use of potentially hazardous substances, including, but not limited to, chemical and biological materials and hazardous waste products. Federal, state, and local laws and regulations govern the use, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous materials. If we experience a release of hazardous substances, it is possible that this release could cause personal injury or death, and require decontamination of the facility. In the unlikely event of an accident while manufacturing Ampion, we could be held liable for damages or face substantial penalties. We do not have any insurance for liabilities arising from the procurement, handling, or discharge of hazardous materials. Compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations, in the event of an accident, is expensive, and current or future environmental regulations may delay our research, development and production efforts, which could harm the financial condition of our business or impair our operations.\nEven if we, or our collaborators, obtain marketing approvals for Ampion, the terms of approvals and ongoing regulation of our product may limit how we, or our collaborators, manufacture and market our product, which could materially impair our ability to generate revenue.\nEven if we receive regulatory approval for Ampion, this approval may carry conditions that limit the market for the product or put the product at a competitive disadvantage relative to alternative therapies for treatment of severe OAK. For instance, the indicated use for Ampion that we have negotiated with the FDA is \u201ctreatment of the signs and symptoms of severe OAK\u201d, which will mean that our product will not be marketed to persons having less than severe OAK, a regulatory approval may further limit the indicated uses for which we can market a product or the patient population that may utilize the product. These restrictions could make it more difficult to market Ampion effectively.\nAccordingly, assuming we, or our collaborators, receive marketing approval for Ampion, we, our collaborators and contract manufacturers will continue to expend time, money and effort in all areas of regulatory compliance, including manufacturing, production, product surveillance, and quality control.\nAmpion for which we obtain marketing approval in the future could be subject to post-marketing restrictions or withdrawal from the market and we, and our collaborators, may be subject to substantial penalties if we, or they, fail to comply with regulatory requirements or if we, or they, experience unanticipated problems with our product following approval. The expenses and costs we will incur to comply with FDA post approval requirements could limit our financial resources for other development activities.\nAmpion for which we, or our collaborators, obtain marketing approval in the future, as well as the manufacturing processes, post-approval studies and measures, labeling, advertising, and promotional activities for such product, among other things, will be subject to continual requirements of and review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, registration and listing requirements, requirements relating to manufacturing, quality control, quality assurance and corresponding maintenance of records and documents, requirements regarding the distribution of samples to physicians and recordkeeping. Even if marketing approval of Ampion is granted, the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated use for which the product may be marketed and there may be conditions of approval.\nThe FDA may also impose requirements for costly post-marketing studies or clinical trials and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of a product. The FDA and other agencies, including the Department of Justice, closely regulate and monitor the post-approval marketing and promotion of products to ensure that they are manufactured, marketed, and distributed only for the approved indications and in accordance with the provisions of the approved labeling. The FDA imposes stringent restrictions on manufacturers\u2019 communications regarding off-label use and if we, or our collaborators, do not market Ampion in accordance with the marketing approval received for the product\u2019s approved indications, we, or they, may be subject to warnings or enforcement action for off-label marketing. Violation of the FDCA, the Public Health Service Act, and other statutes, including the False Claims Act, relating to the promotion and advertising of prescription drugs may lead to investigations or allegations of violations of federal and state health care fraud and abuse laws and state consumer protection laws.\nDiscovery of previously unknown problems with a product or the failure to comply with applicable FDA requirements can have negative consequences, including adverse publicity, judicial or administrative enforcement, warning letters from the FDA, mandated corrective advertising or communications with doctors and civil or criminal penalties, among others. Newly discovered or developed safety or effectiveness data may require changes to a product\u2019s approved labeling, including the addition of new warnings and contraindications, and also may require the implementation of other risk management measures. The costs and expenses we may incur to comply with FDA post approval requirements could limit our financial resources for other development activities.\nIf we do not achieve our projected development and commercialization goals in the timeframes we announce and expect, the commercialization of Ampion may be delayed, our business will be harmed, and our stock price may decline.\nWe sometimes estimate for planning purposes the timing of the accomplishment of various scientific, clinical, regulatory, and other product development objectives. These milestones may include our expectations regarding the commencement or completion of scientific studies, clinical trials, the submission of regulatory filings, or commercialization objectives. From time to time, we may publicly announce the expected timing of some of these milestones, such as the completion of an ongoing clinical trial, the initiation of other clinical programs, submission of a BLA application, receipt of marketing approval, or a commercial launch of a product. The achievement of many of these milestones may be outside of our control. All of these milestones are based on a variety of assumptions which may cause the timing of achievement of the milestones to vary considerably from our estimates, including:\n\u00b7\nour available capital resources or capital constraints we experience;\n\u00b7\nthe rate of progress, costs, and results of our clinical trials and research and development activities, including the extent of scheduling conflicts with participating clinicians and collaborators, and our ability to identify and enroll patients who meet clinical trial eligibility criteria;\n\u00b7\nour receipt of approvals by the FDA and other regulatory agencies and the timing thereof;\n\u00b7\nother actions, decisions, or rules issued by regulators;\n\u00b7\nour ability to access sufficient, reliable and affordable supplies of the compound used to manufacture Ampion;\n\u00b7\nthe efforts of our collaborators with respect to the commercialization of our product; and\n\u00b7\ncosts related to, and timing issues associated with, product manufacturing as well as sales and marketing activities.\nIf we fail to achieve announced milestones in the timeframes we announce and expect, our business and results of operations may be harmed, and the price of our stock may decline.\nEven if collaborators with which we currently contract with or may contract with in the future successfully complete clinical trials of Ampion, our product may not be commercialized successfully for other reasons.\nEven if the contractors that we currently contract with for the AP-013 study, or contractors that we may contract with in the future, successfully complete clinical trials for Ampion, our product may not be commercialized for other reasons, including:\n\u00b7\nfailure to receive the regulatory clearances required to market Ampion;\n\u00b7\nbeing subject to proprietary rights held by others;\n\u00b7\nbeing difficult or expensive to manufacture on a commercial scale;\n\u00b7\nhaving adverse side effects that make Ampion\u2019s use less desirable; or\n\u00b7\nfailing to compete effectively with products or treatments commercialized by competitors.\nWe might enter into agreements with collaborators to commercialize Ampion, which may affect the sales of our product and our ability to generate revenues.\nWe are not currently established to handle sales, marketing, and distribution of pharmaceutical products and may contract with, or license, third parties to market Ampion if we receive regulatory approvals. Outsourcing sales and marketing in this manner may subject us to a variety of risks, including:\n\u00b7\nour inability to exercise control over sales and marketing activities and personnel;\n\u00b7\nfailure or inability of contracted sales personnel to obtain access to or persuade adequate numbers of physicians to prescribe our product;\n\u00b7\ndisputes with collaborators concerning sales and marketing expenses, calculation of royalties, and sales and marketing strategies;\n\u00b7\nunforeseen costs and expenses associated with sales and marketing;\n\u00b7\ncollaborators may not have sufficient resources or decide not to devote the necessary resources due to internal constraints such as budget limitations, lack of human resources, or a change in strategic focus;\n\u00b7\ncollaborators may believe our intellectual property or Ampion infringes on the intellectual property rights of others;\n\u00b7\ncollaborators may dispute their responsibility to conduct commercialization activities pursuant to the applicable collaboration, including the payment of related costs or the division of any revenues;\n\u00b7\ncollaborators may decide to pursue a competitive product developed outside of the collaboration arrangement;\n\u00b7\ncollaborators may delay the commercialization of Ampion in favor of commercializing another party\u2019s product candidate; or\n\u00b7\ncollaborators may decide to terminate or not to renew the collaboration for these or other reasons.\nIf we are unable to partner with a third party that has adequate sales, marketing, and distribution capabilities, we may have difficulty commercializing Ampion, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition, and ability to generate product revenues.\nAmpion is regulated by the FDA, and as such, may subject it to competition sooner than anticipated.\nWith the enactment of the BPCIA an abbreviated pathway for the approval of biosimilar and interchangeable biological products was created. The abbreviated regulatory pathway established legal authority for the FDA to review and approve biosimilars, including the possible designation of a biosimilar as \u201cinterchangeable\u201d based on its similarity to an existing brand product. The BPCIA provides a period of exclusivity for product granted \u201creference product exclusivity,\u201d under which an application for a biosimilar product referencing such products cannot be approved by the FDA until 12 years after the original branded product is approved under a BLA.\nThis period of regulatory exclusivity does not apply to companies pursuing regulatory approval via their own traditional BLA, rather than via the abbreviated pathway. Therefore, if Ampion were to receive reference product exclusivity, a competitor may seek approval of a product candidate under a full BLA. In such a case, although the competitor would not enjoy the benefits of the abbreviated pathway for biosimilar approval created under the BPCIA, the FDA would not be precluded from making effective an approval of the competitor product pursuant to a BLA prior to the expiration of our 12-year period of market exclusivity.\nWe could face substantial competition from companies with considerably more resources and experience than we have, which may result in others discovering, developing, receiving approval for, or commercializing products before or more successfully than us.\nIf we develop an approved product, we cannot provide assurance it will be first to market, clinically superior or scientifically preferable to existing or future products and/or treatments developed or introduced by our competitors. Our ability to succeed in the future depends on our ability to discover, develop, and commercialize a pharmaceutical product that offers superior efficacy, convenience, tolerability, and safety when compared to existing, or a lack of demonstrated, treatment methodologies. Because our strategy is to develop a new product candidate primarily for the treatment of a disease that affects a large patient population, our product is likely to compete with a number of existing medicines or treatments, and a large number of product candidates that are being developed by others.\nMany of our potential competitors have substantially greater financial, technical, personnel, and marketing resources than we do. In addition, many of these competitors have significantly greater resources devoted to product development and pre-clinical research. Our ability to compete successfully will depend largely on our ability to:\n\u00b7\ndevelop Ampion to be superior to other products in the market;\n\u00b7\nattract and retain qualified personnel;\n\u00b7\nobtain patent and/or other proprietary protection for Ampion;\n\u00b7\nobtain required regulatory approvals; and\n\u00b7\nobtain collaboration arrangements to commercialize Ampion.\nEstablished pharmaceutical companies devote significant financial resources to discovering, developing, or licensing novel compounds that could make Ampion obsolete. Our competitors may obtain patent protection, receive FDA approval, and commercialize medicines before us. Other companies are engaged in the discovery of compounds that may compete with Ampion.\nAny new product that competes with a currently-approved treatment or medicine must demonstrate compelling advantages in efficacy, convenience, tolerability, and/or safety to address price competition and be commercially successful. If we are not able to compete effectively against our current and future competitors, our business will not grow, and our financial condition and operations will suffer.\nLawsuits or investigations could divert our resources, result in substantial liabilities and reduce the commercial potential of Ampion.\nWe are currently and may be additionally in the future subject to legal or administrative proceedings and litigation which may be costly to defend and could materially harm our business, financial conditions and operations. While we do not anticipate that the current legal and administrative proceedings and litigation that we are currently subject to are likely to result in liability for the Company, the cost of responding to and defending ourselves in such proceedings was approximately $600,000 in 2019 and $84,000 in 2018, which was material, and, as of December 31, 2019, had not met our retention levels under our insurance.\nAdditionally, the risk that we may be sued on product liability claims is inherent in the development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products. Side effects of, or manufacturing defects in, the product that we develop which is commercialized by us, or our collaborators could result in the deterioration of a patient\u2019s condition, injury, or even death. Once a product is approved for sale and commercialized, the likelihood of product liability lawsuits increases. Claims may be brought by individuals seeking relief for themselves or by individuals or groups seeking to represent a class. These lawsuits may divert our management from pursuing our business strategy and may be costly to defend. In addition, if we are held liable in any of these lawsuits, we may incur substantial liabilities and may be forced to limit or forgo further commercialization of Ampion.\nAlthough we maintain general liability and product liability and directors and officers insurance, this insurance may not fully cover potential liabilities. In addition, our inability to obtain or maintain sufficient insurance coverage at an acceptable cost or to otherwise protect against potential legal or administrative liability claims could prevent or inhibit the commercial production and sale of Ampion, if and when it receives regulatory approval, which could in turn adversely affect our business. Lawsuits and investigations, or threats thereof, could also harm our reputation, which may adversely affect our collaborators\u2019 ability to commercialize our product successfully.\nWe may have difficulties obtaining and maintaining sufficient insurance coverage.\nAs a result of a number of factors, such as ongoing litigation, certain of the insurance products that we purchase have become less available and their cost has increased significantly in 2019. Although we maintain directors and officers insurance as well as general liability and product liability insurance, these insurance coverages only cover potential liabilities after our retention has been met and only to the extent of the insurance coverage, therefore, our insurance coverages may not fully cover potential liabilities. In addition, our inability to obtain or maintain sufficient insurance coverage at an acceptable cost or to otherwise protect against potential product or other legal or administrative liability claims could prevent or inhibit the manufacture and sale of Ampion if it receives regulatory approval, which could adversely affect our business.\nIf Ampion is commercialized, this does not assure acceptance by physicians, patients, third-party payors, or the medical community in general.\nWe cannot be sure that Ampion, if and when approved for marketing, will be accepted by physicians, patients, third-party payors, or the medical community in general. Even if the medical community accepts a product as safe and efficacious for its indicated use, physicians may choose to restrict the use of the product if we or any collaborator are unable to demonstrate that, based on experience, clinical data, side-effect profiles, and other factors, our product is preferable to any existing medicines or treatments. We cannot predict the degree of market acceptance of Ampion once we receive marketing approval, which will depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u00b7\nthe clinical efficacy and safety of the product;\n\u00b7\nthe approved labeling for the product and any required warnings;\n\u00b7\nthe advantages and disadvantages of the product compared to alternative treatments;\n\u00b7\nour and any collaborator\u2019s ability to educate the medical community about the safety and effectiveness of the product;\n\u00b7\nthe reimbursement policies of government and third-party payors pertaining to our product; and\n\u00b7\nthe market price of our product relative to competing treatments.\nGovernment restrictions on pricing and reimbursement, as well as other healthcare payor cost-containment initiatives, may negatively impact our ability to generate revenues if we obtain regulatory approval to market our product.\nThe commercial success of Ampion will depend on the reimbursement rates from health maintenance, managed care, pharmacy benefit, government health administration authorities, private health coverage insurers, and other third-party payors. If reimbursement is not available, or is available only at limited levels, we, or our collaborators, may not be able to successfully commercialize Ampion. Even if coverage is provided, the approved reimbursement amount may not be high enough to allow us, or our collaborators, to establish or maintain pricing to realize a sufficient return on our or their investments.\nThe continuing efforts of the government, insurance companies, managed care organizations, and other payors of health care costs to contain or reduce costs of health care may adversely affect one or more of the following:\n\u00b7\nour or our collaborators\u2019 ability to set a price we believe is fair for Ampion, if approved;\n\u00b7\nour ability to generate revenues and achieve profitability; and\n\u00b7\nthe availability of capital.\nThe 2010 enactment of the Affordable Care Act is expected to significantly impact the provision of, and payment for, health care in the United States. Various provisions of these laws are designed to expand Medicaid eligibility, subsidize insurance premiums, provide incentives for businesses to provide health care benefits, prohibit denials of coverage due to pre-existing conditions, establish health insurance exchanges, and provide additional support for medical research. Additional legislative proposals to reform healthcare and government insurance programs, along with the trend toward managed healthcare in the United States, could influence the purchase of medicines and reduce demand and prices for our products, if approved. This could harm our or our collaborators\u2019 ability to market our product and generate revenues. Cost containment measures that health care payors and providers are instituting, and the effect of further health care reform could significantly reduce potential revenues from the sale of Ampion in the future, and could cause an increase in our compliance, manufacturing, or other operating expenses. In addition, in certain foreign markets, the pricing of prescription drugs is subject to government control and reimbursement may in some cases be unavailable. We believe that pricing pressures at the federal and state level, as well as internationally, will continue and may increase, which may make it difficult for us to sell our potential product that may be approved in the future at a price acceptable to us or any of our future collaborators.\nThe approval process outside the United States varies among countries and may limit our ability to develop, manufacture and sell our product internationally. Failure to obtain marketing approval in international jurisdictions would prevent Ampion from being marketed abroad.\nIn order to market and sell our product outside the United States, we, or our collaborators, may need to obtain separate marketing approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements in global markets which do not recognize the FDA approval process. The approval procedures in these jurisdictions vary among countries and can require separate clinical trials and approval submission/approval process involve additional testing. If we or our collaborators seek marketing approvals for Ampion outside the United States, we will be subject to the regulatory requirements of health authorities in each country in which we seek approvals. With respect to marketing authorizations in Europe, we will be required to submit a European marketing authorization application (\u201cMAA\u201d) to the EMA which conducts a validation and scientific approval process in evaluating a product for safety and efficacy. As further noted above, the approval procedure varies among regions and countries and can involve additional testing, and the time required to obtain approvals may differ from that required to obtain FDA approval. Obtaining regulatory approvals from health authorities in countries outside the United States is likely to subject us to all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval described above. In addition, marketing approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by the health authorities of any other country.\nOur future success depends on our ability to retain key employees, consultants and advisors and to attract, retain, and motivate qualified personnel.\nWe are highly dependent on our executive officers; the loss of whose services may adversely impact the achievement of our objectives. Recruiting and retaining other qualified employees, consultants, and advisors for our business, including scientific and technical personnel, will also be critical to our success. There is currently a shortage of skilled executives and scientific personnel in our industry, which is likely to continue. As a result, competition for skilled personnel is intense and the turnover rate can be high. We may not be able to attract and retain personnel on acceptable terms given the competition among numerous pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies for individuals with similar skill sets. In addition, our current financial needs and potential benefit packages at other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies may make it more challenging to recruit and retain qualified personnel. The inability to recruit or loss of the services of any executive, key employee, consultant, or advisor may impede the progress of our research, development and commercialization objectives.\nIn order to induce valuable employees to remain employed at Ampio, in addition to salary and cash incentives, we have provided stock options that vest over time. The value to employees of stock options that vest over time may be significantly affected by movements in our stock price that are beyond our control and may at any time be insufficient to counteract more lucrative offers from other companies.\nDespite our efforts to retain valuable employees, members of our management, scientific, and development teams have in the past and may in the future terminate their employment with us. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees and our inability to find suitable replacements could potentially harm our business, prospects, financial condition or results of operations. We do not maintain \u201ckey man\u201d insurance policies on the lives of these individuals or any of our other employees. Our success also depends on our ability to continue to attract, retain, and motivate highly skilled junior, mid-level, and senior managers as well as junior, mid-level, and senior scientific and medical personnel.\nMany of the other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies that we compete against for qualified personnel have greater financial and other resources, different risk profiles and a longer history in the industry than we do. They may also provide more diverse opportunities and better chances for career advancement. Some of these characteristics may be more appealing to high quality candidates than what we can offer. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain high quality personnel, the rate and success at which we can discover, develop and commercialize product candidates will be limited.\nOur drug development program to date has been dependent in large part upon the services of Dr. David Bar-Or, who retired as Chief Scientific Officer in September 2018.\nOur drug development program to date has been dependent in large part upon the services of Dr. David Bar-Or, who retired from his full-time role as Chief Scientific Officer effective September 30, 2018. Although Dr. Bar-Or continues to serve as a member of our Board and our Scientific Advisory Board, the loss of his services as our full-time Chief Scientific Officer could diminish when, and if, we have the financial resources to do so, our ability to develop and commercialize new product candidates.\nBusiness interruptions could limit our ability to operate our business.\nOur operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from computer viruses, human error, natural disasters, telecommunications failures, intentional acts of misappropriation, and similar events. We have not established a formal disaster recovery plan or back-up operations. Additionally, our business interruption insurance may not be adequate to compensate us for losses that occur. A significant business interruption could result in losses or damages and require us to curtail our operations.\nWhile we are not aware of any cybersecurity incidents, the cybersecurity landscape continues to evolve, and we may find it necessary to make further investments to protect our data and infrastructure.\nWe continuously work to install new and upgrade existing information technology systems and provide employee awareness training around phishing, malware, and other cyber risks to ensure that we are protected, to the greatest extent possible, against cyber risks and security breaches. Any actual or suspected security breach or other compromise of our security measures or those of our third-party vendors, whether as a result of hacking efforts, denial-of-service attacks, viruses, malicious software, break-ins, phishing attacks or otherwise, could harm our reputation and business, require us to expend significant capital and other resources to address the breach, and result in a violation of applicable laws, regulations or other legal obligations.\nOur employees, principal investigators, consultants and commercial partners may engage in misconduct or other improper activities.\nWe are exposed to the risk that our employees, contract research organizations, principal investigators, consultants, and commercial partners may engage in fraudulent conduct or other illegal activity or may fail to disclosure unauthorized activities to us. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional, reckless and/or negligent failures to comply with:\n\u00b7\nthe laws and regulations of the FDA and non-U.S. regulators, including those laws requiring the reporting of true, complete and accurate information to such regulatory bodies;\n\u00b7\nmanufacturing standards we have established;\n\u00b7\nhealthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations in the United States and similar foreign laws; or\n\u00b7\nlaws requiring the accurate reporting of financial information or data or the disclosure of unauthorized activities to us.\nIn particular, sales, marketing, and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs, and other business arrangements. Such misconduct could also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and cause serious harm to our reputation. We have adopted a Code of Business Conduct and Ethics applicable to all of our employees, but it is not always possible to identify and deter employee misconduct, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of significant fines or other sanctions.\nOur ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to limitation.\nUnder Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, substantial changes in our ownership may limit the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that could be utilized annually in the future to offset our taxable income. Specifically, this limitation may arise in the event of a cumulative change in ownership of our company of more than 50% within a three-year period. Any such annual limitation may significantly reduce the utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards before they expire. We believe it is likely that transactions that have occurred in the past and other transactions that may occur in the future, could trigger an ownership change pursuant to Section 382, which could limit the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that could be utilized annually in the future to offset our taxable income, if any.\nFurther, the Tax Act changed the federal rules governing net operating loss carryforwards. For net operating loss carryforwards arising in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the Tax Act limits a taxpayer\u2019s ability to utilize such carryforwards to 80% of taxable income. In addition, net operating loss carryforwards arising in tax years ending after December 31, 2017 can be carried forward indefinitely, but carryback is generally prohibited. Net operating loss carryforwards generated before January 1, 2018 will not be subject to the Tax Act\u2019s taxable income limitation and will continue to have a twenty-year carryforward period. Nevertheless, our net operating loss carryforwards and other tax assets could expire before utilization and could be subject to limitations, which could harm our business, revenue, and financial results.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nOur ability to compete may decline if we do not adequately protect our proprietary rights.\nOur commercial success depends on obtaining and maintaining proprietary rights for Ampion including its composition and uses. We must successfully defend these rights against third-party challenges. We will only be able to protect Ampion\u2019s proprietary composition and its uses from unauthorized use to the extent that valid and enforceable patents, or effectively protected trade secrets, cover them.\nOur ability to obtain patent protection for Ampion and its composition is uncertain due to a number of factors, including:\n\u00b7\nwe may not be the first to make the inventions covered by pending patent applications or issued patents;\n\u00b7\nwe may not be the first to file patent applications for Ampion or for its uses;\n\u00b7\nothers may independently develop identical, similar, or alternative products or compositions;\n\u00b7\nour disclosures in patent applications may not be sufficient to meet the statutory requirements for patentability;\n\u00b7\nany or all of our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents;\n\u00b7\nwe may not seek or obtain patent protection in countries that may eventually provide us a significant business opportunity;\n\u00b7\nany patents issued to us may not provide a basis for commercially viable products, may not provide any competitive advantages, or may be successfully challenged by third parties;\n\u00b7\nour proprietary compositions may not be patentable;\n\u00b7\nothers may design around our patent claims to produce competitive products which fall outside of the scope of our patents;\n\u00b7\nothers may identify prior art which could invalidate our patents; and\n\u00b7\nthe availability and length of patent term extension (PTE) under the Hatch-Waxman Act for approved products are subject to a number of factors and PTE could be unavailable or less than the maximum 5 years for PTE for Ampion.\nEven if we have or obtain patents covering Ampion or its uses, we may still be barred from making, using and selling Ampion because of the patent rights of others. Others have or may have filed, and in the future may file, patent applications covering compositions or products that are similar or identical to ours. There are many issued U.S. and foreign patents and pending patent applications relating to chemical compounds, biological compositions and therapeutic products, and some of these may relate to compositions we intend to commercialize. These could materially affect our ability to develop Ampion or sell our product if approved. Because patent applications can take many years to issue, there may be currently pending applications unknown to us that may later result in issued patents that Ampion or its uses may infringe. These patent applications may have priority over patent applications filed by us.\nWe have conducted searches in the past to identify patents or patent applications that may prevent us from obtaining patent protection for our compositions or that could limit the rights we have claimed in our patents and patent applications, however, currently there are no ongoing searching efforts. Disputes may arise regarding the source or ownership of our inventions. It is difficult to determine if and how such disputes would be resolved. Others may challenge the validity of our patents. If our patents are found to be invalid, we will lose the ability to exclude others from making, using or selling the compositions or uses addressed in those patents.\nConfidentiality agreements with employees and others may not adequately prevent disclosure of our trade secrets and other proprietary information and may not adequately protect our intellectual property, which could limit our ability to compete.\nBecause we operate in the highly technical field of drug discovery and development of therapies that can address inflammation and other conditions, we rely in part on trade secret protection to protect our proprietary technology and processes. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. We enter into confidentiality and intellectual property assignment agreements with our employees, consultants, outside scientific collaborators, sponsored researchers, and other advisors. These agreements generally require that the other party keep confidential, and not disclose to third parties, all confidential information developed by the party or made known to the party by us during the party\u2019s relationship with us. These agreements also generally provide that inventions conceived by the party while rendering services for us will be our exclusive property.\nHowever, these agreements may not be honored and may not effectively assign intellectual property rights to us. Enforcing a claim that a party illegally obtained and is using our trade secrets is difficult, expensive, and time consuming and the outcome is unpredictable. In addition, courts outside the United States may be less willing to protect trade secrets. The failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could adversely affect our competitive position.\nA dispute concerning the infringement or misappropriation of our proprietary rights or the proprietary rights of others could be time consuming and costly, and an unfavorable outcome could harm our business.\nThere is significant litigation in the pharmaceutical industry regarding patent and other intellectual property rights. While we are not currently subject to any pending intellectual property litigation, and are not aware of any such threatened litigation, we may be exposed to future litigation by third parties based on claims that Ampion, methods of making Ampion and/or methods of using Ampion infringe the intellectual property rights of others. There are many patents relating to pharmaceuticals used to treat inflammation. Some of these may encompass Ampion or components of Ampion. If our development activities are found to infringe any such patents, we may have to pay significant damages or seek licenses to such patents. A patentee could prevent us from using pharmaceuticals encompassed by their claims. We may need to resort to litigation to enforce a patent issued to us, to protect our trade secrets, or to determine the scope and validity of third-party proprietary rights. From time to time, we may hire scientific personnel or consultants formerly employed by other companies involved in one or more areas similar to the activities conducted by us. Either we or these individuals may be subject to allegations of trade secret misappropriation or other similar claims as a result of prior affiliations. If we become involved in litigation, it could consume a substantial portion of our managerial and financial resources, regardless of whether we win or lose. We may not be able to afford the costs of litigation. Any legal action against us or our collaborators could lead to:\n\u00b7\npayment of damages, potentially treble damages, if we are found to have willfully infringed a party\u2019s patent rights;\n\u00b7\ninjunctive or other equitable relief that may effectively block our ability to further develop, commercialize, and sell Ampion; or\n\u00b7\nus or our collaborators having to enter into license arrangements that may not be available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all.\nAs a result, we could be prevented from commercializing Ampion.\nPharmaceutical patents and patent applications involve highly complex legal and factual questions, which, if determined adversely to us, could negatively impact our patent position.\nThe patent positions of pharmaceutical companies can be highly uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. For example, some of our patents and patent applications cover methods of use of Ampion, while other patents and patent applications cover the composition of Ampion. The interpretation and breadth of claims allowed in some patents covering pharmaceutical compositions may be uncertain and difficult to determine and are often affected materially by the facts and circumstances that pertain to the patented composition and the related patent claims. The standards of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cUSPTO\u201d) are sometimes uncertain and could change in the future. Consequently, the issuance and scope of patents cannot be predicted with certainty. Patents, if issued, may be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented. U.S. patents and patent applications may also be subject to interference proceedings, and U.S. patents may be subject to reexamination or other post-grant proceedings by the USPTO. Foreign patents may be subject to opposition or comparable proceedings in the corresponding foreign patent offices, which could result in either loss of the patent or rejection of the patent application or loss or reduction in the scope of one or more of the claims of the patent or patent application. In addition, such interference, reexamination and opposition proceedings may be costly. Accordingly, rights under any issued patents may not provide us with sufficient protection against competitive products or processes.\nIn addition, changes in or different interpretations of patent laws in the United States and foreign countries may permit others to use our discoveries or to develop and commercialize our technology and product without providing any compensation to us, or may limit the number of patents or claims we can obtain. The laws of some countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as U.S. laws and those countries may lack adequate rules and procedures for defending our intellectual property rights. For example, some countries do not grant patent claims directed to methods of treating humans and, in these countries, patent protection may not be available at all to protect Ampion. In addition, U.S. patent laws may change, which could prevent or limit us from filing patent applications or patent claims to protect our products and/or compounds.\nIf we fail to obtain and maintain patent protection and trade secret protection for Ampion, its proprietary composition and its uses, we could lose our competitive advantage and the competition we face could increase, reducing any potential revenues and adversely affecting our ability to attain or maintain profitability.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nThe price of our stock has been extremely volatile and may continue to be volatile and fluctuate substantially, which could result in substantial losses for purchasers of our common stock.\nThe price of our common stock has been extremely volatile and may continue to be so. The stock market in general and the market for pharmaceutical companies have experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of a particular company. The following factors, in addition to the other risk factors described in this section, may also have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock:\n\u00b7\nany actual or perceived adverse developments in clinical trials for Ampion;\n\u00b7\nany actual or perceived difficulties or delays in obtaining regulatory approval of Ampion in the United States or other countries;\n\u00b7\nany finding that Ampion is not safe or effective, or any inability to demonstrate the clinical effectiveness of Ampion when compared to existing treatments;\n\u00b7\nany actual or perceived adverse developments in repurposed drug technologies, including any change in FDA policy or guidance on approval of repurposed drug technologies for new indications;\n\u00b7\nany announcements of developments with, or comments by, the FDA, the EMA, or other regulatory authorities with respect to our development of Ampion;\n\u00b7\nany announcements concerning our retention or loss of key employees;\n\u00b7\nour success or inability to obtain collaborators to conduct clinical trials, or commercialize Ampion once regulatory approval is obtained;\n\u00b7\nannouncements of patent issuances or denials, product innovations, or introduction of new commercial products by our competitors that will compete with Ampion;\n\u00b7\npublicity regarding actual or potential study results or the outcome of regulatory reviews relating to the development of Ampion or our competitors\u2019 products;\n\u00b7\neconomic and other external factors beyond our control; and\n\u00b7\nsales of stock by us or by our stockholders.\nIn addition, we believe there has been and may continue to be substantial off-market transactions in derivatives of our stock, including short selling activity or related similar activities, which are beyond our control and which may be beyond the full control of the SEC and Financial Institutions Regulatory Authority (\u201cFINRA\u201d). While SEC and FINRA rules prohibit some forms of short selling and other activities that may result in stock price manipulation, such activity may nonetheless occur without detection or enforcement. Significant short selling or other types of market manipulation could cause our stock trading price to decline, to become more volatile, or both.\nThe price of our stock may be vulnerable to manipulation.\nWe believe that our common stock has been the subject of significant short selling by certain market participants. Short sales are transactions in which a market participant sells a security that it does not own. To complete the transaction, the market participant must borrow the security to make delivery to the buyer. The market participant is then obligated to replace the security borrowed by purchasing the security at the market price at the time of required replacement. If the\nprice at the time of replacement is lower than the price at which the security was originally sold by the market participant, then the market participant will realize a gain on the transaction. Thus, it is in the market participant\u2019s interest for the market price of the underlying security to decline as much as possible during the period prior to the time of replacement.\nBecause our unrestricted public float has been small relative to other issuers, previous short selling efforts have impacted, and may in the future continue to impact, the value of our stock in an extreme and volatile manner to our detriment and the detriment of our stockholders. In addition, market participants with admitted short positions in our stock have published, and may in the future continue to publish, negative information regarding us and our management team on internet sites or blogs that we believe is inaccurate and misleading. We believe that the publication of this negative information has led, and may in the future continue to lead, to significant downward pressure on the price of our stock to our detriment and the further detriment of our stockholders. These and other efforts by certain market participants to manipulate the price of our common stock for their personal financial gain may cause our stockholders to lose a portion of their investment, may make it more difficult for us to raise equity capital when needed without significantly diluting existing stockholders, and may reduce demand from new investors to purchase shares of our stock.\nIf we cannot continue to satisfy the NYSE American listing maintenance requirements and other rules, including the director independence requirements, our securities may be delisted, which could negatively impact the price of our securities.\nAlthough our common stock is listed on the NYSE American, we may be unable to continue to satisfy the listing maintenance requirements and rules. If we are unable to satisfy the NYSE American criteria for maintaining our listing, our securities could be subject to delisting. To qualify for continued listing on the NYSE American, we must remain in compliance. There can be no assurances that we will be able to continue to comply with the NYSE American listing requirements.\nIf the NYSE American delists our securities, we could face significant consequences, including:\n\u00b7\na limited availability for market quotations for our securities;\n\u00b7\nreduced liquidity with respect to our securities;\n\u00b7\na determination that our common stock is a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d which will require brokers trading in our common stock to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in reduced trading;\n\u00b7\nactivity in the secondary trading market for our common stock;\n\u00b7\nlimited amount of news and analyst coverage; and\n\u00b7\na decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future.\nIn addition, we would no longer be subject to the NYSE American rules, including rules requiring us to have a certain number of independent directors and to meet other corporate governance standards.\nConcentration of our ownership limits the ability of our stockholders to influence corporate matters.\nAs of February 14, 2020, holders of more than 5% of our common stock and our directors, executive officers and their affiliates beneficially owned 27.4% of our outstanding common stock. These stockholders may have significant effect on the outcome of actions taken by us that require stockholder approval.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter and bylaws and in Delaware law could prevent or delay a change in control of Ampio.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may discourage, delay, or prevent a merger or acquisition that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. These provisions include:\n\u00b7\nrequiring supermajority stockholder voting to effect certain amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws;\n\u00b7\nrestricting the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u00b7\nestablishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nIncreased costs associated with corporate governance compliance may significantly impact our results of operations.\nAs a public company, we incur significant legal, accounting, and other expenses due to our compliance with regulations and disclosure obligations applicable to us, including compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as well as rules implemented by the SEC, and the NYSE American. The SEC and other regulators have continued to adopt new rules and regulations and make additional changes to existing regulations that require our compliance. In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (\u201cDodd-Frank Act\u201d), was enacted. There are significant corporate governance and executive compensation related provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act that have required the SEC to adopt additional rules and regulations in these areas. Stockholder activism, the current political environment, and the current high level of government intervention and regulatory reform may lead to substantial new regulations and disclosure obligations, which may lead to additional compliance costs and impact, in ways we cannot currently anticipate, the manner in which we operate our business. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance programs and monitoring of public company reporting obligations, and as a result of the new corporate governance and executive compensation related rules, regulations, and guidelines prompted by the Dodd-Frank Act, and further regulations and disclosure obligations expected in the future, we will likely need to devote additional time and costs to comply with such compliance programs and rules. These rules and regulations will cause us to incur significant legal and financial compliance costs and will make some activities more time-consuming and costly.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting. We continuously refine our disclosure controls and other procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file with the SEC is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms, and that information required to be disclosed in reports under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our principal executive and financial officers. Our current controls and any new controls that we develop may become inadequate, and weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting may be discovered in the future. Any failure to develop or maintain effective controls could adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual independent registered public accounting firm attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, which we may be required to include in our periodic reports that we file with the SEC under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and could harm our operating results, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations, or result in a restatement of our prior period financial statements. If we are not able to demonstrate compliance with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, that our internal controls over financial reporting are perceived as adequate, or that we are unable to produce timely or accurate financial statements, investors may lose confidence in our operating results, and the price of our common stock could decline.\nWe are required to comply with certain of the SEC rules that implement Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which requires management to certify financial and other information in our quarterly and annual reports and provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. This assessment needs to include the disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by our management or our independent registered public accounting firm. During the evaluation and testing process, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting or if we are unable to complete our evaluation,\ntesting, and any required remediation in a timely fashion, we will be unable to assert that our internal controls over financial reporting are effective.\nThese developments could make it more difficult for us to retain qualified members of our Board, qualified executive officers and/or qualified internal and independent auditors. We are presently evaluating and monitoring regulatory developments and cannot estimate the timing or magnitude of additional costs we may incur as a result. To the extent these costs are significant, our general and administrative expenses are likely to increase.\nWe have no plans to pay cash dividends on our common stock.\nWe have no plans to pay cash dividends on our common stock. We intend to invest future earnings, if any, to fund our growth. Any payment of future dividends will be at the discretion of our Board and will depend on, among other things, our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, level of indebtedness, statutory and contractual restrictions applying to the payment of dividends, and other considerations our Board deem relevant. Any future credit facilities or preferred stock financing we obtain may further limit our ability to pay cash dividends on our common stock.", "PERMNO": 12789, "SIC": 2834, "TIC": "AMPE"}
