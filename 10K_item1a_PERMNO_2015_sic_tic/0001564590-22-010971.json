Risk Factors.\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below, in addition to the other information contained in this annual report, before making an investment decision. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be harmed by any of these risks. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or other factors not perceived by us to present significant risks to our business at this time also may impair our business operations.\nRisk Factors Summary\nAn investment in our securities is subject to various risks, the most significant of which are summarized below.\n\u2022\nWe have a history of operating losses and may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability in the future; our prospects for achieving and sustaining profitability in the future will depend primarily on how successful we are in increasing Inbrija (levodopa inhalation powder) sales in the U.S. and establishing collaborations or distribution agreements to sell Inbrija in the EU and other territories outside the U.S., as well as the extent and timing of expected continuing Ampyra sales declines due to generic competition that commenced in 2018.\n\u2022\nOur business depends on our ability to attract and retain key management and other personnel, and maintain access to expert advisors and consultants; we have recently experienced workforce attrition in various functions across our business, we may not be able to adjust our operations in response to prevent disruption to our business, and we lack redundancy in important functions across our business.\n\u2022\nOur 2021 restructurings and associated organizational changes may not adequately reduce our expenses, may lead to additional workforce attrition, and may cause operational disruptions.\n\u2022\nWe may not be able to repay our convertible senior secured notes when they come due in 2024; we may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of our notes or to repurchase the notes upon a fundamental change.\n\u2022\nThe indenture governing our convertible senior secured notes due 2024 contains restrictions that may make it more difficult to execute our strategy or to effectively compete, and an event of default under the indenture could adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to retain title to our assets, including our intellectual property.\n\u2022\nWe are substantially dependent on our ability to increase sales of Inbrija in the U.S. and to a lesser extent commercialize Inbrija in the EU or other countries outside the U.S.; the commercial success of Inbrija depends on market acceptance among physicians, patients and the medical community, adequate reimbursement by governmental and other third-party payors, and other factors; and Inbrija faces competition from other marketed products.\n\u2022\nWe do not have the capabilities to commercialize products outside of the U.S.; we are dependent on our existing collaboration with Biogen for sales of Ampyra in the EU and other countries outside the U.S. where it is approved, and we are dependent on our existing distribution agreements with Esteve for commercialization of Inbrija in Germany and Spain, and we will need to enter into additional collaborations or distribution agreements to commercialize Inbrija in other EU countries and other countries outside U.S.\n\u2022\nWe rely on Catalent as our sole third party for the commercial manufacture of Inbrija and ARCUS inhaled therapeutic candidates that we may seek to develop; we rely on the Chelsea, Massachusetts, manufacturing facility that we transferred to Catalent for the manufacture of Inbrija; our business could be harmed if Catalent does not maintain required regulatory approvals for the facility, if there is an interruption in operations, or if there is insufficient manufacturing capacity; and we have substantial long-term financial commitments under our global supply agreement with Catalent for Inbrija.\n\u2022\nWe have no manufacturing capabilities for our products or product candidates and we are dependent upon third parties to supply the materials for, and to manufacture, our other products and product candidates (and in many cases these are single source suppliers).\n\u2022\nWe face risks related to health epidemics, such as the current COVID-19 global pandemic, that could adversely affect our operations of financial results.\n\u2022\nWe operate in the highly regulated pharmaceutical industry, and our business could be harmed and we could incur substantial liabilities if we (or our contractors, partners, collaborators or distributors) fail to comply with stringent federal, state and foreign legal and regulatory requirements relating to matters such as pharmaceutical marketing and promotion, safety and adverse event monitoring and reporting, fraud and abuse, false claims, Medicare rebate and other governmental pricing programs, and reporting of payments to certain health care practitioners.\n\u2022\nThe identification of new side effects from our products, or side effects that are more frequent or severe than in the past, could harm our business by leading to a significant decrease in sales or the withdrawal of marketing approval in the U.S., the EU, or other jurisdictions.\n\u2022\nWe rely on specialty pharmacies to dispense our products, deliver customer support, and provide us with related services, and our business could be harmed and we could be subject to liabilities if these services are performed inadequately or in a manner that does not comply with applicable laws and regulations.\n\u2022\nWe do not have any active drug development programs and may never commercialize any new products; because of our limited financial resources, we previously suspended work on all research and development programs, and as part of our financial management efforts, we are allowing the intellectual property associated with certain of these programs to lapse; even if we were to recommence investment in drug development programs, drug development is highly risky and uncertain, and programs may never result in a commercialized product despite significant investment.\n\u2022\nOur business depends on our ability to maintain and protect our intellectual property and proprietary trade secrets and know how, avoiding infringing the intellectual property of other parties, and complying with third-party licenses to the intellectual property of others.\n\u2022\nWe depend on sophisticated information technology systems to operate our business, and a cyber-attack or other breach of these systems, or a system error, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\n\u2022\nOur stock price may be volatile and you may lose all or part of your investment.\n\u2022\nSubstantial dilution could result from future issuances of our common stock, shares underlying existing or future equity awards to employees and directors, the possible issuance of shares to holders of our convertible senior secured notes due 2024 to settle all or a portion of our conversion or make-whole payment obligations under, and/or interest payments on, those notes, and/or the possible sale of shares pursuant to an at-the-market offering or other financing transaction.\n\u2022\nCertain provisions of Delaware law, our Certificate of Incorporation, and our Bylaws may delay or prevent an acquisition of us that stockholders may consider favorable or may prevent efforts by our stockholders to change our directors or our management, which could decrease the value of your shares.\nRisks related to our business\nWe have a history of operating losses and may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability in the future; we are substantially dependent on our ability to successfully market and sell Inbrija.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated deficit of approximately $870.4 million. We had a net loss of $104.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. We have historically been highly dependent on sales of Ampyra in the U.S. but have experienced a significant decline in Ampyra sales due to competition from several generic versions of Ampyra that began entering the market in the U.S. in late 2018. Additional manufacturers may market generic versions of Ampyra, and we expect our Ampyra sales will continue to decline over time.\nOur prospects for achieving and sustaining profitability in the future will depend primarily on how successful we are in increasing Inbrija sales in the U.S. and establishing partnerships to sell Inbrija in the EU and other territories outside the U.S., as well as the extent and timing of continuing Ampyra sales declines due to generic competition. If we are not successful in executing our business plan, we may not achieve or sustain profitability and even if we do so, we may not meet sales expectations. Also, even if we are successful in executing our business plan, our ability to achieve and sustain profitability in the future will also depend on our ability to manage our operating costs, and profitability may fluctuate from period to period due to our level of investments in sales and marketing, research and development, and product and product candidate acquisitions.\nWe may not have sufficient cash flow from our business to continue to sufficiently fund our operations and pay our substantial debt.\nWe will need to expend substantial resources for commercialization of our marketed products, including costs associated with the commercialization of Inbrija. In addition, our ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on, or to refinance our indebtedness, including $207.1 million of convertible senior secured notes that mature in December 2024, depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors beyond our control. Our business may not continue to generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to support our operations and service our debt and make necessary capital expenditures. Also, research and development programs will not generate any revenues for us for the foreseeable future, if ever, because they are all in early stages, pharmaceutical development is subject to numerous risks including those described elsewhere in these risk factors, and we have generally discontinued funding research and development.\nOur ability to meet our future operating requirements, repay our liabilities, and meet our other obligations are dependent upon a number of factors, including our ability to generate cash from product sales, reduce planned expenditures, and obtain additional financing. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from the sale of our products, we will be required to adopt one or more alternatives, subject to the restrictions contained in the indenture governing our convertible senior secured notes due 2024, such as further reducing expenses, selling assets, restructuring debt, or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous and likely to be highly dilutive. Also, our ability to raise additional capital and repay or restructure our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time, among other factors. In addition, financing may not be available when needed, at all, on terms acceptable to us or in accordance with the restrictions described above. As a result of these factors, we may not be able to engage in any of the alternative activities, or engage in such activities on desirable terms, which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations, as well as result in a default on our debt obligations. If we are unable to take these actions, we may be forced to significantly alter our business strategy, substantially curtail our current operations, or cease operations altogether.\nOur restructurings and associated organizational changes may not adequately reduce our expenses, may lead to additional workforce attrition, and may cause operational disruptions.\nIn 2021, we implemented two corporate restructurings to reduce costs, more closely align operating expenses with expected revenue, and focus our resources on Inbrija. As part of these restructurings, we substantially reduced employee headcount. Further restructuring activities may be required in the future, depending in particular on the rate of decline in our sales of Ampyra due to generic competition and whether we are able to sufficiently increase sales of Inbrija. Our\nrestructurings may have other unintended consequences as well, including, for example, making it more difficult for us to attract and retain highly skilled personnel in a competitive environment (particularly given that we have implemented four corporate restructurings since 2017). We have recently experienced workforce attrition in various functions across our business, which may be attributable to our corporate restructurings, our current business circumstances, a combination of both, or other factors. Our efforts to adjust our operations with the reduced workforce may not be successful in preventing disruption to our business, and with the reduced workforce, we lack redundancy in important functions across our business. We are increasingly relying on the services of contract sales representatives and potentially third-party promotional partnerships or other similar arrangements in response to substantial sales force attrition. Further loss of one or more of our key employees, additional loss of multiple employees in particular functions, and/or our inability to attract replacement or additional qualified personnel could substantially impair our ability to operate our business and implement our business plan, particularly our efforts to successfully commercialize Inbrija.\nWe may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to settle conversions of our convertible notes or to repurchase notes upon a fundamental change.\nHolders of our convertible senior secured notes due 2024 have the right to require us to repurchase their notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the notes to be repurchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. This use of cash may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity. Furthermore, we may not have enough available cash or be able to obtain financing at the time we are required to make cash payments with respect to the notes, whether upon maturity, conversion, or occurrence of a fundamental change. In addition, our ability to repurchase the notes or to pay cash upon conversion of the notes may be limited by law, regulatory authority or agreements governing our future indebtedness. Our failure to repurchase notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the indenture pursuant to which the notes were issued or to make cash payments to settle conversions or make interest payments (including make-whole interest payments) as required by the notes indenture, would constitute a default under the indenture.\nThe indenture governing our convertible senior secured notes due 2024 contains restrictions that may make it more difficult to execute our strategy or to effectively compete.\nSubject to certain exceptions and qualifications, the indenture governing our convertible senior secured notes due 2024 restricts our ability and the ability of certain of our subsidiaries to, among other things, (i) pay dividends or make other payments or distributions on capital stock, or purchase, redeem, defease or otherwise acquire or retire for value any capital stock, (ii) make certain investments, (iii) incur indebtedness or issue preferred stock, other than certain forms of permitted debt, which includes, among other items, indebtedness incurred to refinance our convertible senior notes, (iv) create liens on assets, (v) sell assets, (vi) enter into certain transactions with affiliates or (vii) merge, consolidate or sell all or substantially all assets. The indenture also requires us to make an offer to repurchase the convertible senior secured notes due 2024 upon the occurrence of certain asset sales. These restrictions may make it difficult to successfully execute our business strategy, including limiting our ability to engage in certain collaborations or transactions involving Inbrija and certain intellectual property, or effectively compete with companies that are not similarly restricted.\nAn event of default under the indenture governing our convertible senior secured notes due 2024 could adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to retain title to our assets, including our intellectual property.\nThe indenture governing our convertible senior secured notes due 2024 provides that a number of events will constitute an event of default, including, among other things, (i) a failure to pay interest for 30 days, (ii) failure to pay the convertible senior secured notes when due at maturity, upon any required repurchase, upon declaration of acceleration or otherwise, (iii) failure to convert the convertible senior secured notes in accordance with the indenture and the failure continues for five business days, (iv) not issuing certain notices required by the notes indenture within a timely manner, (v) failure to comply with the other covenants or agreements in the notes indenture for 60 days following the receipt of a notice of non-compliance, (vi) a default or other failure by us to make required payments under our other indebtedness or certain subsidiaries having an outstanding principal amount of $30.0 million or more, (vii) failure by us or certain subsidiaries to pay final judgments aggregating in excess of $30.0 million, (viii) certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency and (ix) the commercial launch in the U.S. of a product determined by the FDA to be bioequivalent to Inbrija. Certain of these potential events of default may occur as a result of factors beyond our control.\nIn the case of an event of default arising from certain events of bankruptcy or insolvency with respect to us, all outstanding convertible senior secured notes due 2024 will become due and payable immediately without further action or\nnotice. If any other event of default occurs and is continuing, the trustee or the holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the then outstanding convertible senior secured notes due 2024 may declare all the notes to be due and payable immediately. Such acceleration of our debt could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity if we are unable to negotiate mutually acceptable terms with the holders of the convertible senior secured notes due 2024 or if alternate funding is not available to us. Furthermore, if we are unable to repay the convertible senior secured notes due 2024 upon an acceleration or otherwise, we would be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation and we would lose title to substantially all of our assets, including our intellectual property.\nThe commercial success of Inbrija and any other future products are highly dependent on market acceptance among physicians, patients and the medical community, adequate reimbursement by governmental and other third-party payers, and other factors.\nWe face significant challenges in successfully commercializing our approved pharmaceutical products, including Inbrija. Generally, market acceptance of our products depends on the benefits of our products in terms of safety, efficacy, convenience, ease of administration and cost effectiveness and our ability to demonstrate these benefits to physicians, patients and third-party payers. Commercial success requires significant investment in sales, marketing and market access efforts, and is dependent on how well we develop and implement strategies for these efforts. Commercial success is also subject to numerous other risks, including those described below, some of which are described in further detail elsewhere in these risk factors:\n\u2022\nMarket Access: Physicians may be discouraged from prescribing our products and/or patients may not fill or refill prescriptions for our products because of the reimbursement policies or decisions of third-party payers such as commercial insurance companies and government and government-sponsored payers such as Medicare. Our sales may suffer if Inbrija or other products are not listed on the preferred drug lists of third-party payers, or if Inbrija or other products do not receive a pricing or reimbursement approval, are on the preferred drug list but subject to unfavorable limitations or preconditions or in disadvantageous positions on tiered formularies. Preconditions or other reimbursement limitations imposed by third-party payers may discourage physicians from prescribing Inbrija or other products because of the time and effort that may be needed by the prescribing physician to overcome these hurdles. Even if physicians prescribe Inbrija or another product, patients may not fill or refill the prescription if their out-of-pocket cost is too high, for example because of inadequate or lack of reimbursement from their insurance company or Medicare.\n\u2022\nSafety and Efficacy: Physicians may not prescribe our products if they do not consider our products as safe and effective for their labelled indication, and patients may determine, for any reason, that our products are not useful to them. For example, physicians may not believe that the benefits of Inbrija or our future products that we may develop are meaningful for patients or, even if they do believe there is a potential benefit, they may stage or delay the use of Inbrija with patients or patient groups to evaluate patient feedback or for other reasons.\n\u2022\nSide Effects: Market acceptance of Inbrija or another product may be impeded by the occurrence of any side effects, adverse reactions, customer complaints or misuse (or any unfavorable publicity relating thereto) stemming from the use of the product or identified in ongoing or future studies. As further described below, FDA and EU-approved product labeling for Inbrija includes limitations, warnings and precautions, which may harm its market acceptance. For example, the Inbrija product label identifies cough as one of the most common adverse reactions observed in our clinical trials, and the risk of cough may discourage some patients from taking Inbrija, and the actual occurrence of cough has led some patients to discontinue Inbrija. Also, in 2020, we updated the Inbrija U.S. and EU-approved labels to add \u201csensation of choking immediately following administration\u201d as a potential adverse reaction.\n\u2022\nCompetition: The market for Inbrija may be adversely affected by the development of products that compete with or are an alternative to Inbrija or any future products that we may develop, the timing of market entry for competing or alternative products, the perceived advantages of competing or alternative therapies over our products, and the pricing of (and reimbursement available for) our products as compared to the pricing of (and reimbursement available for) competing or alternative products. For example, as further described below in these risk factors, Inbrija competes with Apokyn, an injectable formulation of apomorphine, as well as Kynmobi, a sublingual, or under the tongue, formulation of apomorphine, both of which are approved for the acute, intermittent treatment of OFF periods.\n\u2022\nIntellectual Property: The loss of intellectual property protection for our products would enable generic competition. Ampyra became subject to generic competition in the U.S. in late 2018, due to the invalidation of certain Ampyra patents, and our Ampyra sales have been declining since then.\nAlso, in the U.S., the federal government provides funding for comparative effectiveness research, which may compare our products with other treatments and may result in published findings that would, in turn, discourage use of our products by physicians and payments for our products by payers. Similar research is funded in other countries, including in some countries in Europe.\nThe failure of any of our products or product candidates, once approved, to achieve market acceptance would limit our ability to generate revenue and would harm our results of operations and could adversely affect our future prospects. If market acceptance of our products in the U.S., EU, or other countries does not meet expectations, our revenues or royalties from product sales would suffer and this could cause our stock price to decline or could otherwise adversely affect our stock price.\nWe face risks related to health epidemics, including the COVID-19 global pandemic, that could adversely affect our operations or financial results.\nOur business and financial condition have been impacted by, and are subject to the ongoing risks resulting from, the COVID-19 global pandemic. The COVID-19 global pandemic has caused significant disruptions in the healthcare industry. The duration of the pandemic is difficult to predict, and it is likely to have ongoing impacts as it continues. The travel restrictions, \u201cshelter in place\u201d orders, quarantine policies, vaccine mandates, and general concerns about the spread and effects of COVID-19 have disrupted the delivery of healthcare to patients; for example, the pandemic has made it more difficult for some patients to visit with their physician and obtain pharmaceutical prescriptions. Also, healthcare office staffing shortages may delay the administrative work, and particularly insurance-related documentation, needed to obtain reimbursement for prescriptions. We also believe that the governmental and other restrictions and requirements related to the pandemic may have caused certain patients to lessen their mobility and therefore their need for certain therapeutics. We believe these factors contributed to volatility in new Inbrija prescriptions since the start of the pandemic in 2020 and are continuing to impact prescriptions in 2022.\nCOVID-related policies, restrictions, mandates, and concerns may disrupt our operations and those of our customers and suppliers. Also, our operations could be interrupted if we or our customers or suppliers lose the services of key employees or consultants who become ill from COVID-19. These types of disruptions could potentially affect any of our critical business functions, and thus harm our business, including for example our sales and marketing operations as well compliance and certain general and administrative functions. The ultimate impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic, or any other health epidemic, is highly uncertain and subject to change. We do not yet know the full extent of potential delays or impacts on our business, healthcare systems, or the global economy as a whole. As the pandemic continues, it may cause continuing economic volatility or result in a sustained economic downturn that could affect demand for our products and our ability to access capital on reasonable terms, or at all. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe operate in the highly regulated pharmaceutical industry.\nPharmaceutical research, development, preclinical and clinical trial activities, as well as the manufacture and marketing of any products that we have developed or in the future may successfully develop, are subject to an extensive regulatory approval process by the FDA and other regulatory agencies and authorities abroad.\nBoth in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions, the process of obtaining required regulatory approvals for drugs is lengthy, expensive and uncertain. Any regulatory approvals may be for fewer or narrower indications than we request, may include distribution restrictions, or may be conditioned on burdensome post-approval study or other requirements, including the requirement that we institute and follow a special risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, to monitor and manage potential safety issues, all of which may eliminate or reduce the drug's market potential. Additional adverse events that could impact commercial success, or even continued regulatory approval, might emerge with more extensive post-approval patient use. In the U.S., investigational products that rely on device components to deliver drug to patients, such as Inbrija, are regulated as combination products and require that we satisfy FDA that both the drug and device component of the products satisfy FDA requirements. Failure to satisfy the FDA\u2019s requirements for either the drug or device component of such combination products could delay approval of these products or result in these products not receiving FDA approval. In the\nEU, where Inbrija has received a marketing authorization and is co-packaged with a medical device (the Inbrija inhaler), the overall product is regulated under the EU\u2019s medicines rules, but the device must be CE marked and comply with the EU\u2019s medical devices rules, as further described below in these risk factors. Failure to meet these requirements could adversely affect our ability to market Inbrija in the European Economic Area, or EEA.\nAny product for which we currently have or may in the future obtain marketing approval is subject to continual post-approval requirements including, among other things, record-keeping and reporting requirements, packaging and labeling requirements, requirements for reporting adverse drug experiences, import/export controls, restrictions on advertising and promotion, current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) requirements as well as, for example in the U.S., any other requirements imposed by the applicant\u2019s New Drug Application (NDA) or Biologics License Application (BLA). All of our products and operations are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. Regulatory approval of a product may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to other restrictive conditions of approval that limit our ability to promote, sell or distribute a product. Furthermore, any approval may contain requirements for costly post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the product. Post-market evaluation of a product could result in marketing restrictions or withdrawal from the market.\nIn addition, in the EU, if a medicinal product has been granted EU marketing authorization through the centralized procedure and we do not market that product in at least one European Economic Area, or EEA, member state within three years of its first marketing authorization, the EU marketing authorization would lapse under the EU\u2019s sunset rules unless the deadline is extended. The European Commission, or EC, approved our Inbrija Marketing Authorization Application, or MAA, in September 2019. Based on Inbrija\u2019s approval, the sunset deadline for Inbrija was originally September 2022. However, in December 2021, we received an extension of the sunset deadline for Inbrija to March 31, 2023. Although we have entered into distribution and supply agreements with Esteve for the commercialization of Inbrija in Germany and Spain, we cannot be sure that Esteve will commence marketing Inbrija in one of those countries prior to the extended deadline, and we currently do not have any other agreements in place for distribution of Inbrija in the EU/EEA. If we cannot meet the deadline through our Esteve distribution arrangement or other means, our Inbrija marketing authorization will lapse and this could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe may fail to comply with existing legal or regulatory requirements or be slow to adapt, or be unable to adapt, to new legal or regulatory requirements. We may encounter problems with manufacturing processes for our products, and we may discover previously unknown problems with our products. These circumstances could result in:\n\u2022\nvoluntary or mandatory recalls;\n\u2022\nvoluntary or mandatory patient or physician notification;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of product approvals;\n\u2022\nshut-down of manufacturing facilities;\n\u2022\nreceipt of warning letters or untitled letters;\n\u2022\nproduct seizures;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on, or prohibitions against, marketing our products;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on importation of our product candidates;\n\u2022\nfines and injunctions;\n\u2022\ncivil and criminal penalties;\n\u2022\nexclusion from participation in government programs; and\n\u2022\nsuspension of review or refusal to approve pending applications.\nIn addition, we are subject to regulation under other state, federal and foreign laws and regulations, including requirements regarding occupational safety, laboratory practices, environmental protection and hazardous substance control, controlled substances and we may be subject to other local, state, federal and foreign regulations. We cannot predict the impact of those regulations on us, although they could impose significant restrictions on our business and we may have to incur additional expenses to comply with them. We may rely on collaborators within or outside the U.S. for the manufacture, sale and/or marketing of our pharmaceutical products. The failure of these other companies to comply with laws and regulations applicable to them or the activities they perform for us could similarly harm our business.\nWe must obtain a CE mark for the Inbrija inhaler under the EU Medical Devices Regulation by May 26, 2024, otherwise at that time we and any collaborators or distributors would have to cease marketing Inbrija in the EU until the CE mark is obtained.\nIn the EU, Inbrija is considered a medicinal product that is co-packaged with a medical device, the inhaler. This device is required to comply with the applicable EU medical device rules. Medical Devices Regulation (EU) 2017/745 (MDR) has applied from May 26, 2021 and repealed and replaced the Medical Devices Directive 93/42/EEC (MDD). For us or our collaborators or distributors to place the device on the market in the EU, the device must undergo the applicable conformity assessment and have a CE mark affixed. Under the MDD, as the Inbrija inhaler was a Class I device, we self-certified the conformity of the device against the MDD\u2019s requirements (including the Essential Requirements included in Annex I) and affixed a CE mark. Now under the MDR, the inhaler is a Class II device and so the conformity assessment procedure to confirm compliance with the MDR (including the General Safety and Performance Requirements included in Annex I) has to be carried out by a Notified Body (a third-party organization designated by a member state of the EEA to conduct conformity assessments) before we can affix a CE mark.\nWe have not yet CE marked the Inbrija inhaler under the MDR nor appointed a Notified Body. However, under the MDR\u2019s transition period, we can continue to place the device on the market under the MDD CE mark until May 26, 2024, so long as it continues to comply with the MDD and we make no significant changes to the design or intended purpose of the device. Failure to obtain an MDR CE mark by May 26, 2024, and/or to retain our MDD CE mark until that date would mean we and any collaborators or distributors could not lawfully market Inbrija with the Inbrija inhaler in the EU. As the marketing authorization for Inbrija requires that the medicinal product can only be used with the Inbrija inhaler device, this would mean the medicinal product could not be made available to patients in the EU until the device was CE marked under the MDR.\nWe are in the process of appointing a Notified Body and are planning to undergo an MDR inspection in the first half of 2023. However, if the Notified Body disagrees with our classification of the Inbrija inhaler device or otherwise does not agree with our approach and requires further changes, there is a risk we may fail to obtain a CE mark under the MDR before the end of the transitional period on May 26, 2024, in which case we and any collaborators or distributors would have to cease marketing Inbrija until the CE mark is obtained.\nWe have no manufacturing capabilities for our products or product candidates, and we are dependent upon third parties to supply the materials for, and to manufacture, our products and product candidates.\nWe do not own or operate, and currently do not plan to own or operate, facilities for production and packaging of our products or product candidates. We rely and expect to continue to rely on third parties for the production and packaging, active pharmaceutical ingredients, or APIs, inactive ingredients, and finished dosage forms of our products and product candidates, and where relevant any medical devices that are part of our products or product candidates. We similarly expect to continue to rely on third parties for the supply of materials for research and development activities, particularly any clinical trials we may conduct in the future. In addition, due to the unique manner in which our products are manufactured, in many cases we rely on single source providers for our commercial and investigational products, or components of those products. This dependence on others may harm our ability to develop and commercialize our products on a timely and competitive basis. Any such failure may result in decreased product sales and lower product revenue, which would harm our business.\nAs further described below in these risk factors, we sold our Chelsea, Massachusetts manufacturing operations to Catalent Pharma Solutions and rely on Catalent for the manufacture and supply of Inbrija. As our Inbrija supplier, Catalent is responsible for all Inbrija components other than the inhaler and levodopa, the Inbrija API. We have relied, and we expect to continue relying, on single third parties to supply the inhaler and levodopa. Also, we rely on a single third party to package Inbrija kits after they are manufactured. Any failure or delay by a third-party manufacturer, packager, or supplier may delay or impair our ability to commercialize Inbrija or to complete any future clinical studies that may be needed. Although in some cases we have contracts for these requirements, we cannot be certain that those contracts will be renewed on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. This may be made more complex in certain circumstances if we do not have contracts with suppliers, such as in the case of Inbrija where we currently do not have a contract with the supplier of the API, which exposes us to the risk that they could discontinue supply at any time. Manufacturers, packagers or suppliers may choose not to conduct business with us at all, or may choose to discontinue doing business with us, for example if they determine that our particular business requirements would be unprofitable or otherwise not appropriate for their business. We do not control how Catalent sources the other components of Inbrija, but we are aware that they rely on a single supplier for a critical excipient used for Inbrija manufacturing and they could rely on single suppliers for other components. Our business could be similarly exposed to risk if and to the extent they rely on single source suppliers or do not have supply contracts.\nWe currently rely on a single third-party molding manufacturer for supply of the Inbrija inhalers. Our reliance on a third party for the manufacture of inhalers increases the risk that we will not have sufficient quantities of our inhalers or will not be able to obtain such quantities at an acceptable cost or quality, which could delay, prevent or impair our commercialization of Inbrija. If the inhaler supplier fails to provide sufficient inhaler supply, we would need enter into alternative arrangements with a different supplier. Transition to a new inhaler supplier would be a lengthy and complex process. Among other things, we would have to revalidate the molding and assembly processes pursuant to FDA requirements and we would have to ensure that inhalers manufactured by the new supplier adhere to other applicable regulatory requirements.\nOur reliance on third-party manufacturers, packagers, and suppliers subjects us to risks associated with their businesses and operations. For example, even if we have agreements with third parties, they may not perform their obligations to us and/or they may be unable or unwilling to establish or increase production capacity commensurate with our needs. Also, third-party manufacturers, packagers, and suppliers are subject to their own operational and financial risks that are outside of our control, and potentially their control also, that may cause them to suffer liquidity or operational problems and that could interfere with their business operations. For example, their operations and/or ability to source raw materials and other supplies may be interrupted by natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism, or disease outbreaks (such as the COVID-19 global pandemic). In addition, the manufacture and distribution of our products and product candidates, including product components such as API, and the manufacture of medical devices, are highly regulated, and any failure to comply with regulatory requirements could adversely affect our supply of products or our access to materials needed for product development. The third parties we rely on are subject to regulatory review, and any regulatory compliance problems could significantly delay or disrupt commercialization of our products. U.S. and foreign governments and regulatory authorities continue to propose legislative and other measures relating to the manufacture or distribution of pharmaceutical products, including revisions to current good manufacturing practices, or cGMPs. Third-party manufacturers may be unable or unwilling to comply with new legislative or regulatory measures, and/or compliance with new requirements could increase the price we must pay for our products.\nThe manufacturing facilities used to produce our products, including those of our third-party manufacturers, packagers and suppliers, must comply with cGMPs and will likely have to pass a pre-approval FDA inspection and potentially other inspections required by other regulatory authorities. Third-party manufacturers, packagers and suppliers are also subject to periodic inspections for cGMP compliance from the FDA and potentially other regulatory authorities. Failure to pass such inspections and otherwise satisfactorily complete the requisite approval regimen with respect to our products or product candidates may result in regulatory actions by the FDA and other regulatory authorities, such as the issuance of FDA Form 483 notices of observations, warning letters, injunctions, facility shut-downs, product seizures, loss of operating licenses, and other civil and criminal penalties. Based on the severity of the regulatory action, our clinical or commercial supplies could be interrupted or limited, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. In some cases, these third-party manufacturers may also be subject to GMP inspections by foreign regulatory authorities. Failure to pass such inspections by foreign regulatory authorities could impede our ability to manufacture product needed for clinical trials or impede our ability to secure product approvals.\nIf any of our third-party manufacturers, packagers or suppliers fails to perform their obligations to us or otherwise have an interruption in or discontinue supply to us, we may be forced to seek a different third-party manufacturer, packager or supplier. In such event, we may experience significant delays associated with finding an alternative manufacturer, packager or supplier that is both available on commercially acceptable terms and conditions, and also properly qualified in accordance with our specifications and the requisite regulatory requirements, such as those of the FDA and other regulatory authorities. This transition may require time consuming and complex operational, testing, and regulatory approval requirements, and the process could interfere with product sales because of inadequate supply or cause interruptions of, or delays in, research and development programs. We may not be able to establish arrangements with an alternative manufacturer, packager or supplier on reasonable terms, if at all. In some cases, the technical skills required to manufacture our products or product candidates or the API, excipients or other components of such products or product candidates may be unique or proprietary to the original manufacturer or supplier and we may have difficulty, or there may be contractual restrictions prohibiting us from, transferring such skills to a backup or alternative supplier, or we may be unable to transfer such skills at all.\nWe rely on Alkermes to supply us with our requirements for Ampyra. We and Alkermes also rely on a single third-party manufacturer to supply dalfampridine, the API in Ampyra, and also a single supplier for a critical excipient used in the manufacture of Ampyra. We also rely on a single third party to package Ampyra. If these companies experience any disruption in their operations, our supply of Ampyra could be delayed or interrupted until the problem is solved or we locate another source of supply or packager, which may not be available. We may not be able to enter into alternative supply or\npackaging arrangements on terms that are commercially reasonable, if at all. Any new supplier or packager would also be required to qualify under applicable regulatory requirements. Because of these and other factors, we could experience substantial delays before we are able to obtain qualified replacement products or services from any new supplier or packager.\nAlso, under our supply agreement with Alkermes, we provide Alkermes with monthly written 18-month forecasts and with annual written five-year forecasts for our supply requirements of Ampyra. In each of the three months for Ampyra following the submission of our written 18-month forecast, we are obligated to purchase the quantity specified in the forecast, even if our actual requirements are greater or less. Given the introduction of generic competition to Ampyra in the market, it may be difficult to forecast the level of supply needed to satisfy our requirements in the future.\nWe completed the sale of our Chelsea, Massachusetts manufacturing operations in February 2021, and accordingly we rely on Catalent as our sole supplier for the manufacture of Inbrija and the manufacture of any ARCUS product candidates we may seek to further develop.\nIn connection with the sale of the Chelsea manufacturing operations, we entered into a long-term global supply agreement under which a Catalent affiliate will manufacture Inbrija on an exclusive basis (other than for sale in China). We are reliant on Catalent for all of our Inbrija supply and, subject to the negotiation of an amendment or new supply agreement, supply of other ARCUS inhaled therapeutic product candidates. Although Catalent has significant experience in commercial manufacturing, given applicable regulatory requirements and the complexity of the manufacturing processes for pharmaceuticals, Catalent may be unable or otherwise not successful in passing any required regulatory inspection as a condition to manufacturing, carrying out its contractual duties, meeting expected deadlines or effectively manufacturing or releasing Inbrija in a timely manner in accordance with current good manufacturing practices and other regulatory requirements. If we are unable to obtain adequate supplies of Inbrija under our supply agreement with Catalent, or if the supplies we receive do not meet quality and safety standards, we could face supply shortages, significant additional costs, product liability claims and reputational harm. Any of these factors, alone or in combination, could materially harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nWe are discussing potential ARCUS collaborations with other companies that have expressed interest in formulating their novel molecules using ARCUS, and have already been performing feasibility studies for a number of these opportunities. However, currently we are not investing in any proprietary ARCUS research and development programs. Should we decide to proceed with any ARCUS development program, we would be reliant on Catalent or another third-party supplier for the manufacture of product for that program. Our global supply agreement does not provide for the terms and conditions under which Catalent would supply any product or product candidate other than Inbrija, or under which Catalent would provide support for ARCUS research and development. We would be unable to advance the development of any ARCUS inhaled therapeutic candidate unless Catalent is willing to manufacture the candidate for us on commercially reasonable terms, or we could identify another third-party manufacturer that would be capable and willing to manufacture the candidate on commercially reasonable terms. Also, due to reductions in force, employee attrition and the 2021 sale of our Chelsea manufacturing operations, we may need to hire replacement personnel or engage consultants to continue with ARCUS research and development work beyond feasibility and similar early-stage studies.\nEstablishing our global supply agreement with Catalent required that we share proprietary trade secrets and know-how relating to Inbrija and our ARCUS platform. We have sought to protect that information pursuant to various operational safeguards and confidentiality and other requirements set forth in the global supply agreement. We are reliant on Catalent\u2019s compliance with those provisions, and even if Catalent does comply with those provisions, they may not provide adequate protection or prevent the unauthorized use or disclosure of the information. The unauthorized use or disclosure of our proprietary information could harm its value by enabling others to copy or use our information for their own products, methods or technologies, and we may not have an adequate remedy against Catalent or any other party for the harm caused.\nOur global supply agreement with Catalent contains substantial long-term financial commitments.\nUnder our agreement with Catalent, we are obligated to make substantial minimum purchases from Catalent through the expiration of the agreement on December 31, 2030. Currently, these minimum purchase commitments substantially exceed our supply needs for Inbrija, and we cannot be certain whether and when our supply needs will meet or exceed these amounts. Even if we are forced to obtain Inbrija from another supplier because Catalent is unable or unwilling to provide adequate Inbrija supply, we may be unable to offset the costs of alternate supply against our minimum purchase commitments under the Catalent supply agreement. Lastly, if we choose to terminate the Catalent agreement for convenience, we would be obligated to pay a substantial termination fee.\nWe rely on Catalent\u2019s Chelsea, Massachusetts manufacturing facility for the manufacture of Inbrija, and our business could be harmed if Catalent does not maintain required regulatory approvals to manufacture commercial product at that facility, if there is an interruption in operations at the facility, or if the facility does not have manufacturing capacity needed to meet product demand.\nAll commercial supply of Inbrija is currently manufactured at Catalent\u2019s Chelsea, Massachusetts manufacturing facility. Under our long-term global supply agreement with Catalent, Inbrija will be exclusively manufactured by Catalent at this manufacturing facility (other than for sale in China, which is not covered by the exclusivity provisions of the agreement). Catalent may need expanded manufacturing capacity at the Chelsea facility to meet demand depending on the timing and extent of sales growth. Catalent\u2019s inability to complete any needed expansion of the facility in a timely manner or unexpected demand for commercial quantities of Inbrija could cause a supply shortage that would harm our commercialization of Inbrija in the U.S. and any foreign jurisdictions where we seek to commercialize Inbrija (including Germany and Spain, where we intend to commercialize Inbrija through our existing agreements with Esteve). If we or a collaborator launches Inbrija in an EU member state or another foreign jurisdiction, such supply shortages could lead to a breach of our legal obligation to supply Inbrija.\nFurthermore, if Catalent were to lose the use of the facility or equipment, the manufacturing facility and manufacturing equipment would be difficult to replace and could require substantial replacement lead time and substantial additional funds. The facility may be affected by natural disasters, such as floods or fire, or Catalent may lose the use of the facility due to manufacturing issues that arise, such as contamination or regulatory concerns following a regulatory inspection of the facility. Catalent may also unexpectedly experience manufacturing issues as the unintended result of activities occurring at the facility unrelated to Inbrija manufacture. In the event of a loss of the use of all or a portion of the facility or equipment for the reasons stated above or any other reason, Catalent would be unable to manufacture Inbrija until such time as the facility or equipment could be repaired or rebuilt or they are able to address other manufacturing issues at the facility. Any such interruptions in their ability to manufacture Inbrija would harm our business. Even if Catalent does not suffer a loss of the facility or equipment within the facility, manufacturing operations can experience intermittent interruptions due to the need for routine or unexpected maintenance, inspection and repairs of the facility or the equipment, and, depending on their frequency and duration, these intermittent interruptions could also harm our business.\nWe do not have back-up manufacturing capability for Inbrija or any ARCUS product candidates, and if Catalent fails to timely perform under our global supply agreement our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects could be harmed.\nIf we are unable to obtain adequate supplies of Inbrija under our supply agreement with Catalent, or if the supplies we receive do not meet quality and safety standards, we could face supply shortages, significant additional costs, product liability claims and reputational harm. Also, if we decide to make further investments in any ARCUS product development programs, we would be unable to advance those programs unless we could obtain adequate supply of the inhaled therapeutic product candidate from Catalent or another third-party manufacturer and on commercially reasonable terms.\nWe do not currently have back-up manufacturing capability at another facility and there are only limited third-party manufacturers that we believe would be capable of manufacturing Inbrija or other ARCUS inhaled therapeutic products or product candidates. If the need arises to obtain supply from another third-party manufacturer, there can be no assurance that we could identify a third party that would be capable and willing to manufacture for us on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, or that they could supply us in sufficient quantities on a timely basis to meet our needs.\nEngaging a third-party manufacturer to supply ARCUS products or product candidates would likely be a lengthy process due to the complexity and substantial regulation of the manufacturing processes involved. Also, engaging a third party would require the sharing of proprietary information, which increases the risk of the unauthorized use or disclosure of that information and potential harm to our business for which we may not have an adequate remedy. If we are successful in engaging a third-party manufacturer, they may not perform their obligations to us and/or they may be unable or unwilling to establish or increase production capacity commensurate with our needs. Also, third-party manufacturers and suppliers are subject to their own operational and financial risks that are outside of our control, including macro-economic conditions that may cause them to suffer liquidity or operational problems and that could interfere with their business operations.\nCatalent may not successfully complete the expansion of the Chelsea, Massachusetts manufacturing facility.\nCatalent may need expanded manufacturing capacity at the Chelsea facility to meet Inbrija demand depending on the timing and extent of sales growth. In 2018, prior to our sale of the Chelsea manufacturing operations to Catalent, we initiated a renovation and expansion of the Chelsea facility that increased the size of the facility to approximately 95,000 square feet. The project added a new size 7 spray dryer manufacturing production line for Inbrija and other ARCUS products that has greater capacity than the existing size 4 spray dyer manufacturing production line, and has created additional warehousing space for manufactured product. Although the project was substantially completed in late 2019, the expansion does not yet have all of the approvals needed for use of the new production line for commercial manufacture, such as approvals from the FDA and other regulatory authorities. Also, manufacturing scale-up generally is subject to significant risks related to process development and manufacturing yields, which is especially true for the manufacture of a product such as Inbrija which involves a highly specialized spray drying and capsule filling process. Lastly, the expanded Chelsea facility will have to continue to comply with cGMP requirements, as described above in these risk factors, as well as other applicable environmental, safety, and other governmental permitting requirements. Given the potential importance of the expansion to our business, in December 2021 we agreed to fund $1.5 million of Catalent\u2019s costs to complete the size 7 spray dryer expansion, which will be payable by us in four quarterly installments after the later of January 1, 2024 or FDA qualification and approval for use of the size 7 spray dryer.\nThe challenges described above could delay or prevent Catalent from successfully completing the expansion of the Chelsea manufacturing capacity. If we need the expanded capacity but Catalent is delayed in or prevented from completing the expansion and obtaining necessary regulatory approvals, we may need to seek another party to manufacturer additional Inbrija supply for us. As described above in these risk factors, there can be no assurance that we could identify a third party that would be capable and willing to manufacture for us on commercially reasonable terms, if at all, or that they could supply us with product in sufficient quantities on a timely basis to meet our needs. If we cannot obtain increased supply of Inbrija from expanded capacity at the Chelsea facility or engaging another third-party manufacturer, we may not be able to meet demand for Inbrija and this could harm our ability to commercialize Inbrija in the U.S. and any foreign jurisdictions where we seek to commercialize Inbrija (including Germany and Spain, where we intend to commercialize Inbrija through our existing agreements with Esteve). If we or a collaborator launches Inbrija in an EU member state or another foreign jurisdiction, such an inability to meet demand could lead to a breach of our legal obligation to supply Inbrija.\nWe may incur significant liability if we or our contract sales representatives, promotional partners, distributors, or collaborators fail to comply with stringent U.S. FDA and foreign marketing and promotion regulations.\nThe advertising and promotion activities for our products are subject to stringent rules and requirements both in the U.S. and other jurisdictions, which are enforced and overseen by the FDA and other regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions. These rules and requirements vary from country to country and promotional practices and materials that are acceptable in one country may not be so in another. Importantly, unlike in the U.S., EU law prohibits the advertising of prescription-only medicinal products (such as Inbrija) directly to patients or the general public. Advertising to healthcare professionals is permitted, provided certain conditions are met.\nAmong other requirements, in the U.S. and EU, advertising and promotional materials for our products must not be false or misleading in any particular respect, and must be appropriately substantiated and fairly balanced with information on the safety risks and limitations of our products. In the U.S., we must submit all promotional materials to the FDA by the time of their first use. Some other jurisdictions also require government pre-approval of promotional materials. If the FDA or other regulators raise concerns regarding promotional materials or messages for our products, we or our contract sales representatives, promotional partners, distributors or collaborators may be required to modify or discontinue using them and may be required to provide corrective information. Should we or our contract sales representatives, promotional partners, distributors or collaborators fail to comply with the relevant requirements, in the U.S. or other countries, we may be subject to significant liability, including civil and administrative remedies as well as criminal sanctions. In the case where our contract sales representatives or one of our promotional partners, distributors, or collaborators has failed to comply with legal requirements, there can be no assurance that contractual terms and conditions intended to protect our rights and mitigate our risk relating to their misconduct will provide us with adequate rights and remedies, and actions required to protect against enforcement actions or to enforce such rights could be costly and time consuming.\nEach of our products is approved with specific indications and other conditions of use that inform our ability, and the ability of our contract sales representatives, promotional partners, distributors, and collaborators, to promote our products. For example, in the U.S., Inbrija is indicated \u201cfor the intermittent treatment of OFF episodes in people with Parkinson\u2019s disease treated with carbidopa/levodopa.\u201d The approved Summary of Product Characteristics, or SmPC, in the EU marketing\nauthorization contains a similar indication. The approved labeling in the U.S. and the EU SmPC also contain other limitations on use and warnings and precautions, the most common adverse reactions, and contraindications for risks. If potential purchasers or those influencing purchasing or prescribing decisions, such as physicians and pharmacists, third-party payers or reimbursement authorities, react negatively to Inbrija or other products because of their perception of the limitations or safety risks in the approved product labeling, it may result in lower product acceptance and lower product revenues.\nIn the U.S., EU and many other jurisdictions, we face significant risks if we or our contract sales representatives, promotional partners, distributors, or collaborators promote our drugs \u201coff-label,\u201d i.e., for uses other than those approved by the appropriate regulatory authority in a territory (e.g., the FDA in the U.S.). Physicians may prescribe drug products for uses that are not described in the product\u2019s labeling and that differ from those approved by the FDA. Similar rules apply in many countries outside the U.S. Off-label uses are common across medical specialties. In the U.S., although the FDA does not regulate a physician\u2019s choice of treatments, it traditionally has prohibited companies from promoting their drugs for off-label uses. Several federal court cases, based on First Amendment principles, have called into question the FDA\u2019s ability to enforce against companies solely on the basis of truthful and non-misleading off-label promotion of their drugs. It is unclear, however, how the courts ultimately will resolve this issue or how the FDA\u2019s policies may (or may not) change in light of developing case law. Furthermore, off-label promotion of our products could violate advertising and promotion requirements such as the prohibition against false or misleading advertising and/or labeling, or the requirement that approved labeling bear \u201cadequate directions\u201d for all of the product\u2019s \u201cintended uses.\u201d Similarly, although EU law does not in general restrict the off-label use of a product by healthcare professional, it is unlawful to promote the off-label use of a product or promotion that is inconsistent with the product\u2019s SmPC. Accordingly, we potentially face significant risk of enforcement should we or our contract sales representatives, promotional partners, distributors or collaborators promote Inbrija, Ampyra or any other products in the U.S., EU and potentially other countries for any uses that are not consistent with the products\u2019 approved labeling in the relevant territory. The FDA and other regulatory and enforcement authorities actively enforce laws and regulations regulating promotion of approved drugs as well as the promotion of products for which marketing approval has not been obtained. A company that is found to have violated these requirements may be subject to significant liability, including civil and administrative remedies as well as criminal sanctions both in the U.S. and potentially other jurisdictions.\nNotwithstanding the above-described regulatory restrictions, the FDA and other applicable regulatory authorities and EU medicines laws allow companies to engage in truthful, non-misleading, and non-promotional scientific exchange concerning their products. We engage in medical education activities and communicate with investigators and potential investigators regarding our clinical trials. Although we believe that all of our communications regarding our marketed and investigational products are in compliance with applicable advertising and promotional regulations, and we seek to ensure that the activities of our contract sales representatives, promotional partners, distributors and collaborators are similarly compliant, the FDA or another regulatory or enforcement authority may disagree.\nAny free samples we distribute to physicians must be carefully monitored and controlled, and, in the U.S., must otherwise comply with the requirements of the Prescription Drug Marketing Act, as amended, and FDA regulations.\nThe identification of new side effects from Inbrija or any other marketed drug products, or side effects from those products that are more frequent or severe than in the past, could harm our business by leading to a significant decrease in sales or to the withdrawal of marketing approval in the U.S., EU and/or other jurisdictions.\nBased on our clinical trials, the most common adverse reactions with Inbrija (at least 5% and greater than placebo) include cough, upper respiratory tract infection, nausea and discolored sputum. We constantly monitor Inbrija adverse event reports for signals regarding potential additional adverse events.\nIf we or others identify previously unknown side effects, if known side effects are more frequent or severe than in the past, or if we or others detect unexpected safety signals for Inbrija or any products perceived to be similar to Inbrija, then in any of these circumstances:\n\u2022\nwe may decide to, or be required to, send product warning letters or field alerts to physicians, pharmacists and hospitals;\n\u2022\nwe may be required to make product label changes; for example, in September 2020, we updated the Inbrija label to add \u201csensation of choking immediately following administration\u201d as a potential adverse reaction;\n\u2022\nhealthcare practitioners, regulatory authorities, third-party payers or patients may perceive or conclude that the risks associated with use of Inbrija outweigh the benefits, which could cause regulatory authorities such as the\nFDA or authorities in the EU to seek to suspend, vary or revoke Inbrija\u2019s regulatory approvals or impact the availability of adequate reimbursement by third-party payers or reimbursement authorities;\n\u2022\nwe may be required to reformulate the product, conduct additional preclinical or clinical studies, or make changes in labeling or changes to or re-approvals of manufacturing facilities;\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities such as the FDA or those in the EU may take additional risk mitigation measures, such as imposing a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (in the U.S.) or requiring an updated risk mitigation plan, detailing additional requirements to be fulfilled to manage risks (in the EU);\n\u2022\nour reputation in the marketplace may suffer; and\n\u2022\ngovernment investigations and lawsuits, including class-action lawsuits, may be brought against us.\nThe above occurrences could impair our business by harming or possibly preventing sales of Inbrija, causing sales to fall below projections, and increasing our expenses. The same risks apply to our other marketed products, such as Ampyra.\nRegulatory approval of our products could be withdrawn and our business could be harmed if we fail to comply with safety and adverse event monitoring, documentation, investigation and reporting requirements.\nUnder FDA and EU rules and regulations, we are required to monitor the safety of Inbrija and Ampyra, as applicable, and in the case of Ampyra inform healthcare professionals about the risks of drug-associated seizures with Ampyra. We are required to document and investigate reports of adverse events, and to report them to the FDA and EU authorities in accordance with regulatory timelines based on their severity and expectedness. These requirements are applicable to all medicinal products marketed in the relevant territory, including Inbrija and Ampyra. Failure to make timely safety reports and to establish and maintain related records could result in the withdrawal of marketing authorization or other regulatory action, civil actions against us, or criminal or financial penalties, any of which could harm our business. If specialty pharmacies, promotional partners, distributors, or collaborators fail timely to report adverse events and product complaints to us, or if we do not meet the requirements for safety reporting, our business may be harmed.\nWe are subject to periodic unannounced inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities related to other regulatory requirements that apply to drugs manufactured or distributed by us.\nIf we receive a notice of inspectional observations or deficiencies from the FDA or from foreign regulatory authorities, we may be required to undertake corrective and preventive actions in order to address the relevant regulatory authority\u2019s concerns, which could be expensive and time-consuming to complete and could impose additional burdens and expenses. Failure to adequately address any such concerns could expose us to enforcement and a range of potential sanctions.\nIn addition, our third-party suppliers\u2019 drug product manufacturing sites are subject to inspection by the FDA. Some of these sites have been inspected by the FDA and could be inspected by the FDA in the future. If the FDA inspects the process validation efforts and manufacturing process at these sites, the FDA might find what it considers to be deficiencies in the manufacturing process or process validation efforts, which could negatively impact the availability of product supply or, in the case of a potential new product, delay or prevent commercial launch of that product. In some cases, our third-party suppliers\u2019 drug manufacturing sites may also be subject to inspection by foreign regulatory authorities. We face similar risks to our business if those third-party manufacturers are unable to comply with foreign regulatory requirements. We and our third-party suppliers are generally required to maintain compliance with cGMPs and are subject to inspections by the FDA or comparable authorities in other jurisdictions to confirm such compliance. This may be made more complex in certain circumstances if we do not have contracts with suppliers, such as in the case of Inbrija where we currently do not have a contract with the supplier of levodopa, the active pharmaceutical ingredient. In addition, the FDA and other relevant regulatory authorities must approve certain changes to our suppliers or manufacturing methods. If we or our third-party suppliers cannot demonstrate ongoing cGMP compliance, we may be required to withdraw or recall product and interrupt commercial supply of our products. Any delay, interruption or other issues that arise in the manufacture, fill-finish, packaging, or storage of our products as a result of a failure of our facilities or the facilities or operations of our third-party suppliers, to pass regulatory agency inspection could significantly impair our ability to develop and commercialize our products. Significant noncompliance could also result in the imposition of monetary penalties, shut-down of manufacturing facilities, or other civil or criminal sanctions. Non-compliance could increase our costs, cause us to lose revenue, and damage our reputation. In addition, a delay or interruption in supply of our products could lead to claims against us by our distributors and collaborators to whom we are obligated to supply product.\nEven if our suppliers or manufacturing methods are in compliance with applicable requirements, we may encounter problems with the manufacture of our products. To investigate and/or resolve these problems, we may be required to withdraw or recall product and interrupt commercial supply of our products. These events could increase our costs, cause us to lose revenue, damage our reputation, and potentially lead to claims against us by distributors or collaborators to whom we are obligated to supply product. If we learn of certain reported problems with our products, we are required to submit field alert reports to the FDA and quality defect reports to the relevant EU authorities, such as the EMA, and we are required to investigate the causes of the reported problems. Issues identified in field alerts could lead to product recalls and interruption of supplies, which in turn could harm our business.\nAlso, the Federal Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act requires that our manufacturers, repackagers, wholesale distributors, and dispensers, take certain actions when product in their possession or control is suspect product, meaning there is reason to believe the product is: counterfeit; diverted; stolen; intentionally adulterated such that the product would result in serious adverse health consequences or death to humans; is the subject of a fraudulent transaction; or appears otherwise unfit for distribution such that the product would be reasonably likely to result in serious adverse health consequences to humans. The suspect product is required to be quarantined while an investigation is promptly conducted to determine whether the product is illegitimate, meaning credible evidence shows that it meets any of the above criteria. If a product is deemed an illegitimate product, additional requirements apply such as notifying the FDA and all immediate trading partners in the supply chain within 24 hours and quarantining the product until it is dispositioned. Similar requirements exist under EU law, particularly pursuant to the Falsified Medicines Directive (Directive 2011/62/EU). The notification, quarantine and/or dispositioning of product during an investigation could impact product availability for commercial distribution and harm our business.\nWe rely on specialty pharmacies to dispense our products, deliver customer support, and provide us with related services, and our business could be harmed and we could be subject to liabilities if these services are performed inadequately or in a manner that does not comply with applicable laws and regulations.\nA specialty pharmacy is a pharmacy that specializes in the dispensing of injectable, infused, or certain other medications typically for complex or chronic conditions, including Parkinson\u2019s disease and multiple sclerosis, which often require a high level of patient education and ongoing management. Most of our Inbrija and Ampyra sales are sold through specialty pharmacies, and sales of these products are highly dependent on the performance of these specialty pharmacies.\nThe use of specialty pharmacies involves risks, including, but not limited to, risks that these specialty pharmacies:\n\u2022\ndo not provide us with accurate or timely information regarding their inventories or the number of patients who are using Inbrija or Ampyra;\n\u2022\nfail to provide timely and accurate information regarding product adverse events or product complaints;\n\u2022\nfail to properly administer copay mitigation programs;\n\u2022\ndo not effectively dispense or support Inbrija or Ampyra;\n\u2022\nreduce their efforts or discontinue dispensing or supporting Inbrija or Ampyra;\n\u2022\ndo not devote the resources necessary to dispense Inbrija or Ampyra in a manner that meets patient needs;\n\u2022\nare unable to satisfy financial obligations to us or others; or\n\u2022\nlose the required licenses to distribute drugs; or cease operations.\nIf our specialty pharmacies do not fulfill their contractual obligations to us or fail to adequately dispense our products and deliver customer support, our product sales and business could be harmed or we could be subject to legal or regulatory liabilities or sanctions. Also, Alliance Rx Walgreens Prime, or Walgreens, is the primary specialty pharmacy that we use for sales of Inbrija in the U.S. While we believe our use of Walgreens as our primary specialty pharmacy for Inbrija has benefits for patients and our business, such reliance on a specialty pharmacy that services a large percentage of Inbrija patients also potentially increases the risks described above because we do not have a backup specialty pharmacy replace Walgreens and provide related services if an issue arises with Walgreens. We expect that it would take a significant amount of time to engage a new specialty pharmacy and transfer patients to the new specialty pharmacy if we were required to make a change, and that process could result in the loss of patients using Inbrija and/or an interruption in new patients using Inbrija.\nFurthermore, arrangements between manufacturers and specialty pharmacies can be subject to government scrutiny and challenge under fraud and abuse laws if not structured properly.\nWe are dependent on third parties such as through collaboration and distribution agreements to develop and commercialize products outside of the U.S.\nWe do not have the capabilities to develop and commercialize products outside of the U.S. without reliance on another party. Ampyra is marketed as Fampyra outside the U.S. by Biogen under a license and collaboration agreement that we entered into in June 2009. In 2021, we entered into distribution and supply agreements with Esteve Pharmaceuticals for commercialization of Inbrija in Germany and Spain, and we are relying on Esteve, among other things, to obtain necessary country-specific approvals needed for the sale of and reimbursement for Inbrija in those countries. We expect that we will need to enter into additional collaborations or distribution arrangements with third parties to commercialize Inbrija in other EU countries. We would similarly need to rely on third parties for developing and commercializing any other potential products outside of the U.S. We cannot provide any assurance that we will be able to identify suitable collaborators or distributors in addition to our existing agreements, or that we will be able to enter into additional collaboration or distribution agreements with third parties on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Our inability to identify collaborators or distributors and enter into agreements with them could harm or delay our efforts to develop and commercialize Inbrija or other potential products outside of the U.S.\nOur dependence on third parties such as collaborators and distributors for development and commercialization of products outside the U.S., does and will subject us to a number of risks, including:\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to control the amount and timing of resources that our collaborators or distributors devote to the development or commercialization of product candidates or to their marketing and distribution;\n\u2022\nour collaborators or distributors may fail to comply with laws and regulations applicable to the development, or commercialization of products or product candidates;\n\u2022\nour collaborators or distributors may not be successful in their efforts to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals or adequate product reimbursement in a timely manner, or at all, as discussed further in these risk factors;\n\u2022\ndisputes may arise between us and our collaborators or distributors that result in the delay or termination of the research, development, or commercialization of our product candidates or that result in costly litigation or arbitration that diverts management's attention and resources;\n\u2022\nour collaborators or distributors may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use our proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation;\n\u2022\nour collaborators or distributors may delay clinical trials, provide insufficient funding for a clinical trial program, stop a clinical trial or abandon a product candidate, repeat or conduct new clinical trials or require a new formulation of a product candidate for clinical testing;\n\u2022\nbusiness combinations or significant changes in our collaborator's or distributor\u2019s business strategy may also adversely affect a collaborator's willingness or ability to complete its obligations under any arrangement;\n\u2022\nour collaborator or distributor could independently move forward with a competing product candidate developed either independently or in collaboration with others, including our competitors;\n\u2022\ncollaborations or distribution arrangements may be terminated or allowed to expire, which would delay the development and may increase the cost of developing our product candidates;\n\u2022\nour collaborators or distributors may experience financial difficulties; and\n\u2022\nour ability to enter into additional collaboration agreements or distribution arrangements may be limited by the restrictive covenants contained in the indenture that governs our convertible senior secured notes due 2024.\nWhile we seek contractual terms and conditions intended to protect our rights and mitigate our risk relating to circumstances listed above, there can be no assurance that these terms will provide us with adequate rights and remedies, and actions required to enforce such rights could be costly and time consuming.\nWe do not currently receive any royalties from Biogen for sales of Fampyra, and we will not receive any royalties from Biogen until we satisfy certain financial obligations to HealthCare Royalty Partners under a 2017 royalty monetization transaction; and potential generic Fampyra competition could affect our prospects for receiving additional Fampyra royalties.\nUnder the terms of our 2017 Fampyra royalty monetization transaction with HealthCare Royalty Partners, we will not receive royalties from the sale of Fampyra until HealthCare Royalty Partners receives an agreed-upon threshold of royalties. After this threshold is met, we will receive Fampyra royalty revenue under the terms of our collaboration agreement with Biogen. Although we believe that threshold may be met in mid-2022, we cannot be certain when this will occur, because it depends on Biogen\u2019s ability to continue commercializing Fampyra.\nBiogen\u2019s commercialization of Fampyra depends on factors such as Biogen\u2019s ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals, its ability to obtain and maintain adequate third party reimbursement as described further in these risk factors, as well as the extent to which Fampyra becomes subject to competition from generic versions marketed in European or other countries. Fampyra is no longer protected by regulatory marketing exclusivity in the EU, which expired in July 2021. Accordingly, generic drug manufacturers who have obtained or may obtain marketing approval for generic versions of Fampyra in European countries can potentially launch their products in those European countries, and we and Biogen would need to rely on enforcement of Fampyra patents to prevent competition from those generic versions. Fampyra is covered by claims of two European patents, which are set to expire in 2025, absent any additional exclusivity granted based on regulatory review timelines. However, it is uncertain whether we and Biogen would be successful in any Fampyra patent litigation with generic drug manufacturers, and we and Biogen may be unable to obtain injunctive or similar relief to prevent the commercial launch of a generic product while patent litigation is proceeding. Also, generic drug manufacturers have filed nullity actions in Germany against both of the German national patents derived from these two patents, and similar legal proceedings could be filed in other European countries challenging Fampyra patents. Lastly, we do not know if Biogen will obtain approval to market and commercialize Fampyra in any new jurisdictions in the future, and there can be no assurance that Biogen will launch Fampyra in any new jurisdiction where they do obtain marketing approval. For example, in May 2021, Biogen announced that Fampyra was approved by the National Medicinal Products administration in China, but Biogen is continuing to evaluate commercial launch options in that country. All of these factors could affect sales of Fampyra sales and accordingly our prospects for receiving additional Fampyra royalties in the future.\nOur collaborators and distributors will need to obtain and maintain regulatory approval in foreign jurisdictions where they seek to market or are currently marketing our products.\nIn order to market our products in the EU and other foreign jurisdictions, separate regulatory approvals must be obtained and maintained and numerous and varying regulatory requirements must be complied with. Approval procedures vary among countries and can involve additional clinical and non-clinical testing as well as additional regulatory agency inspections. The time required to obtain approval may differ from that required to obtain FDA approval. We and our collaborators or distributors may fail to obtain foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis, if at all. In addition, individual countries, within the EU or elsewhere, may require additional steps after regulatory approval to gain access to national markets, such as agreements with pricing authorities and other agencies, that may harm the ability of us or our collaborators or distributors to market and sell our products outside the U.S. Approval by the FDA does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other countries, and approval by one foreign regulatory authority does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in other foreign countries or by the FDA. Inability to obtain or maintain necessary regulatory approvals to commercialize Inbrija, Fampyra or other products or product candidates in foreign markets could materially harm our business prospects. In addition, we may face adverse legal and business consequences if our collaborators or distributors fail to comply with legal and regulatory requirements.\nWe do not have any active drug development programs and may never commercialize any new products.\nBecause of our limited financial resources, we previously suspended work on all research and development programs, and deferred consideration of further investment. Furthermore, as part of our financial management efforts, we are allowing the intellectual property associated with certain of these programs to lapse. Future growth of our business may depend, in part, on our ability to identify new product development candidates, complete preclinical development of these product candidates, and advance them to and through clinical trials.\nEven if we were to recommence investment in drug development programs, our suspended programs are all early-stage and either have not advanced to clinical trials or are only in Phase 1 trials. Early-stage product candidates in particular\nwould require significant development, preclinical studies and clinical trials, regulatory clearances and substantial additional investment before they could be commercialized, if at all. Pharmaceutical research and development programs are subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with drug development described elsewhere in these risk factors and in general experience a high rate of failure. For example, we may fail to identify promising product candidates, product candidates may fail to be safe and effective in preclinical tests or clinical trials, or we may have inadequate financial or other resources to pursue discovery and development efforts for new product candidates. Also, as a result of reductions in force, we previously terminated substantially all of our research and development and clinical development workforce, and accordingly we lack personnel necessary to advance development programs unless and until we can hire qualified replacements.\nOur research and development programs have included exploration of opportunities for proprietary products, in addition to Inbrija, in which inhaled delivery of medicine using our ARCUS drug delivery technology can provide a significant therapeutic benefit to patients. Although our suspension of research and development investment impacted these efforts, we are discussing potential ARCUS collaborations with other companies that have expressed interest in formulating their novel molecules using ARCUS, and have already been performing feasibility studies for a number of these opportunities. However, there can be no assurance that these companies will want to further pursue, or would agree to commercially reasonable terms and conditions for, such collaborations. Even if we enter into an ARCUS collaboration for a third-party molecule, the development of the ARCUS formulation would be subject to the risks and uncertainties associated with drug development described elsewhere in these risk factors and may never be commercialized. For example, the third party could discontinue the development program for financial reasons, or safety or efficacy concerns could prevent the ARCUS formulation from receiving regulatory approval.\nFrom time to time, we may establish and announce certain development goals for product candidates and development programs. However, given the complex nature of the drug discovery and development process, it is difficult to predict accurately if and when we will achieve these goals.\nDrug products in development must undergo rigorous clinical testing, the results of which are uncertain and could substantially delay or prevent us from bringing them to market.\nBefore any product candidate can receive regulatory approval, the product candidate must be subjected to extensive clinical testing in humans to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of the FDA, EU regulatory authorities and other regulatory agencies. Clinical trials of new product candidates sufficient to obtain regulatory marketing approval are expensive and take years to complete, and the outcome of such trials is uncertain. Clinical development of any product candidate that we or a collaboration partner determine to take into clinical trials may be curtailed, redirected, delayed or eliminated at any time for some or all of the following reasons:\n\u2022\nnegative or ambiguous results regarding the efficacy of the product candidate;\n\u2022\nundesirable side effects that delay or extend the trials, or other unforeseen or undesirable safety issues that make the product candidate not medically or commercially viable;\n\u2022\ninability to locate, recruit and qualify a sufficient number of patients for our trials;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in determining meaningful end points or other measurements of success in our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nregulatory delays or other regulatory actions, including changes in regulatory requirements by the FDA and similar regulatory authorities in other countries;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in obtaining sufficient quantities of our product candidates, or where applicable comparator product or other ancillary materials needed, manufactured under cGMP;\n\u2022\ndelays, suspension or termination of the trials imposed by us or our collaboration partner, an independent institutional review board (or ethics committee), or a data safety monitoring board, or clinical holds placed upon the trials by the FDA or similar regulatory authorities in other countries;\n\u2022\napproval by FDA and/or foreign regulatory authorities of new drugs that are more effective than our or our collaboration partner\u2019s product candidates;\n\u2022\nchange in the focus of our development efforts or a re-evaluation of our or our collaboration partner\u2019s clinical development strategy; and\n\u2022\nchange in our or our collaboration partner\u2019s financial position.\nA delay in or termination of any of a clinical development program that we or a collaboration partner may conduct in the future could harm our business.\nClinical trials are subject to oversight by institutional review boards (or similar ethics committees), data safety monitoring boards, the FDA and similar regulatory authorities in other countries to ensure compliance with good clinical practice requirements, as well as other requirements for the protection of clinical trial participants. If we were to conduct any clinical trials, we would depend, in part, on third-party laboratories and medical institutions to conduct preclinical studies and clinical trials and other third-party organizations to perform data collection and analysis, all of which must maintain both good laboratory and good clinical practices required by regulators. If any of those standards are not complied with in a clinical trial, the resulting data from the clinical trial may not be usable or we, an institutional review board, the FDA or a similar regulatory authority in another country may suspend or terminate a trial, which would severely delay our development and possibly end the development of the product candidate.\nIf we proceed with research and development programs, we will rely on third-party contract research organizations, medical centers and others to perform preclinical and non-clinical testing and clinical trials, and research and development programs could be harmed if these third parties do not perform in an acceptable and legally compliant manner.\nIf we recommence investment in research and development programs, we would rely on clinical investigators, third-party contract research organizations, and consultants to perform some or all of the functions associated with preclinical and non-clinical testing and clinical trials. Additionally, we have historically conducted clinical trials in the U.S., Canada, and to a lesser extent other jurisdictions, particularly Europe. Because we have limited experience conducting clinical trials outside the U.S. and Canada, we would place even greater reliance on third-party contract research organizations to manage, monitor and carry out clinical trials in these other jurisdictions. The failure of any of these parties to perform in an acceptable and timely manner in the future, including in accordance with any applicable U.S. or foreign regulatory requirements, such as good clinical and laboratory practices, or preclinical testing or clinical trial protocols, could cause a delay or other adverse effect on preclinical or non-clinical testing or clinical trials and ultimately on the timely advancement of research and development programs. Similarly, we would rely on medical centers to conduct clinical trials, and if they fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements or clinical trial protocols, our research and development programs could be harmed.\nIf we or our contract sales representatives, promotional partners, collaborators or distributors market products in a manner that violates healthcare fraud and abuse laws, if we or any of them violate false claims laws, or if we fail to comply with our reporting and payment obligations under the Medicaid drug rebate program or other governmental pricing programs, or other applicable legal requirements, we may be subject to civil or criminal penalties or additional reimbursement requirements and sanctions, which could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nThe distribution, sale and promotion of drug and biological products in the U.S. and in foreign markets are subject to numerous laws and regulations. In the U.S., this includes regulation by various federal, state and local authorities in addition to the FDA, including the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the Federal Trade Commission, other divisions of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Federal Trade Commission, the U.S. Department of Justice and individual U.S. Attorney offices within the Department of Justice, and state and local governments. For example, sales, marketing and scientific/educational grant programs must comply with the anti-kickback and fraud and abuse provisions of the Social Security Act, as amended, the False Claims Act, as amended, and are affected by the privacy regulations promulgated pursuant to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, as amended, and similar state laws. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of safe harbors under these laws, it is possible that some of our business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of these laws. All of these activities are also subject to federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws and regulations.\nThe U.S. federal healthcare program anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce, or in return for, purchasing, leasing, ordering or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid or other federally financed healthcare programs. This statute has been interpreted to apply to arrangements between pharmaceutical manufacturers on the one hand and prescribers, purchasers, patients, and formulary managers on the other. Industry relationships with specialty pharmacies have also been scrutinized under these provisions. There are several statutory exemptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, but the exemptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and our practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for exemptions or safe harbors.\nPractices that involve remuneration for performing activities that we believe are legitimate in support of the distribution of our products may be subject to scrutiny, particularly if they do not qualify for an exemption or safe harbor, and they may be found to be improperly intended to induce or facilitate the prescribing, purchasing or recommending of our products even though we believe these practices to be in compliance with applicable laws and regulations.\nFederal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, a false claim for payment to the federal government or knowingly making, or causing to be made, a false statement to get a false claim paid. By statute, a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute may serve as the basis for a false claim under the false claims act. Numerous pharmaceutical and other healthcare companies have been prosecuted under these laws for a variety of alleged promotional and marketing activities, such as: allegedly providing kickbacks, such as free trips, free goods, sham consulting fees, and grants and other monetary benefits to prescribers; reporting to pricing services inflated average wholesale prices that were then used by federal programs to set reimbursement rates; and engaging in off-label promotion that caused claims to be submitted to Medicaid for non-covered, off-label uses. Most states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback law and false claims laws, which apply to items and services reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of the payer.\nSanctions under these federal and state laws may include requirements to make payments to government-funded health plans to correct for insufficient rebates paid by us or overpayments made to us, civil monetary penalties, exclusion of our products from reimbursement under government programs, criminal fines and imprisonment. We may also be subject to a corporate integrity agreement, deferred prosecution agreement, or similar arrangement.\nUnder the federal Sunshine Act, pharmaceutical manufacturers are required to collect information on payments or other transfers of value made to \u201ccovered recipients,\u201d which are defined as physicians, teaching hospitals, physician assistants and advance practice nurses. Similarly, the Affordable Care Act requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to annually report samples of prescription drugs requested by and distributed to healthcare providers. The law does not state whether these disclosures regarding samples will be made publicly available, and the FDA has not provided any guidance. If we fail to submit these reports, or if the reports we submit are not accurate, we could be subject to significant penalties.\nWe participate in the federal Medicaid drug rebate program established by the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1990, as well as several state supplemental rebate programs. Under the Medicaid drug rebate program, we pay a rebate to each state Medicaid program for utilization of our products that is reimbursed by those programs. Federal law requires that any company that participates in the Medicaid drug rebate program extend comparable discounts to qualified purchasers under the Public Health Service Act pharmaceutical pricing program, which requires us to sell our products to certain customers at prices lower than we otherwise might be able to charge. The minimum basic Medicaid rebate for branded prescription drugs is 23.1% of average manufacturer price, and pharmaceutical manufacturers must pay states rebates on prescription drugs dispensed to Medicaid managed care enrollees. In addition, manufacturers must pay an additional Medicaid rebate on \u201cline extensions\u201d (such as extended-release formulations) of solid oral dosage forms of branded products or products where the average manufacturer price has increased faster than the inflation rate.\nFor products to be made available to authorized users of the Federal Supply Schedule, additional pricing laws and requirements apply, as do certain obligations imposed by the Federal Acquisition Regulations. Under the Veterans Health Care Act of 1992, as amended (VHCA), we are required to offer certain drugs at a reduced price to a number of federal agencies, including the Veterans Administration, the Department of Defense (DOD), the Public Health Service and certain private Public Health Service designated entities, in order to participate in other federal funding programs including Medicare and Medicaid. Participation under the VHCA requires submission of pricing data and calculation of discounts and rebates pursuant to complex statutory formulas, as well as the entry into government procurement contracts governed by the Federal Acquisition Regulations.\nPharmaceutical companies have been prosecuted under federal and state false claims laws for manipulating information submitted to the Medicaid drug rebate program or for knowingly submitting or using allegedly inaccurate pricing information in connection with federal pricing and discount programs.\nPricing and rebate calculations vary among products and programs. The laws and regulations governing the calculations are complex and are often subject to interpretation by us or our contractors, governmental or regulatory agencies and the courts. Our methodologies for calculating these prices could be challenged under false claims laws or other laws. We or our contractors could make a mistake in calculating reported prices and required discounts, revisions to those prices and discounts, or determining whether a revision is necessary, which could result in retroactive rebates (and interest and penalties, if any). Governmental agencies may also make changes in program interpretations, requirements or conditions of\nparticipation, some of which may have implications for amounts previously estimated or paid. If we make these mistakes or if governmental agencies make these changes, we could face, in addition to prosecution under federal and state false claims laws, substantial liability and civil monetary penalties, exclusion of our products from reimbursement under government programs, criminal fines or imprisonment or prosecutors may impose a corporate integrity agreement, deferred prosecution agreement, or similar arrangement.\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, or ACA, as amended, drug manufacturers are required to provide a 70% discount on prescriptions for branded products filled while the beneficiary is in the Medicare Part D coverage gap, also known as the \u201cdonut hole.\u201d In addition, the ACA imposes a significant annual fee on companies that manufacture or import branded prescription drug products. The fee (which is not deductible for federal income tax purposes) is based on the manufacturer\u2019s market share of sales of branded drugs and biologics (excluding orphan drugs) to, or pursuant to coverage under, specified U.S. government programs.\nOutside the U.S., the distribution, sale and promotion of our products is subject to a variety of rules and requirements. In the EU, these vary from country to country and we must comply with all applicable rules in each relevant market. In many jurisdictions, these include both general anti-bribery rules and specific rules prohibiting the provision of inducements to healthcare professionals under medicines advertising laws and self-regulatory codes of conduct and guidelines. In many EU countries, the applicable industry self-regulatory codes of conduct require companies to disclose publicly any transfers of value to healthcare professionals or healthcare organizations, and disclosure laws comparable to the U.S. Sunshine Act have been adopted in some EU member states. Failure to adhere to such rules and regulations could result in any number of possible sanctions, including fines and criminal prosecutions as well as reputational damage to us and our products.\nIn the U.S., we supplement our own sales activities with the services of contract sales representatives and may enter into promotional partnerships or other similar arrangments. Outside the U.S., we rely on collaborators and distributors to market our products. Although these are independent companies, under applicable laws and regulations we can in some cases be held directly responsible for the acts or omissions of these companies because they are marketing our products. While we seek contractual terms and conditions intended to protect our rights and mitigate our risk relating to the misconduct of other parties, contractual rights would not protect us against governmental prosecution or enforcement, there can be no assurance that contractual financial remedies would be adequate to cover associated liabilities, and the actions required to protect against enforcement actions or to enforce such rights could be costly and time consuming.\nLegislative or regulatory reform of the healthcare system may affect our ability to sell our products profitably.\nThe Biden presidential administration and members of Congress have indicated an interest in measures designed to lower drug costs and there continues to be political pressure at both the U.S. federal and state levels related to drug pricing and drug transparency that could result in legislative or administrative actions, or at a minimum continued scrutiny. We cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of adverse governmental regulation that might arise from future legislative or administrative action, either in the U.S. or abroad.\nHealthcare systems outside the U.S. are varied and in the EU differ from country to country. In general, in many EU countries there is a growing pressure to lower overall expenditure on medicines and a range of government initiatives are in place or being proposed with this aim. These include measures to lower the prices of medicines, restrictions on reimbursement, and a range of substitution, procurement and prescribing initiatives. The state of healthcare legislation and regulation in the EU is also unclear and difficult to predict.\nChanges in the law or regulatory framework that reduce our revenues or increase our costs could also harm our business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows.\nOur existing or potential products may not be commercially viable in the U.S. if we fail to obtain or maintain an adequate level of reimbursement for these products by Medicaid, Medicare or other third-party payers.\nOur ability to sell our products in the U.S. and be profitable is substantially dependent on third-party payers, such as government or government-sponsored health administrative authorities, including Medicaid and Medicare Parts B and D, private health insurers and other such organizations, agreeing to reimburse patients for the cost of our products. Significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved drug products, including Inbrija. Third-party payers are increasingly challenging the pricing of medical products and services and their reimbursement practices may affect the price levels for Inbrija or other potential products we may develop in the future. Our business could be materially harmed if the\nMedicaid program, Medicare program or other third-party payers were to deny reimbursement for our products or provide reimbursement only on unfavorable terms. Our business could also be harmed if the Medicaid program, Medicare program or other reimbursing bodies or payers limit the indications for which our products will be reimbursed to a smaller set of indications than we believe is appropriate or limit the circumstances under which our products will be reimbursed to a smaller set of circumstances than we believe is appropriate.\nThird-party payers frequently require that drug companies negotiate agreements with them that provide discounts or rebates from list or wholesale prices. We have agreed to provide such discounts and rebates to some third-party payers in relation to Inbrija and Ampyra, and we expect that obtaining agreements with other third-party payers to provide access to, and reimburse patients for, our products, if possible, will similarly require that we provide such discounts and rebates. We have experienced increasing pressure to offer larger discounts and discounts to a greater number of third-party payers to maintain acceptable reimbursement levels and access for patients at copay levels that are reasonable. There is no guarantee that we would be able to negotiate agreements with third-party payers at price levels that are profitable to us, or at all. Many third-party payers have implemented utilization management techniques for Inbrija and Ampyra, such as prior authorization and/or quantity limits. Patients who cannot meet the conditions of prior authorizations are often prevented from obtaining the prescribed medication, because they cannot afford to pay for the medication without reimbursement. If we are unsuccessful in maintaining reimbursement for our products at acceptable levels, or if reimbursement for our products by third-party payers is subject to overly restrictive utilization management, our business will be harmed. In addition, if our competitors reduce the prices of their products, or otherwise demonstrate that they are better or more cost effective than our products, this may result in a greater level of reimbursement for their products relative to our products, which would reduce our sales and harm our results of operations. Both federal healthcare programs and commercial insurers are increasingly conditioning coverage, formulary placement, and/or reimbursement rates on the ability of a manufacturer to present favorable health economics and outcomes data.\nThe Medicare Part D outpatient prescription drug benefit is provided primarily through private entities, which attempt to negotiate price concessions from pharmaceutical manufacturers. These negotiations increase pressure to lower prescription drug prices or increase rebate payments to offset price. While the law specifically prohibits the U.S. government from interfering in price negotiations between manufacturers and Medicare drug plan sponsors, some members of the U.S. Congress support legislation that would permit the U.S. government to use its enormous purchasing power to demand discounts from pharmaceutical companies. While this is a priority for the Biden presidential administration, we cannot predict whether such legislation will pass. In addition, the ACA contains triggers for Congressional consideration of cost containment measures for Medicare in the event Medicare cost increases exceed a certain level. These cost containment measures could include limitations on prescription drug prices. The ACA requires drug manufacturers to provide a 70% discount on prescriptions for branded products filled while the beneficiary is in the Medicare Part D coverage gap, also known as the \u201cdonut hole.\u201d Legislative or regulatory revisions to the Medicare Part D outpatient prescription drug benefit, as well as additional healthcare legislation that may be enacted at a future date, could reduce our sales and harm our results of operations.\nThe success of our existing and potential products in the EU substantially depends on achieving adequate government reimbursement.\nThe commercial success in the EU of products approved there primarily depends on obtaining and maintaining government reimbursement because, in many European countries, patients may not have access to prescription drugs that are not reimbursed by their governments. In addition, participation in pricing and reimbursement procedures and negotiating prices with government authorities can delay commercialization. Even if reimbursement is available, reimbursement policies may negatively impact revenue from sales of our products and therefore our ability or that of Biogen, our collaborator for Fampyra, Esteve, our distribution partner for Inbrija, or any future collaborator or distributor to sell our products on a profitable basis. Furthermore, cross-border imports from lower-priced markets (parallel imports) into higher-priced markets could harm sales of products by us or our collaborators or distributors and exert commercial pressure on pricing within a country.\nGovernments in a number of international markets have announced or implemented measures aimed at reducing healthcare costs to constrain the overall level of government expenditures. This includes some of the largest markets in the EU, where Biogen markets Fampyra and Esteve has agreed to distribute Inbrija, and where we may seek to market Inbrija through other collaborators or distributors. The measures vary by country and include, among other things, mandatory rebates and discounts, clinical benefit and cost-effectiveness assessments, reimbursement limitations and reference pricing, price reductions and suspensions on pricing increases on pharmaceuticals. These measures may negatively impact net revenue from Biogen\u2019s sales of Fampyra and therefore both the timing of when we receive any further royalty revenue from Biogen\nunder the terms of our Fampyra royalty monetization transaction with HealthCare Royalty Partners, and the amount of the royalty we would then receive from Biogen. Furthermore, the adverse financial impact of these measures in any particular country, in addition to related reimbursement or regulatory constraints, could prevent the commercial launch or continued commercialization of Inbrija or Fampyra in that country.\nThe United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union, generally referred to as \u201cBrexit,\u201d could have adverse effects on our business.\nAs of January 1, 2021, the UK formally left the EU and the UK and EU are now operating separate pharmaceutical regulatory regimes. The UK and EU announced on December 24, 2020 that they had agreed a Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) to govern their future relationship. The TCA sets out the arrangements for trade of goods, including medicines and medical devices, which aims to ensure goods continue to flow between the EU and the UK and also has implications for product regulation and mutual recognition.\nFollowing the exit of the UK from the EU, we were granted a grandfathered Marketing Authorization (MA) by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) in the UK that was approved in November 2021. In order to maintain the grandfathered marketing authorization in the UK, we are required to retain the services of a qualified person for pharmacovigilance. Moreover, if we are to market Inbrija in the UK in the future, the movement of finished pharmaceutical products into the UK is treated as an import from a third country post-Brexit. The UK has decided to unilaterally waive batch testing requirements for imports of products from the EU until January 2023. Unless the UK and EU enter into a mutual recognition agreement or otherwise agree to extend this period, we may face additional quality control and batch release requirements for product entering the UK from the EU after this date.\nIn addition, although the TCA provides some clarity regarding the future relationship between the EU and UK, the impact of Brexit on the fiscal, monetary and regulatory landscape in the UK remains uncertain, it could have a material impact on its economy and the future growth of its various industries, including the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries. Given the lack of comparable precedent, it remains unclear what financial, trade, regulatory and legal implications the withdrawal of the UK from the EU may have and how such withdrawal would affect us.\nIf our competitors develop and market products that are more effective, safer or more convenient than our approved products, or obtain marketing approval before we obtain approval of future products, our commercial opportunity will be reduced or eliminated.\nCompetition in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries is intense and is expected to increase. Many biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, as well as academic laboratories, are engaged in research, development, and/or marketing of therapeutics for various neurological conditions, including Parkinson\u2019s disease and multiple sclerosis.\nOur competitors may succeed in developing products that are more effective, safer or more convenient than our products or the ones we have under development or that render our approved or proposed products or technologies noncompetitive or obsolete. In addition, our competitors may achieve product commercialization before we do. If any of our competitors develops a product that is more effective, safer or more convenient for patients, or is able to obtain FDA approval for commercialization before we do, we may not be able to achieve market acceptance for our products, which would harm our ability to generate revenues and recover the substantial development costs we have incurred and will continue to incur.\nOur products may be subject to competition from lower-priced versions of such products and competing products imported into the U.S. from Canada, Mexico and other countries where there are government price controls or other market dynamics that cause the products to be priced lower.\nInbrija/Parkinson\u2019s Disease. Inbrija competes against other therapies approved for intermittent, or as needed, use that aim to specifically address Parkinson\u2019s disease symptoms. Apokyn, an injectable formulation of apomorphine, is approved for the treatment of OFF periods, also known as OFF episodes. Apokyn was approved for this use in the U.S. in 2004 and in Europe in 1993, and in 2022 the FDA approved a generic version of Apokyn. Also, Sunovion Pharmaceuticals Inc. markets a sublingual, or under the tongue, formulation of apomorphine branded as Kynmobi that is competitive with Inbrija.\nThe standard of care for the treatment of Parkinson\u2019s disease is oral carbidopa/levodopa, but oral medication can be associated with wide variability in the timing and the amount of absorption and there are significant challenges in creating a\nregimen that consistently maintains therapeutic effects as Parkinson\u2019s disease progresses. Inbrija may face competition from therapies that can limit the occurrence of OFF periods. Approaches to achieve consistent levodopa plasma concentrations include new formulations of carbidopa/levodopa, such as extended-release and intestinal infusions, and therapies that prolong the effect of levodopa. Amneal Pharmaceuticals, Inc. markets RYTARY, an extended-release formulation of oral carbidopa/levodopa, and extended-release formulations of oral and patch carbidopa/levodopa are being developed by others including Intec Pharma and Mitsubishi Tanabe Pharma Corporation. Also, Abbvie Inc. has developed a continuous administration of a gel-containing levodopa through a tube that is surgically implanted into the intestine. This therapy, known as Duopa, has been approved by the FDA and is approved in the EU.\nOne or more of our competitors may utilize their expertise in pulmonary delivery of drugs to develop and obtain approval for pulmonary delivery products that may compete with Inbrija and any other ARCUS drug delivery technology product candidates that we may develop in the future. These competitors may include smaller companies such as Alexza Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Pulmatrix, Inc. and Vectura Group plc and larger companies such as Allergan, Inc., GlaxoSmithKline plc, MannKind Corporation, and Novartis AG, among others. If approved, our product candidates may face competition in the target commercial areas for these pulmonary delivery products. Also, we are aware that at least one company, Impel Neuropharma, is developing intranasally-delivered levodopa therapies which, if approved, might compete with Inbrija.\nAmpyra/MS. Ampyra became subject to competition from generic versions of Ampyra starting in late 2018 as a result of an adverse U.S. federal district court ruling that invalidated certain Ampyra Orange Book-listed patents. We have experienced a significant decline in Ampyra sales due to competition from several generic versions of Ampyra. Additional manufacturers may market generic versions of Ampyra, and we expect our Ampyra sales will continue to decline over time.\nCurrent disease management approaches to MS are classified either as relapse management, disease course management, or symptom management approaches. For relapse management, the majority of neurologists treat sudden and severe relapses with a four-day course of intravenous high-dose corticosteroids. Many of these corticosteroids are available generically. For disease course management, there are a number of FDA-approved MS therapies that seek to modify the immune system. These treatments attempt to reduce the frequency and severity of exacerbations or slow the accumulation of physical disability for people with certain types of MS, though their precise mechanisms of action are not known. These products include Avonex, Tysabri, Plegridy and Tecfidera from Biogen, Zinbryta from Biogen and AbbieVie, Betaseron from Bayer AG, Copaxone from Teva Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd., Rebif from Merck Serono, Gilenya and Extavia from Novartis AG, Aubagio and Lemtrada from Genzyme Corporation (a Sanofi company), Glatopa from Sandoz International GmbH (a Novartis AG company), Rituxan from F. Hoffman-La Roche AG, and Zeposia from BristolMyersSquibb.\nSeveral biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, as well as academic laboratories, are involved in research and/or product development for various neurological diseases, including MS. Other companies also have products in clinical development, including products approved for other indications in MS, to address improvement of walking ability in people with MS. Furthermore, several companies are engaged in developing products that include novel immune system approaches and cell therapy approaches to remyelination for the treatment of people with MS. These programs are in early stages of development and may compete in the future with Ampyra or some of our product candidates. In addition, in certain circumstances, pharmacists are not prohibited from formulating certain drug compounds to fill prescriptions on an individual patient basis, which is referred to as compounding. We are aware that at present compounded dalfampridine is used by some people with MS and it is possible that some people will want to continue to use compounded formulations even though Ampyra and generic versions of Ampyra are commercially available.\nState pharmaceutical compliance and reporting requirements may expose us to regulatory and legal action by state governments or other government authorities.\nMany states have enacted laws governing the licensure of companies that manufacture and/or distribute prescription drugs, although the scope of these laws varies, particularly where out-of-state distributors are concerned. We have obtained licenses in all of the jurisdictions in which we believe we are required to be licensed. However, there can be no assurance that one or more of these states will not take action under these licensure laws.\nSeveral states have also enacted legislation regarding promotional and other activities conducted by pharmaceutical companies. The specifics of these laws vary, but in general they require companies to establish marketing compliance programs; disclose various sales and marketing expenses and pricing information; refrain from providing certain gifts or other payments to healthcare providers; and/or ensure that their sales representatives in that state are licensed. Some states, including California, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Minnesota, and Vermont, and the District of Columbia, have passed laws of varying scope that ban or limit the provision of gifts, meals and certain other payments to healthcare providers and/or\nimpose reporting and disclosure requirements upon pharmaceutical companies pertaining to drug pricing, payments and/or costs associated with pharmaceutical marketing, advertising and other promotional activities. Other states also have laws that regulate, directly or indirectly, various pharmaceutical sales and marketing activities, and new legislation is being considered in many states.\nMany of the state requirements continue to evolve, and the manner in which they will be enforced going forward is uncertain. In some cases, the penalties for failure to comply with these requirements are unclear. We are continually updating our compliance infrastructure and standard operating procedures to comply with such laws, but we cannot eliminate the risk created by these uncertainties. Unless we are in full compliance with these laws, we could face enforcement action, fines and other penalties, including government orders to stop selling drugs into a state until properly licensed, and could receive adverse publicity.\nOur inability to attract and retain key management and other personnel, or maintain access to expert advisors, may hinder our ability to execute our business plan.\nWe are highly dependent on the services of Dr. Ron Cohen, our President and Chief Executive Officer, as well as the other principal members of our management and scientific, regulatory, manufacturing and commercial personnel. Our success depends in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel with the knowledge and experience needed for these and other areas of our business. We do not maintain \"key man\" life insurance policies on the lives of our officers, directors or employees.\nWe face intense competition in our hiring efforts with other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, as well as universities and nonprofit research organizations. We may be unable to attract or retain qualified personnel because their competitive salaries and other compensation may increase to levels that we are unwilling or unable to provide. In addition, material adverse developments with our business, including the 2017 adverse patent decision relating to our Orange Book-listed Ampyra patents, the termination or suspension of research and development programs, four reductions in force since 2017, and the current progress of our Inbrija commercial launch, may impede our ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel. We have recently experienced workforce attrition in various functions across our business, which may be attributable to one or more of the factors described above or other factors. Our efforts to adjust our operations with the reduced workforce may not be successful in preventing disruption to our business, and with the reduced workforce we lack redundancy in important functions across our business. We are increasingly relying on the services of contract sales representatives or other third-party marketing support in response to substantial sales force attrition. Further loss of one or more of our key employees, additional loss of multiple employees in particular functions, and/or our inability to attract replacement or additional qualified personnel could substantially impair our ability to operate our business and implement our business plan, particularly our efforts to successfully commercialize Inbrija. Also, due to the recent attrition, four reductions in force since 2017, and the 2021 sale of our Chelsea manufacturing operations, we believe we lack personnel needed for, and would need to hire replacements before continuing with, research and development and clinical programs. Our inability to attract qualified replacements needed for research and development and clinical programs could substantially impair our ability to advance those programs, if we determine to make further investments in those programs.\nWe also have scientific, medical, clinical, marketing and other advisors who assist us in our research and development, clinical, and commercial strategies. These advisors are not our employees and may have commitments to, or consulting or advisory contracts with, other entities that may limit their availability to us. Similarly, they may have arrangements with other companies to assist in the development and commercialization of products that may compete with ours. Burkhard Blank, M.D., our former Chief Medical Officer, transitioned into a consulting role effective January 1, 2022, and, to our knowledge, has commenced a full time role as an executive at another biopharmaceutical company. We cannot be sure whether and for how long we will have continuing access to Dr. Blank\u2019s expertise for our business, and currently we have not identified any individual with comparable expertise to replace Dr. Blank.\nWe and our third-party contract manufacturers must comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, and failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose us to significant costs or liabilities.\nBiopharmaceutical research and development activities are subject to numerous and increasingly stringent environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those which govern laboratory procedures and the use, generation, manufacture, distribution, storage, handling, treatment, remediation and disposal of hazardous substances. We may incur substantial costs in order to comply with current or future such laws and regulations, which may also impair research and development efforts that we may be engaged in. We cannot completely avoid the risk of contamination or injury\nin connection with research and development activities, and in such cases of contamination or injury, or in cases of failure to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could be held liable, and in some cases strictly liable, for any resulting damages.\nAlso, the existence, investigation and/or remediation of contamination at properties currently or formerly owned, leased or operated by us may result in costs, fines or other penalties. Furthermore, our third-party manufacturers are subject to the same or similar environmental, health and safety laws and regulations as those to which we are subject. It is possible that if our third-party manufacturers fail to operate in compliance with the applicable environmental, health and safety laws and regulations or properly dispose of wastes associated with our products, we could be held liable for any resulting damages and/or experience a disruption in the manufacture and supply of our product candidates or products. Any such liability may result in substantial civil or criminal fines, penalties or other sanctions, which could exceed our assets and resources, as well as reputational harm.\nAlthough we assigned our Chelsea, Massachusetts manufacturing facility lease to Catalent Pharma Solutions in February 2021, we remain responsible for certain contingent environmental liabilities should an issue arise in the future relating to the operation of the facility prior to the assignment.\nRisks related to our intellectual property\nIf we cannot protect, maintain and, if necessary, enforce our intellectual property, our ability to develop and commercialize our products will be severely limited.\nOur success will depend in part on our and our licensors' ability to obtain, maintain and enforce patent and trademark protection for the technologies, compounds and products, if any, resulting from our licenses and research and development programs. Without protection for the intellectual property we use or intend to use, other companies could offer substantially identical products for sale without incurring the sizable discovery, research, development and licensing costs that we have incurred. Our ability to recover these expenditures and realize profits upon the sale of products could be diminished.\nWe have patent portfolios relating to Inbrija and our ARCUS drug delivery technology composed of both our own and in-licensed patents and patent applications. For some of our proprietary technologies, for example our ARCUS drug delivery technology, we rely on a combination of patents, trade secret protection and confidentiality agreements to protect our intellectual property rights. Our intellectual property also includes copyrights and a portfolio of trademarks.\nThe process of obtaining patents and trademarks can be time consuming and expensive with no certainty of success. Even if we spend the necessary time and money, a patent or trademark may not issue, it may not issue in a timely manner, or it may not have sufficient scope or strength to protect the technology it was intended to protect or to provide us with any commercial advantage. We may never be certain that we were the first to develop the technology or that we were the first to file a patent application for the particular technology because patent applications are confidential until they are published, and publications in the scientific or patent literature lag behind actual discoveries. The degree of future protection for our proprietary rights will remain uncertain if our pending patent applications are not allowed or issued for any reason or if we are unable to develop additional proprietary technologies that are patentable. Furthermore, third parties may independently develop similar or alternative technologies, duplicate some or all of our technologies, design around our patented technologies or challenge our issued patents or trademarks or the patents or trademarks of our licensors. For example, Ampyra became subject to competition from generic versions of Ampyra starting in late 2018 as a result of an adverse U.S. federal district court ruling that invalidated certain Ampyra Orange Book-listed patents. We have experienced a significant decline in Ampyra sales due to competition from several generic versions of Ampyra. Additional manufacturers may market generic versions of Ampyra, and we expect our Ampyra sales will continue to decline over time.\nAlso, the validity of our patents can be challenged by third parties pursuant to procedures introduced by American Invents Act, specifically inter partes review and/or post grant review before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. For example, in 2015, a hedge fund (acting with affiliated entities and individuals and proceeding under the name of the Coalition for Affordable Drugs) filed inter partes review (IPR) petitions with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, challenging some of our Ampyra Orange Book-listed patents. We successfully defended the patents in these proceedings, but this outcome did not affect the U.S. federal district court decision invalidating Ampyra Orange Book-listed patents as described above. IPR petitions could be filed in the future challenging our other patents for any of our programs.\nNullity actions with respect to Fampyra have been filed in Germany against both of the German national patents derived from EP 1732548 (the \u2018548 patent) and EP 2377536 (the \u2018536 patent) by ratiopharm GmbH, a generic manufacturer affiliated with Teva. In November 2021, a German court issued preliminary opinions in the ratiopharm case indicating that the claimed subject matter of the \u2018548 patent lacked inventive step and the claimed subject matter of the \u2018536 patent lacked novelty and inventive step. At an oral hearing in February 2022, the German patent court dismissed ratiopharm\u2019s action against the \u2018536 patent as inadmissible because of ongoing formality proceedings relating to the \u2018536 patent in the European Patent Office. Ratiopharm could appeal this decision or refile the nullity action when the formalities are completed at the European Patent Office. An oral hearing is currently scheduled for April 26, 2022, for the \u2018548 patent. On January 11, 2022, STADA Arzneimittel also filed a nullity action against the \u2018536 patent in the same court. We are working with Biogen to vigorously defend these actions and enforce our patent rights. Refer to Legal Proceedings in Part I, Item 3 of this report for more information.\nPatent litigation, IPR proceedings, and other legal proceedings usually involve complex legal and factual questions and require the devotion of significant financial resources and management time and attention. If we are not successful in protecting any of our intellectual property that is subject to such proceedings, we could lose Orange Book listed patents that protect our products and our business could be materially harmed. We can provide no assurance concerning the duration or the outcome of any such lawsuits and legal proceedings.\nWe may initiate actions to protect our intellectual property and in any litigation in which our intellectual property or our licensors' intellectual property is asserted, a court may determine that the intellectual property is invalid or unenforceable. Even if the validity or enforceability of that intellectual property is upheld by a court, a court may not prevent alleged infringement on the grounds that such activity is not covered by, for example, the patent claims. In addition, effective intellectual property enforcement may be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries for a variety of legal and public policy reasons. From time to time we may receive notices from third parties alleging infringement of their intellectual property rights. Any litigation, whether to enforce our rights to use our or our licensors' patents or to defend against allegations that we infringe third-party rights, would be costly, time consuming, and may distract management from other important tasks.\nAs is commonplace in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry, we employ individuals who were previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. To the extent our employees are involved in areas that are similar to those areas in which they were involved at their former employers, we may be subject to claims that such employees and/or we have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed the alleged trade secrets or other proprietary information of the former employers. Litigation may be necessary to defend against such claims, which could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management and which could have an adverse effect on us, even if we are successful in defending such claims.\nWe also rely in our business on trade secrets, know-how and other proprietary information. For example, the know-how that forms the basis of our proprietary manufacturing process for the ARCUS technology and Inbrija manufacturing is substantially dependent on trade secret protection. Establishing our global supply agreement with Catalent required that we share this type of information with Catalent, and we may need to share similar information with others in the future in connection with development of backup or additional manufacturing needed for Inbrija commercialization. We seek to protect trade secrets, know-how and other proprietary information, in part, through the use of confidentiality agreements with employees, consultants, collaborators, advisors and others, and in the case of Catalent by including various operational safeguards and confidentiality and other requirements in our global supply agreement with them. Nonetheless, those agreements may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets, know-how or other proprietary information, including our proprietary ARCUS technology, and prevent their unauthorized use or disclosure. To the extent that consultants, collaborators, key employees or other third parties apply technological information independently developed by them or by others to our proposed products, joint ownership may result, which could undermine the value of the intellectual property to us or disputes may arise as to the proprietary rights to such information which may not be resolved in our favor. The risk that other parties may breach confidentiality agreements or that our trade secrets such as our ARCUS technology become known or independently discovered by competitors, could harm us by enabling our competitors, who may have greater experience and financial resources, to copy or use our trade secrets and other proprietary information in the advancement of their products, methods or technologies. Policing unauthorized use of our or our licensors' intellectual property is difficult, expensive and time-consuming, and we may be unable to determine the extent of any unauthorized use. Adequate remedies may not exist in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure.\nOur business could be harmed by requirements to publicly disclose our clinical trial data.\nThere is an increasing trend across multiple jurisdictions, including the United States and the EU, towards requiring greater transparency, particularly in the area of clinical trial results. In many jurisdictions, including the U.S. and the EU, we are required to register most of our clinical trials as well as disclose summaries of the results of those clinical trials. Further requirements for transparency could result in the disclosure of data down to the individual patient level. In the EU, for example, the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, has since 2015 implemented a policy on transparency of clinical trial data submitted to the agency in applications for marketing authorization. These data traditionally were regarded as confidential commercial information not subject to disclosure. According to this policy, the EMA proactively publishes anonymized clinical data submitted by pharmaceutical companies to support their regulatory applications submitted after January 1, 2015 (subject to certain company redactions agreed with the EMA during the application review process). Possible redactions include commercially confidential information, identifiable information about study participants and study staff and patient level data (i.e., line listings including patient data against individual patient codes). The EMA plans to release patient level data in the future, but needs to address some data privacy concerns before doing so. The EMA may release clinical data submitted before this date on request, subject to the company having the opportunity to make similar redactions. The precise implementation of the EMA\u2019s policy remains in flux and subject to legal challenge. This could harm our business in a variety of ways, including for example through disclosure of our trade secret methodologies for clinical development of our products, and/or by potentially enabling competitors to use our clinical data to gain approvals for their own products in the same or other jurisdictions. Regardless of the precise details of the EMA\u2019s policy, the trend across governments is for increased transparency, which could diminish our ability to protect our confidential commercial information.\nIf third parties successfully claim that we infringe their patents or proprietary rights, our ability to continue to develop and successfully commercialize our product candidates could be delayed or prevented.\nThird parties may claim that we or our licensors or suppliers are infringing their patents or are misappropriating their proprietary information. In the event of a successful claim against us or our licensors or suppliers for infringement of the patents or proprietary rights of others relating to any of our marketed products or product candidates, we may be required to:\n\u2022\npay substantial damages;\n\u2022\nstop using our technologies;\n\u2022\nwithdraw a product from the market;\n\u2022\nstop certain research and development efforts;\n\u2022\nsignificantly delay product commercialization activities;\n\u2022\ndevelop non-infringing products or methods, which may not be feasible; and\n\u2022\nobtain one or more licenses from third parties.\nIn addition, from time to time, we may become aware of third parties who have, or claim to have, intellectual property rights covering matters such as methods for doing business, conducting research, diagnosing diseases or prescribing medications that are alleged to be broadly applicable across sectors of the industry, and we may receive assertions that these rights apply to us. The existence of such intellectual property rights could present a risk to our business.\nA license required under any patents or proprietary rights held by a third party may not be available to us, or may not be available on acceptable terms. If we or our licensors or suppliers are sued for infringement we could encounter substantial delays in, or be prohibited from developing, manufacturing and commercializing our product candidates and advancing our preclinical or clinical programs. In addition, any such litigation would be costly, time consuming, and might distract management from other important tasks.\nWe are dependent on our license agreements and if we fail to meet our obligations under these license agreements, or our agreements are terminated for any reason, we may lose our rights to our in-licensed patents and technologies.\nWe are dependent on licenses for intellectual property for products and research and development, including in particular Inbrija and potential ARCUS-based programs. Our failure to meet any of our obligations under these license agreements could result in the loss of our rights to this intellectual property. If we lose our rights under any of these license\nagreements, we may be unable to commercialize, or continue commercializing, a product that uses licensed intellectual property.\nRisks relating to our common stock\nOur stock price may be volatile and you may lose all or a part of your investment.\nOur stock price could fluctuate significantly due to a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nachievement or rejection of regulatory approvals by us or our collaborators or by our competitors;\n\u2022\npublicity regarding actual or potential clinical trial results or updates relating to products under development by us, our collaborators, or our competitors;\n\u2022\ndevelopments concerning proprietary rights, including patents; including litigation and other legal proceedings;\n\u2022\ndilution, or expected or potential dilution, relating to the issuance of additional shares of our common stock to satisfy conversion or make-whole payment obligations under, or interest on, our convertible senior secured notes due 2024;\n\u2022\nissuance of additional shares of our common stock, and the expected dilution to our stockholders resulting therefrom, which may occur upon the refinancing of our convertible senior notes;\n\u2022\nannouncements of new acquisitions, collaborations, financings or other transactions, or of technological innovations or new commercial products by our competitors or by us; regulatory developments in the U.S. and foreign countries;\n\u2022\nchanges in securities analysts' estimates of our performance or our failure to meet analysts' expectations;\n\u2022\nsales of substantial amounts of our stock or short selling activity by certain investors;\n\u2022\nvariations in our anticipated or actual operating results;\n\u2022\nconditions or trends in the pharmaceutical or biotechnology industries;\n\u2022\ngovernment regulation of drug pricing;\n\u2022\nchanges in healthcare reimbursement policies; and\n\u2022\nevents that affect, or have the potential to affect, general economic conditions, including but not limited to political unrest, global trade wars, natural disasters, acts of war, terrorism, or disease outbreaks (such as the COVID-19 global pandemic).\nMany of these factors are beyond our control, and we believe that period-to-period comparisons of our financial results will not necessarily be indicative of our future performance. If our revenues in any particular period do not meet expectations, we may not be able to adjust our expenditures in that period, which could cause our operating results to suffer. If our operating results in any future period fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors, our stock price may fall by a significant amount.\nIn addition, the stock markets in general, and the Nasdaq Global Select Market and the market for biopharmaceutical companies in particular, have recently and can in the future experience extreme price and volume fluctuations. These fluctuations often have been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies. These broad market and industry factors may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nWe cannot predict the effect that our reverse stock split will have on the market price for shares of our common stock.\nWe completed a one-for-six reverse stock split on December 31, 2020. We cannot predict the long-term effect of the reverse stock split upon the market price for shares of our common stock, and the history of similar reverse stock splits for companies in like circumstances has varied. Although the reverse stock split initially resulted in an increased market price per share of our common stock, the market price per share has since substantially declined and may continue to decline due to, among other factors, the performance of our business, economic conditions and other factors, some of which may not be\nunder our control. Even with an increased market price per share, the total market capitalization of our shares is lower than the total market capitalization before the reverse stock split and it could continue to decline.\nFuture sales of our common stock could cause our stock price to decline, and future issuances of common stock could cause substantial dilution.\nIf our existing stockholders sell a large number of shares of our common stock, or the public market perceives that existing stockholders might sell shares of common stock, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly. Sales of substantial amounts of shares of our common stock in the public market by our executive officers, directors, 5% or greater stockholders or other stockholders, or the prospect of such sales, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. As of March 9, 2022, 13,250,296 shares of our common stock were issued and outstanding; options to acquire 1,189,705 shares of our common stock were outstanding, exercisable at an average exercise price of $92.13 per share, issued under our 2006 Employee Incentive Plan, our 2015 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan, and our 2016 Inducement Plan; and restricted stock units issued under our 2015 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan entitling the holders to an aggregate of 112,264 shares of our common stock were outstanding. Additional shares of common stock are authorized for issuance pursuant to options and other stock-based awards under our 2015 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan and under our 2019 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, and additional stock-based awards could be issued under our 2016 Inducement Plan. To the extent that option holders exercise outstanding options, there may be further dilution and the sales of shares issued upon such exercises could cause our stock price to drop further. In addition, if we elect to settle all or a portion of our conversion or make-whole payment obligations under, and/or interest payments on, our convertible senior secured notes due 2024 in shares of our common stock, our stockholders could experience significant dilution. Lastly, in January 2021, we entered into an At The Market (ATM) Offering Agreement with H.C. Wainwright & Co., LLC as sales agent. Pursuant to the ATM agreement, we may offer and sell shares of our common stock having an aggregate value of up to $15.25 million in an at-the-market offering, which could cause additional dilution.\nCertain provisions of Delaware law, our Certificate of Incorporation, and our Bylaws may delay or prevent an acquisition of us that stockholders may consider favorable or may prevent efforts by our stockholders to change our directors or our management, which could decrease the value of your shares.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us, and may have the effect of preventing or hindering any attempt by our stockholders to replace our current directors or officers. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nOur board of directors has the right to elect directors to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on our board of directors.\n\u2022\nOur board of directors may issue, without stockholder approval, shares of preferred stock with rights, preferences and privileges determined by the board of directors. The ability to authorize and issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences makes it possible for our board of directors to issue preferred stock with super voting, special approval, dividend or other rights or preferences on a discriminatory basis that could impede the success of any attempt to acquire us.\n\u2022\nOur board of directors is divided into three classes, each with staggered three-year terms. As a result, only one class of directors will be elected at each annual meeting of stockholders, and each of the two other classes of directors will continue to serve for the remainder of their respective three-year terms, limiting the ability of stockholders to reconstitute the board of directors.\n\u2022\nThe vote of the holders of 75% of the outstanding shares of our common stock is required in order to take certain actions, including amendment of our bylaws, removal of directors for cause and certain amendments to our certificate of incorporation.\n\u2022\nOur Bylaws contain an exclusive forum clause providing that (i) the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the exclusive forum for actions or proceedings for (a) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf; (b) any action asserting a breach of a fiduciary duty; (c) any action asserting a claim arising pursuant to any provision of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware or the our Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws; (d) any action or proceeding to interpret, apply, enforce or determine the validity of our Certificate of\nIncorporation or Bylaws, including any right, obligation or remedy thereunder; or (e) any action asserting a claim governed by the internal affairs doctrine, and (ii) the federal district courts of the United States of America will be the exclusive forum for resolving any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act of 1933.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to certain anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law. Under Delaware law, a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holders has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the board of directors has approved the transaction. Our board of directors could rely on Delaware law to prevent or delay an acquisition of us, which could have the effect of reducing your ability to receive a premium on your common stock.\nBecause we do not intend to pay dividends in the foreseeable future, you will benefit from an investment in our common stock only if it appreciates in value.\nWe have not paid cash dividends on any of our classes of capital stock to date, and we currently intend to retain our future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business. As a result, we do not expect to pay any cash dividends in the foreseeable future. The success of your investment in our common stock will depend entirely upon any future appreciation. There is no guarantee that our common stock will appreciate in value or even maintain the price at which you purchased your shares.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nOur ability to use net operating loss carry forwards to reduce future tax payments may be limited if taxable income does not reach sufficient levels or if there is a change in ownership of Acorda.\nIn general, under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), a corporation is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize net operating losses, or NOLs, to offset future taxable income. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $234.0 million of U.S. Federal NOLs. Existing NOLs that were incurred prior to 2018 have a 20-year carryforward available (based on when they were incurred) to reduce taxable income in future years. Federal income tax losses generated in tax years ending after January 1, 2018 can generally be carried forward indefinitely, due to 2017 tax reform legislation. However, the ability to use existing NOL carryforwards will be dependent on our ability to generate taxable income and will be subject to an annual limitation of 80% of taxable income. Of our existing NOLs, approximately $121.6 million existed at December 31, 2021 and were incurred by our Biotie subsidiary. Our ability to use these Biotie NOL carryforwards will depend on the ability of that specific subsidiary to generate taxable income, and because we do not expect any taxable income from that subsidiary we currently do not assign any value to these NOLs. The remaining U.S. Federal NOL carryforward as of December 31, 2021 of approximately $112.4 million is for the Acorda Therapeutics, Inc. return filing group, which is carried forward indefinitely and subject to the 80% limitation on taxable income when utilized in future tax years.\nOur ability to utilize the NOL's may be further limited if we undergo an ownership change, as defined in section 382 of the Code. This ownership change could be triggered by substantial changes in the ownership of our outstanding stock, which are generally outside of our control. An ownership change would exist if the stockholders, or group of stockholders, who own or have owned, directly or indirectly, 5% or more of the value of our stock, or are otherwise treated as 5% stockholders under section 382 and the regulations promulgated thereunder, increase their aggregate percentage ownership of our stock by more than 50 percentage points over the lowest percentage of our stock owned by these stockholders at any time during the testing period, which is generally the three-year period preceding the potential ownership change. In the event of an ownership change, section 382 imposes an annual limitation on the amount of post-ownership change taxable income a corporation may offset with pre-ownership change NOL's. If an ownership change were to occur, the annual limitation under Section 382 could result in a material amount of our NOLs expiring unused. This could significantly impair any value we assign to our NOL asset and, as a result, could have a negative impact on our financial position and results of operations.\nWe may have exposure to additional tax liabilities, which could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position.\nWe are subject to income taxes, as well as non-income based taxes, in both the U.S. and Puerto Rico, as well as certain European countries where we have subsidiaries and/or subsidiary operations. Significant judgment is required in determining\nour tax liabilities. Although we believe our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate outcome with respect to the taxes we owe may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements. If the Internal Revenue Service, or other taxing authority, disagrees with the positions taken by us, we could have additional tax liability, and this could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position. In addition, governments may adopt tax reform measures that significantly increase our worldwide tax liabilities, which could materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may expand our business through the acquisition of companies or businesses or in-licensing product candidates that could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition.\nWe may in the future seek to expand our products and capabilities by acquiring one or more companies or businesses or in-licensing one or more product candidates. Our ability to enter into these types of transactions as part of our business strategy may be constrained based on our limited cash resources and/or limited access to other sources of capital needed to fund such transactions. Also, our ability to enter into such transactions is limited in part because of restrictive covenants contained in the indenture governing our convertible senior secured notes due 2024 which constrain the type and terms of such agreements. Acquisitions and in-licenses involve numerous risks, including:\n\u2022\nsubstantial cash expenditures;\n\u2022\npotentially dilutive issuance of equity securities;\n\u2022\nincurrence or assumption of debt and contingent liabilities, some of which may not be disclosed to us and may be difficult or impossible for us to identify at the time of acquisition;\n\u2022\nexposure to business risks or issues, or legal or regulatory compliance issues, such as with the FDA, associated with the acquired or in-licensed company, business or product candidate, which may not be disclosed to us and may be difficult or impossible for us to identify at the time of acquisition or licensing;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in assimilating the personnel and/or operations of the acquired companies;\n\u2022\ndiversion of our management\u2019s attention away from other business concerns;\n\u2022\ncommencement of business in markets where we have limited or no direct experience; and\n\u2022\npotential loss of our key employees or key employees of the acquired companies or businesses.\nWe cannot assure you that any acquisition or in-license will result in short-term or long-term benefits to us. We may incorrectly judge the value or worth of an acquired company or business or in-licensed products or product candidates, for example by underestimating the investment required to advance research and development programs, or overestimating likelihood of approval by the FDA or similar foreign regulators or the market potential of acquired or in-licensed products or product candidates. Acquired development programs are generally subject to all of the risks inherent in the drug development process, and our knowledge of the risks specifically relevant to acquired programs generally improves over time.\nIn addition, our future success would depend in part on our ability to manage the rapid growth associated with some of these acquisitions and in-licenses. Any acquisition might distract resources from and otherwise harm sales of Inbrija or other products we currently, or may in the future, market. We cannot assure you that we would be able to make the combination of our business with that of acquired businesses or companies or in-licensed products or product candidates work or be successful. Furthermore, the development or expansion of our business or any acquired business or company or in-licensed product or product candidate may require a substantial capital investment by us. We may not have these necessary funds or they might not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. We may also seek to raise funds by selling shares of our stock, which could dilute our current stockholders\u2019 ownership interest, or securities convertible into our stock, which could dilute current stockholders\u2019 ownership interest upon conversion. Also, although we may from time to time announce that we have entered into agreements to acquire other companies or assets, we cannot assure you that these acquisitions will be completed in a timely manner or at all. These transactions are subject to an inherent risk that they may not be completed, for example because required closing conditions cannot be met at all or within specified time periods, termination rights may be exercised such as due to a breach by one of the parties, or other contingencies may arise that affect the transaction.\nWe face an inherent risk of liability in the event that the use or misuse of our products results in personal injury or death.\nIf the use or misuse of Inbrija, Ampyra or any other approved products we or our collaborator or distributor may sell in the future harms people, we may be subject to costly and damaging product liability claims brought against us by consumers, healthcare providers, pharmaceutical companies, third-party payers or others. The use of our product candidates in clinical trials could also expose us to product liability claims. We currently maintain a product liability insurance policy that includes coverage for our marketed products as well as for clinical trials. The total insurance limit is $30 million per claim, and the aggregate amount of claims under the policy is also capped at $30 million. We cannot predict all of the possible harms or side effects that may result from the use of our products or the testing of product candidates and, therefore, the amount of insurance coverage we currently have may not be adequate to cover all liabilities or defense costs we might incur. A product liability claim or series of claims brought against us could give rise to a substantial liability that could exceed our resources. Even if claims are not successful, the costs of defending such claims and potential adverse publicity could be harmful to our business.\nAdditionally, we have entered into various agreements where we indemnify third parties such as manufacturers and investigators for certain product liability claims related to our products. These indemnification obligations may require us to pay significant sums of money for claims that are covered by these indemnification obligations.\nWe may be the subject of litigation, which, if adversely determined, could harm our business and operating results.\nFrom time to time, we may be subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits. The costs of defending any litigation, whether in cash expenses or in management time, could harm our business and materially and adversely affect our operating results and cash flows, even if we ultimately win the litigation. An unfavorable outcome on any litigation matter could require that we pay substantial damages, or, in connection with any intellectual property infringement claims, could require that we pay ongoing royalty payments or prohibit us from selling certain of our products. In addition, we may decide to settle any litigation, which could cause us to incur significant settlement costs. A settlement or an unfavorable outcome on any litigation matter could have a material and adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows.\nWe depend on sophisticated information technology systems to operate our business and a cyber-attack or other breach of these systems, or a system error, could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe are increasingly and substantially dependent upon information technology systems and infrastructure to operate our business. In the ordinary course of our business, we collect, store, process, and transmit sensitive data on our networks and systems, including our intellectual property and proprietary or confidential business information (such as research data) and confidential information (and personal information) with respect to our employees, customers, clinical trial patients and our business partners. In the ordinary course of our business, this type of data is also collected, stored, processed, and transmitted on the networks and systems of business partners and vendors from whom we purchase software and/or technology-based services.\nThe size and complexity of our and third-party information technology systems and infrastructure, and their connection to the Internet, make such systems potentially vulnerable to service interruptions, system errors leading to data loss, data theft, unauthorized disclosure, and/or cyber-attacks. These incidents could result from inadvertent or intentional actions or omissions by our employees and consultants, or those of our business partners and vendors, or from the actions of third parties with criminal or other malicious intent. As with most other companies, our information technology systems have been, and will likely continue to be, subject from time to time to computer viruses, malicious codes, unauthorized access, and other forms or cyber-attack, and we expect the sophistication and frequency of such efforts to continue to increase. To date, we are not aware of any significant impact to our business or operations resulting from these occurrences affecting our or third-party information technology systems that we utilize; however, there is a growing risk of harm from these types of incidents, which could disrupt our operations, result in a loss of assets, and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWe are increasingly relying on the networks and systems of third-party vendors as we seek to migrate the storage and processing of business and other information from our own computer servers and networks to \u201ccloud\u201d-based storage and software systems and services maintained by third-party vendors. While we believe there are potential cost savings and other benefits from this migration strategy, we do not control how third-party vendors maintain their networks and systems, what technology they implement to protect their systems from cyber-attack or other malicious behavior, or what corrective or\nremedial measures they would take in response to service issues or a criminal or other malicious attack. Also, many of these vendors are large, well-known technology companies that maintain substantial volumes of information for a large number of companies, and whose systems may therefore be larger targets for criminal or other malicious actors as compared to our own networks and systems. Accordingly, our migration to third-party networks and system could increase the risk that business and other information maintained by us could be subject to a breach, theft, unauthorized disclosure, or other forms of cyber-attacks even if we are not specifically targeted.\nUnauthorized access to, or disclosure or theft of, our business information and/or other information we maintain could compromise our intellectual property, expose sensitive business information, and expose personal information of our clinical trial patients, employees, and others. Any such event that leads to unauthorized access, use, or disclosure of personal information, including personal information regarding our patients or employees, could harm our reputation and business, compel us to comply with federal and/or state breach notification laws and foreign law equivalents, subject us to mandatory corrective action, require us to verify the correctness of database contents and otherwise subject us to liability under laws and regulations that protect the privacy and security of personal information, which could disrupt our business, result in increased costs or loss of revenue, and/or result in significant legal and financial exposure. Also, unauthorized access to, or disclosure of theft of, our business information and/or other information we maintain could cause us to incur significant remediation costs, result in product development delays, disrupt or force suspension of key business operations and divert attention of management and key information technology resources. These events could also result in liability to others, if these incidents involve the data of others that we have agreed, or are otherwise legally responsible, to keep confidential and protect.\nBreaches of information technology systems and technology can be difficult to detect, and any delay in identifying any such incidents may lead to increased harm of the type described above. While we have implemented security measures to protect our information technology systems and infrastructure, and monitor such systems and infrastructure on an ongoing basis for any current or potential threats, there can be no assurance that these measures will prevent the type of incidents that could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Also, we rely on the security measures and monitoring activities of our business partners and vendors who collect, store, process and transmit data on their networks and systems. In the event they experience a service issue or security incident: we may not receive timely notice from them of the issue or incident; they may not take adequate steps to remediate the issue or incident and protect against future occurrences; we may not have any remedy against them for losses and liabilities that we suffer, or if we have a remedy it may be inadequate, even though they are or may be at fault; and we may become subject to legal claims from others whose information has been compromised regardless of whether we are at fault.", "PERMNO": 91086, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "ACOR"}
