{"cik": "39911", "company": "GAP INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nOur past performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance because actual future results and trends may differ materially depending on a variety of factors, including but not limited to the risks and uncertainties discussed below and in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K and \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\u201d in Part II, Item 7A of this Form 10-K. In addition, historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. The occurrence of any of the following risks or additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. In such case, the market price of our common stock could decline.\nRisks Related to Macroeconomic Conditions\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has and could continue to adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy, disrupted consumer spending and global supply chains, and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets. The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected our business and results of operations and this adverse effect could continue.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and in response to government mandates or recommendations, as well as decisions we made to protect the health and safety of our employees, consumers and communities, in fiscal 2020, we temporarily closed a significant number of our stores globally and furloughed the majority of our store teams. While we began to safely reopen our temporarily closed stores in May 2020 and have since reopened most of our stores, we and our franchisees may face new store closure requirements and other operational restrictions with respect to some or all of our physical locations for prolonged periods if the pandemic is not fully contained.\nFurther, consumer fears about becoming ill with COVID-19 may continue, which has and could continue to adversely affect traffic to our and our franchisees\u2019 stores. Consumer spending generally has and may continue to be negatively impacted by general macroeconomic conditions and consumer confidence, including the impacts of any recession or inflationary pressures resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. This may negatively impact sales at our stores and on our e-commerce platform, and through our franchise agreements. Furthermore, if sales do not meet expectations because of unexpected effects on consumer demand caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the resulting surplus inventory may cause excessive markdowns and, therefore, lower than planned gross margins. Any significant reduction in consumer visits to, or spending at, our and our franchisees\u2019 stores caused by the pandemic, and any decreased spending at stores or online caused by decreased consumer confidence and spending resulting from the pandemic, would adversely affect our sales and results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic also has significantly impacted our supply chain and may continue to do so if the factories that manufacture our products, the distribution centers where we manage our inventory, or the operations of our logistics and other service providers are disrupted, temporarily closed or experience worker shortages. Vessel, container and other transportation shortages, factory closures, labor shortages and port congestion globally have delayed and are expected to continue to delay inventory orders and, in turn, deliveries to our and our franchisees' stores and distribution centers. These supply chain and logistics disruptions have impacted our inventory levels and net sales, particularly in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2021, and could impact our sales in future periods. These disruptions could also result in our receiving inventory after the intended selling season and therefore require us to take significant impairment charges on delayed inventory when it is finally received. We have also incurred in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2021 higher freight and other distribution costs, including air freight, to mitigate these delays, and we expect to continue incurring higher freight and distribution costs in fiscal 2022. Furthermore, in the event we experience negative impacts to pricing of certain components of our products resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, there can be no assurance that consumers will accept such increases, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nAs a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, including related governmental guidance or requirements, in 2020 we also closed many of our corporate offices and other facilities, including our corporate headquarters in San Francisco. Although we reopened our corporate offices and other facilities beginning in June 2020 and have implemented remote work or hybrid work policies for certain employees, we may face future closure requirements and other operational restrictions if the pandemic is not fully contained. These policies may also negatively impact productivity and cause other disruptions to our business.\nWe continue to monitor the latest developments regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and have made certain assumptions regarding the pandemic for purposes of our operating and financial projections. However, we are unable to accurately predict the full extent of the COVID-19 pandemic\u2019s impact on our business and results of operations due to the uncertainty of future developments, including the duration and severity of the pandemic, the success of vaccination efforts, any resurgences of the virus or variants of the virus and the economic impacts of the pandemic, including recent inflationary pressures. Even in regions where we have experienced business recovery, the failure to fully contain the pandemic could result in those markets not recovering as quickly or at all, which could adversely affect our results of operations. The pandemic may also affect our business and results of operations in manners that are not presently known to us or that we do not presently consider to pose significant risks.\nGlobal economic conditions and any related impact on consumer spending patterns could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur business is affected by global economic conditions and the related impact on levels of consumer spending worldwide. Some of the factors that may influence consumer spending patterns include high levels of unemployment, pandemics (such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic), extreme weather conditions and natural disasters, higher consumer debt levels, inflationary pressures (such as current inflation related to global supply chain disruptions), global geopolitical instability (such as the current conflict between Russia and Ukraine and related economic and other retaliatory measures taken by the United States, European Union and others), reductions in net worth based on market declines and uncertainty, home foreclosures and reductions in home values, fluctuating interest and foreign currency rates and credit availability, government austerity measures, fluctuating fuel and other energy costs, fluctuating commodity prices, and general uncertainty regarding the overall future economic environment. Consumer purchases of discretionary items, including our merchandise, generally decline during periods when disposable income is adversely affected or when there are inflationary pressures or economic uncertainty.\nThe uncertain state of the global economy continues to impact businesses around the world. Deteriorating economic conditions or geopolitical instability in any of the regions in which we and our franchisees sell our products could reduce consumer confidence and adversely impact consumer spending patterns, and thereby could adversely affect our sales and results of operations. In challenging and uncertain economic environments such as the current one, we cannot predict whether or when such circumstances may improve or worsen, or what impact, if any, such circumstances could have on our business, financial condition and results of operations, or on the price of our common stock.\nRecent inflationary pressures have increased the cost of energy and raw materials and may adversely affect our results of operations. If inflation continues to rise and further impact the cost of energy and raw materials, we may not be able to offset cost increases to our products through price adjustments without negatively impacting consumer demand, which could adversely affect our sales and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Brand Relevance and Brand Execution\nWe must successfully gauge apparel trends and changing consumer preferences to succeed.\nOur success is largely dependent upon our ability to gauge the tastes of our customers and to provide merchandise that satisfies customer demand in a timely manner. However, lead times for many of our design and purchasing decisions may make it more difficult for us to respond rapidly to new or changing apparel trends or consumer acceptance of our products, and supply chain disruptions may lead to prolonged delays in receiving inventory. The global apparel retail business fluctuates according to changes in consumer preferences, dictated in part by apparel trends and season. To the extent we misjudge the market for our merchandise or the products suitable for local markets, or fail to execute trends and deliver products to the market as timely as our competitors, our sales will be adversely affected, and the markdowns required to move the resulting excess inventory will adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe must maintain our reputation and brand image.\nOur brands have wide recognition, and our success has been due in large part to our ability to maintain, enhance and protect our brand image and reputation and our customers\u2019 connection to our brands. Our continued success depends in part on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment, including our increasing reliance on social media and online dissemination of advertising campaigns. Even if we react appropriately to negative posts or comments about us and/or our brands on social media and online, our customers\u2019 perception of our brand image and our reputation could be negatively impacted. Customer sentiment could also be shaped by our partnerships with artists, athletes and other public figures. Failure to maintain, enhance and protect our brand image could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur brand image and reputation may also depend on our environmental, social and governance (\"ESG\") policies, priorities and commitments and related design, sourcing and operations decisions. These risks may include any increased public focus, including by governmental and nongovernmental organizations, on these matters. These risks may also include increased pressure to expand our disclosures in these areas, make commitments, set targets or establish additional goals and take actions to meet them, which could expose us to market, operational and execution costs or risks. Our failure to achieve progress on our stated commitments, targets or goals on a timely basis, or at all, could adversely affect our brand image and reputation.\nRisks Related to Competition\nOur business is highly competitive.\nThe global apparel retail industry is highly competitive. We and our franchisees compete with local, national, and global department stores, specialty and discount store chains, independent retail stores, and online businesses that market similar lines of merchandise. We face a variety of competitive challenges in an increasingly complex and fast-paced environment, including:\n\u2022anticipating and quickly responding to changing apparel trends and customer demands;\n\u2022attracting customer traffic both in stores and online;\n\u2022competitively pricing our products and achieving customer perception of value;\n\u2022maintaining favorable brand recognition and effectively marketing our products to customers in several diverse market segments and geographic locations;\n\u2022anticipating and responding to changing customer shopping preferences and practices, including the increasing shift to digital brand engagement, social media communication, and online shopping;\n\u2022developing innovative, high-quality products in sizes, colors, and styles that appeal to customers of varying demographics and tastes;\n\u2022purchasing and stocking merchandise to match seasonal weather patterns, and our ability to react to shifts in weather that impact consumer demand;\n\u2022sourcing and allocating merchandise efficiently; and\n\u2022improving the effectiveness and efficiency of our processes in order to deliver cost savings to fund growth.\nIf we or our franchisees are not able to respond effectively to competitive pressures, changes in retail markets or customer expectations in the United States or internationally, our results of operations would be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Strategic Transactions and Investments\nWe may engage in or seek to engage in strategic transactions, such as acquisitions, divestitures and other dispositions, that are subject to various risks and uncertainties, which could disrupt or adversely affect our business.\nWe may engage in or seek to engage in strategic transactions, such as acquisitions, divestitures or other dispositions, which we may not be able to complete on anticipated terms or time frames or at all, or which may not generate some or all of the strategic, financial, operational or other benefits we expect to realize from such transactions on such anticipated time frames or at all. In addition, these transactions may be complex in nature, and unanticipated developments or changes, including changes in law, the macroeconomic environment, market conditions, the retail industry or political conditions may affect our ability to complete such transactions. In addition, the process of completing these transactions may be time-consuming and involve significant costs and expenses, which may be significantly higher than what we anticipate and may not yield a benefit if the transactions are not completed successfully, and executing these transactions may require significant time and attention from our senior management and employees, which could disrupt our ongoing business and adversely affect our results of operations. We may also experience increased difficulties in attracting, retaining and motivating employees and/or attracting and retaining customers during the pendency or following the completion of any of these transactions, which could harm our business.\nIn particular, in 2021 we divested our Janie and Jack and Intermix brands and reached agreements to transfer our European business to a franchise model. We also acquired two technology companies in 2021. We incurred costs and expenses in connection with these transactions and may incur such costs and expenses in connection with future strategic reviews, which will require significant attention from our senior management and employees. Executing any transactions resulting from future strategic reviews will be time-consuming, will involve additional costs and expenses, which may be significant, and may result in difficulties attracting, retaining and motivating employees, which could harm our business and adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur investments in customer, digital, and omni-channel shopping initiatives may not deliver the results we anticipate.\nOne of our strategic priorities is to further develop an omni-channel shopping experience for our customers through the integration of our store and digital shopping channels. Our omni-channel initiatives include cross-channel logistics optimization and exploring additional ways to develop an omni-channel shopping experience, including further digital integration and customer personalization. These initiatives involve significant investments in information technology (\"IT\") systems, data science and artificial intelligence initiatives, and significant operational changes. Our competitors are also investing in omni-channel initiatives, some of which may be more successful than our initiatives. If the implementation of our customer, digital, and omni-channel initiatives is not successful, or we do not realize the return on our investments in these initiatives that we anticipate, our results of operations would be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Human Capital, Inventory and Supply Chain Management\nOur failure to manage key executive succession and retention and to continue to attract qualified personnel could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur business and future success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain key personnel in our design, merchandising, sourcing, marketing, and other functions. In addition, executing our strategic initiatives, including our technology and supply chain initiatives, has required and may require in the future that we hire and/or develop employees with appropriate and specialized experience. We must also attract, develop, and retain a sufficient number of qualified field and distribution center personnel. Competition for talent is intense and the turnover rate in the retail industry is generally high. Furthermore, we have experienced a shortage of labor for field and distribution center positions, including due to concerns around COVID-19 and other factors, and we cannot be sure that we will be able to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel for these and other positions in future periods. Our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling costs is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels, prevailing wage rates and competitive wage pressures, minimum wage legislation, and overtime and paid leave regulations. Additionally, changes to our office environments, the adoption of new work models, and our requirements and/or expectations about when or how often certain employees work on-site or remotely may not meet the expectations of our employees. As businesses increasingly operate remotely, traditional geographic competition for talent may change in ways that we cannot presently predict. If our employment proposition is not perceived as favorable compared to other companies, it could negatively impact our ability to attract and retain our employees.\nIf we are unable to retain, attract, and motivate talented employees with the appropriate skill sets, or if changes to our organizational structure or business model adversely affect morale or retention, we may not achieve our objectives and our results of operations could be adversely impacted. In addition, the loss of one or more of our key personnel or the inability to effectively identify a suitable successor to a key role could adversely affect our business. In 2019 and 2020, we made significant changes to our executive leadership team. The effectiveness of our leaders, and any further transition, could adversely affect our results of operations.\nIf we are unable to manage our inventory effectively, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nFluctuations in the global apparel retail markets impact the levels of inventory owned by apparel retailers. The nature of the global apparel retail business requires us to carry a significant amount of inventory, especially prior to the peak holiday selling season when we build up our inventory levels. Merchandise usually must be ordered well in advance of the season and frequently before apparel trends are confirmed by customer purchases. We must enter into contracts for the purchase and manufacture of merchandise well in advance of the applicable selling season, and supply chain delays may increase lead times. As a result, we are vulnerable to demand and pricing shifts and to suboptimal selection and timing of merchandise purchases. In the past, we have not always predicted our customers\u2019 preferences and acceptance levels of our trend items with accuracy. If sales do not meet expectations, including due to the impact of current economic conditions (including due to inflationary pressures, political instability or the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic) on consumer demand, too much inventory may cause excessive markdowns and, therefore, lower-than-planned gross margins. Conversely, if we underestimate or are unable to satisfy consumer demand for our products, including due to increasing consumer demand in areas where the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic decrease or supply chain disruptions that result in delayed inventory, we may experience inventory shortages, which could result in lower than anticipated sales, delayed shipments to customers and negative impacts on consumer relationships and brand loyalty, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe have key strategic initiatives designed to optimize our inventory levels and increase the efficiency and responsiveness of our supply chain, including vendor fabric platforming, product demand testing, and in-season rapid response to demand. We are also developing additional capabilities to analyze customer behavior and demand, which we believe will allow us to better localize assortment and improve store-level allocations, such as size allocation, to further tailor our assortments to customer needs and increase sell-through. Further, we are leveraging technology and data science to digitize product creation, integrate with our consolidated vendor base, and further optimize our product-to-market processes and supply chain which we anticipate will enhance our in-season responsiveness and reduce our exposure to fashion volatility. These initiatives and additional capabilities involve significant changes to our inventory management systems and processes. If we are unable to implement these initiatives and integrate these additional capabilities successfully, we may not realize the return on our investments that we anticipate, and our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur business is subject to risks associated with global sourcing and manufacturing.\nIndependent third parties manufacture all of our products for us. As a result, we are directly impacted by increases in the cost of those products.\nIf we experience significant increases in demand or need to replace an existing vendor, including due to factory closures and labor shortages in the countries where our vendors are located, there can be no assurance that additional manufacturing capacity will be available when required on terms that are acceptable to us or that any vendor would allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements. In addition, for any new manufacturing source, we may encounter delays in production and added costs as a result of the time it takes to train our vendors in our methods, products, quality control standards, and environmental, labor, health, and safety standards. Moreover, in the event of a significant disruption in the supply of the fabrics or raw materials used by our vendors in the manufacture of our products, our vendors might not be able to locate alternative suppliers of materials of comparable quality at an acceptable price. Any delays, interruption, or increased costs in the manufacture of our products could result in lower than anticipated sales. In addition, certain countries represent a larger portion of our global sourcing. For example, in fiscal 2021, approximately 33 percent and 16 percent of our merchandise, by dollar value, was purchased from factories in Vietnam and Indonesia, respectively. Delays in production and added costs in Vietnam or Indonesia have and could continue to adversely affect our results of operations.\nBecause independent vendors manufacture virtually all of our products outside of our principal sales markets, third parties must transport our products over large geographic distances. Increases in transportation costs and/or delays in the shipment or delivery of our products due to the availability of transportation, work stoppages, port strikes, port and infrastructure congestion, public health emergencies, social unrest, changes in local economic conditions, political upheavals, or other factors, and costs and delays associated with transitioning between vendors, could adversely affect our results of operations. Operating or manufacturing delays, transportation delays, or unexpected demand for our products may require us to use faster, but more expensive, transportation methods such as air freight, which could adversely affect our gross margins. In addition, the cost of fuel is a significant component of transportation costs, so increases in the price of petroleum products (including due to inflationary pressures, political instability, and/or regulation of energy inputs and greenhouse gas emissions) can adversely affect our gross margins.\nIf our vendors, or any raw material suppliers on which our vendors rely, suffer prolonged manufacturing or transportation disruptions due to public health conditions, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, or other unforeseen events, our ability to source product could be adversely impacted which would adversely affect our results of operations.\nRisks associated with importing merchandise from foreign countries, including failure of our vendors to adhere to our Code of Vendor Conduct, could harm our business.\nWe purchase merchandise from third-party vendors in many different countries, and we require those vendors to adhere to a Code of Vendor Conduct, which includes anti-corruption, environmental, labor, health, and safety standards. From time to time, our vendors and their suppliers may not be in compliance with these standards or applicable local laws. Although we have implemented policies and procedures to facilitate our compliance with laws and regulations relating to doing business in foreign markets and importing merchandise from and into various countries, there can be no assurance that our vendors and their suppliers and other third parties with whom we do business will not violate such laws and regulations or our policies. Significant or continuing noncompliance with such standards and laws by one or more vendors, suppliers or other third parties could subject us to liability, and could adversely affect our reputation, business and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Data Privacy and Cybersecurity\nWe are subject to data and security risks, which could adversely affect our results of operations and consumer confidence in our security measures.\nAs part of our normal operations, we receive and maintain confidential, proprietary, and personally identifiable information, including credit card information, and information about our customers, our employees, job applicants, and other third parties. Our business employs systems and websites that allow for the secure storage and transmission of this information. However, despite our safeguards and security processes and protections, security breaches and vulnerabilities could expose us to a risk of loss or misuse of this information, litigation, and potential liability. The retail industry, in particular, has been the target of many recent cyber-attacks. We may not have the resources to anticipate or prevent rapidly evolving types of cyber-attacks, such as phishing and ransomware attacks, which have emerged as particularly prominent. While we train our employees to identify these and other security threats as part of our security efforts, this training cannot be completely effective. Attacks may be targeted at us, our vendors or customers, or others who have entrusted us with personal or confidential information. In addition, even if we take appropriate measures to safeguard our information security and privacy environment from security breaches and vulnerabilities, we could still expose our customers and our business to risk. Actual or anticipated attacks may disrupt or impair our technology capabilities, and may cause us to incur increasing costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees, and engage third-party experts and consultants. Advances in computer capabilities, new technological discoveries, or other developments may result in the technology used by us to protect transaction or other data being breached or compromised. Measures we implement to protect against cyberattacks and address vulnerabilities may also have the potential to impact our customers\u2019 shopping experience or decrease activity on our websites by making them more difficult to use. Data and security breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues, including intentional or inadvertent breaches by our employees or by persons with whom we have commercial relationships that result in the unauthorized release of personal or confidential information. In addition, the global regulatory environment surrounding information security, cybersecurity, and data privacy is increasingly demanding, and we are required to comply with new and constantly evolving laws, such as the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the California Consumer Privacy Act, the California Privacy Rights Act and the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act, each of which gives customers the right to control how their personal information is collected, used and retained. Our failure to comply with these and other data privacy laws or to secure personal or confidential information could result in significant legal and financial exposure, and a loss of consumer confidence in our security measures, which could adversely affect our results of operations and our reputation.\nFailures of, or updates or changes to, our IT systems may disrupt operations.\nWe maintain a complex technology platform consisting of both legacy and modern systems, and we also increasingly rely on third party providers for public cloud infrastructure that powers our e-commerce platform and other systems. Our owned and operated systems require continual maintenance, upgrades and changes, some of which are significant. Upgrades may involve replacing existing systems with successor systems, making changes to existing systems, or cost-effectively acquiring new systems with new functionality. We are aware of the inherent risks associated with maintaining and replacing these systems, including accurately capturing data and addressing system disruptions, and believe we are taking appropriate steps to mitigate these risks through testing, training, and staging implementation, as well as ensuring appropriate commercial contracts are in place with third party vendors supplying or supporting our IT initiatives. However, there can be no assurance that we will successfully maintain or launch these systems as planned or that they will be implemented without disruptions to our operations. IT system disruptions or failures, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated, or failure to successfully implement new or upgraded systems, could disrupt our operations and therefore adversely affect our results of operations. While the uptime, performance, and security of our third party public cloud infrastructure providers are generally equal to or better than our own systems, as we continue to move to their platforms, our reliance on third parties means that any downtime or security issues they experience poses a greater risk of a single point of failure. Any failure by our third party providers could disrupt our operations and therefore adversely affect our results of operations.\nRisks Related to Operating a Global Business\nOur efforts to expand internationally may not be successful.\nOur current business strategies include pursuing selective international expansion in a number of countries around the world through a number of channels. This includes our franchisees opening additional stores internationally. We have limited experience operating or franchising in some of these locations. In many of these locations, we face major established competitors. In addition, in many of these locations, the real estate, employment and labor, transportation and logistics, regulatory, and other operating requirements differ dramatically from those in the places where we have more experience. Consumer tastes and trends may differ in many of these locations and, as a result, the sales of our products may not be successful or result in the margins we anticipate. If our international expansion plans are unsuccessful or do not deliver an appropriate return on our investments, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur franchise and licensing businesses are subject to certain risks not directly within our control that could impair the value of our brands.\nWe have entered into franchise agreements with unaffiliated franchisees to operate stores and websites in many countries around the world. Under these agreements, third parties operate, or will operate, stores and websites that sell apparel and related products under our brand names. We have also entered into licensing agreements with unaffiliated licensees to sell products using our brand names. The effect of these arrangements on our business and results of operations is uncertain and will depend upon various factors, including the demand for our products in international markets, the demand for new product categories (such as our Gap Home collection at Walmart) and our ability to successfully identify appropriate third parties to act as franchisees, licensees, distributors, or in a similar capacity. In addition, certain aspects of these arrangements are not directly within our control, such as franchisee and licensee financial stability and the ability of these third parties to meet their projections regarding store locations, store openings, and sales. Other risks that may affect these third parties include general economic conditions in specific countries or markets, foreign exchange rates, changes in diplomatic and trade relationships, restrictions on the transfer of funds, and political instability. Moreover, while the franchise and licensing agreements we have entered into and plan to enter into in the future provide us with certain termination rights, the value of our brands could be impaired to the extent that these third parties do not operate their stores or websites or sell our branded products in a manner consistent with our requirements regarding our brand identities and customer experience standards. Failure to protect the value of our brands, or any other harmful acts or omissions by a franchisee or licensee, could adversely affect our results of operations and our reputation.\nTrade matters may disrupt our supply chain.\nTrade restrictions, including more stringent tariffs or quotas, embargoes, safeguards, and customs restrictions against apparel items, as well as U.S. or foreign labor strikes, work stoppages, or boycotts, could increase the cost or reduce the supply of apparel available to us and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot predict whether any of the countries in which our merchandise currently is manufactured or may be manufactured in the future will be subject to additional trade restrictions imposed by the United States or other countries, including the likelihood, type, or effect of any such restrictions. For example, the current political landscape, including with respect to U.S.-China relations, and recent tariffs and bans imposed by the United States and other countries (such as the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act) has introduced greater uncertainty with respect to future tax and trade regulations. In addition, we face the possibility of anti-dumping or countervailing duties lawsuits from U.S. domestic producers. We are unable to determine the impact of the changes to the quota system or the impact that potential tariff lawsuits could have on our global sourcing operations. Our sourcing operations may be adversely affected by trade limits or political and financial instability, resulting in the disruption of trade from exporting countries, significant fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar against foreign currencies, restrictions on the transfer of funds, or other trade disruptions. Changes in tax policy or trade regulations, such as the imposition of new tariffs on imported products, could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur business is exposed to the risks of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and our hedging strategies may not be effective in mitigating those risks.\nWe are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk with respect to our sales, operating expenses, profits, assets, and liabilities generated or incurred in foreign currencies as well as inventory purchases in U.S. dollars for our foreign subsidiaries. Although we use financial instruments to hedge certain foreign currency risks, these measures may not succeed in fully offsetting the negative impact of foreign currency rate movements and generally only delay the impact of adverse foreign currency rate movements on our business and results of operations.\nWe experience fluctuations in our comparable sales and margins, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock, our credit ratings and our liquidity.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to grow sales and improve margins. A variety of factors affect comparable sales and/or margins, including but not limited to apparel trends, competition, current economic conditions (including due to inflationary pressures, political instability or the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic), the timing of new merchandise releases and promotional events, changes in our merchandise mix, the success of our marketing programs (including our loyalty program), supply chain disruptions and transitory costs, foreign currency fluctuations, industry traffic trends, and weather conditions. These factors may cause our comparable sales results and margins to differ materially from prior periods and from financial market expectations. Our comparable sales, including the associated comparable online sales, have fluctuated significantly in the past on an annual and quarterly basis. In fiscal 2021, our reported quarterly comparable sales have ranged from a high of 28 percent in the first quarter of fiscal 2021 to a low of negative 1 percent in the third quarter of fiscal 2021. Over the past five fiscal years, our reported gross margins have ranged from a high of 39.8 percent in fiscal 2021 to a low of 34.1 percent in fiscal 2020. In addition, over the past five fiscal years, our reported operating margins have ranged from a high of 9.3 percent in fiscal 2017 to a low of negative 6.2 percent in fiscal 2020.\nOur ability to deliver strong comparable sales results and margins depends in large part on accurately forecasting demand and apparel trends, selecting effective marketing techniques, providing an appropriate mix of merchandise for our broad and diverse customer base, managing inventory effectively, using effective pricing strategies, and optimizing store performance. Fluctuations in our comparable sales and margins or failure to meet financial market expectations in one or more future periods could reduce the market price of our common stock, cause our credit ratings to decline, and negatively impact our liquidity.\nOur business and results of operations could be adversely affected by natural disasters, public health crises, political crises, negative global climate patterns, or other catastrophic events.\nNatural disasters, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, earthquakes, wildfires, and other extreme weather conditions; unforeseen public health crises, such as pandemics and epidemics (including, for example, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic); political crises, such as terrorist attacks, war, labor unrest, and other political instability; negative global climate patterns, especially in water stressed regions; or other catastrophic events or disasters occurring in or impacting the areas in which our stores, distribution centers, corporate offices or our vendors\u2019 manufacturing facilities are located, whether occurring in the United States or internationally, could disrupt our, our franchisees' and our vendors' operations. Additionally, climate change may increase both the frequency and severity of extreme weather conditions and natural disasters, and the physical changes prompted by climate change could result in increased regulation or changes in consumer preferences. While we consider these types of catastrophic events as part of our disaster recovery and business continuity planning, our planning may not be sufficient in all instances.\nIn particular, these types of events could impact our supply chain from or to the impacted region and could impact our ability or the ability of our franchisees or other third parties to operate our stores or websites. These types of events could also negatively impact consumer spending in the impacted regions or, depending upon the severity, globally. Disasters occurring at our vendors\u2019 manufacturing facilities could impact our reputation and our customers\u2019 perception of our brands. To the extent any of these events occur, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nIn February 2022, in response to the military conflict between Russia and Ukraine, the United States and other North Atlantic Treaty Organization member states, as well as non-member states, announced targeted economic sanctions on Russia, including certain Russian citizens and enterprises, and the continuation of the conflict may trigger additional economic and other sanctions. The potential impact of the conflict and any resulting bans, sanctions and boycotts on our business is uncertain at the current time due to the fluid nature of the conflict as it is unfolding. The potential impacts could include supply chain and logistics disruptions, macro financial impacts resulting from the exclusion of Russian financial institutions from the global banking system, volatility in foreign exchange rates and interest rates, inflationary pressures on raw materials and energy and heightened cybersecurity threats. We have a small franchise and distribution business in Russia and Ukraine. Although our operations in Russia and Ukraine are not significant, we do not and cannot know if the conflict, which is unfolding in real-time, could escalate and result in broader economic and security concerns which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe market for real estate is competitive.\nOur ability to effectively obtain real estate to open new stores, distribution centers, and corporate offices nationally and internationally depends on the availability of real estate that meets our criteria for traffic, square footage, co-tenancies, lease economics, demographics, and other factors. We also must be able to effectively renew our existing store leases. In addition, we may seek to downsize, consolidate, reposition, relocate, or close some of our real estate locations, which in most cases requires a modification of an existing store lease. Since the beginning of fiscal 2020, in connection with our Power Plan strategy, we have closed hundreds of Gap and Banana Republic stores in North America. Failure to secure adequate new locations, successfully modify or exit existing locations, or effectively manage the profitability of our existing fleet of stores, could adversely affect our results of operations.\nAdditionally, the economic environment may at times make it difficult to determine the fair market rent of real estate properties within the United States and internationally. This could impact the quality of our decisions to exercise lease options and renew expiring leases at negotiated rents. Any adverse effect on the quality of these decisions could impact our ability to retain real estate locations adequate to meet our targets or efficiently manage the profitability of our existing fleet of stores, and could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are subject to various proceedings, lawsuits, disputes, and claims from time to time, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs a multinational company, we are subject to various proceedings, lawsuits, disputes, and claims (\u201cActions\u201d) arising in the ordinary course of our business. Many of these Actions raise complex factual and legal issues and are subject to uncertainties. Actions filed against us from time to time include commercial, intellectual property, customer, employment, securities, and data privacy claims, including class action lawsuits. We are also currently party to Actions with certain landlords related to our decision to suspend rent payments earlier in the COVID-19 pandemic as a result of government and public health authority orders, mandates, guidelines and recommendations. The plaintiffs in some Actions seek unspecified damages or injunctive relief, or both. Actions are in various procedural stages and some may be covered in part by insurance. We cannot predict with assurance the outcome of Actions brought against us. Additionally, defending against Actions may involve significant expense and diversion of management's attention and resources. Accordingly, developments, settlements, or resolutions may occur and impact income in the quarter of such development, settlement, or resolution. An unfavorable outcome could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Governmental and Regulatory Changes\nFailure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, and changes in the regulatory or administrative landscape, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLaws and regulations at the local, state, federal, and international levels frequently change, and the ultimate cost of compliance cannot be precisely estimated. In addition, we cannot predict with assurance the impact that may result from changes in the regulatory or administrative landscape. While our policies are designed to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, such laws and regulations are complex and often subject to differing interpretations, which can lead to unintentional or unknown instances of non-compliance.\nOur failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, and any changes in laws or regulations, the imposition of additional laws or regulations, or the enactment of any new or more stringent legislation that impacts employment and labor, anti-corruption, trade, product safety, transportation and logistics, health care, tax, cybersecurity, privacy, operations, or environmental issues, among others, could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Credit Card Arrangement\nReductions in income and cash flow from our credit card arrangement related to our private label and co-branded credit cards could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nA third party, Synchrony Financial (\u201cSynchrony\u201d), currently owns and services our portfolios of private label credit card and co-branded programs for our Gap, Old Navy, Banana Republic and Athleta brands and another third party, Barclays PLC (\"Barclays\"), is expected to acquire those credit card portfolios during the second quarter of fiscal 2022. Our agreement with Synchrony provides for certain payments to be made by Synchrony to us, including a share of revenues from the performance of the credit card portfolios. The income and cash flow that we receive from Synchrony is dependent upon a number of factors, including the level of sales on private label and co-branded accounts, the level of balances carried on the accounts, payment rates on the accounts, finance charge rates and other fees on the accounts, the level of credit losses for the accounts, Synchrony\u2019s ability to extend credit to our customers, as well as the cost of customer rewards programs. Our agreement with Barclays is expected to be largely similar to our current agreement with Synchrony. All of these factors can vary based on changes in federal and state credit card, banking, and commercial protection laws. The factors affecting the income and cash flow that we receive from our credit card arrangement can also vary based on a variety of economic, legal, social, and other factors (for example, the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic) that we cannot control. If the income and cash flow that we receive from our credit card arrangement decreases significantly, our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nRisks Relating to Our Indebtedness and Credit Profile\nOn May 7, 2020, we entered into a third amended and restated senior secured asset-based revolving credit agreement (the \"ABL Facility\") in an initial aggregate principal amount of $1.8675 billion. On September 27, 2021, we issued $750 million aggregate principal amount of 3.625 percent Senior Notes due 2029 (the \"2029 Senior Notes\") and $750 million aggregate principal amount of 3.875 percent Senior Notes due 2031 (the \"2031 Senior Notes\" and, with the 2029 Senior Notes, the \"Senior Notes\"). We used the proceeds from the offering of the Senior Notes and cash on hand to purchase or redeem all of our previously outstanding senior secured notes. As a result, we are subject to risks relating to our indebtedness, including the following risks.\nSee Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8, \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Form 10-K for disclosures on our debt and credit facilities.\nOur level of indebtedness may adversely affect our ability to operate and expand our business.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness. As of January 29, 2022, the aggregate principal amount of our total outstanding indebtedness was $1.5 billion, all of which consisted of indebtedness under the Senior Notes. As of January 29, 2022, we had $1.8675 billion in principal amount of undrawn commitments available for additional borrowings under the ABL Facility, subject to borrowing base availability. On February 9, 2022, we borrowed $350 million under the ABL Facility and had $1.5175 billion in principal amount of undrawn commitments available for additional borrowings, subject to borrowing base availability.\nOur high level of indebtedness could impact our business in the following ways:\n\u2022make it more difficult for us to satisfy our debt obligations, including with respect to the Senior Notes;\n\u2022increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and external conditions, including the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and inflationary pressures;\n\u2022impair our ability to obtain additional debt or equity financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or general corporate or other purposes;\n\u2022require us to dedicate a material portion of our cash flows from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flows to fund working capital needs, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022expose us to the risk of increased interest rates for borrowings under the ABL Facility, which bear interest at a variable rate;\n\u2022limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022place us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness; and\n\u2022limit our ability to adjust to changing market conditions.\nAny of these risks could impact our ability to operate and expand our business, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, we may in the future incur additional indebtedness, which could intensify these risks and make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our indebtedness and fund our working capital and capital expenditures, and may be forced to take other actions to satisfy our obligations under our indebtedness, which may not be successful.\nWe are required to dedicate a substantial portion of any cash flows from operations to the payment of interest and principal under our indebtedness. We generated net cash from operating activities of $809 million in fiscal 2021 and ended fiscal 2021 with $877 million of cash and cash equivalents on our balance sheet.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments on our indebtedness depends upon our future operating performance and on our ability to generate cash flows in the future, which is subject to general economic, financial, business, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control, including the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We cannot assure you that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us in an amount sufficient to enable us to fund our debt service obligations and other liquidity needs.\nIf our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems and could be forced to reduce or delay investment and capital expenditures or to dispose of material assets or operations, seek additional debt or equity financing or restructure or refinance our indebtedness. We may not be able to effect any such alternative measures (including due to restrictions in our indebtedness agreements), if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms or at all and, even if successful, such alternative actions may not allow us to meet our scheduled debt service obligations.\nIf we cannot make scheduled payments on our indebtedness, we will be in default and, as a result, our lenders could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable, could terminate their commitments to loan money to us and could foreclose against any assets securing our indebtedness, and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nCovenants in the ABL Facility may restrict our business and could limit our ability to implement our business plan.\nThe ABL Facility includes covenants restricting, among other things, our ability to do the following under certain circumstances:\n\u2022grant or incur liens;\n\u2022sell or otherwise dispose of assets, including capital stock of subsidiaries;\n\u2022make investments in certain subsidiaries;\n\u2022pay dividends, make distributions or redeem or repurchase capital stock; and\n\u2022consolidate or merge with or into, or sell substantially all of our assets to another entity.\nCompliance with these and the other covenants in the ABL Facility may restrict our ability to implement our business plan, finance future operations, respond to changing business and economic conditions, secure additional financing, and engage in opportunistic transactions, such as strategic acquisitions. We cannot assure you that we will be able to comply with our financial or other covenants under the ABL Facility or that any covenant violations would be waived in the future. Any violation that is not waived could result in an event of default and, as a result, our lenders under the ABL Facility could declare all outstanding principal and interest to be due and payable, could suspend commitments to make any advances or could require any outstanding letters of credit to be collateralized by an interest bearing cash account, any or all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in our credit profile or deterioration in market conditions may limit our access to the capital markets and adversely impact our business and financial condition.\nWe currently have corporate credit ratings of BB with a positive outlook from Standard & Poor's and Ba2 with a positive outlook from Moody\u2019s. Any reduction in our credit ratings could result in reduced access to the credit and capital markets, more restrictive covenants in future financing documents and higher interest costs, and potentially increased lease or hedging costs. In addition, market conditions such as increased volatility or disruption in the credit markets, including the recent volatility due, in part, to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, could adversely affect our ability to obtain financing or refinance existing debt on terms that would be acceptable to us.", "PERMNO": 59010, "SIC": 5651, "TIC": "GPS"}
