{"cik": "1120914", "company": "PDF SOLUTIONS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-01", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks Associated with Our Business\nWe invest significant resources into research and development to pursue new product and technology initiatives, including our DFI system and Exensio platform, and if we invest more resources than anticipated or fail to successfully carry out these initiatives on the expected timeline or at all, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nAs part of the evolution of our business, we have made substantial investments in research and development efforts to develop new products, including our DFI system and Exensio cloud-based platform, as well continued investment to enhance existing products. New competitors, technological advances in the semiconductor industry or by competitors, our entry into new markets, or other competitive factors may require us to invest significantly greater resources than we anticipate. If we are required to invest significantly greater resources than anticipated without a corresponding increase in revenue, our operating results could decline. The technologies or products that we invest in may later not be sought after by semiconductor companies. In this event, we would not recoup our investment and our results would suffer. If we are unable to anticipate technological changes in our industry by introducing new or enhanced products in a timely and cost-effective manner, or if we fail to introduce products that meet market demand, we may lose our competitive position, our products may become obsolete, and our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected. Additionally, our periodic research and development expenses may be independent of our level of revenue, which could negatively impact our financial results.\nOur sales cycle is lengthy and customers may delay entering into contracts or decide not to adopt our products or solutions after we have performed services or supported evaluation by them of our technology, which could result in delays in recognizing revenue and negatively impact our results of operations in a quarter or result in lower revenue than we expected if a contract is not consummated at all.\nOn-going negotiations and evaluation projects for new products, with new customers or in new markets may not result in significant revenues for us if we are unable to close new engagements on terms favorable to us, in a timely manner, or at all. Unexpected delays in our sales cycle could cause our revenues to fall short of expectations. Further, the timing and length of negotiations required to enter into agreements with our customers and the ultimate enforcement of complex negotiated contractual provisions as we intended is difficult to predict. If we do not successfully negotiate certain key complex contractual provisions, there are disputes regarding such provisions, or they are not enforceable as we intended, our revenues and results of operations would suffer. Further, our customers sometimes delay starting negotiations until they begin developing a new process, need to insert a new product, or experience specific yield issues. This means that on occasion we have, and may continue to provide technology and services under preliminary documentation before executing the final contract. In these cases, we would not recognize revenue and may defer associated costs until execution of the final contract, which, if significant, could negatively impact our results of operations in the periods before we execute the final contract. Further, if we were to incur significant effort and then fail to enter into a final contract, we would have to write-off such deferred costs in the period in which the negotiations ended, which would increase our costs and expenses and could result in significant operating losses.\nOur fixed-fee services or product or system installation/configurations may take longer than budgeted, which could slow our revenue recognition and may also result in a loss contract or a claim of breach by our customers, which would negatively affect our operating results.\nOur fixed-fee services, including in particular for characterization, require a team of engineers to collaborate with our customers to address complex issues by using our software and other technologies, and the installation and configuration of our software into our customers\u2019 fabrication and test/assembly facilities requires experienced engineers working with our customers on active foundry and test/assembly equipment. We must estimate the amount of resources needed to complete both of these types of services to estimate when the engineers will be able to commence the next engagement. In addition, our accounting for contracts with such services, which generate fixed fees, sometimes requires adjustments to profit (loss) based on revised estimates during the performance of the contract. These adjustments may have a material effect on our results of operations in the period in which they are made. The estimates giving rise to these risks, which are\ninherent in fixed-price contracts, include the forecasting of costs and schedules, and contract revenues related to contract performance. If we significantly fail to meet a customer\u2019s expectations in either case, the customer could claim that we breached our obligations, which could result in lost revenue and increased expenses.\nOur ability to sell our products, systems, and solutions depends in part on the quality of our support and services offerings, and the failure to offer high-quality support and services could negatively affect our sales and results of operations.\nOnce our products are integrated within our customers\u2019 hardware and software systems, our customers may depend on our support organization to resolve any issues relating to our products. Further, in connection with delivering our SaaS, which requires us to maintain adequate server hardware and internet infrastructure, including system redundancies, we are required to meet contractual uptime obligations. A high level of system and support is critical for the successful marketing and sale of our products. If we do not effectively provide subscription access to our SaaS customers, assist our customers in deploying our products, succeed in helping our customers quickly resolve post-deployment issues, and provide effective ongoing support and data security, we may face contractual penalties or customers may not renew subscriptions or services in the future, which would negatively impact our results of operations. In addition, due to our international operations, our system and support organization faces challenges associated with delivering support, hours that support is available, training, and documentation where the user\u2019s native language may not be English. If we fail to maintain high-quality support and services and adequately address our customers\u2019 support needs, our customers may choose our competitors\u2019 products instead of ours in the future, which would negatively affect our revenues and results of operations.\nDefects in our proprietary technologies, hardware and software tools, and failure to effectively remedy any such defects could decrease our revenue and our competitive market share.\nIf the software, hardware, or proprietary technologies we provide to customers contain defects that negatively impact customers\u2019 ability to use our systems or software, increase our customers\u2019 cost of goods sold and time-to-market, or damage our customers\u2019 property, these defects could significantly decrease the market acceptance of our products and services or results in warranty or other claims. We must adequately train our new personnel, especially our customer service and technical support personnel, to effectively and accurately, respond to and support our customers. If we fail to do this, it could lead to dissatisfaction among our customers, which could slow our growth. Further, the cost of support resources required to remedy any defects in our technologies, hardware, or software tools could exceed our expectations. Any actual or perceived defects with our software, hardware, or proprietary technologies may also hinder our ability to attract or retain industry partners or customers, leading to a decrease in our revenue. These defects are frequently found during the period following introduction of new software, hardware, or proprietary technologies or enhancements to existing software, hardware, or proprietary technologies, which means that we may not discover the errors or defects until after customer implementation of the silicon design and manufacturing process recommended by us. If our software, hardware, or proprietary technologies contain errors or defects, it could require us to expend significant resources to remedy these problems or defend/indemnify claims, which could reduce margins and result in the diversion of technical and other resources from our other customer implementations and development efforts.\nInadvertent disclosure of our customers\u2019 confidential information or our failure to comply with our customers\u2019 security rules, including for cloud-based solutions or on-site access could result in costly litigation, cause us to lose existing and potential customers, or negatively impact on-going business with existing customers.\nOur customers consider their product yield information and other confidential information, which we must collect in the course of our engagement with the customer or through our software tools, to be extremely competitively sensitive or subject to strict protection frameworks, including data and personal data about our customers\u2019 employees necessary to administer the licenses. Many of our customers have strict security rules for on-site access to, or hosting, to their confidential information. If we suffered an unauthorized intrusion or we inadvertently disclosed or were required to disclose this information, or if we fail to adequately comply with customers\u2019 security protocols for accessing or hosting confidential information, we could lose existing and potential customers or be subject to costly penalties or litigation, or our on-going business could be negatively impacted and insurance to cover such situations may not fully cover our exposure. In addition, to avoid potential disclosure of confidential information to competitors, some of our customers may, in the future, ask us not to work with key products or processes, which could limit our revenue opportunities.\nWe generate a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of customers, and a large percentage of our revenues from two customers, so decreased business with, or the loss of, any one of these customers, or pricing pressure, or customer consolidation could significantly reduce our revenues or margins and negatively impact results of operations.\nHistorically, we have had a small number of large customers for our IYR engagements and that contribute significant Gainshare royalties. In the year ended December 31, 2021, two customers accounted for 27% of our revenues. We have in the past and could in the future lose a customer due to its decision not to develop or produce its own future process node. Customers could also choose to not engage us on future process nodes, or reduce the scope of our services or technology under contract (which is permitted in one of our customer contracts if the customer\u2019s business materially adversely changes).We could also lose customers as a result of industry factors, including but not limited to reduced manufacturing volume or consolidation. Consolidation among our customers could also lead to increased customer bargaining power, or reduced customer spending on software and services. Further, new business may be delayed if a key customer uses its leverage to push for terms that are worse for us and we delay entering into the contract to negotiate for better terms, in which case revenue in any particular quarter or year may fail to meet expectations. Also, the loss of any of these customers or the failure to secure new contracts with these customers could further increase our reliance on our remaining customers. Further, if any of our key customers default, declare bankruptcy or otherwise delay or fail to pay amounts owed, or we otherwise have a dispute with any of these customers, our results of operations would be negatively affected in the short term and possibly the long term. For example, in 2021 and 2020, we incurred expenses in the amount of $2.0 million and $1.1 million, respectively, related to the arbitration with SMIC New Technology Research & Development (Shanghai) Corporation due to SMIC\u2019s failure to pay fees due to us under a series of contracts. If we are not able to resolve this matter amicably prior to trial, we will incur substantial additional expenses related to resolution of this matter through such an arbitration trial. These events could cause significant fluctuations in results of operations because our expenses are fixed in the short term and it takes us a long time to replace customers or reassign resources.\nIf we do not continuously meet our development milestones of key research and development projects or successfully commercialize our Design-for-Inspection system, our future market opportunity and revenues will suffer and our costs may not be recouped.\nWe have invested significantly in the design and development of our eProbe tool and related intellectual property. Key customers failing to purchase, renew, or expand the number or use of such systems on our expected timeline or at all will cause our results to miss expectations. Also, if the results of our DFI system, including new applications, are not as we expect, we may not be able to successfully commercialize this system or such applications on schedule, or at all, and we may miss the market opportunity and not recoup our investment. Further, our eProbe tool could cause unexpected damage to wafers or delay processing wafers, which we could be liable for, or which could make customers unwilling to use it. If we are not able to create significant interest and show reliable and useful results without significant damage to wafers, our investment may not be recouped and our future results may suffer.\nDecreases in wafer volumes at our customers\u2019 manufacturing sites or the volume of ICs that some of our customers are able to sell to their customers would cause our Integrated Yield Ramp revenue to suffer.\nOur Integrated Yield Ramp revenue includes amounts largely determined by wafer volumes at manufacturing sites covered by our contracts and, in some cases, the volume of an IC product that our customer is able to sell to its customers. Both of these factors are outside of our control. We have seen a significant reduction in our Integrated Yield Ramp revenue in recent years. Further, some of our manufacturing customers\u2019 business is largely dependent on customers that use our manufacturing customer as a second or third source. If those customers consolidate and/or otherwise move the orders to manufacturing facilities not covered by our contracts, or suspend their manufacturing at covered facilities for any reason, including consolidation, our Integrated Yield Ramp revenue will continue to decrease, which could cause us to fail to meet expectations. Further, reduced demand for semiconductor products or protectionist policies has from time to time decreased and may continue to decrease the volume of wafers and, in some cases, products our customers are able to make or sell, which would also decrease our Integrated Yield Ramp revenue. Also, our customers may unilaterally decide to implement changes to their manufacturing processes during the period that volume is covered by royalty contracts, which could negatively affect yield results and, thus, our Integrated Yield Ramp revenue.\nSince we currently work on a small number of large projects at specified manufacturing sites and, in some cases, on specific IC products, our results of operations have been and may continue to be adversely affected by negative changes at those sites or in those products, including slowdowns in manufacturing due to external factors, such as U.S. trade restrictions, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, or supply chain issues. Also, if wafer orders from sites covered by our contracts are not secured by our customers, if an end product does not achieve commercial viability, if a process line or, in some cases, a specific product, does not achieve significant increases in yield or sustain significant volume manufacturing during the time we receive royalties, revenues associated with such volumes or products would be negatively impacted. This could significantly reduce our Integrated Yield Ramp revenue and results of operations could fail to meet expectations. In addition, if we work with two directly competitive manufacturing facilities or products, volume in one may offset volume, and thus any of our related revenue, in the other facility or product.\nOur success depends upon our ability to effectively plan and manage our resources and restructure our business through rapidly fluctuating economic and market conditions, which actions may have an adverse effect on our financial and operating results.\nOur ability to successfully offer our products and services in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning, forecasting, and management process to enable us to effectively scale and adjust our business and business models in response to fluctuating market opportunities and conditions, which has and could continue to require us to increase headcount, acquire new companies or engage in restructurings from time to time. For example, while we have increased investment in our business by, for example, increasing headcount, acquiring companies, and increasing our investment in R&D, sales and marketing, and other parts of our business from time to time, we have initiated a restructuring plan to reduce expenses and align our operations with evolving business needs. Some of our expenses related to such efforts are fixed costs that cannot be rapidly or easily adjusted in response to fluctuations in our business or numbers of employees. Rapid changes in the size, alignment or organization of our workforce, including sales account coverage, could adversely affect our ability to develop and deliver products and services as planned or impair our ability to realize our current or future business and financial objectives. Our ability to achieve the anticipated cost savings and other benefits from our restructuring initiatives within the expected time frame is subject to many estimates and assumptions, which are subject to significant economic, competitive and other uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. If these estimates and assumptions are incorrect, if we are unsuccessful at implementing changes, or if other unforeseen events occur, our business and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur business may be impacted by political events, war, terrorism, business interruptions and other geopolitical events and uncertainties beyond our control.\nWar, terrorism, geopolitical uncertainties and other business interruptions could cause damage to, disrupt or cancel sales of our products and services on a global or regional basis, which could have a material adverse effect on our business or vendors with which we do business. Such events could also make it difficult or impossible for us to deliver products and services to our customers. In addition, territorial invasions can lead to cybersecurity attacks on technology companies, such as ours, located far outside of the conflict zone. In the event of prolonged business interruptions due to geopolitical events, we could incur significant losses, require substantial recovery time and experience significant expenditures in order to resume our business operations. We have no operations in Russia or the Ukraine, but we do not and cannot know if the current uncertainties in these geopolitical areas, which are unfolding in real-time, may escalate and result in broad economic and security conditions, which could result in material implications for our business. In addition, our insurance policies typically contain a war exclusion of some description and we do not know how our insurers are likely to respond in the event of a loss alleged to have been caused by geopolitical uncertainties.\nGlobal economic conditions or semiconductor market conditions could materially adversely impact demand for our products and services, decrease our sales, or delay our sales cycle.\nOur customers are global semiconductor companies, which means that our operations and performance depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions as well as semiconductor market specific changes. Uncertainty about global economic conditions could result in customers postponing purchases of our products and services, including in response to tighter credit, inflationary concerns, unemployment, negative financial news and/or declines in income or asset values and other macroeconomic factors, which could have a material negative effect on demand for our products and\nservices and, accordingly, on our business, results of operations or financial condition. For example, the timing of the build-out of the semiconductor market in China depends significantly on governmental funding on both local and national levels and a delay in this funding could negatively affect our revenues. For further example, any economic and political uncertainty caused by the United States tariffs imposed on goods from China, among other potential countries, and any corresponding tariffs from China or such other countries in response, may negatively impact demand and/or increase the cost for our products. Similarly, the COVID-19 pandemic in China or in other nations has and may continue to cause a slowdown in the global economy and demand for our products and services. Further, the semiconductor industry historically has been volatile with up cycles and down cycles, due to sudden changes in customers\u2019 manufacturing capacity requirements and spending, which depend in part on capacity utilization, demand for customers\u2019 IC products by consumers, inventory levels relative to demand, and access to affordable capital. As a result of the various factors that affect this volatility, the timing and length of any cycles can be difficult to predict and could be longer than anticipated. Any of these events could negatively affect our revenues and make it challenging for us to forecast our operating results, make business decisions, and identify the risks that may affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Customers with liquidity issues may also lead to additional bad debt expense.\nSupply-chain disruption could impact our ability to build additional hardware tools or meeting customer deadlines.\nAny disruptions to our supply chain, significant increase in component costs resulting from inflationary pressures, or shortages of critical components, could impact our ability to build additional hardware tools, which would decrease our sales, earnings, and liquidity or otherwise adversely affect our business and result in increased costs. Such a disruption could occur as a result of any number of events, including, but not limited to: an extended closure of or any slowdown at our suppliers' plants or shipping delays due to efforts to limit the spread of COVID-19, market shortages due to the surge in demand from other purchasers for critical components, increases in prices, the imposition of regulations, quotas or embargoes or tariffs on components or our products themselves, labor stoppages, transportation delays or failures affecting the supply chain and shipment of materials and finished goods, third-party interference in the integrity of the products sourced through the supply chain, cyberattacks, the unavailability of raw materials, severe weather conditions, adverse effects of climate change, natural disasters, geopolitical developments, war or terrorism and disruptions in utilities and other services. In addition, the development, licensing, or acquisition of new products in the future may increase the complexity of supply chain management. Failure to effectively manage the supply of components and products would adversely affect our business.\nRisks Related to Our Technology\nIf we fail to protect our intellectual property rights, customers or potential competitors may be able to use our technologies to develop their own solutions, which could weaken our competitive position, reduce our revenues, or increase our costs.\nOur success depends largely on the proprietary nature of our technologies. Our contractual, patent, copyright, trademark, and trade secret protection may not be effective against any particular threat or in any particular location. Our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents, and even if issued, they may not be sufficiently broad to protect our proprietary technologies. Some foreign countries do not currently provide effective legal protection for intellectual property and our ability to prevent the unauthorized use of our products in those countries is therefore limited. Our trade secrets may also be stolen, otherwise become known, or be independently developed by competitors. Litigation may be necessary from time to time to enforce our IP rights. As a result of any such litigation, we could lose our proprietary rights and incur substantial unexpected operating costs. Litigation could also divert our resources, including our managerial and engineering resources. If we are unable to exclude others from using our proprietary technologies and methods without compensation to us, through litigation or otherwise, it could impede our ability to grow our business and our revenues may suffer.\nWe are exposed to risks related to information technology infrastructure, information management and protection, cybersecurity threats, and cyber incidents.\nWe are heavily reliant on our technology and infrastructure, as well as the public cloud to an increasing degree, to provide our products and services to our customers. We have experienced in the past, and may experience in the future,\ninterruptions in our information systems on which our global operations depend. We may in the future experience unplanned downtime of the infrastructure that delivers our SaaS products. Further, we may face attempts by others to gain unauthorized access through the Internet to our information technology systems whether hosted by us or service providers, to intentionally hack, interfere with, or cause physical or digital damage to or failure of such systems (such as significant viruses or worms), which attempts we or they may be unable to prevent. Our security measures may also be breached due to employee errors, malfeasance, or otherwise. Despite our ongoing efforts to enhance our network security measures, our information systems are susceptible to computer viruses, cyber-related security breaches and similar disruptions from unauthorized intrusions, tampering, misuse, criminal acts, including phishing, or other events or developments that we may be unable to anticipate or fail to mitigate and are subject to the inherent vulnerabilities of network security measures. For example, in the middle of 2020, we became aware that a malicious third-party actor had fraudulently obtained one-time credentials to a limited set of hosts in a small segregated part of our network due to a vulnerability in a third-party VPN device. Third parties may also attempt to influence employees, users, suppliers or customers to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our, our customers\u2019 or business partners\u2019 data. Additionally, third parties with whom we work, such as vendors or developers, may violate applicable laws or our policies and such violations can place personal information of our customers at risk. We or our service providers could be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects until after it is too late to prevent it and the damage it may cause. Further, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to the information systems change frequently, and may not be recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventative measures.\nThe theft, unauthorized use, or a cybersecurity attack that results in the publication of our trade secrets and other confidential business information as a result of such an incident could negatively affect our competitive position, the value of our investment in product or research and development, and third parties might assert against us or our customers claims related to resulting losses of confidential or proprietary information or end-user data and/or system reliability. We carry insurance that provides some protection against the potential losses arising from a cybersecurity incident, but it will not likely cover all such losses, and the losses that it does not cover may be significant. In any such event, our business could be subject to significant disruption, which could impact our revenues or cause customers to cease doing business with us, and we could suffer monetary and other losses, including reputational harm, which costs we may not be able to recover from our service providers. Our operations are dependent upon our ability to protect our technology infrastructure against damage from business continuity events that could have a significant disruptive effect on our operations.\nOur technologies could infringe the intellectual property rights of others, causing costly litigation and the loss of significant rights.\nSignificant litigation regarding intellectual property rights exists in the semiconductor industry. It is possible that a third party may claim that our technologies infringe their intellectual property rights or misappropriate their trade secrets. For example, in late 2020, Ocean Semiconductor LLP (\u201cOcean\u201d) filed complaints against a number of semiconductor companies in the United States, including a number of our customers, alleging that the importation of IC devices made overseas on a process that, in some cases, included our software, infringed U.S. patents owned by Ocean. Any claim, even if without merit, could be time consuming to defend, result in costly litigation, or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms, or at all and could adversely affect our sales opportunities, expenses, and revenues.\nIn addition, we collect, use, store or disclose (collectively, \u201cprocess\u201d) an increasingly large amount of personal information, including from employees and customers, in connection with the operation of our business. The personal information we process is subject to an increasing number of federal, state, local and foreign laws regarding privacy and data security, as well as contractual commitments. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with such obligations may result in governmental enforcement actions, fines, litigation, or public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or others and could cause our customers to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business. Additionally, changes to applicable privacy or data security laws could impact how we process personal information, and therefore limit the effectiveness of our solutions or our ability to develop or deliver new products or services. For example, the European Union General Data Protection Regulation imposes stringent data protection requirements and provides for significant penalties for noncompliance of up to the greater of \u20ac20 million or four percent of worldwide annual revenues. Regulation is also increasingly occurring at the U.S. state level to supplement federal\nlegislative action or inaction, as indicated by the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which first became enforceable in 2020, and similar statutes that have been adopted in other states.\nAdditionally, we must frequently expand our internal information system to meet increasing demand in storage, computing and communication, which may result in increased costs. Our internal information system is expensive to expand and must be highly secure due to the sensitive nature of our customers\u2019 information that we transmit. Building and managing the support necessary for our growth places significant demands on our management and resources. These demands may divert these resources from the continued growth of our business and implementation of our business strategy.\nCompetition in the market for data analytics and related systems and services may intensify in the future, which could impede our ability to grow or execute our strategy.\nWe currently face indirect competition from the internal groups at IC companies and direct competition from providers of (i) yield management and/or prediction systems, such as KLA-Tencor, Siemens AG (\u201cSiemens\u201d), Onto Innovation, Inc. (\u201cOnto\u201d), and Synopsys, Inc. (\u201cSynopsys\u201d); (ii) semiconductor manufacturing software, such as Applied Materials, Inc., Synopsys, Invantest, Inc., NI, Inc., Onto, and Siemens; (iii) inline inspection, metrology and electrical test equipment providers, such as Applied Materials and Keysight Technologies, Inc.; and, (iv) connectivity software or integration products/services supporting factory connectivity or control needs of customers, such as PEER Group, Inc., Kontron AIS, GmbH, Yokogawa Electric Corp., and Kornic Automation Co. Ltd. There may be other providers of competitive commercial solutions of which we are not aware and we may compete with the products or offerings of these named companies or additional companies if we expand our offerings through acquisition or development. For example, since our acquisition of Cimetrix Incorporated in late 2020, we now face competition in the connectivity and integration products/services supporting factory equipment connectivity and control. The demand for solutions that address the need for better integration between the silicon design and manufacturing processes may encourage direct competitors to enter into our market. For example, in 2020, two of our competitors were acquired by larger entities, Synopsys, Inc. acquired Qualtera and NI, Inc. acquired Optimal+, which may enable greater investment or marketing of these competitive applications. This competition in our market may intensify in the future, which could lead to increased pricing pressure, negatively impacting our revenues, and slow our ability to grow or execute our strategy. Also, our current and potential customers may choose to develop their own solutions internally, particularly if we are slow in deploying our solutions or improving them to meet market needs. These and other competitors may be able to operate with a lower cost structure than our engineering organization, which would give any such competitor\u2019s products a competitive advantage over our solutions.\nRisks Related to Our Operations\nMeasurement of our variable consideration requires data collection and customers\u2019 use of estimates in some cases and is subject to customers\u2019 agreement and is later offset if actual data differ from customers\u2019 estimates, which can result in uncertainty and cause quarterly results to fluctuate.\nWe can only recognize volume- or average selling price- based royalties once we have reached agreement with our customers on their level of yield performance improvements or average selling prices (also called \u201cASP\u201d) and quarterly agreements are sometimes based on estimates of volume results or ASP each quarter. Measuring the amount of yield improvement is inherently complicated and dependent on our customers\u2019 internal processes and certain non-public information, thus, there may be uncertainty as to some components of measurement or calculation. Also, some variable consideration can be highly susceptible to delays in the customer measurement of key factors such as reporting volumes results and level of yield or ASP. Therefore, we may have to estimate revenue related to contingent variable fees or usage-based or sales-based royalties prior to the receipt of performance reports, such as royalty acknowledgements, or other related information from customers. These estimates are subject to judgment to evaluate whether it is probable that a significant revenue reversal will not occur in future periods, which could result in our recognition of less Integrated Yield Ramp revenue than expected in any particular period and later offset when actual results become available.\nWe have customers with past due receivable balances and our failure to collect a significant portion of such balances could adversely affect our cash, require us to write-off receivables, or increase expense or our bad debt allowance.\nIf our customers fail to pay receivable balances when due, our cash will decrease and we may have to incur additional expenses in an attempt to collect it, write-off a portion or all of such receivables, or increase our bad debt allowance. Our accounts receivable balance, net of reserves, was $40.1 million and $34.1 million as of December 31, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Unbilled accounts receivable, included in accounts receivable, totaled $11.8 million and $7.2 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Unbilled accounts receivable that are not expected to be billed and collected during the succeeding 12-month period are recorded in other non-current assets and totaled $1.3 million and $2.0 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Two customers accounted for 44% of our gross accounts receivable as of December 31, 2021 and two customers accounted for 27% our gross accounts receivable as of December 31, 2020. The total accounts receivable reserves was $0.9 million and $1.0 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We generally do not require collateral or other security to support accounts receivable. Despite the financial ability of these customers to pay for on-going services by PDF under valid contracts, customers may delay payments. Our allowances for potential credit losses, if any, could be insufficient, and we may need to adjust our allowance for doubtful accounts from current estimates or write-off receivables depending on such claims in the future. If we are forced to pursue legal remedies to collect receivables, our expenses could rise significantly and our business relationship and future business with these customers could suffer.\nWe have experienced losses in the past and we may incur losses again in the future.\nWe have experienced losses in the past, and we may incur losses again in the future if we are not able to adequately control our costs or if total revenues fail to exceed costs. In addition, virtually all of our quarterly operating expenses are fixed, so any shortfall in anticipated quarterly revenues could significantly reduce our operating results below expectations. Our accumulated deficit was $97.7 million as of December 31, 2021. We have in the past and may in the future incur significant expenses in connection with:\n\u25cf funding for research and development;\n\u25cf restructuring costs related to our cost control and management efforts;\n\u25cf expansion of our sales and marketing efforts; and\n\u25cf additional non-cash charges relating to amortization and stock-based compensation.\nWe face operational and financial risks associated with international operations that could negatively impact our revenues.\nIn recent years, we have derived nearly or over half of our revenues from sales outside of the United States, and we expect our international business to continue to grow. We have in the past expanded and reorganized, at different times, our operations, including international operations, and may in the future continue such expansion or reorganization by establishing or restructuring international subsidiaries, offices, or contractor relationships in locations, if and when, deemed appropriate by our management. Thus, the success of our business is subject to risks inherent in doing business internationally, including in particular:\n\u25cf our potential growth in China is dependent upon continued investments in the semiconductor industry by both private and public entities within China. Should circumstances change such that the level of investments is substantially reduced, our future growth potential may be limited;\n\u25cf some of our key engineers and other personnel are foreign nationals and they may not be permitted access to certain technical information under U.S. export laws or by certain of our customers and may have difficulty gaining access to the United States and other countries in which our customers or our offices may be located and it may be difficult for us to recruit and retain qualified technical and managerial employees in foreign offices;\n\u25cf ineffective or inadequate protection or enforcement of our intellectual property in foreign jurisdictions;\n\u25cf greater difficulty in collecting account receivables resulting in longer collection periods, bad debt, and increased cost to collect;\n\u25cf language and other cultural differences may inhibit our sales and marketing efforts and create internal communication problems among our U.S. and foreign teams, increasing the difficulty of managing multiple, remote locations and negatively impacting sales and revenue;\n\u25cf compliance with, inconsistencies among, and unexpected changes in, a wide variety of foreign laws and regulatory environments with which we are not familiar, including, among other issues, with respect to employees, personal data, tax, protection of our IP, and a wide variety of operational regulations and trade and export controls under domestic, foreign, and international law;\n\u25cf currency risk due to the fact that certain of our payables and for our international offices are denominated in the foreign currency, including the Euro, Yen, and RMB, while virtually all of our revenues is denominated in U.S. dollars, or in the event a larger portion of our revenues becomes denominated in foreign currencies, we would be subject to a potentially significant exchange rate risk;\n\u25cf inadequate local infrastructure that could result in business disruptions;\n\u25cf additional taxes, interest, and potential penalties, and uncertainty around changes in tax laws of various countries;\n\u25cf geopolitical instability or changes in government could disrupt our operations or our customers\u2019 purchases or operations or those of related supply chain participants;\n\u25cf quarantine, private travel limitation, or business disruption in regions affecting our operations, stemming from actual, imminent or perceived outbreak of human pandemic or contagious disease, including the COVID-19; or\n\u25cf economic or political instability, including but not limited to armed conflict, terrorism, interference with information or communication of networks or systems, as well as strained or worsening relations between the United States and China, and occupation or war involving Russia and Ukraine, and the resulting disruption to economic activity and business operations.\nFurther, our employees and contractors include professionals located in various international locations, including Shanghai, China, and Ramallah, Palestine, who provide software-related development, quality assurance, maintenance, and other technical support services for certain of our software products. Political changes, including policies regarding export control, that affect these or other international operations could disrupt or limit the work our employees and contractors are able to perform, and thus negatively affect the range of services we are able to provide our customers or our cost for such services.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has affected the manufacturing and shipment of goods. From time to time since the start of the pandemic in 2020, our offices around the world have been temporarily shut down and restrictions have limited the ability of our local employees to travel to customer sites or visit our other offices. An extended closure of our customers\u2019 plants due to a resurgence of COVID-19 or variants thereof could adversely impact our business.\nIn addition, our global operations are subject to numerous U.S. and foreign laws and regulations, including those related to anti-corruption, tax, corporate governance, imports and exports, financial and other disclosures, privacy, and labor relations. These laws and regulations are complex and may have differing or conflicting legal standards, making compliance difficult and costly. In addition, there is uncertainty regarding how proposed, contemplated, or future changes to these complex laws and regulations could affect our business. We may incur substantial expense in complying with the new obligations to be imposed by these laws and regulations, and we may be required to make significant changes in our business operations, all of which may adversely affect our revenues and our business overall. Given the high level of\ncomplexity of these laws, there is a risk that some provisions may be inadvertently or intentionally breached, for example through fraudulent or negligent behavior of individual employees, our failure to comply with certain formal documentation requirements or otherwise. If we violate these laws and regulations, we could be subject to fines, penalties, or criminal sanctions, and may be prohibited from conducting business in one or more countries. Additionally, we may be held liable for actions taken by our local dealers and partners. A significant violation could additionally have a significantly negatively impact our sales opportunities, operations, and financial results. Even if our operations and ability to deliver products and services to customers in China and elsewhere are not significantly negatively impacted by such changing regulations, our customers in China and elsewhere may decide to use only local vendors as a precaution. In such case, our expected international business may be slower than expected or not materialize at all, in which case, our sales opportunities, operations, and financial results would suffer.\nFurther, the U.S. government has most recently imposed a \u201cfirst tranche\u201d of broad sanctions against Russia relating to its invasion of Ukraine aimed at Russia\u2019s financial, technology, energy and transport sectors, and certain companies and high-wealth individuals, and has additionally continued a bipartisan consensus in the U.S. government favoring increased confrontation of China in trade practices and economic matters, national security, and human rights. The current U.S. Administration views technology as a domain of strategic competition in which the U.S. and allies must stay ahead of China and has reaffirmed the U.S. government consensus identifying semiconductor, artificial intelligence, and 5G technologies, and protection of U.S. supply chains as priority efforts. If the Administration continues to augment ongoing U.S. efforts by enlisting the cooperation of allied countries in both advanced development and protection against P.R.C. and/or Russian use of U.S. and allied advances, or expands or intensifies export controls and sanctions, including by adding more P.R.C. or Russian companies to the U.S. Export Administration Regulations (EAR) Entity List, our ability to sell to these companies or companies supplied by them could be negatively impacted. Our standard operations include development, distribution processes, software download sites, and professional service centers and processes located in various geographies around the world. Some customers have expressed concerns to us that continued action by the U.S. government could potentially interrupt their ability to make use of our products or services. The continuing tension between the U.S. and P.R.C. and Russian governments in trade and security matters or the perception of that tension could lead to disruptions or reductions in international trade, deter or prevent purchasing activity of customers, and negatively impact us in our financial results, including in particular sales in China and Russia.\nWe must comply with a variety of existing and future laws and regulations that could impose substantial costs on us and may adversely affect our business.\nIncreasingly regulators, customers, investors, employees and other stakeholders are focusing on Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) matters. While we have certain ESG initiatives at the Company, there can be no assurance that regulators, customers, investors, and employees will determine that these programs are sufficiently robust. In addition, there can be no assurance that we will be able to attain any announced goals related to our ESG program, as statements regarding our ESG goals reflect our current plans and aspirations and are not guarantees that we will be able to achieve them within the timelines we announce or at all. Actual or perceived shortcomings with respect to our ESG initiatives and reporting can impact our ability to hire and retain employees, increase our customer base, or attract and retain certain types of investors. In addition, these parties are increasing focused on specific disclosures and frameworks related to ESG matters. Collecting, measuring, and reporting ESG information and metrics can be costly, difficult and time consuming, is subject to evolving reporting standards, and can present numerous operational, reputational, financial, legal and other risks, any of which could have a material impact, including on our reputation and stock price. Inadequate processes to collect and review this information prior to disclosure could be subject to potential liability related to such information.\nTax Risks\nChanges in effective tax rates could positively affect our earnings, thereby raising investors\u2019 expectations, while the final tax rates that are determined could be significantly higher, thereby lowering our earnings and causing us to miss investors\u2019 expectations, which could cause our stock price to drop.\nWe conduct our business globally and, as a result, are subject to taxation in the United States and foreign countries. Our future tax rates could be affected by numerous factors, including recent changes in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws, insufficient taxable income to realize deferred tax assets, and changes in accounting policies. Our filings\nare subject to reviews or audit by the Internal Revenue Service and state, local and foreign taxing authorities. We cannot be sure that any final determination in an audit would not be materially different than the treatment reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. If additional taxes are assessed as a result of an audit, there could be a significant negative effect on our income tax provision and our operating results in the period or periods for which that determination is made. Any changes in our geographical earnings mix in various tax jurisdictions, including those resulting from transfer pricing adjustments, could materially increase our effective tax rate.\nFuture events may impact our deferred tax asset position, including the utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards.\nRealization of our deferred tax assets is dependent primarily upon future taxable income in the applicable jurisdiction. We previously recorded a full valuation allowance against all of our U.S. federal and state deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty surrounding the future realization of these deferred tax assets. Therefore, no benefit has been recognized for the net operating loss carryforwards, tax credit carryforwards, and other deferred tax assets. The net operating loss and tax credits could expire unused and be unavailable to reduce future income tax liabilities. We intend to continue maintaining a full valuation allowance on these deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of these allowances. We evaluate our deferred tax assets for realizability each reporting period. The impact of releasing some or all of such valuation allowance in a future period could be a material benefit in the period in which such release occurs.\nU.S. federal tax reform and changes in other tax laws could increase our tax burden and adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nIn December 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, significantly reforming the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. These changes include, among others, (i) a permanent reduction to the corporate income tax rate, (ii) a partial limitation on the deductibility of business interest expense, (iii) a shift of the U.S. taxation of multinational corporations from a tax on worldwide income to a territorial system (along with certain rules designed to prevent erosion of the U.S. income tax base) and (iv) a one-time tax on accumulated offshore earnings held in cash and illiquid assets, with the latter taxed at a lower rate.\nIn addition, beginning in 2022, the recently enacted tax legislation will require research and experimental expenditures to be capitalized and amortized ratably over a five-year period. Any such expenditures attributable to research conducted outside the United States must be capitalized and amortized over a 15-year period.\nNotwithstanding the reduction in the corporate income tax rate, the overall impact of this tax reform is uncertain, and our business and financial condition could be adversely affected. Furthermore, it is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the enacted federal tax law or any newly enacted federal legislation. In addition, new legislation or regulation which could affect our tax burden could be enacted by any governmental authority. We cannot predict the timing or extent of such tax related developments which could have a negative impact on our financial results. Additionally, we use our best judgment in attempting to quantify and reserve for these tax obligations. However, a challenge by a taxing authority, our ability to utilize tax benefits such as carryforwards or tax credits, or a deviation from other tax related assumptions could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Strategic Transactions\nWe may not realize the benefits of our strategic partnership with Advantest, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations\nOn July 29, 2020, we entered into a strategic partnership with Advantest Corporation through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Advantest America, Inc. (collectively, \u201cAdvantest\u201d), that includes: (i) a significant agreement for our assistance in development of cloud-based applications for Advantest tools that leverage our Exensio software analytics platform; (ii) a commercial agreement providing for the license to third parties of solutions that result from the development work that combine Advantest\u2019s testing applications and our Exensio platform; (iii) a 5-year cloud-based subscription for our Exensio analytics platform and related services; and (iv) the purchase of 3,306,924 shares of our\ncommon stock, for aggregate gross proceeds of $65.2 million. The full extent of the future impact of this strategic partnership on our financial condition and results of operations is currently unknown and the failure to reap the anticipated benefits of Advantest\u2019s financial resources, technology, customer relationships, and global footprint and/or develop successful joint solutions could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur acquisitions and divestitures create special risks and challenges that could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe have made, and may continue to make, acquisitions in order to enhance our business. For example, we acquired Cimetrix Incorporated (\u201cCimetrix\u201d) in December 2020 for a gross purchase price of approximately $37.5 million ($31.6 million net of cash acquired) for all of its outstanding equity. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including, but not limited to, problems combining the purchased operations, technologies or products, unanticipated costs, liabilities, litigation, and diversion of management\u2019s attention from our core businesses, adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers, risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience, and where competitors in such markets have stronger market positions, initial dependence on unfamiliar supply chains or relatively small supply partners, failure of our due diligence processes to identify significant problems, liabilities or other challenges of an acquired company or technology, and the potential loss of key employees, customers, distributors, vendors, and other business partners of the companies we acquire.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully integrate any businesses, products, technologies, or personnel that we might acquire or that the transaction will advance our business strategy. The integration of businesses that we may acquire is likely to be a complex, time-consuming, and expensive process and we may not realize the anticipated revenues or other benefits associated with our acquisitions. If we fail to successfully manage, operate, or integrate any acquired business or if we are unable to efficiently operate as a combined organization, including through the use of common information and communication systems, operating procedures, financial controls, and human resources practices, we could be required to write-down investments and our business, financial condition, and results of operations may be adversely affected. We may also be unable to protect or enforce the intellectual property rights of any target business that we acquire, or such target businesses may become subject to claims of intellectual property infringement. Further, if we become subject to liabilities as a result of an acquisition, the liabilities we incur may be substantial and the amounts of such liabilities may not be covered by and/or may exceed any liability protections.\nIn connection with certain acquisitions, we may agree to issue common stock, or assume equity awards, that dilute the ownership of our current stockholders, use a substantial portion of our cash resources, assume liabilities (both known and unknown), record goodwill and amortizable intangible assets that will be subject to impairment testing on a regular basis and potential periodic impairment charges, incur amortization expenses related to certain intangible assets, and incur large and immediate write-offs and restructuring and other related expenses, all of which could harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nCOVID-19 Risks\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected how we and our customers are operating our business and the duration and extent to which this will impact our future results of operations and overall financial performance remains uncertain.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected how we and our customers are operating our business. For example, most U.S. states and countries worldwide imposed and may continue to impose from time-to-time for the foreseeable future, restrictions on the physical movement of our employees, partners, and customers to limit the spread of COVID-19. Our US headquarters and R&D facility and offices in Canada, France, Japan and Korea have experienced temporary closures since the first quarter of 2020. In addition, since that time, our personnel worldwide have also been subject to various country to country travel restrictions, which limit our ability to provide services to customers at their facilities. These impacts have disrupted our normal operations. If the COVID-19 pandemic has a substantial impact on our employees\u2019 productivity, our results of operations and overall financial performance may be harmed.\nMoreover, the conditions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic could adversely affect our customers\u2019 ability or willingness to purchase our products or services, delay prospective customers\u2019 purchasing decisions, adversely impact our\nability to provide or deliver products and on-site services to our customers, delay the provisioning of our offerings, lengthen payment terms, reduce the value or duration of their subscriptions, or affect attrition rates, all of which could adversely affect our future sales, operating results and overall financial performance. For example, we believe the lack of an ability to meet face-to-face during most of 2020 and 2021 have made it harder for us to sell complex or new technologies to such customers during these periods.\nWhile the future economic impact brought by the COVID-19 pandemic may be difficult to assess or predict, a long-term market downturn resulting from the spread of COVID-19 could materially impact the value of our common stock, impact our access to capital and affect our business in the near and long-term.\nThe duration and extent of the continuing impact from the COVID-19 pandemic depends on future developments that cannot be accurately predicted at this time, such as the severity and transmission rate of the virus and variants thereof, the extent and effectiveness of containment actions, including the availability and effective distribution of vaccines, and the impact of these and other factors on our employees, customers, partners and vendors. If we are not able to respond to and manage the impact of such events effectively, or if the macroeconomic conditions of the general economy continue to worsen or the industries in which we operate are negatively impacted over the long-term, our business, operating results, financial condition and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nIf we are not able to retain, attract, motivate, and strategically locate talented employees, including some key executives, our business may suffer.\nOur success and competitiveness depend on our ability to retain, attract, motivate, and strategically locate in our offices around the globe, talented employees, including some of our key executives. Achieving this objective may be difficult due to many factors, including fluctuations in global economic and industry conditions, changes in our management or leadership, the hiring practices at our competitors or customers, cost reduction activities, and the effectiveness of our compensation programs, including equity-based programs. Further, we have had, and expect to continue to have, difficulty in obtaining visas permitting entry for some of our employees that are foreign nationals into the United States, and delays in obtaining visas permitting entry into other key countries, for several of our key personnel, which disrupts our ability to strategically locate our personnel. In recent years, the United States increased the level of scrutiny in granting H-1(b), L-1 and other business visas. Compliance with United States immigration and labor laws could require us to incur additional unexpected labor costs and expenses or could restrain our ability to retain skilled professionals. If we lose the services of certain of our key executives or a significant number of our engineers, it could disrupt our ability to implement our business strategy. If we do not successfully attract, retain, and motivate key employees, including key executives, we may be unable to realize our business objectives and our operating results may suffer.\nOur earnings per share and other operating results may vary quarter to quarter, which could result in not meeting investors\u2019 expectations and cause our stock price to drop.\nOur stock price has fluctuated widely during the last few years. A factor in the volatility may be that our historical quarterly operating results have fluctuated. Our future quarterly operating results will likely fluctuate from time to time and may not meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors in some future period, which could cause our stock price to decrease again. A significant reduction in our stock price negatively impacts our ability to raise equity capital in the public markets and increases the cost to us, as measured by dilution to our existing shareholders, of equity financing. In addition, the reduced stock price also increases the cost to us, in terms of dilution, of using our equity for employee compensation or for acquisitions of other businesses. A greatly reduced stock price could also have other negative results, including the potential loss of confidence by employees, the loss of institutional investor interest, a hostile take-over bid, and fewer business development opportunities. Also, significant volatility in the stock price could be followed by a securities class action lawsuit, which could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources.\nOur business could be negatively affected as a result of actions of activist shareholders, and such activism could impact the trading value of our securities.\nIn recent years, shareholder activists have become involved in numerous public companies, including our company. Shareholder activists frequently propose to involve themselves in the governance, strategic direction, and operations of a company. Such proposals may disrupt our business, increase our expenses, and divert the attention of our Board of Directors and our management and employees, and any perceived uncertainties as to our future direction resulting from such a situation could result in the loss of potential business opportunities, interfere with our ability to execute our strategic plan be exploited by our competitors, cause concern to our current or potential customers, and make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel and business partners, all of which could adversely affect our business. A proxy contest for the election of directors at our annual meeting could also require us to incur significant legal fees and proxy solicitation expenses. In addition, actions of activist shareholders may cause significant fluctuations in our stock price based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business.", "PERMNO": 89044, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "PDFS"}
