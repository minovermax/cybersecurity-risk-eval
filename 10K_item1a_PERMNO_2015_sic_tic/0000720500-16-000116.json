Because of the following factors, as well as other variables affecting our operating results and financial condition, past performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. The following risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information and risks set forth herein.\nRisks Related to our Business and Industry.\nThe ongoing volatility of the solar and semiconductor equipment industry may negatively impact our business and results of operations and our corresponding ability to efficiently budget our expenses. The demand for our products and the profitability of our products can change significantly from period to period as a result of numerous factors.\nThe solar and semiconductor equipment industries are highly cyclical and the conditions of the industries we operate are volatile. As such, demand for, and the profitability of, our products can change significantly from period to period as a result of numerous factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022 changes in global and regional economic conditions;\n\u2022 changes in capacity utilization and production volume of manufacturers of solar cells, semiconductors, silicon\nwafers and MEMS;\n\u2022\nthe profitability and capital resources of those manufacturers;\n\u2022\ntariff and international trade barriers, including without limitation unfair trade proceedings against solar PV manufacturers in China;\n\u2022\nchallenges associated with marketing and selling manufacturing equipment and services to a diverse and diffuse customer base;\n\u2022\nthe financial condition of solar PV customers and their access to affordable financing and capital; and\n\u2022 the shift of solar and semiconductor production to Asia, where there often is increased price competition.\nFor these and other reasons, our results of operations for past periods may not necessarily be indicative of future operating results.\nSince our business has historically been subject to cyclical industry conditions, we have experienced significant fluctuations in our quarterly new orders and net revenue, both within and across years. Demand for solar, semiconductor and silicon wafer manufacturing equipment and related consumable products has also been volatile as a result of sudden changes in solar and semiconductor supply and demand and other factors in both semiconductor devices and wafer fabrication processes. Our orders tend to be more volatile than our revenue, as any change in demand is reflected immediately in orders booked, which are net of cancellations, while revenue tends to be recognized over multiple quarters as a result of procurement and production lead times and the deferral of certain revenue under our revenue recognition policies. Customer delivery schedules on large system orders can also add to this volatility since we generally recognize revenue for new product sales on the date of customer acceptance or the date the contractual customer acceptance provisions lapse. As a result, the fiscal period in which we are able to recognize new product revenue is typically subject to the length of time that our customers require to evaluate the performance of our equipment after shipment and installation, which could cause our quarterly operating results to fluctuate.\nThe purchasing decisions of our customers are highly dependent on their capacity utilization, which changes when new facilities are put into production, and with the level of demand for solar cells and semiconductors. Purchasing decisions are also impacted by changes in the economies of the countries which our customers serve, as well as the state of the worldwide solar and semiconductor industries. The timing, length and severity of the up-and-down cycles in the solar and semiconductor equipment industries are difficult to predict. The cyclical nature of our marketplace affects our ability to accurately budget our expense levels, which are based in part on our projections of future revenue.\nWhen cyclical fluctuations result in lower than expected revenue levels, operating results are adversely affected. Cost reduction measures may be necessary in order for us to remain competitive and financially sound. During a down cycle, our operating results may be adversely affected if we are unable to make timely adjustments to our cost and expense structure to correspond to the prevailing market conditions; effectively manage the supply chain; and motivate and retain key employees. In addition, during periods of rapid growth, our operating results may be adversely affected if we are unable to increase manufacturing capacity and personnel to meet customer demand, which may require additional\nliquidity. We can provide no assurance that we can timely and effectively respond to the industry cycles. Our failure to timely and effectively respond to these cyclical changes could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe Company is exposed to risks as a result of ongoing changes specific to the solar industry.\nA significant portion of the Company's business is to supply the solar market, which, in addition to the general industry changes described above, is characterized by ongoing changes specific to the solar industry, including:\n\u2022\nthe varying energy policies of governments around the world and their influence on the rate of growth of the solar PV market, including the availability and amount of government incentives for solar power such as tax credits, feed-in tariffs, rebates, renewable portfolio standards that require electricity providers to sell a targeted amount of energy from renewable sources, and goals for solar installations on government facilities;\n\u2022\nthe need to continually decrease the cost-per-watt of electricity produced by solar PV products to or below competing sources of energy by, among other things, reducing operating costs and increasing throughputs for solar PV manufacturing, and improving the conversion efficiency of solar PV;\n\u2022\nthe impact on demand for solar PV products arising from the cost of electricity generated by solar PV compared to the cost of electricity from the existing grid or other energy sources;\n\u2022\nthe growing number of solar PV manufacturers and increasing global production capacity for solar PV, primarily in China as a result of increased solar subsidies and lower manufacturing costs;\n\u2022\ntariff and international trade barriers, including without limitation such barriers arising from any trade tensions between the United States and China and potential retaliatory actions;\n\u2022\nthe varying levels of operating and industry experience among solar PV manufacturers and the resulting differences in the nature and extent of customer support services requested from the Company;\n\u2022\nchallenges associated with marketing and selling manufacturing equipment and services to a diverse and diffuse customer base;\n\u2022\nthe cost of polysilicon and other materials;\n\u2022\naccess to affordable financing and capital by customers and end-users; and\n\u2022\nan increasing number of local equipment and parts suppliers based in Asia with certain cost and other advantages over suppliers from outside Asia.\nIn addition, current projections for global solar PV production exceed anticipated near-term end-use demand, which is heavily dependent on installed cost-per-watt, government policies and incentives, and the availability of affordable capital. An oversupply of solar PV may lead customers to delay or reduce investments in manufacturing capacity and new technology, and adversely impact the sales and/or profitability of our products. If the Company does not successfully manage the risks resulting from the ongoing changes occurring in the solar industry, its business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe solar and semiconductor equipment industries are competitive and because we are relatively small in size and have fewer resources compared to our competitors, we may not be able to compete successfully with them. Loss of competitive position could impair our prices, customer orders, revenue, gross margin and market share, any of which would negatively affect our financial position and results of operations.\nOur industry includes large manufacturers with substantial resources to support customers worldwide. Our future performance depends, in part, upon our ability to continue to compete successfully in these markets. Some of our competitors are diversified companies having substantially greater financial resources and more extensive research, engineering, manufacturing, marketing and customer service and support capabilities than we can provide. We face competition from companies whose strategy is to provide a broad array of products, some of which compete with the products and services that we offer. These competitors may bundle their products in a manner that may discourage customers from purchasing our products. In addition, we face competition from emerging solar and semiconductor equipment companies whose strategy is to provide a portion of the products and services that we offer often at a lower price than ours and use innovative technology to sell products into specialized markets. Furthermore, we face competition from Chinese equipment manufacturers, including 48th Institute and Sevenstar Electronics, which may receive greater support from Chinese customers and governmental agencies because they are locally based. Loss of competitive position could impair our prices, customer orders, revenue, gross margin and market share, any of which would negatively affect our financial position and results of operations. Our failure to compete successfully with these other companies would seriously harm our business. There is a risk that larger, better-financed competitors will develop and market more advanced products than those that we currently offer, or that competitors with greater financial resources may decrease\nprices thereby putting us under financial pressure. The occurrence of any of these events could have a negative impact on our revenue and results of operations.\nOur reliance on sales to a few major customers and granting credit to those customers places us at financial risk.\nWe currently sell to a relatively small number of customers, and we expect our operating results will likely continue to depend on sales to a relatively small number of customers for the foreseeable future. Our operating results, therefore, depend on the ability of these customers to sell products that require our equipment in their manufacture. Many of our customer relationships have been developed over a short period of time and certain customers are in their early stages of development. The loss of sales to any of these customers would have a significant negative impact on our business. Our agreements with these customers may be canceled if we fail to meet certain product specifications, materially breach the agreement, or in the event of bankruptcy, and our customers may seek to renegotiate the terms of current agreements or renewals. We cannot be certain that these customers will generate significant revenue for us in the future nor that these customer relationships will continue to develop. If our relationships with other customers do not continue to develop, we may not be able to expand our customer base or maintain or increase our revenue.\nAs of September 30, 2016, one customer individually represented 11% of accounts receivable. As of September 30, 2015, no single customer represented greater than 10% of accounts receivable. A significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any of our customers that purchase large systems could have a material impact on the collectability of our accounts receivable and our future operating results. A concentration of our receivables from one or a small number of customers places us at risk. We attempt to manage this credit risk by performing credit checks, by requiring significant partial payments prior to shipment where appropriate and by actively monitoring collections. We also require letters of credit from certain customers depending on the size of the order, type of customer or its creditworthiness and its country of domicile. Our major customers may seek, and on occasion, may receive pricing, payment, intellectual property-related, or other commercial terms that are less favorable to the Company. If any one or more of our major customers does not pay us or continue business with us, it could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.\nIf any of our customers cancels or fails to accept a large system order, our financial position and results of\noperations could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur backlog includes orders for large systems, such as our diffusion furnaces, with system prices of up to and in excess of $1.0 million, depending on the system configuration, options and any special requirements of the customer. Because our orders are typically subject to cancellation or delay by the customer, our backlog at any particular point in time is not necessarily representative of actual sales for succeeding periods, nor is backlog any assurance that we will realize revenue or profit from completing these orders. Our financial position and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected should any large systems order be canceled prior to shipment, or not be accepted by the customer. Cancellations may result in inventory that we may not be able to sell or reuse if those products have been tailored for a specific customer's requirements and cannot then be sold without significant incremental cost. We have experienced cancellations in the past. We cannot provide any assurance that we will realize revenue or profit from our backlog or for which period net revenue will be recognized, if ever.\nBecause we depend on revenue from international customers, our business may be adversely affected by changes in the economies and policies of the countries or regions in which we do business.\nDuring fiscal 2015, 74% of our net revenue came from customers outside of North America. During fiscal 2016, 80% of our net revenue came from customers outside of North America as follows:\n\u2022\nAsia - 68% (including China - 28%, Malaysia 18% and Taiwan - 15%); and\n\u2022\nEurope - 12%\nEach region in the global solar and semiconductor equipment markets exhibits unique characteristics that can cause capital equipment investment patterns to vary significantly from period to period. Our business and results of operations could be negatively affected by periodic local or international economic downturns, trade balance issues and political, social and military instability in countries such as China, India, South Korea, Taiwan and possibly elsewhere. In addition, we face competition from a number of suppliers based in Asia that have certain advantages over suppliers from outside of Asia. These advantages include lower operating, shipping and regulatory costs, proximity to customers,\nfavorable tariffs and other government policies that favor local suppliers. Additionally, the marketing and sale of our products to international markets expose us to a number of risks, including, but not limited, to:\n\u2022\nincreased costs associated with maintaining the ability to understand the local markets and follow their trends and customs, as well as develop and maintain effective marketing and distributing presence in various countries;\n\u2022\nthe availability of advance payments made by our customers;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in providing customer service and support in these markets;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in staffing and managing overseas operations;\n\u2022\nlonger sales cycles and time collection periods;\n\u2022\nfewer or weaker legal protections for our intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nfailure to develop appropriate risk management and internal control structures tailored to overseas\noperations;\n\u2022\ndifficulty and costs relating to compliance with the different or changing commercial and legal requirements of our overseas markets;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange and interest rates, particularly in Asia and Europe;\n\u2022\nlonger sales cycles and time collection periods;\n\u2022\nfailure to obtain or maintain certifications for our products or services in these markets; and\n\u2022\ninternational trade barriers such as export requirements, tariffs, taxes and other restrictions and expenses.\nOur common stock may experience substantial price volatility.\nOur stock price has experienced volatility in the past, and volatility in the price of our common stock may occur in the future, particularly as a result of fluctuations in global economic conditions and quarter-to-quarter variations in our actual or anticipated financial results, or the financial results of other semiconductor companies or our customers. Stock price volatility may also result from product announcements by us or our competitors, or from changes in perceptions about the various types of products we manufacture and sell. In addition, our stock price may fluctuate due to price and volume fluctuations in the stock market, especially in the technology sector, and as a result of other considerations or events described in this section.\nOur business may be adversely affected by significant exchange rate fluctuations and changes in foreign laws\nWe incurred a net foreign currency transaction loss of less than $0.1 million during the fiscal year ended September 30, 2016 and had a foreign currency transaction gain of $0.3 million for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. While our business generally has not been materially affected in the past by currency fluctuations, there is a risk that it may be materially adversely affected in the future, especially as we continue to expand operations into other countries. Such risk includes possible losses due to currency exchange rate fluctuations, possible future prohibitions against repatriation of earnings, or proceeds from disposition of investments. Our wholly-owned subsidiary, Tempress Systems, has conducted its operations in The Netherlands since 1995. In October 2007, we completed our acquisition of R2D, a French company. In December 2014, we acquired SoLayTec with operations in The Netherlands. BTU International, acquired in January 2015, has substantial operations in Shanghai, China. As a result of these acquisitions in Europe and Asia, the risk associated with foreign currency translation gains and losses has increased. Operations of these companies are subject to the taxation policies, employment and labor laws, transportation regulations, import and export regulations and tariffs, possible foreign exchange restrictions and international monetary fluctuations. Changes in such laws and regulations may have a material adverse effect on our revenue and costs. We are subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage to foreign companies that are not subject to similar regulations. We could be adversely affected by violations of applicable anti-corruption laws or violations of our internal policies designed to ensure ethical business practices.\nWe are exposed to risks associated with an uncertain global economy.\nUncertain global economic conditions and slowing growth in China, Europe and the United States, along with difficulties in the financial markets, national debt concerns in various regions and government austerity measures, pose challenges to the industries in which we operate. Economic uncertainty and related factors, including unemployment, inflation and fuel prices, exacerbate negative trends in business and consumer spending and may cause our customers to push out, cancel, or refrain from placing orders for equipment or services. This may, in turn, reduce our net sales, reduce backlog, and affect our ability to convert backlog to sales. Uncertain market conditions, difficulties in obtaining capital, or reduced profitability may also cause some customers to scale back operations, exit businesses, merge with other\nmanufacturers, or file for bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations, which can also result in lower sales and/or additional inventory or bad debt expense for us. These conditions may similarly affect key suppliers, impairing their ability to deliver parts and potentially causing delays or added costs for delivery of our products. In addition, these conditions may lead to strategic alliances by, or consolidation of, other equipment manufacturers, which could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively. Uncertainty about future economic and industry conditions also makes it more challenging for us to forecast our operating results, make business decisions, and identify and prioritize the risks that may affect our businesses, sources and uses of cash, financial condition and results of operations. We may be required to implement additional cost reduction efforts, including restructuring activities, and/or modify our business model, which may adversely affect our ability to capitalize on opportunities in a market recovery. If we do not timely and appropriately adapt to changes resulting from the uncertain macroeconomic environment and industry conditions, or to difficulties in the financial markets, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nManufacturing interruptions or delays could affect our ability to meet customer demand and lead to higher costs, while the failure to estimate customer demand accurately could result in excess or obsolete inventory.\nOur business depends on timely supply of equipment, services and related products that meet the rapidly changing technical and volume requirements of our customers. Some key parts to our products are subject to long lead-times and/or obtainable only from a single supplier or limited group of suppliers. Cyclical industry conditions and the volatility of demand for manufacturing equipment increase capital, technical, operational and other risks for us and for companies throughout our supply chain. Further, these conditions may cause some suppliers to scale back operations, exit businesses, merge with other companies, or file for bankruptcy protection and possibly cease operations. We may also experience significant interruptions of our manufacturing operations, delays in our ability to deliver products or services, increased costs or customer order cancellations as a result of:\n\u2022\nthe failure or inability of suppliers to timely deliver sufficient quantities of quality parts on a cost-effective basis;\n\u2022\nvolatility in the availability and cost of materials, including rare earth elements;\n\u2022\ndifficulties or delays in obtaining required import or export approvals;\n\u2022\ninformation technology or infrastructure failures; and\n\u2022\nnatural disasters or other events beyond our control (such as earthquakes, floods or storms, regional economic downturns, pandemics, social unrest, political instability, terrorism, or acts of war), particularly where the Company conducts manufacturing.\nNatural disasters, outbursts of infectious diseases, terrorist attacks and threats or actual war may negatively impact all aspects of our operations, revenue, costs and stock price.\nNatural disasters such as earthquakes, floods, severe weather conditions or other catastrophic events, or outbreaks of infectious diseases may severely affect our operations or those of our suppliers and customers. Such catastrophic events or future disasters may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nActs of terrorism, as well as events occurring in response or connection to them, including potential future terrorist attacks, rumors or threats of war, actual military conflicts or trade disruptions impacting our domestic or foreign customers or suppliers of parts, components and subassemblies, may negatively impact our operations by causing, among other things, delays or losses in the delivery of supplies or finished goods and decreased sales of our products. More generally, any of these events could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease or result in increased volatility in the worldwide financial markets and economy. They could also result in economic recession. Any of these occurrences could have a significant adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations.\nIf demand declines for horizontal diffusion furnaces and related equipment, or for other solar industry products, our financial position and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nThe revenue of our solar equipment business is comprised primarily of sales of horizontal diffusion furnaces and our automation products. Our automation products are useable almost exclusively with horizontal diffusion furnaces. A significant part of our growth strategy involves expanding our sales to the solar industry. The solar industry is subject to risks relating to industry shortages of polysilicon, (which we discuss further herein), the continuation of government incentives, the availability of specialized capital equipment, global energy prices and rapidly changing technologies offering alternative energy sources and manufacturing processes. If the demand for solar industry products declines,\nthe demand by the solar industry for our products would also decline and our financial position and results of operations would be harmed.\nThere is a trend in the semiconductor industry, related to the trend to produce smaller chips on larger wafers, towards the use in semiconductor manufacturing facilities of newer technology, such as vertical diffusion furnaces. Vertical diffusion furnaces are more efficient than horizontal diffusion furnaces in certain manufacturing processes for smaller chips on larger wafers. To the extent that the trend to use vertical diffusion furnaces over horizontal diffusion furnaces continues, our revenue may decline and our corresponding ability to generate income may be adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to manage the business successfully through severe business cycles.\nWe may be unable to successfully expand or contract our business to meet fluctuating demands. Market fluctuations place significant strain on our management, personnel, systems and resources. In fiscal years 2010 and 2011, we purchased additional equipment and real estate to significantly expand our manufacturing capacity and hired additional employees to support an increase in manufacturing, field service, research and development and sales and marketing efforts. During fiscal years 2012 through 2016, the rapid decline in demand has caused us to reduce headcount in manufacturing and field service and to reduce certain research and development costs. To successfully manage our growth, we believe we must effectively:\n\u2022\nmaintain the appropriate number and mix of permanent, part-time, temporary and contract employees to meet the fluctuating demand for our products;\n\u2022\ntrain, integrate and manage personnel, particularly process engineers, field service engineers, sales and marketing personnel, and financial and information technology personnel to maintain and improve skills and morale;\n\u2022\nleverage our expanded global sales and service presence through the acquisition of BTU International\n\u2022\nretain key management and augment our management team, particularly if we lose key members;\n\u2022\ncontinue to enhance our customer resource and manufacturing management systems to maintain high levels of customer satisfaction and efficiencies, including inventory control;\n\u2022\nimplement and improve existing and new administrative, financial and operations systems,\nprocedures and controls;\n\u2022\nexpand and upgrade our technological capabilities; and\n\u2022\nmanage multiple relationships with our customers, suppliers and other third parties.\nWe may encounter difficulties in effectively managing the budgeting, forecasting and other process control issues presented by rapidly changing cycles. If we are unable to manage these cycles effectively, we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities, develop new technologies for the production of solar cells and other products, satisfy customer requirements, execute our business plan or respond to competitive pressures.\nIf governmental subsidies decline or if demand for solar energy declines, our Company may not be able to continue making substantial investments in our organization to develop new products for the solar industry which may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe solar energy sector is dependent upon governmental subsidies, some of which have been scaled back and are not guaranteed to continue. A further decline in these subsidies could reduce our ability to make investments in our Company and grow our business in this market. The solar industry is currently facing overcapacity in production. This overcapacity has a significant adverse impact on the demand for the capital equipment we supply to this industry. As a result of these risks there is no assurance that we will realize a return on these investments which may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are dependent on key personnel for our business and product development and sales, and any loss of our key\npersonnel to competitors or other industries could dramatically impact our ability to continue operations.\nHistorically, our product development has been accomplished through cooperative efforts with key customers. Our relationships with some customers are substantially dependent on personal relations and other contacts established by either our Executive Chairman or our President and Chief Executive Officer. Our relationships with major European customers that are strategically important to the development and testing of our N-type technology solar diffusion furnace and PECVD equipment are substantially dependent upon our President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Fokko\nPentinga. While there can be no assurance that such relationships will continue, such cooperation is expected to continue to be a significant element in our future development efforts.\nFurthermore, it may not be feasible for any successor to maintain the same business relationships that our Executive Chairman, Mr. J.S. Whang, has established. Even though we are the beneficiary of life insurance policies on the life of Mr. Whang, in the amount of $2.0 million, there is no assurance that such amount will be sufficient to cover the cost of finding and hiring a suitable replacement for Mr. Whang. If we were to lose the services of either Mr. Whang or Mr. Pentinga for any reason, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe also depend on the management efforts of our officers and other key personnel and on our ability to attract and retain key personnel. During times of strong economic growth, competition is intense for highly skilled employees. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel or that we can avoid increased costs in order to do so. There can be no assurance that employees will not leave Amtech or compete against us. Our failure to attract additional qualified employees, or to retain the services of key personnel, could negatively impact our financial position and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to keep pace with the rapid change in the technology needed to meet customer requirements.\nSuccess in the solar and semiconductor equipment industries depends, in part, on continual improvement of existing technologies and rapid innovation of new solutions. For example, the solar industry continues to develop new technologies to increase the efficiencies and lower the costs of solar cells. Also, the semiconductor industry continues to shrink the size of semiconductor devices. These and other evolving customer needs require us to continually respond with new product developments.\nTechnical innovations are inherently complex and require long development cycles and appropriate professional staffing. Our future business success depends on our ability to develop and introduce new products, or new uses for existing products, that successfully address changing customer needs and win market acceptance. We must also manufacture these new products in a timely and cost-effective manner. To realize future growth through technical innovations in the solar and semiconductor industries, we must either acquire the technology through product development, merger and acquisition activity or through the licensing of products from our technology partners. Potential disruptive technologies could have a material adverse effect on our business if we do not successfully develop and introduce new products, technologies or uses for existing products in a timely manner and continually find ways of reducing the cost to produce them in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements.\nAcquisitions can result in an increase in our operating costs, divert management's attention away from other operational matters and expose us to other risks associated with acquisitions.\nWe continually evaluate potential acquisitions and consider acquisitions an important part of our future growth strategy. In the past, we have made acquisitions of, or significant investments in, other businesses with synergistic products, services and technologies and plan to continue to do so in the future. Acquisitions, including our acquisition of R2D, SoLayTec and BTU, involve numerous risks, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\ndifficulties and increased costs in connection with integration of geographically diverse personnel,\noperations, technologies and products of acquired companies;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management's attention from other operational matters;\n\u2022\nthe potential loss of our key employees and the key employees of acquired companies;\n\u2022\nthe potential loss of our key customers and suppliers and the key customers and suppliers of acquired companies;\n\u2022\ndisagreement with joint venture or strategic alliance partners;\n\u2022\nfailure to comply with laws and regulations as well as industry or technical standards of the overseas markets into which we expand;\n\u2022\nour inability to achieve the intended cost efficiency, level of profitability or other intended strategic goals for the acquisitions, strategic investments, joint ventures or other strategic alliances;\n\u2022\nlack of synergy, or inability to realize expected synergies, resulting from the acquisition;\n\u2022\nthe risk that the issuance of our common stock, if any, in an acquisition or merger could be dilutive to our shareholders, if anticipated synergies are not realized;\n\u2022\nacquired assets becoming impaired as a result of technological advancements or worse-than-expected\nperformance of the acquired company;\n\u2022\ninability to complete proposed transactions as anticipated or at all and any ensuing obligation to pay a termination fee and any other associated transaction expenses;\n\u2022\nthe potential impact of the announcement or consummation of a proposed transaction on relationships with third parties;\n\u2022\npotential changes in our credit rating, which could adversely impact the Company\u2019s access to and cost of capital;\n\u2022\npotential litigation brought against the Company that may arise in connection with an acquisition;\n\u2022\nreductions in cash balances and/or increases in debt obligations to finance activities associated with a transaction, which reduce the availability of cash flow for general corporate or other purposes;\n\u2022\ninadequacy or ineffectiveness of an acquired company\u2019s internal financial controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and/or environmental, health and safety, anti-corruption, human resource, or other policies or practices; and\n\u2022\nunknown, underestimated and/or undisclosed commitments or liabilities.\nOur financial position and results of operations may be materially harmed if our R&D investments do not result in timely new products that can be sold at favorable prices and obtain market acceptance.\nThe rapid change in technology in our industry requires that we continue to make investments in research and development in order to enhance the performance, functionality and cost of ownership of our products to keep pace with competitive products and to satisfy customer demands for improved performance, features and functionality. There can be no assurance that revenue from future products or enhancements will be sufficient to recover the development costs associated with such products or enhancements, or that we will be able to secure the financial resources necessary to fund future development. Research and development costs are typically incurred before we confirm the technical feasibility and commercial viability of a product, and not all development activities result in commercially viable products. We cannot ensure that products or enhancements will receive market acceptance, or that we will be able to sell these products at prices that are favorable to us. In addition, from time to time we receive funding from government agencies for certain strategic development programs to increase our research and development resources and address new market opportunities. As a condition to this government funding, we may be subject to certain record-keeping, audit, intellectual property rights-sharing and/or other obligations. If we do not successfully manage risks resulting from diversification and entry into new markets and industries, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nIf we fail to maintain optimal inventory levels, our inventory obsolescence costs could increase, our liquidity could be significantly reduced or our revenue could decrease, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWhile we must maintain sufficient inventory levels to operate our business successfully and meet our customers' demands, accumulating excess inventory may have a significant unfavorable impact on our operating results and financial condition. Changing customer demands, supplier lead-times and uncertainty surrounding new product launches expose us to risks associated with excess inventory or shortages. Demand for products can change rapidly and unexpectedly. Our products are manufactured using a wide variety of purchased parts and raw materials and we must maintain sufficient inventory levels to meet the demand for the products we sell. During peak years in the solar and semiconductor industries, increases in demand for capital equipment results in longer lead-times for many important system components. Future increases in demand could cause delays in meeting shipments to our customers. Because of the variability and uniqueness of customer orders, we try to avoid maintaining an extensive inventory of materials for manufacturing. However, long lead-times for important system components during industry upturns sometimes require us to carry higher levels of inventory and make larger purchase commitments than we would otherwise make. We may be unable to sell sufficient quantities of products in the event that market demand changes, resulting in increased risk of excess inventory that could lead to obsolescence or reduced liquidity as we fulfill our purchase commitments. On the other hand, if we do not have a sufficient inventory of a product to fulfill customer orders, we may lose orders or customers, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot assure that we can accurately predict market demand and events to avoid inventory shortages or inventories and purchase commitments in excess of our current requirements.\nSupplier capacity constraints, supplier production disruptions, supplier quality issues or price increases could increase our operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of our products.\nWe use a wide range of materials and services in the production of our products including custom electronic and mechanical components, and we use numerous suppliers of materials. Although we make what we believe are reasonable efforts to ensure that parts are available from multiple suppliers, this may not always be practical or possible. Accordingly, some key parts are being procured from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers. Key vendors include suppliers of controllers, quartz and silicon carbide for our diffusion systems, two steel mills capable of producing the types of steel to the tolerances needed for our wafer carriers, an injection molder that molds plastic inserts into our steel carriers, an adhesive manufacturer that supplies the critical glue and a pad supplier that produces a unique material used in the manufacture of our polishing templates. We also rely on third parties for certain machined parts, steel frames and metal panels and other components used particularly in the assembly of solar and semiconductor production equipment.\nBecause the selling price of some of our systems exceeds $1.0 million, the delay in the shipment of even a single system could cause significant variations in our quarterly revenue. In the event of supplier capacity constraints, production disruptions, or failure to meet our requirements concerning quality, cost or performance factors, we may transfer our business to alternative sourcing which could lead to further delays, additional costs or other difficulties. If, in the future, we do not receive, in a timely and cost-effective manner, a sufficient quantity and quality of parts to meet our production requirements, our financial position and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nIf the practice of requiring certain customers to make advance payments when they place orders with us ceases, or if our customers fail to meet their payment obligations, we may experience increased needs to finance our working capital requirements and may be exposed to increased credit risk, which may materially and adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.\nWe require many of our customers to make an advance payment representing a percentage of their orders, which is a business practice that helps us manage our accounts receivable, prepay our suppliers and reduce the amount of funds that we need to finance our working capital requirements. We cannot assure that this practice will not cease in the future. If this practice ceases, we may not be able to secure additional financing on a timely basis or on terms acceptable to us or at all. Currently, a significant portion of our revenue is derived from credit sales to our customers, generally with payments due within less than three months after shipment. As a result, any future decrease in the use of cash advance payments by our customers may negatively impact our short-term liquidity and, coupled with increased credit sales to a small number of major customers, expose us to additional and more concentrated credit risk since a significant portion of our outstanding accounts receivable is derived from sales to a limited number of customers. We may need to, from time to time, commence legal proceedings to recover accounts receivables from customers, which may also increase our cost. Any failure by our customers to settle outstanding accounts receivable in the future could materially and adversely affect our cash flow, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows or obtain access to external financing necessary to fund and expand our operations as planned.\nCash flows may be insufficient to provide adequate working capital in the future and we may require additional financing for further implementation of our growth plans. There is no assurance that any additional financing will be available if and when required, or, even if available, that it would not materially dilute the ownership percentage of the then existing shareholders, result in increased expenses or result in covenants or special rights that would restrict our operations.\nWe may incur impairment charges to goodwill or long-lived assets.\nWe have acquired, and may acquire in the future, goodwill and other long-lived intangible assets. Goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment at least annually, typically during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, and more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. The review compares the fair value for each of our reporting units to its associated carrying value, including goodwill. Factors that could lead to impairment of goodwill and intangible assets include adverse industry or economic trends, reduced estimates of future cash flows, declines in the market price of our common stock, changes in our strategies or product portfolio, and restructuring activities. Our valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and projections of future operating performance. We may be required to record a charge to earnings during the period in which an impairment of goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined to exist, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nMost of our production, storage, and administrative facilities are located in close proximity to one another in The Netherlands. Any damage or disruption at these facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur production, storage and administrative facilities are located in close proximity to one another in The Netherlands. A natural disaster or other unanticipated catastrophic event, including flood, power interruption, and war, could significantly disrupt our ability to manufacture our products and operate our business. If any of our productions facilities or equipment were to experience any significant damage or downtime, we would be unable to meet our production targets, our business would suffer, and it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf third parties violate our proprietary rights, in which we have made significant investments, such events could result in a loss of value of some of our intellectual property or costly litigation.\nOur success is dependent in part on our technology and other proprietary rights. We own various United States and international patents and have additional pending patent applications relating to some of our products and technologies. Protecting and defending our patents domestically, and especially internationally, is costly. In addition, the process of seeking patent protection is lengthy and expensive. Therefore, we cannot be certain that pending or future applications will actually result in issued patents, or that issued patents will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or commercial advantage to us. Other companies and individuals, including our larger competitors, may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology or design around the patents we own or license. We also maintain trademarks on certain of our products and claim copyright protection for certain proprietary software and documentation. However, we can give no assurance that our trademarks and copyrights will be upheld or will successfully deter infringement by third parties. The patent covering technology that we license and use in our manufacture of insert carriers has expired, which may have the effect of diminishing or eliminating any competitive advantage we may have with respect to this manufacturing process.\nWe attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through confidentiality agreements with our customers, suppliers, employees and consultants and through other security measures. We also maintain exclusive and non-exclusive licenses with third parties for the technology used in certain products. However, these employees, consultants and third parties may breach these agreements, and we may not have adequate remedies for wrongdoing. In addition, the laws of certain territories, such as China, in which we develop, manufacture or sell our products may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States.\nWe may face intellectual property infringement claims that could be time-consuming and costly to defend and could result in our loss of significant rights and the assessment of treble damages.\nFrom time to time, we have received communications from other parties asserting the existence of patent rights or other intellectual property rights that they believe cover certain of our products, processes, technologies or information. In such cases, we evaluate our position and consider the available alternatives, which may include seeking licenses to use the technology in question on commercially reasonable terms or defending our position. We cannot ensure that licenses can be obtained, or if obtained will be on acceptable terms, or that litigation or other administrative proceedings will not occur.\nSome of these claims may lead to litigation. We cannot assure that we will prevail in these actions, or that other actions alleging misappropriation or misuse by us of third-party trade secrets, infringement by us of third-party patents and trademarks or the validity of our patents, will not be asserted or prosecuted against us. Intellectual property litigation, regardless of outcome, is expensive and time-consuming, could divert management's attention from our business and have a material negative effect on our business, operating results or financial condition. If there is a successful claim of infringement against us, we may be required to pay substantial damages (including treble damages if we were to be found to have willfully infringed a third party's patent) to the party claiming infringement, incur costs to develop non-infringing technology, stop selling or using technology that contains the allegedly infringing intellectual property or, enter into royalty or license agreements that may not be available on acceptable or commercially practical terms, if at all. Our failure to develop non-infringing technologies or license the proprietary rights on a timely basis could harm our business. Parties making infringement claims on future issued patents may be able to obtain an injunction that would prevent us from selling or using our technology that contains the allegedly infringing intellectual property, which could harm our business.\nFailure to manage our growth, or otherwise develop appropriate internal organizational structures, internal control environment and risk monitoring and management systems in line with the size of our organization could result in a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business and operations have expanded rapidly through organic growth and acquisitions, as well as successfully managed frequent cyclical contractions. Significant management resources must be expended to develop and implement appropriate structures for internal organization and information flow, an effective internal control environment and risk monitoring and management systems in line with our fast growth as well as to hire and integrate qualified employees into our organization. It is challenging for us to hire, integrate and retain qualified employees in key areas of operations, such as engineers and technicians who are familiar with the industries. In addition, disclosure and other ongoing obligations associated with being a public company further increase the challenges to our finance, legal and accounting team. It is possible that our existing risk monitoring and management system could prove to be inadequate. If we fail to appropriately develop and implement structures for internal organization and information flow, an effective internal control environment and a risk monitoring and management system, we may not be able to identify unfavorable business trends, administrative oversights or other risks that could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, our stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting, which could have a negative impact on our business and the price of our common stock.\nTo maintain compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 we have assessed, strengthened and tested our system of internal controls. Despite our conclusion that our system of internal controls was effective as of September 30, 2016, we must continue to maintain our processes and systems and adapt them to changes in our business as it evolves. This continuous process of maintaining and adapting our internal controls and complying with Section 404 is expensive, time-consuming and requires significant management attention. We cannot be certain that our internal control measures will continue to provide adequate control over our financial reporting processes and ensure compliance with Section 404. Furthermore, as our business changes, our internal controls may become more complex and we may require significantly more resources to ensure our internal controls remain effective. In addition, if we reduce a portion of our workforce, as we have done recently, our ability to adequately maintain our internal controls may be adversely impacted. Failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. If we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify material weaknesses, the disclosure of that fact may result in negative investor perceptions of our Company and could cause a decline in the market price of our stock.\nUnsatisfactory performance of, or defects in our products may cause us to incur additional warranty expenses, damage our reputation and cause our sales to decline.\nAs of September 30, 2016, 2015 and 2014, our accrued warranty costs amounted to $0.8 million, $0.8 million and $0.6 million, respectively. Our assumptions regarding the durability and reliability of our products may not be accurate, and because our products have relatively long warranty periods, we cannot assure you that the amount of accrued warranty by us for our products will be adequate in light of the actual performance of our products. If we experience a significant increase in warranty claims, we may incur significant repair and replacement costs associated with such claims. Furthermore, widespread product underperformances or failures will damage our reputation and customer relationships and may cause our sales to decline, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe face the risk of product liability claims or other litigation, which could be expensive and may divert management's attention from running our business.\nThe Company and its subsidiaries are defendants from time to time in actions for matters arising out of our business operations. The manufacture and sale of our products, which, in our customers' operations, involve toxic materials and robotic machinery, involve the risk of product liability claims. In addition, a failure of one of our products at a customer site could interrupt the business operations of our customer. Our existing insurance coverage limits may not be adequate to protect us from all liabilities that we might incur in connection with the manufacture and sale of our products if a successful product liability claim or series of product liability claims were brought against us. We may also be involved in other legal proceedings or claims and experience threats of legal action from time to time in the ordinary course of our business.\nWhere appropriate, we intend to vigorously defend all claims. However, any actual or threatened claims, even if not meritorious or material, could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources. The continued defense of these claims and other types of lawsuits could divert management's attention away from running our business. In addition, required amounts to be paid in settlement of any claims, and the legal fees and other costs associated with their defense or also settlement, cannot be estimated and could, individually or in the aggregate, materially harm our financial condition. We may also experience higher than expected warranty claims.\nWe are subject to environmental regulations, and our inability or failure to comply with these regulations could result in significant costs or the suspension of our ability to operate portions of our business.\nWe are subject to environmental regulations in connection with our business operations, including regulations related to manufacturing and our customers' use of our products. From time to time, we receive notices regarding these regulations. It is our policy to respond promptly to these notices and to take any necessary corrective action. Our failure or inability to comply with existing or future environmental regulations could result in significant remediation liabilities, the imposition of fines and/or the suspension or termination of development, manufacturing or use of certain of our products or facilities, each of which could damage our financial position and results of operations.\nRegulations related to conflict minerals could adversely impact our business.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act contains provisions to improve transparency and accountability concerning the supply of certain minerals, known as conflict minerals, originating from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and adjoining countries. As a result, the SEC has adopted annual disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies who use conflict minerals mined from the DRC and adjoining countries in their products. These new requirements require companies to conduct due diligence efforts to determine whether products contain such conflict minerals, with initial disclosure requirements beginning in May of 2014. Our supply chain is complex and we may be unable to verify the origins for all metals used in our products. As a result, we may be unable to certify that our products are conflict mineral free.\nOur results of operations are difficult to predict, and if we do not meet the market expectations, the price of the our stock will likely decline.\nOur results of operations are difficult to predict and have fluctuated from time to time in the past. We expect that our results of operations may continue to fluctuate from time to time in the future. It is possible that our results of operations in some reporting periods will be below market expectations. If our results of operations for a particular reporting period are lower than the market expectations for such reporting period, investors may react negatively, and as a result, the price of our stock may materially decline.\nInformation security breaches or failures of our information technology systems may have a negative impact on our operations and our reputation.\nWe may be subject to information security breaches or failures of our information technology systems caused by advanced persistent threats, unauthorized access, sabotage, vandalism, terrorism or accident. Compromises and failure to our information technology networks and systems could result in unauthorized release of our confidential or proprietary information, or that of our customers and suppliers, as well as employee personal data. The costs to protect against or alleviate breaches and systems failures require significant human and financial capital expenditures, which in turn could potentially disrupt our continuing operations, increase our liability as a result of compromises to personally identifiable information, and may lead to a material and adverse effect on our financial reporting, reputation and business.\nThe Company's income taxes are subject to variables beyond our control.\nThe Company's net income and cash flow may be adversely affected by conditions affecting income taxes which are outside the Company's control. Examples of the potential uncontrollable circumstances that could affect our tax rate:\n\u2022\nThe Company sells and operates globally in the United States, Europe and Asia. Disagreement could occur on the jurisdiction of income and taxation among different governmental tax authorities. Potential areas of dispute may include transfer pricing, intercompany charges and intercompany balances.\n\u2022\nThe Company is subject to a China withholding tax on certain non-tangible charges made under our transfer pricing agreements. The interpretation of what charges are subject to the tax and when the liability for the tax occurs has varied and could change in the future.\n\u2022\nTax rates may increase and, therefore, have a material adverse effect on our earnings and cash flows.\nSecurities litigation brought against the Company, including litigation related to the BTU acquisition could cause the Company to incur substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention and resources.\nIn the past, securities class action litigation often has been brought against a Company following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities or in connection with strategic transactions. The Company may in the future be the target of securities litigation. Any securities litigation could result in substantial costs and could divert the attention and resources of the Company\u2019s management.\nAs previously disclosed in the Company\u2019s filings with the SEC, shortly after the Company entered into the merger agreement with BTU, two separate putative stockholder class action complaints (together, the \"Stockholder Actions\") were filed in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the \"Delaware Court\"). The first was filed on November 4, 2014 and the second on November 17, 2014, on behalf of BTU\u2019s public stockholders, against BTU, members of the BTU board, Amtech and the special purpose merger subsidiary. The Stockholder Actions were consolidated on December 4, 2014. The complaints generally alleged that, in connection with entering into the merger agreement, the BTU board of directors breached certain fiduciary duties owed to BTU's stockholders. The complaints sought various forms of declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as compensatory damages.\nOn February 18, 2016, the Delaware Court entered the Order approving the Amended Stipulation of Settlement. As a result, the Released Claims were dismissed with prejudice and without any admission of wrongdoing by any of the parties to the Stockholder Actions. Pursuant to the Amended Stipulation of Settlement, BTU, its insurer(s), or its successor(s) in interest are responsible for payment of fees and expenses in the amount of $325,000 which were paid in full on April 1, 2016.\nAs described above, the Released Claims are limited solely to claims related to any disclosures (or lack thereof) to BTU\u2019s stockholders concerning the merger and any fiduciary claims concerning the decision to enter into the merger. While we are currently unaware of any other pending or threatened litigation related to additional claims arising from the Stockholder Actions, any future claims are uncertain, so additional harm could potentially result to the Company from this litigation, which may cause the Company to incur substantial costs and divert management\u2019s attention from operational matters.\nOur officers, directors, and largest stockholders could choose to act in their best interests and not necessarily those of our other stockholders.\nOur directors, executive officers and holders of five percent or more of our outstanding common stock and their affiliates represent a significant portion of our common stock held as of September 30, 2016, and, therefore, have significant influence over the management and corporate policies of the Company. These stockholders have significant influence over all matters submitted to our stockholders, including the election of our directors and approval of business combinations, and could potentially initiate or delay, deter or prevent a change of control of our Company. Circumstances may occur in which the interests of these stockholders may conflict with the interests of the Company or those of our other stockholders, and these stockholders may cause the Company to take actions that align with their interests. Should conflicts of interest arise, we can provide no assurance that these stockholders would act in the best interests of our other stockholders or that any conflicts of interest would be resolved in a manner favorable to our other stockholders. In addition, involvement of certain activist stockholders may impact our ability to recruit and retain talent or otherwise distract management or make decisions that we believe are in the long-term interest of all shareholders.", "PERMNO": 65008, "SIC": 3559, "TIC": "ASYS"}
