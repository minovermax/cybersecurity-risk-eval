Because of the following factors, as well as other variables affecting our operating results and financial condition, past performance may not be a reliable indicator of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. We operate in a continually changing business environment, and new risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time. Management cannot predict such new risks and uncertainties, nor can it assess the extent to which any of the risk factors below or any such new risks and uncertainties, or any combination thereof, may impact our business. The following risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information and risks set forth herein.\nRisks Related to the Semiconductor Industry\nThere is ongoing volatility in the semiconductor equipment industry.\nThe semiconductor equipment industry is highly cyclical and volatile. As such, demand for, and the profitability of, our products can change significantly from period to period as a result of numerous factors, including the following:\n\u2022\nchanges in global and regional economic conditions;\n\u2022\nthe shift of semiconductor production to Asia, where there often is increased price competition;\n\u2022\ntariffs, quotas and international trade barriers;\n\u2022\nchanges in capacity utilization and production volume of manufacturers of semiconductors, silicon wafers and MEMS;\n\u2022\nthe profitability and capital resources of those manufacturers; and\n\u2022\nchallenges associated with marketing and selling manufacturing equipment and services to a diverse and diffuse customer base.\nFor these and other reasons, our results of operations for past periods may not be indicative of future operating results. In addition, as we announced in April 2019, we are focused on exiting the Solar business segment in order to focus our strategic efforts on our semiconductor and silicon carbide/polishing business segments. While these efforts remain ongoing, we expect our results of operations for past periods related to our Solar business segment will not be indicative of our future operating results.\nThe purchasing decisions of our customers are highly dependent on their capacity utilization, which changes when new facilities are put into production and with the level of demand for our products, as well as their company\u2019s capital expenditure budget. Purchasing decisions are also impacted by changes in the economies of the countries which our customers serve, as well as the state of the worldwide industries in which we operate or expect to operate in the future. The timing, length and severity of the up-and-down cycles in the semiconductor equipment industry are difficult to predict. Additionally, we generally experience a one-to-two quarter lag between upturns/downturns experienced by larger equipment manufacturers. The cyclical nature of our marketplace affects our ability to accurately budget our expense levels, which are based in part on our projections of future revenue.\nWhen cyclical fluctuations result in lower than expected revenue levels, operating results are adversely affected. Cost reduction measures may be necessary in order for us to remain competitive and financially sound. During a down cycle, our operating results may be adversely affected if we are unable to make timely adjustments to our cost and expense structure to correspond to the prevailing market conditions; effectively manage the supply chain; and motivate and retain key employees. In addition, during periods of rapid growth, our operating results may be adversely affected if we are unable to increase manufacturing capacity and personnel to meet customer demand, which may require additional liquidity. We can provide no assurance that we can timely and effectively respond to the industry cycles, and our failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe semiconductor equipment industry is highly competitive and, because we are relatively small in size and have fewer financial and other resources compared to our competitors, we may not be able to compete successfully with them.\nOur industry includes large manufacturers with substantial resources to support customers worldwide. Our future performance depends, in part, upon our ability to continue to compete successfully in these markets. Some of our competitors are diversified companies with extensive financial resources and research, engineering, manufacturing, marketing and customer service and support capabilities that are greater than ours. We face competition from companies whose strategy is to provide a broad array of products, some of which compete with the products and services we offer. These competitors may bundle their products in a manner that discourages customers from purchasing our products. In addition, we face competition from emerging semiconductor equipment companies whose strategy is to provide a portion of the products and services that we offer often at a lower price than ours and use innovative technology to sell products into specialized markets. We also face competition from Chinese equipment manufacturers that may receive greater support than we do from Chinese customers and governmental agencies because they are locally based. Our local Chinese competitors may offer lower prices and more liberal payment terms than ours. Loss of our competitive position due to any of these factors could impair our prices, customer orders, revenue, gross margin and market share, any of which would negatively affect our financial position and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Our Operations\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash flows or obtain access to external financing necessary to fund existing operations and planned expansions.\nCash flows may be insufficient to provide adequate working capital in the future and we may require additional financing for further implementation of our growth plans. There is no assurance that any additional financing will be available if and when required, or, even if available, that it would not materially dilute the ownership percentage of our then existing shareholders, result in increased expenses or result in covenants or special rights that would restrict our operations.\nWe may not be able to find a buyer for our solar assets.\nIn April 2019, we announced our intent to divest all of our operations in the Netherlands, which comprise the majority of our Solar segment, as we plan to focus on our Semiconductor and SiC/LED operations. There can be no assurances that we will be able to timely complete a sale of our Solar segment or otherwise find a buyer for these assets, or, if we do complete a sale transaction, that it will be on terms acceptable to the Company. If we are unable to locate a buyer, we will have to seek other strategic alternatives, which may include an auction of our solar business assets, suspending or winding down operations or the discontinued operations may file for bankruptcy. It is not possible to predict the outcome of any suspension, winding down or bankruptcy proceeding that may be required.\nThe failure to successfully implement cost reduction initiatives through our restructuring activities, could materially adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nAs noted immediately above, in April 2019, we announced our intent to divest all of our operations in the Netherlands, which comprised the majority of our Solar segment. In June 2019, we announced that we had completed the sale of our subsidiary, SoLayTec, to a third party located in the Netherlands. We expect to complete a sale of R2D in the first quarter of fiscal 2020. These restructuring initiatives are being made, in part, in response to significant challenges in the solar industry. We cannot assure you that our restructuring initiatives will be successfully or timely implemented or that they will materially and positively impact our profitability. Because our restructuring activities involve changes to many aspects of our business, the associated cost reductions could materially adversely impact productivity and sales to an extent we have not anticipated. Even if we fully execute and implement these activities and they generate the anticipated cost savings, there may be other unforeseeable and unintended consequences that could materially adversely impact our profitability and business, including unintended employee attrition or harm to our competitive position. To the extent that we do not achieve the profitability enhancement or other benefits of restructuring initiatives that we anticipate, our results of operations may be materially adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to manage the business successfully through severe business cycles.\nWe may be unable to successfully expand or contract our business to meet fluctuating demands. Market fluctuations place significant strain on our management, personnel, systems and resources. In fiscal years 2010 and 2011, we purchased additional equipment and real estate to significantly expand our manufacturing capacity and hired additional employees to support an increase in manufacturing, field service, research and development and sales and marketing efforts. Over the past several years, the rapid decline in demand caused us to reduce headcount in manufacturing and field service and to reduce certain research and development costs. To successfully manage our growth through such market fluctuations, we believe we must effectively:\n\u2022\nmaintain the appropriate number and mix of permanent, part-time, temporary and contract employees to meet the fluctuating demand for our products;\n\u2022\ntrain, integrate and manage personnel, particularly process engineers, field service engineers, sales and marketing personnel, and financial and information technology personnel to maintain and improve skills and morale;\n\u2022\nretain key management and augment our management team, particularly if we lose key members;\n\u2022\ncontinue to enhance our customer resource and manufacturing management systems to maintain high levels of customer satisfaction and efficiencies, including inventory control;\n\u2022\nimplement and improve existing and new administrative, financial and operations systems, procedures and controls;\n\u2022\nexpand and upgrade our technological capabilities; and\n\u2022\nmanage multiple relationships with our customers, suppliers and other third parties.\nWe may encounter difficulties in effectively managing the budgeting, forecasting and other process control issues presented by rapidly changing business cycles. If we are unable to manage these cycles effectively, we may not be able to take advantage of market opportunities, develop new technologies and other products, satisfy customer requirements, execute our business plan or respond to competitive pressures.\nAcquisitions can result in an increase in our operating costs, divert management\u2019s attention away from other operational matters and expose us to other risks.\nWe continually evaluate potential acquisitions and consider acquisitions an important part of our future growth strategy, including, in particular, in connection with our new focus on our silicon carbide business segment. In the past, we have made acquisitions of, or significant investments in, other businesses with synergistic products, services and technologies and plan to continue to do so in the future. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\ndifficulties and increased costs in connection with integration of geographically diverse personnel,\n\u2022\noperations, technologies and products;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from other operational matters;\n\u2022\nthe potential loss of our key employees and the key employees of acquired companies;\n\u2022\nthe potential loss of our key customers and suppliers and the key customers and suppliers of acquired companies;\n\u2022\ndisagreement with joint venture or strategic alliance partners;\n\u2022\nfailure to comply with laws and regulations as well as industry or technical standards of the overseas markets into which we expand;\n\u2022\nour inability to achieve the intended cost efficiency, level of profitability or other intended strategic goals for the acquisitions, strategic investments, joint ventures or other strategic alliances;\n\u2022\nlack of synergy, or inability to realize expected synergies, resulting from the acquisition;\n\u2022\nthe possibility that the issuance of our common stock, if any, in an acquisition or merger could be dilutive to our shareholders;\n\u2022\nimpairment of acquired assets as a result of technological advancements or worse-than-expected performance of the acquired company;\n\u2022\ninability to complete proposed transactions as anticipated or at all and any ensuing obligation to pay a termination fee and any other associated transaction expenses;\n\u2022\nthe potential impact of the announcement or consummation of a proposed transaction on relationships with third parties;\n\u2022\npotential changes in our credit rating, which could adversely impact our access to and cost of capital;\n\u2022\npotential litigation that may arise in connection with an acquisition;\n\u2022\nreductions in cash balances and/or increases in debt obligations to finance activities associated with a transaction, which reduce the availability of cash flow for general corporate or other purposes;\n\u2022\ninadequacy or ineffectiveness of an acquired company\u2019s internal financial controls, disclosure controls and procedures, and/or environmental, health and safety, anti-corruption, human resource or other policies or practices; and\n\u2022\nunknown, underestimated and/or undisclosed commitments or liabilities.\nNo assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully complete future strategic acquisitions if we cannot reach agreement on acceptable terms or for other reasons. We may have to incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for any future acquisitions, the issuance of which could involve the imposition of restrictive covenants or be dilutive to our existing shareholders.\nOur reliance on sales to a few major customers, often on credit terms, places us at financial risk.\nWe currently sell to a relatively small number of customers and expect to do so for the foreseeable future. Therefore, our operating results depend on the ability of these customers to sell products that require our equipment in their manufacture. Many of our customer relationships have developed over a short period of time and certain ones are in the early stages of development. The loss of sales to any of these customers would have a significant negative impact on our business. Additionally, our customers cancel their agreements with us if we fail to meet certain product specifications, materially breach agreements or encounter insolvency or bankruptcy. They also may seek to renegotiate the terms of current agreements or renewals. We cannot be certain our existing customers will generate significant revenue for us in the future or that these new customer relationships will continue to develop. If we are unable to expand our customer base, we may not be able to maintain or increase our revenue.\nAs of September 30, 2019, one Semiconductor customer individually represented 15% of our accounts receivable. As of September 30, 2018, one Semiconductor customer individually represented 16% of our accounts receivable. A concentration of our receivables from one or a small number of customers places us at risk. In such a scenario, a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any of our customers that purchase large systems could have a material impact on the collectability of our accounts receivable and our future operating results. We attempt to manage this credit risk by performing credit checks, by requiring significant partial payments prior to shipment, where appropriate, and by actively monitoring collections. We also require letters of credit from certain customers depending on the size of the order, type of customer or its creditworthiness and its country of domicile. Our major customers may seek and, on occasion, may receive pricing, payment, intellectual property-related or other commercial terms that are less favorable to us than the current terms we customarily obtain. If any one or more of our major customers were to re-negotiate their agreements on more favorable terms, or not pay us or continue business with us, it could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to require certain customers to make advance payments when they place orders with us, or if our customers fail to meet their payment obligations, we may experience increased needs to finance our working capital requirements and may be exposed to increased credit risk.\nWe require many of our customers to make an advance payment representing a percentage of their orders, which is a business practice that helps us manage our accounts receivable, prepay our suppliers and reduce the amount of funds that we need to meet our working capital requirements. We cannot assure that this practice will continue in the future. If this practice ceases, we may not be able to secure additional financing on a timely basis or on terms acceptable to us or at all. Currently, a significant portion of our revenue is derived from credit sales to our customers, generally with payments due within less than three months after shipment. As a result, any future decrease in the use of cash advance payments by our customers may negatively impact our short-term liquidity and expose us to additional and more concentrated credit risk. From time to time, we also may need to commence legal proceedings to recover accounts receivables from customers, which would increase our expenses. Any failure by our customers to settle outstanding accounts receivable in the future could materially and adversely affect our cash flow, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur customers could cancel or fail to accept a large system order.\nOur backlog includes orders for large systems, such as our diffusion furnaces, with system prices of up to and in excess of $1.0 million, depending on the system configuration, options and any special requirements of the customer. Some orders include multiple systems. Because our orders are typically subject to cancellation or delay by the customer, our backlog at any particular point in time is not necessarily representative of actual sales for succeeding periods, nor is backlog any assurance that we will realize revenue or profit from completing these orders. Our financial position and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected should any large systems order be canceled prior to shipment or not be accepted by the customer. Cancellations may result in inventory that we may not be able to sell or reuse if those products have been tailored for a specific customer\u2019s requirements and cannot then be sold without significant incremental cost. We have experienced cancellations in the past. We cannot provide any assurance that we will realize revenue or profit from our backlog.\nManufacturing interruptions or delays could affect our ability to meet customer demand and lead to higher costs.\nOur business depends on timely supply of equipment, services and related products that meet the rapidly changing technical and volume requirements of our customers. Some key parts to our products are subject to long lead times and/or are obtainable only from a single supplier or limited group of suppliers. Cyclical industry conditions and the volatility of demand for manufacturing equipment increase capital, technical, operational and other risks for us and for companies throughout our supply chain. Further, these conditions may cause some suppliers to scale back operations, exit businesses, merge with other companies, file for bankruptcy protection or possibly cease operations. We also may experience significant interruptions of our manufacturing operations, delays in our ability to deliver products or services, increased costs or customer order cancellations as a result of any of the following:\n\u2022\nthe failure or inability of suppliers to timely deliver sufficient quantities of quality parts on a cost-effective basis;\n\u2022\nvolatility in the availability and cost of materials, including rare earth elements;\n\u2022\ndifficulties or delays in obtaining required import or export approvals;\n\u2022\ninformation technology or infrastructure failures; and\n\u2022\nnatural disasters or other events beyond our control (such as earthquakes, floods or storms, regional economic downturns, pandemics, social unrest, political instability, terrorism, or acts of war), particularly where we conduct manufacturing operations.\nBecause we depend on revenue from international customers, our business may be adversely affected by changes in the economies and policies of the countries or regions in which we do business.\nDuring fiscal 2018, 76% of our net revenue came from customers outside of North America. During fiscal 2019, 59% of our net revenue came from customers outside of North America as follows:\n\u2022\nAsia - 41% (including China - 18%, Malaysia - 5% and Taiwan - 10%); and\n\u2022\nEurope - 18%\nEach geographic region in the markets in which we operate exhibits unique characteristics that can cause capital equipment investment patterns to vary significantly from period to period. Our business and results of operations could be negatively affected by periodic local or international economic downturns, trade balance issues and political, social and military instability in countries such as China, India, South Korea, Taiwan and possibly elsewhere. In addition, we face competition from a number of suppliers based in Asia that have certain advantages over suppliers from outside of Asia. These advantages include lower operating, shipping and regulatory costs, proximity to customers, favorable tariffs and other government policies that favor local suppliers. Additionally, the marketing and sale of our products to international markets expose us to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nincreased costs associated with maintaining the ability to understand the local markets and follow their trends and customs, as well as developing and maintaining an effective marketing and distributing presence;\n\u2022\nlimitations on our ability to require advance payments from our customers;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in providing customer service and support in local markets;\n\u2022\ndifficulty in staffing and managing overseas operations;\n\u2022\nlonger sales cycles and time collection periods;\n\u2022\nfewer or weaker legal protections for our intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nfailure to develop appropriate risk management and internal control structures tailored to overseas operations;\n\u2022\ndifficulty and costs relating to compliance with the different or changing commercial and legal requirements of our overseas markets;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange and interest rates;\n\u2022\nfailure to obtain or maintain certifications for our products or services in these markets; and\n\u2022\ninternational trade barriers such as export requirements, tariffs, taxes and other restrictions and expenses.\nOur business may be adversely affected by significant exchange rate fluctuations.\nThough our business has not been materially affected in the past by currency fluctuations, there is a risk that it may be materially adversely affected in the future, especially as we continue to expand operations into other countries. Such risk includes possible losses due to currency exchange rate fluctuations, future prohibitions against repatriation of earnings, or proceeds from disposition of investments.\nWe are exposed to risks associated with an uncertain global economy.\nUncertain global economic conditions and slowing growth in China, Europe and the United States, along with difficulties in the financial markets, national debt concerns and government austerity measures in certain regions, pose challenges to the industries in which we operate. Related factors, including unemployment, inflation and fuel prices, exacerbate negative trends in business and consumer spending and may cause our customers to delay, cancel, or refrain from placing orders for equipment or services. These actions may, in turn, reduce our net sales, reduce backlog, and affect our ability to convert backlog to sales. Uncertain market conditions, difficulties in obtaining capital, or reduced profitability also may cause some customers to scale back operations, exit businesses, merge with other manufacturers, or file for bankruptcy protection and potentially cease operations, which can result in lower sales and/or additional inventory or bad debt expense for us. These conditions may similarly affect key suppliers, impairing their ability to deliver parts and potentially causing delays or added costs for delivery of our products. In addition, these conditions may lead to strategic alliances by, or consolidation of, other equipment manufacturers, which could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively. Uncertainty about future economic and industry conditions also makes it more challenging for us to forecast our operating results, make business decisions, and identify and prioritize the risks that may affect our businesses, sources and uses of cash, financial condition and results of operations. We may be required to implement additional cost reduction efforts, including restructuring activities, and/or modify our business model, which may adversely affect our ability to capitalize on opportunities in a market recovery. If we do not timely and appropriately adapt to changes resulting from these uncertain macroeconomic environment and industry conditions, or to difficulties in the financial markets, our business, financial condition and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe are dependent on key personnel for our business and product development and sales.\nHistorically, our relationships with key customers and partners have depended on personal relations and other contacts established by certain of our executive officers. Though we cannot assure that such relationships will continue, such cooperation is expected to continue to be a significant element in our future development efforts.\nFurthermore, it may not be feasible for any successor to maintain the same business relationships that our executive officers have established. While we are the beneficiary of a life insurance policy on the life of our Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. Whang, there is no assurance that such insurance will be sufficient to cover the cost of finding and hiring a suitable replacement for Mr. Whang. If we were to lose the services of Mr. Whang for any reason, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe also depend on the management efforts of our officers and other key personnel and on our ability to attract and retain key personnel. During times of strong economic growth, competition is intense for highly-skilled employees. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel or that we can avoid increased costs in order to do so. There can be no assurance that employees will not leave Amtech or compete against us. Our failure to attract additional qualified employees, or to retain the services of key personnel, could negatively impact our financial position and results of operations.\nIf we fail to maintain optimal inventory levels, our inventory obsolescence costs could increase, our liquidity could be significantly reduced or our revenue could decrease.\nWhile we must maintain sufficient inventory levels to operate our business successfully and meet our customers\u2019 demands, accumulating excess inventory may have a significant unfavorable impact on our operating results and financial condition. Changing customer demands, supplier lead times and uncertainty surrounding new product launches expose us to risks associated with excess inventory or shortages. Our products are manufactured using a wide variety of purchased parts and raw materials and we must maintain sufficient inventory levels to meet the demand for the products we sell, which can change rapidly and unexpectedly. During peak years of our business, increases in demand for capital equipment result in longer lead times for many important system components. Future increases in demand could cause delays in meeting shipments to our customers. Because of the variability and uniqueness of customer orders, we try to avoid maintaining an extensive inventory of materials for manufacturing. However, long lead times for important system components during industry upturns sometimes require us to carry higher levels of inventory and make larger purchase commitments than we otherwise would make. We may be unable to sell sufficient quantities of products in the event that market demand changes, resulting in increased risk of excess inventory that could lead to obsolescence or reduced liquidity as we fulfill our purchase commitments. On the other hand, if we do not have a sufficient inventory of a product to fulfill customer orders, we may lose orders or customers, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot assure that we can accurately predict market demand and events to avoid inventory shortages or inventories and purchase commitments in excess of our current requirements.\nSupplier capacity constraints, supplier production disruptions, supplier quality issues or price increases could increase our operating costs and adversely impact the competitive positions of our products.\nWe use numerous materials suppliers covering a wide range of materials and services in the production of our products including custom electronic and mechanical components. Key vendors include suppliers of controllers, quartz and silicon carbide for our diffusion systems, two steel mills capable of producing the types of steel to the tolerances needed for our wafer carriers, an injection molder that molds plastic inserts into our steel carriers, an adhesive manufacturer that supplies the critical glue and a pad supplier that produces a unique material used in the manufacture of our polishing templates. We also rely on third parties for certain machined parts, steel frames and metal panels and other components used particularly in the assembly of our production equipment. Although we strive to ensure that parts are available from multiple suppliers, we procure some key parts from a single supplier or a limited group of suppliers. Thus, at times, certain parts may not be available in sufficient quantities, or on a timely and cost-efficient basis, to adequately meet our needs and the needs of our customers.\nFurther, because the selling price of some of our systems exceeds $1.0 million, the delay in the shipment of even a single system could cause significant variations in our quarterly revenue. In the event of supplier capacity constraints, production disruptions, or failure to meet our requirements concerning quality, cost or performance factors, we may transfer our business to alternative sourcing which could lead to further delays, additional costs or other difficulties. If, in the future, we do not receive, in a timely and cost-effective manner, a sufficient quantity and quality of parts to meet our production requirements, our financial position and results of operations may be materially and adversely affected.\nWe might fail to develop adequate internal organizational structures, internal controls and risk monitoring and management systems for an organization of our scale.\nOur business and operations have expanded rapidly through organic growth and acquisitions, as well as successfully managed frequent cyclical contractions. These periods of growth and contraction require the diversion of significant management resources to develop and implement adequate structures for internal organization and information flow, an effective internal control environment, risk monitoring and management systems in line with the scale of our organization, and the hiring and integration of qualified employees into our organization. In addition, disclosure and other ongoing obligations associated with being a public company further increase the challenges to our finance, legal and accounting teams. Furthermore, if we fail to continue to develop and implement appropriate structures for internal organization and information flow, an effective internal control environment and a risk monitoring and management system, we may not be able to identify unfavorable business trends, administrative oversights or other risks that could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nUnsatisfactory performance of, or defects in, our products may cause us to incur additional warranty expenses, damage our reputation and cause our sales to decline.\nAs of September 30, 2019 and 2018, our accrued warranty costs at our continuing operations amounted to $0.6 million in each period. Our assumptions regarding the durability and reliability of our products may not be accurate, and because our products have relatively long warranty periods, we cannot assure you that the amount of accrued warranty by us for our products will be adequate in light of the actual performance of our products. If we experience a significant increase in warranty claims, we may incur significant repair and replacement costs associated with such claims. Furthermore, widespread product underperformances or failures will damage our reputation and customer relationships and may cause our sales to decline, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may incur impairment charges to goodwill or long-lived assets.\nWe have acquired, and may acquire in the future, goodwill and other long-lived intangible assets. Goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment at least annually, typically during the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, and more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable. The review compares the fair value for each of our reporting units to its associated carrying value, including goodwill. Factors that could lead to impairment of goodwill and intangible assets include adverse industry or economic trends, reduced estimates of future cash flows, declines in the market price of our common stock, changes in our strategies or product portfolio, and restructuring activities. Our valuation methodology for assessing impairment requires management to make judgments and assumptions based on historical experience and projections of future operating performance. As is the case with our impairment charge in fiscal 2018, we may again be required to record a charge to earnings during the period in which an impairment of goodwill or amortizable intangible assets is determined to exist, which could materially and adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur income taxes are subject to variables beyond our control.\nOur net income and cash flow may be adversely affected by conditions affecting income taxes which are outside our control. Examples of the potential uncontrollable circumstances that could affect our tax rate are as follows:\n\u2022\nWe sell and operate globally in the United States, Europe and Asia. Disagreement could occur on the jurisdiction of income and taxation among different governmental tax authorities. Potential areas of dispute may include transfer pricing, intercompany charges and intercompany balances.\n\u2022\nWe are subject to a China withholding tax on certain non-tangible charges made under our transfer pricing agreements. The interpretation of what charges are subject to the tax and when the liability for the tax occurs has varied and could change in the future.\n\u2022\nTax rates may increase, and, therefore, have a material adverse effect on our earnings and cash flows.\nOur officers, directors and largest shareholders could choose to act in their best interests and not necessarily those of our other shareholders.\nOur directors, executive officers and holders of five percent or more of our outstanding common stock and their affiliates represent a significant portion of our common stock held as of September 30, 2019, and, therefore, have significant influence over our management and corporate policies. These shareholders have significant influence over all matters submitted to our shareholders, including the election of our directors and approval of business combinations, and could potentially initiate or delay, deter or prevent a change of control. Circumstances may occur in which the interests of these shareholders may conflict with the interests of Amtech or those of our other shareholders, and these shareholders may cause us to take actions that align with their interests. Should conflicts of interest arise, we can provide no assurance that these shareholders would act in the best interests of our other shareholders or that any conflicts of interest would be resolved in a manner favorable to our other shareholders. In addition, involvement of certain activist shareholders may impact our ability to recruit and retain talent or otherwise distract management or make decisions that we believe are in the long-term interest of all shareholders.\nInformation security breaches or failures of our information technology systems may have a negative impact on our operations and our reputation.\nWe may be subject to information security breaches or failures of our information technology systems caused by advanced persistent threats, unauthorized access, sabotage, vandalism, terrorism or accident. Compromises and failure to our information technology networks and systems could result in unauthorized release of our confidential or proprietary information, or that of our customers and suppliers, as well as employee personal data. The costs to protect against or alleviate breaches and systems failures require significant human and financial capital expenditures, which in turn could potentially disrupt our continuing operations, increase our liability as a result of compromises to personally identifiable information, and may lead to a material and adverse effect on our financial reporting, reputation and business.\nNatural disasters, outbreaks of infectious diseases, terrorist attacks, wars and threats of war may negatively impact our operations, revenue, costs and stock price.\nNatural disasters such as earthquakes, floods, severe weather conditions, outbreaks of infectious diseases or other catastrophic events may severely affect our operations or those of our suppliers and customers. Such catastrophic events may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nActs of terrorism, as well as events occurring in response or connection to them, including potential future terrorist attacks, rumors or threats of war, actual military conflicts or trade disruptions impacting our domestic or foreign customers or suppliers, may negatively impact our operations by causing, among other things, delays or losses in the delivery of supplies or finished goods and decreased sales of our products. More generally, any of these events could cause consumer confidence and spending to decrease and/or result in increased volatility in the worldwide financial markets and economy. They also could result in economic recession either globally or in the markets in which we operate. Any of these occurrences could have a significant adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Regulations and Litigation\nOur business may be adversely affected by changes in or failure to comply with foreign and domestic laws.\nThe operations of our companies are subject to numerous foreign and domestic regulatory regimes, including taxation policies, governance and audit requirements, employment and labor laws, transportation regulations, import and export regulations and tariffs, possible foreign exchange restrictions and international monetary fluctuations. Our policies, procedures and internal controls are designed to help us comply with all applicable foreign and domestic laws, accounting and reporting requirements, regulations and tax requirements. We could be subject to legal or regulatory action in the event of our failure to comply, which could be expensive to defend and resolve and be disruptive to our business. Any changes in regulations, the imposition of additional regulations or the enactment of any new legislation that affects us may increase the complexity of the legal and regulatory environment in which we operate and the related costs of compliance.\nWe are subject to U.S. and certain non-U.S. anti-corruption/anti-bribery, export and import controls, sanctions, embargoes, anti-money laundering, anti-terrorist financing, and other similar laws and regulations. Compliance with these legal standards could impair our ability to compete in domestic and international markets. We can face criminal liability and other serious consequences for violations of these laws and regulations which can harm our business.\nWe are a U.S.-based multinational company with extensive operations, including manufacturing joint ventures, in Asia and elsewhere. We operate in several high-risk jurisdictions, including, but not limited to China. Various U.S. and certain non-U.S. anti-corruption/anti-bribery and other international trade laws and regulations apply to our company entities and businesses. These laws and regulations may include, among others, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended, the U.S. Travel Act, the U.S. Domestic Bribery Statute contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7201, the Money Laundering Control Act (1986), the USA PATRIOT Act, the United States Export Administration Act of 1979, the U.S. Export Administration Regulations (15 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7730 et seq.), U.S. sanctions contained in 31 C.F.R. Parts 500-599, the United States International Emergency Economic Powers Act, the United States Trading with the Enemy Act, the International Boycott Provisions of Section 999 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, the UK Bribery Act 2010, the UK Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, and certain other anti-corruption, anti-bribery, anti-kickback, anti-fraud, anti-money laundering, anti-terrorist financing, anti-narcotics, anti-boycott, export control, sanctions, embargo, import control, customs, tax, insider trading, insurance, banking, false claims, anti-racketeering, and other laws, regulations, decrees, government or executive orders, or judicial or administrative decisions or determinations to the extent applicable.\nThe above-mentioned laws and regulations are interpreted very broadly and will impact and raise legal compliance risks for our business in the various jurisdictions where we operate. Violations of the above-mentioned laws and regulations may result in substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties, imprisonment, the loss of export or import privileges, debarment, tax reassessments, breach of contract and fraud litigation, reputational harm, and other consequences.\nAnti-corruption/anti-bribery and the other laws and regulations mentioned above are actively enforced by U.S. and other governments agencies. Among various matters, anti-corruption/anti-bribery laws prohibit our companies, subsidiaries, directors, officers, employees, agents, contractors, vendors, and other business partners from authorizing, promising, offering, providing, soliciting, or accepting directly or indirectly, improper payments or anything else of value to or from recipients in the public or private sector. We may engage vendors and third-party business partners to sell our products or services and/or to obtain necessary permits, licenses, patent registrations, and other regulatory approvals. We have direct or indirect interactions with officials and employees of government agencies or government-affiliated organizations. These factors raise our anti-corruption/anti-bribery risk exposure. We can be held liable for the corrupt or other illegal activities of our employees, agents, contractors, vendors, and other business partners, even if we do not explicitly authorize or have actual knowledge of such activities. The application of these laws to us also may place us at a competitive disadvantage to foreign companies that are not subject to similar regulations.\nThe United States could withdraw from or materially modify certain international trade agreements, or change tariff, trade, or tax provisions related to the global manufacturing and sales of our products in ways that we currently cannot predict.\nA portion of our business activities are conducted in foreign countries, including China, Malaysia, Taiwan, France and the Netherlands. Our business benefits from free trade agreements, and we also rely on various U.S. corporate tax provisions related to international commerce as we build, market and sell our products globally. The current U.S. presidential administration, with support of some members in Congress, has announced trade policy changes, including an intention to impose new tariffs on imported goods, which have created significant uncertainty about the future relationship between the United States and other countries with respect to trade, treaties and tariffs. For example, on June 15, 2018, the Office of the USTR published a list of products covering 818 separate U.S. tariff lines valued at approximately $34 billion in 2018 trade values, imposing an additional duty of 25% on the listed product lines. The list generally focuses on products from industrial sectors that contribute to or benefit from the \u201cMade in China 2025\u201d industrial policy, which include industries such as aerospace, information and communications technology, robotics, industrial machinery, new materials, and automobiles. The USTR also announced a second set of 284 proposed tariff lines, which cover approximately $16 billion worth of imports from China, which will undergo further review in a public notice and comment process, including a public hearing. After completion of this process, USTR stated that it will issue a final determination on the products from this list that would be subject to the additional duties. We are continuing to evaluate the impact of the announced and other proposed tariffs on products that we import from China, and we may experience a material increase in the cost of our products, which may result in our products becoming less attractive relative to products offered by our competitors.\nThese developments, or the perception that any of them could occur, may have a material adverse effect on global economic conditions and the stability of global financial markets, and may significantly reduce global trade and, in particular, trade between the impacted nations and the United States. Any of these factors, or any changes to U.S. corporate tax policies related to international commerce, could depress economic activity and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRecent changes to U.S. tax laws may adversely affect our financial condition or results of operation and create the risk that we may need to adjust our accounting for these changes.\nThe TCJA, enacted on December 22, 2017, makes significant changes to U.S. tax laws and includes numerous provisions that affect businesses, including ours. For instance, as a result of lower corporate tax rates, the TCJA tends to reduce both the value of deferred tax assets and the amount of deferred tax liabilities. It also limits interest rate deductions and the amount of net operating losses that can be used each year and alters the expensing of capital expenditures. Other provisions have international tax consequences for businesses like ours that operate internationally. The TCJA is unclear in certain respects and will require interpretations and implementing regulations by the Internal Revenue Service, as well as state tax authorities, and the TCJA could be subject to amendments and technical corrections, any of which could lessen or increase the adverse (and positive) impacts of the TCJA. The accounting treatment of these tax law changes is complex, and some of the changes may affect both current and future periods. Others will primarily affect future periods. We accounted for the impact of the TCJA on us in fiscal 2018, and, though we believe our analysis and computations of the tax effects of the TCJA on us to be correct, any adjustments to our conclusions or the effects of currently unknown impacts of the TCJA on us could affect our current or future financial statements, or both.\nRegulations related to conflict minerals will force us to incur additional expenses, may make our supply chains more complex, and may result in damage to our relationships with customers.\nUnder the Dodd-Frank Act, the SEC adopted requirements for companies that manufacture products that contain certain minerals and metals known as \u201cconflict minerals\u201d. These rules require public companies to perform diligence and to report annually to the SEC whether such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries. The implementation of these requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, availability, and pricing of minerals we use in the manufacture of our products. In addition, we have incurred and will continue to incur additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements, including costs related to determining the source of any of the relevant minerals used in our products. Given the complexity of our supply chain, we may not be able to ascertain the origins of these minerals used in our products through the due diligence procedures that we implement, which may harm our reputation. We may also face difficulties in satisfying customers who may require that our products be certified as conflict mineral free, which could harm our relationships with these customers and lead to a loss of revenue. These requirements could limit the pool of suppliers that can provide conflict-free minerals, and we may be unable to obtain conflict-free minerals at competitive prices, which could increase our costs and adversely affect our manufacturing operations and our profitability.\nWe are subject to environmental regulations, and our inability or failure to comply with these regulations could result in significant costs or the suspension of our ability to operate portions of our business.\nWe are subject to environmental regulations in connection with our business operations, including regulations related to manufacturing and our customers\u2019 use of our products. From time to time, we receive notices regarding these regulations. It is our policy to respond promptly to these notices and to take any necessary corrective action. Our failure or inability to comply with existing or future environmental regulations could result in significant remediation liabilities, the imposition of fines and/or the suspension or termination of development, manufacturing or use of certain of our products or facilities, each of which could damage our financial position and results of operations.\nWe face the risk of product liability claims or other litigation, which could be expensive and may divert management\u2019s attention from running our business.\nAmtech and our subsidiaries are defendants from time to time in actions for matters arising out of our business operations. The manufacture and sale of our products, which, in our customers\u2019 operations, involve toxic materials and robotic machinery, involve the risk of product liability claims. In addition, a failure of one of our products at a customer site could interrupt the business operations of our customer. Our existing insurance coverage limits may not be adequate to protect us from all liabilities that we might incur in connection with the manufacture and sale of our products if a successful product liability claim or series of product liability claims were brought against us.\nWe also may be involved in other legal proceedings or claims and experience threats of legal action from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. For example, securities class action litigation is often brought against companies following periods of volatility in the market price of its securities or in connection with strategic transactions. We may in the future be the target of securities litigation due to volatility in the market price of our common stock or for other reasons. Any securities litigation could result in substantial costs and could divert the attention and resources of our management.\nWhere appropriate, we intend to vigorously defend all claims. However, any actual or threatened claims, even if not meritorious or material, could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources. The continued defense of these claims and other types of lawsuits could divert management\u2019s attention away from running our business. In addition, required amounts to be paid in settlement of any claims, and the legal fees and other costs associated with their defense or also settlement, cannot be estimated and could, individually or in the aggregate, materially harm our financial condition. We may also experience higher than expected warranty claims.\nRisks Related to Our Research and Development and Intellectual Property Activities\nWe may not be able to keep pace with the rapid change in the technology needed to meet customer requirements.\nSuccess in the solar and semiconductor equipment industries depends, in part, on continual improvement of existing technologies and rapid innovation of new solutions. For example, the solar industry continues to develop new technologies to increase the efficiencies and lower the costs of solar cells. Also, the semiconductor industry continues to shrink the size of semiconductor devices. These and other evolving customer needs require us to continually respond with new product developments.\nTechnical innovations are inherently complex and require long development cycles and appropriate professional staffing. Our future business success depends on our ability to develop and introduce new products, or new uses for existing products, that successfully address changing customer needs and win market acceptance. We also must manufacture these new products in a timely and cost-effective manner. To realize future growth through technical innovations in the solar and semiconductor industries, we must acquire the technology through product development, merger and acquisition activity or through the licensing of products from our technology partners. Potential disruptive technologies could have a material adverse effect on our business if we do not successfully develop and introduce new products, technologies or uses for existing products in a timely manner and continually find ways of reducing the cost to produce them in response to changing market conditions or customer requirements.\nOur research and development investments may not result in timely new products that can be sold at favorable prices and obtain market acceptance.\nThe rapid change in technology in our industry requires that we continue to make investments in research and development in order to enhance the performance, functionality and cost of ownership of our products to keep pace with competitors\u2019 products and to satisfy customer demands for improved performance, features and functionality. We cannot provide assurance that revenue from future products or enhancements will be sufficient to recover the development costs associated with such products or enhancements, or that we will be able to secure the financial resources necessary to fund future development. Research and development costs are typically incurred before we confirm the technical feasibility and commercial viability of a product, and not all development activities result in commercially viable products. We cannot assure that products or enhancements will receive market acceptance, or that we will be able to sell these products at prices that are favorable to us, or at all. In addition, from time to time we receive funding from government agencies for certain strategic development programs to increase our research and development resources and address new market opportunities. As a condition to this government funding, we may be subject to certain record-keeping, audit, intellectual property rights-sharing and/or other obligations. If we do not successfully manage our investments in research and development, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nThird parties may violate our proprietary rights, in which we have made significant investments, resulting in a loss of value of some of our intellectual property or costly litigation.\nOur success is dependent in part on our technology and other proprietary rights. We own various United States and international patents and have additional pending patent applications relating to some of our products and technologies. Protecting and defending our patents domestically, and especially internationally, is costly. In addition, the process of seeking patent protection is lengthy and expensive. Therefore, we cannot be certain that pending or future applications will result in issued patents, or that issued patents will be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or commercial advantage to us. Other companies and individuals, including our larger competitors, may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology or design around the patents we own or license. In addition, the patent for the technology that we license and use in our manufacture of insert carriers has expired, which, along with the other risks related to our patents described above, may have the effect of diminishing or eliminating any competitive advantage we may have with respect to our manufacturing process.\nWe also maintain trademarks on certain of our products and claim copyright protection for certain proprietary software and documentation. We can give no assurance, however, that our trademarks and copyrights will be upheld or will successfully deter infringement by third parties.\nWe attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through confidentiality agreements with our customers, suppliers, employees and consultants and through other security measures. We also maintain exclusive and non-exclusive licenses with third parties for the technology used in certain products. However, these employees, consultants and third parties may breach these agreements, and we may not have adequate remedies for wrongdoing. In addition, the laws of certain territories, such as China, in which we develop, manufacture or sell our products may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the United States.\nWe may face intellectual property infringement claims that could be time-consuming and costly to defend and could result in our loss of significant rights and the assessment of treble damages.\nFrom time to time, we have received communications from other parties asserting the existence of patent rights or other intellectual property rights that they believe cover certain of our products, processes, technologies or information. Some of these claims may lead to litigation. We cannot assure that we will prevail in these actions, or that other actions alleging misappropriation or misuse by us of third-party trade secrets, infringement by us of third-party patents and trademarks or the validity of our patents, will not be asserted or prosecuted against us. If there is a successful claim of infringement against us, we may be required to pay substantial damages (including treble damages if we were to be found to have willfully infringed a third party\u2019s patent) to the party claiming infringement, incur costs to develop non-infringing technology, stop selling or using technology that contains the allegedly infringing intellectual property, or enter into royalty or license agreements that may not be available on acceptable or commercially practical terms, if at all. Intellectual property litigation, regardless of outcome, is expensive and time-consuming, and could divert management\u2019s attention from our business. Our failure to successfully defend against infringement claims, or to develop non-infringing technologies or license the proprietary rights on a timely basis, could have a material negative effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur results of operations are difficult to predict, and, we have experienced, and may continue to experience, significant volatility in our stock price as a result.\nA variety of factors may cause the price of our stock to be volatile. For example, our results of operations are difficult to predict and have fluctuated from time to time in the past. We expect that our results of operations may continue to fluctuate from time to time in the future. It is possible that our results of operations in some reporting periods will be below market expectations. If our results of operations for a particular reporting period are lower than the market expectations for such reporting period, investors may react negatively and, as a result, the price of our stock may materially decline.\nFurthermore, the stock market in general, and the market for shares of high-technology companies in particular, including ours, have experienced extreme price fluctuations, which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies. During the two-year period ended September 30, 2019 the price of our common stock has ranged from $15.45 to $4.03. The price of our stock may be more volatile than the stock of other companies due to, among other factors, the unpredictable, volatile and seasonal nature of the industries in which we operate, our significant customer concentration, intense competition, our fluctuating backlog and our relatively low daily stock trading volume. As a result, the market price of our common stock is likely to continue to fluctuate significantly in the future, including fluctuations related and unrelated to our performance.\nShareholder activists could cause a disruption to our business.\nAn activist investor may indicate disagreement with our strategic direction or capital allocation policies and may seek representation on our Board of Directors. Our business, operating results or financial condition could be adversely affected and may result in, among other things:\n\u2022\nincreased operating costs, including increased legal expenses, insurance, administrative expenses and associated costs incurred in connection with director election contests;\n\u2022\nuncertainties as to our future direction, which could result in the loss of potential business opportunities and could make it more difficult to attract, retain, or motivate qualified personnel, and strain relationships with investors and customers; and\n\u2022\nreduction or delay in our ability to effectively execute our current business strategy and to implement new strategies.\nFuture sales of our common stock by us or our existing shareholders could depress the market price of our common stock.\nIf we or our existing shareholders sell a large number of shares of our common stock, the market price of our common stock could decline significantly. Further, even the perception in the public market that we or our existing shareholders might sell shares of common stock could depress the market price of the common stock.\nIf securities analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they downgrade our stock, the price of our stock could decline.\nThe trading market for our shares of common stock could rely in part on the research and reporting that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. We do not control these analysts. Furthermore, if one or more of the analysts who do cover us downgrades our stock, the price of our stock could decline. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline.", "PERMNO": 65008, "SIC": 3559, "TIC": "ASYS"}
