{"cik": "1596961", "company": "RumbleON, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2018-02-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. Investors should carefully consider the risks described below and all of the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our financial statements and related notes and \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,\u201d before deciding to invest in our common stock. If any of the events or developments described below occur, our business, financial condition, or results of operations could be materially or adversely affected. As a result, the market price of our common stock could decline, and investors could lose all or part of their investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have a limited operating history and we cannot assure you we will achieve or maintain profitability.\nOur business model is unproven, and we have a limited operating history. We are only in the initial development stage of our business. We expect to make significant investments in the further development and expansion of our business and these investments may not result in the successful development, operation, or growth of our business on a timely basis or at all. We may not generate sufficient revenue and we may incur significant losses in the future for a number of reasons, including a lack of demand for our products and services, increasing competition, weakness in the powersports, and recreational vehicle industries generally, as well as other risks described in these Risk Factors, and we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications and delays, and other unknown factors relating to the development and operation of our business. Accordingly, we may not be able to successfully develop and operate our business, generate revenue, or achieve or maintain profitability.\nOur annual and quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly or may fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, each of which may cause our stock price to fluctuate or decline.\nWe expect our operating results to be subject to annual and quarterly fluctuations, and they will be affected by numerous factors, including:\n\u25cf\na change in consumer discretionary spending;\n\u25cf\na shift in the mix and type of vehicles we sell which could result in lower sales price and lower gross profit;\n\u25cf\nweather, which may impact the ability or desire for potential end customers to consider whether they wish to own a powersports and recreational vehicle;\n\u25cf\nthe timing and cost of, and level of investment in, development activities relating to our software development and services, which may change from time to time;\n\u25cf\nour ability to attract, hire and retain qualified personnel;\n\u25cf\nexpenditures that we will or may incur to acquire or develop additional product and service offerings;\n\u25cf\nfuture accounting pronouncements or changes in our accounting policies; and\n\u25cf\nthe changing and volatile U.S., European and global economic environments.\nIf our annual or quarterly operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the price of our Class B Common Stock could decline substantially. Furthermore, any annual or quarterly fluctuations in our operating results may, in turn, cause the price of our stock to fluctuate substantially. We believe that annual and quarterly comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance.\nThe initial development and progress of our business to date may not be indicative of our future growth prospects and, if we continue to grow rapidly, we may not be able to manage our growth effectively.\nWe expect that, in the future, as our revenue increases, our rate of growth will decline. In addition, we will not be able to grow as fast or at all if we do not accomplish the following:\n\u25cf\nmaintain and grow our regional partner network;\n\u25cf\nincrease the number of users of our products and services, and in particular the number of unique visitors to our website and our branded mobile applications;\n\u25cf\nincrease the number of transactions between our users and both RumbleOn and our regional partners;\n\u25cf\nintroduce third party ancillary products and services;\n\u25cf\nacquire sufficient number of pre-owned vehicles at attractive cost; and\n\u25cf\nsell sufficient number of pre-owned vehicles at acceptable prices.\nWe may not successfully accomplish any of these objectives. We plan to continue our investment in future growth. We expect to continue to expend substantial financial and other resources on:\n\u25cf\nmarketing and advertising;\n\u25cf\nproduct and service development; including investments in our website, business processes, infrastructure, inventory, product and service development team and the development of new products and services and new features for existing products; and\n\u25cf\ngeneral administration, including legal, accounting and other compliance expenses related to being a public company.\nIn addition, our anticipated growth may place and may continue to place significant demands on our management and our operational and financial resources. As we grow, we expect to hire additional personnel. Also, our organizational structure will become more complex as we add additional staff, and we will need to ensure we adequately develop and maintain operational, financial and management controls as well as our reporting systems and procedures.\nWe may require additional capital to pursue our business objectives and respond to business opportunities, challenges or unforeseen circumstances. If capital is not available on terms acceptable to us or at all, we may not be able to develop and grow our business as anticipated and our business, operating results and financial condition may be harmed.\nWe intend to continue to make investments to support the development and growth of our business and, we may require additional capital to pursue our business objectives and respond to business opportunities, challenges or unforeseen circumstances. Accordingly, we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. However, additional funds may not be available when we need them, on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. Volatility in the credit markets may also have an adverse effect on our ability to obtain debt financing. Also, the incurrence of leverage, the debt service requirements resulting therefrom, and the possibility of a need for financing or any additional financing could have important and negative consequences, including the following: (a) the Company\u2019s ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, or general corporate or other purposes may be impaired in the future; (b) certain future borrowings may be at variable rates of interest, which will expose the Company to the risk of increased interest rates; (c) the Company may need to use a portion of the money it earns to pay principal and interest on their credit facilities, which will reduce the amount of money available to finance operations and other business activities, repay other indebtedness, and pay distributions; and (d) substantial leverage may limit the Company\u2019s flexibility to adjust to changing economic or market conditions, reduce their ability to withstand competitive pressures and make them more vulnerable to a downturn in general economic conditions.\nIf we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us, when we require it, our ability to continue to pursue our business objectives and to respond to business opportunities, challenges or unforeseen circumstances could be significantly limited, and our business, operating results, financial condition and prospects could be adversely affected.\nThe success of our business relies heavily on our marketing and branding efforts, especially with respect to the RumbleOn website and our branded mobile applications, and these efforts may not be successful.\nWe believe that an important component of our development and growth will be the business derived from the RumbleOn website and our branded mobile applications. Because RumbleOn is a consumer brand, we rely heavily on marketing and advertising to increase the visibility of this brand with potential users of our products and services.\nOur business model relies on our ability to scale rapidly and to decrease incremental user acquisition costs as we grow. Some of our methods of marketing and advertising may not be profitable because they may not result in the acquisition of a sufficient users visiting our website and mobile applications such that we may recover these costs by attaining corresponding revenue growth. If we are unable to recover our marketing and advertising costs through increases in user traffic and in the number of transactions by users of our platform, it could have a material adverse effect on our growth, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe failure to develop and maintain our brand could harm our ability to grow unique visitor traffic and to expand our regional partner network.\nDeveloping and maintaining the RumbleOn brand will depend largely on the success of our efforts to maintain the trust of our users and dealers and to deliver value to each of our users and dealers. If our potential users perceive that we are not focused primarily on providing them with a better pre-owned vehicle buying experience, our reputation and the strength of our brand will be adversely affected.\nComplaints or negative publicity about our business practices, our marketing and advertising campaigns, our compliance with applicable laws and regulations, the integrity of the data that we provide to users, data privacy and security issues, and other aspects of our business, irrespective of their validity, could diminish users\u2019 and dealers\u2019 confidence in and the use of our products and services and adversely affect our brand. There can be no assurance that we will be able to develop, maintain or enhance our brand, and failure to do so would harm our business growth prospects and operating results.\nWe rely on Internet search engines to drive traffic to our website, and if we fail to appear prominently in the search results, our traffic would decline, and our business would be adversely affected.\nWe depend in part on Internet search engines and social media such as Google\u2122, Bing\u2122, and Facebook\u2122 to drive traffic to our website. For example, when a user searches the internet for a particular type of powersports or recreational vehicle, we will rely on a high organic search ranking of our webpages in these search results to refer the user to our website. However, our ability to maintain high, non-paid search result rankings is not within our control. Our competitors\u2019 Internet search engine and social media efforts may result in their websites receiving a higher search result page ranking than ours, or Internet search engines could revise their methodologies in a way that would adversely affect our search result rankings. If Internet search engines or social media companies modify their search algorithms or display technologies in ways that are detrimental to us, or if our competitors\u2019 efforts are more successful than ours, overall growth in our user base could slow or our user base could decline. Internet search engine providers could provide recreation vehicle dealer and pricing information directly in search results, align with our competitors or choose to develop competing services. Any reduction in the number of users directed to our website through Internet search engines could harm our business and operating results.\nA significant disruption in service on our website or of our mobile applications could damage our reputation and result in a loss of consumers, which could harm our business, brand, operating results, and financial condition.\nOur brand, reputation and ability to attract consumers, affinity groups and advertisers depend on the reliable performance of our technology infrastructure and content delivery. We may experience significant interruptions with our systems in the future. Interruptions in these systems, whether due to system failures, computer viruses, or physical or electronic break-ins, could affect the security or availability of our products on our website and mobile application, and prevent or inhibit the ability of consumers to access our products. Problems with the reliability or security of our systems could harm our reputation, result in a loss of consumers, dealers and affinity group marketing partners, and result in additional costs.\nWe intend to locate our communications, network, and computer hardware used to operate our website and mobile applications at facilities in various parts of the country to minimize the risk and create an environment where we can remain online if one of the facilities in which our equipment is housed goes offline. Nevertheless, we will not own or control the operation of these facilities, and our systems and operations will be vulnerable to damage or interruption from fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications failure, terrorist attacks, acts of war, electronic and physical break-ins, computer viruses, earthquakes, and similar events. The occurrence of any of these events could result in damage to our systems and hardware or could cause them to fail.\nProblems faced by any third-party web hosting providers we may utilize could adversely affect the experience of our consumers. Any third-party web hosting providers could close their facilities without adequate notice. Any financial difficulties, up to and including bankruptcy, faced by any third-party web hosting providers or any of the service providers with whom they contract may have negative effects on our business, the nature and extent of which are difficult to predict. If our third-party web hosting providers are unable to keep up with our growing capacity needs, our business could be harmed.\nAny errors, defects, disruptions, or other performance or reliability problems with our network operations could cause interruptions in access to our products as well as delays and additional expense in arranging new facilities and services and could harm our reputation, business, operating results, and financial condition.\nWe may be unable to maintain or grow relationships with information data providers or may experience interruptions in the data feeds they provide, which may limit the information that we are able to provide to our users and regional partners as well as adversely affect the timeliness of such information and may impair our ability to attract or retain consumers and our regional partners and to timely invoice all parties.\nWe expect to receive data from third-party data providers, including our network of dealers, dealer management system data feed providers, data aggregators and integrators, survey companies, purveyors of registration data and possibly others. There may be some instances in which we use this information to collect a transaction fee from those dealers and recognize revenue from the related transactions.\nFrom time to time, we may experience interruptions in one or more data feeds that we receive from third-party data providers, particularly dealer management system data feed providers, in a manner that affects our ability to timely invoice the dealers in our network. These interruptions may occur for a number of reasons, including changes to the software used by these data feed providers and difficulties in renewing our agreements with third-party data feed providers. Additionally, when an interruption ceases, we may not always be able to collect the appropriate fees and any such shortfall in revenue could be material to our operating results.\nIf we are unable to provide a compelling powersport or recreation vehicle buying experience to our users, the number of transactions between our users, RumbleOn and dealers will decline, and our revenue and results of operations will suffer harm.\nWe cannot assure you that we are able to provide a compelling vehicle buying experience to our users, and our failure to do so will mean that the number of transactions between our users, RumbleOn and dealers will decline, and we will be unable to effectively monetize our user traffic. We believe that our ability to provide a compelling powersport and recreation vehicle buying experience is subject to a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf\nour ability to launch new products that are effective and have a high degree of consumer engagement; and\n\u25cf\ncompliance of the dealers and regional auctions within our network with applicable laws, regulations and the rules of our platform.\nIf key industry participants, including powersports and recreation vehicle dealers and regional auctions, perceive us in a negative light or our relationships with them suffer harm, our ability to operate and grow our business and our financial performance may be damaged.\nWe anticipate that we will derive a significant portion of our revenue from fees paid by existing powersports and recreation vehicle dealers for dealer services we may provide them. In addition, we intend to utilize a select set of regional partners to perform services for our benefit, including, among other things, vehicle reconditioning, vehicle storage and vehicle photography. If our relationships with our network of regional partners suffer harm in a manner that leads to the departure of these regional partners from our network, then our ability to operate our business, grow revenue, and lower our costs will be adversely affected.\nWe cannot assure you that we will maintain strong relationships with the regional partners in our network or that we will not suffer partner attrition in the future. We may also have disputes with regional partners from time to time, including relating to the collection of fees from them and other matters. We may need to modify our products, change pricing or take other actions to address regional partner concerns in the future. If we are unable to create and maintain a compelling value proposition for regional partners to become and remain in our network, our network will not grow and may begin to decline. If a significant number of these regional partners decided to leave our network or change their financial or business relationship with us, then our business, growth, operating results, financial condition and prospects could suffer. Additionally, if we are unable to attract regional partners to our network, our growth could be impaired.\nThe growth of our business relies significantly on our ability to increase the number of regional partners in our network such that we are able to increase the number of transactions between our users and regional partners. Failure to do so would limit our growth.\nOur ability to grow the number of regional partners in our network is an important factor in growing our business. We are a new participant in the powersport and recreational vehicle industry, our business may be viewed in a negative light by powersports and recreation vehicle dealerships, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain or grow the number of regional partners in our network.\nOur ability to grow our complementary product offerings may be limited, which could negatively impact our development, growth, revenue and financial performance.\nAs we introduce or expand additional offerings for our platform, such as recreation vehicle trade-ins, lead management, transaction processing, financing, maintenance and insurance, we may incur losses or otherwise fail to enter these markets successfully. Our expansion into these markets may place us in competitive and regulatory environments with which we are unfamiliar and involves various risks, including the need to invest significant resources and the possibility that returns on such investments will not be achieved for several years, if at all. In attempting to establish such new product offerings, we may incur significant expenses and face various other challenges, such as expanding our sales force and management personnel to cover these markets and complying with complicated regulations that apply to these markets. In addition, we may not successfully demonstrate the value of these ancillary products to consumers or dealers, and failure to do so would compromise our ability to successfully expand into these additional revenue streams.\nWe rely on third-party financing providers to finance a portion of our customers\u2019 vehicle purchases.\nWe rely on third-party financing providers to finance a portion of our customers\u2019 vehicle purchases. Accordingly, our revenue and results of operations are partially dependent on the actions of these third parties. We provide financing to qualified customers through a number of third-party financing providers. If one or more of these third-party providers cease to provide financing to our customers, provide financing to fewer customers or no longer provide financing on competitive terms, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, sales and results of operations. Additionally, if we were unable to replace the current third-party providers upon the occurrence of one or more of the foregoing events, it could also have a material adverse effect on our business, sales and results of operations. We rely on third-party providers to supply EPP products to our customers. Accordingly, our revenue and results of operations will be partially dependent on the actions of these third-parties. If one or more of these third-party providers cease to provide EPP products, make changes to their products or no longer provide their products on competitive terms, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, revenue and results of operations. Additionally, if we were unable to replace the current third-party providers upon the occurrence of one or more of the foregoing events, it could also have a material adverse effect on our business, revenue and results of operations.\nOur sales of powersports/recreation vehicles may be adversely impacted by increased supply of and/or declining prices for pre-owned powersports and recreational vehicles and excess supply of new powersports and recreational vehicles.\nWe believe when prices for pre-owned powersports and recreational vehicles have declined, it can have the effect of reducing demand among retail purchasers for new powersports and recreational vehicles (at or near manufacturer\u2019s suggested retail prices). Further, the manufacturers of powersports and recreational vehicles can and do take actions that influence the markets for new and pre-owned powersports and recreational vehicles. For example, introduction of new models with significantly different functionality, technology or other customer satisfiers can result in increased supply of pre-owned powersports and recreational vehicles, and a corresponding decrease in price of pre-owned powersports and recreational vehicles. Also, while historically manufacturers have taken steps designed to balance production volumes for new powersports and recreational vehicles with demand, those steps have not always proven effective. In other instances, manufacturers have chosen to supply new powersports and recreational vehicles to the market in excess of demand at reduced prices which has the effect of reducing demand for pre-owned powersports and recreational vehicles.\nWe rely on a number of third parties to perform certain operating and administrative functions for the Company.\nWe rely on a number of third parties to perform certain operating and administrative functions for us. We may experience problems with outsourced services, such as unfavorable pricing, untimely delivery of services, or poor quality. Also, these third parties may experience adverse economic conditions due to difficulties in the global economy that could lead to difficulties supporting our operations. In light of the amount and types of functions that we will outsource, these service provider risks could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe participate in a highly competitive market, and pressure from existing and new companies may adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe face significant competition from companies that provide listings, information, lead generation, and powersports and recreation vehicle buying services designed to reach consumers and enable dealers to reach these consumers. We will compete for a share of overall powersports and recreation vehicle purchases as well as powersport and recreation vehicle dealer\u2019s marketing and technology spend. To the extent that powersports and recreation vehicle dealers view alternative strategies to be superior to RumbleOn, we may not be able to maintain or grow the number of dealers in our network, we may sell fewer powersports and recreation vehicles to users of our platform, and our business, operating results and financial condition will be harmed.\nWe also expect that new competitors will continue to enter the online powersports and recreation vehicle retail industry with competing products and services, which could have an adverse effect on our revenue, business and financial results.\nOur competitors could significantly impede our ability to expand our network of dealers and regional auctions and to reach consumers. Our competitors may also develop and market new technologies that render our existing or future products and services less competitive, unmarketable or obsolete. In addition, if our competitors develop products or services with similar or superior functionality to our solutions, we may need to decrease the prices for our solutions in order to remain competitive. If we are unable to maintain our current pricing structure due to competitive pressures, our revenue will be reduced, and our operating results will be negatively affected.\nOur current and potential competitors may have significantly more financial, technical, marketing and other resources than we have, and the ability to devote greater resources to the development, promotion, and support of their products and services. Additionally, they may have more extensive recreation vehicle industry relationships than we have, longer operating histories and greater name recognition. As a result, these competitors may be better able to respond more quickly to undertake more extensive marketing or promotional campaigns. If we are unable to compete with these companies, the demand for our products and services could substantially decline.\nIn addition, if one or more of our competitors were to merge or partner with another of our competitors, the change in the competitive landscape could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively. Our competitors may also establish or strengthen cooperative relationships with our current or future third-party data providers, technology partners, or other parties with whom we may have relationships, thereby limiting our ability to develop, improve, and promote our solutions. We may not be able to compete successfully against current or future competitors, and competitive pressures may harm our revenue, business and financial results.\nSeasonality or weather trends may cause fluctuations in our unique visitors, revenue and operating results.\nOur revenue trends are likely to be a reflection of consumers\u2019 recreation vehicle buying patterns. While different types of recreation vehicles are designed for different seasons (motorcycles are typically for non-snow seasons, while snowmobiles are typically designed for winter), our revenue may be cyclical if, for example, powersport and recreation vehicles and powersports and recreational dealers continue to represent a large percentage of our revenue. Historically, the industry has been seasonal with traffic and sales strongest in the spring and summer quarters. Sales and traffic are typically slowest in the fall quarter but increase in February and March, coinciding with tax refund season. Our business will also be impacted by cyclical trends affecting the overall economy, specifically the retail recreation vehicle industry, as well as by actual or threatened severe weather events.\nWe collect, process, store, share, disclose and use personal information and other data, and our actual or perceived failure to protect such information and data could damage our reputation and brand and harm our business and operating results.\nWe collect, process, store, share, disclose and use personal information and other data provided by consumers, dealers and auctions. We rely on encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties to effect secure transmission of such information. We may need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches or to address problems caused by breaches. Any failure or perceived failure to maintain the security of personal and other data that is provided to us by consumers and dealers could harm our reputation and brand and expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability, any of which could harm our business and operating results. In addition, from time to time, it is possible that concerns will be expressed about whether our products, services, or processes compromise the privacy of our users. Concerns about our practices with regard to the collection, use or disclosure of personal information or other privacy related matters, even if unfounded, could harm our business and operating results.\nThere are numerous federal, state and local laws around the world regarding privacy and the collection, processing, storing, sharing, disclosing, using and protecting of personal information and other data, the scope of which are changing, subject to differing interpretations, and which may be costly to comply with and may be inconsistent between countries and jurisdictions or conflict with other rules. We generally comply with industry standards and are subject to the terms of our privacy policies and privacy-related obligations to third parties. We strive to comply with all applicable laws, policies, legal obligations and industry codes of conduct relating to privacy and data protection, to the extent possible. However, it is possible that these obligations may be interpreted and applied in new ways or in a manner that is inconsistent from one jurisdiction to another and may conflict with other rules or our practices or that new regulations could be enacted. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our privacy policies, our privacy-related obligations to consumers or other third parties, or our privacy-related legal obligations, or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release or transfer of sensitive information, which may include personally identifiable information or other user data, may result in governmental enforcement actions, litigation or public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or others and could cause consumers and recreation vehicle dealers to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our business. Additionally, if vendors, developers or other third parties that we work with violate applicable laws or our policies, such violations may also put consumer or dealer information at risk and could in turn harm our reputation, business and operating results.\nFailure to adequately protect our intellectual property could harm our business and operating results.\nA portion of our success may be dependent on our intellectual property, the protection of which is crucial to the success of our business. We expect to rely on a combination of patent, trademark, trade secret and copyright law and contractual restrictions to protect our intellectual property. In addition, we will attempt to protect our intellectual property, technology, and confidential information by requiring our employees and consultants to enter into confidentiality and assignment of inventions agreements and third parties to enter into nondisclosure agreements. These agreements may not effectively prevent unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information, intellectual property, or technology and may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information, intellectual property, or technology. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our website features, software, and functionality or obtain and use information that we consider proprietary.\nCompetitors may adopt service names similar to ours, thereby harming our ability to build brand identity and possibly leading to user confusion. In addition, there could be potential trade name or trademark infringement claims brought by owners of other registered trademarks or trademarks that incorporate variations of the term \u201cRumbleOn\u201d or \u201cRMBL.\u201d\nWe currently hold the \u201cRumbleOn.com\u201d Internet domain name and various other related domain names. The regulation of domain names in the United States is subject to change. Regulatory bodies could establish additional top-level domains, appoint additional domain name registrars, or modify the requirements for holding domain names. As a result, we may not be able to acquire or maintain all domain names that use the name RumbleOn or RMBL.\nWe may in the future be subject to intellectual property disputes, which are costly to defend and could harm our business and operating results.\nWe may from time to time face allegations that we have infringed the trademarks, copyrights, patents and other intellectual property rights of third parties, including from our competitors or non-practicing entities.\nPatent and other intellectual property litigation may be protracted and expensive, and the results are difficult to predict and may require us to stop offering some features, purchase licenses or modify our products and features while we develop non-infringing substitutes or may result in significant settlement costs.\nIn addition, we use open source software in our products and will use open source software in the future. From time to time, we may face claims against companies that incorporate open source software into their products, claiming ownership of, or demanding release of, the source code, the open source software or derivative works that were developed using such software, or otherwise seeking to enforce the terms of the applicable open source license. These claims could also result in litigation, require us to purchase a costly license or require us to devote additional research and development resources to change our platform or services, any of which would have a negative effect on our business and operating results.\nEven if these matters do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor or without significant cash settlements, these matters, and the time and resources necessary to litigate or resolve them, could harm our business, our operating results and our reputation.\nWe depend on key personnel to operate our business, and if we are unable to retain, attract and integrate qualified personnel, our ability to develop and successfully grow our business could be harmed.\nWe believe our success will depend on the efforts and talents of our executives and employees, including Marshall Chesrown, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and Steven R. Berrard, our Chief Financial Officer. Our future success depends on our continuing ability to attract, develop, motivate and retain highly qualified and skilled employees. Qualified individuals are in high demand, and we may incur significant costs to attract and retain them. In addition, the loss of any of our senior management or key employees could materially adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan and strategy, and we may not be able to find adequate replacements on a timely basis, or at all. Our executive officers are at-will employees, which means they may terminate their employment relationship with us at any time, and their knowledge of our business and industry would be extremely difficult to replace. We cannot ensure that we will be able to retain the services of any members of our senior management or other key employees. If we do not succeed in attracting well-qualified employees or retaining and motivating existing employees, our business could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe may acquire other companies or technologies, which could divert our management\u2019s attention, result in additional dilution to our stockholders and otherwise disrupt our operations and harm our operating results.\nOur success will depend, in part, on our ability to grow our business in response to the demands of consumers, dealers and other constituents within the powersports and recreation vehicle industry as well as competitive pressures. In some circumstances, we may determine to do so through the acquisition of complementary businesses and technologies rather than through internal development. The identification of suitable acquisition candidates can be difficult, time-consuming, and costly, and we may not be able to successfully complete identified acquisitions. The risks we face in connection with acquisitions include:\n\u25cf\ndiversion of management time and focus from operating our business to addressing acquisition integration challenges;\n\u25cf\ncoordination of technology, research and development and sales and marketing functions;\n\u25cf\ntransition of the acquired company\u2019s users to our website and mobile applications;\n\u25cf\nretention of employees from the acquired company;\n\u25cf\ncultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into our organization;\n\u25cf\nintegration of the acquired company\u2019s accounting, management information, human resources, and other administrative systems;\n\u25cf\nthe need to implement or improve controls, procedures, and policies at a business that prior to the acquisition may have lacked effective controls, procedures, and policies;\n\u25cf\npotential write-offs of intangibles or other assets acquired in such transactions that may have an adverse effect our operating results in a given period;\n\u25cf\nliability for activities of the acquired company before the acquisition, including patent and trademark infringement claims, violations of laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities, and other known and unknown liabilities; and\n\u25cf\nlitigation or other claims in connection with the acquired company, including claims from terminated employees, consumers, former stockholders, or other third parties.\nOur failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with our future acquisitions and investments could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of these acquisitions or investments, cause us to incur unanticipated liabilities, and harm our business generally. Future acquisitions could also result in dilutive issuances of our equity securities, the incurrence of debt, contingent liabilities, amortization expenses, or the impairment of goodwill, any of which could harm our financial condition. Also, the anticipated benefits of any acquisitions may not materialize to the extent we anticipate or at all.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Common Stock\nThe trading price for our Class B Common Stock may be volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in per share price.\nOur Class B Common Stock is listed for trading on The NASDAQ Capital Market under the trading symbol \u201cRMBL,\u201d however historically there has been a limited public market for our Class B Common Stock. The liquidity of any market for the shares of our Class B Common Stock will depend on a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf\nthe number of stockholders;\n\u25cf\nour operating performance and financial condition;\n\u25cf\nthe market for similar securities;\n\u25cf\nthe extent of coverage of us by securities or industry analysts; and\n\u25cf\nthe interest of securities dealers in making a market in the shares of our common stock.\nThe market price for our Class B Common Stock may be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations. In addition, the price of shares of our Class B Common Stock could decline significantly if our future operating results fail to meet or exceed the expectations of market analysts and investors and actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results could negatively affect our share price.\nOther factors may also contribute to volatility of the price of our Class B Common Stock and could subject our Class B Common Stock to wide fluctuations. These include, but are not limited to:\n\u25cf\ndevelopments in the financial markets and worldwide or regional economies;\n\u25cf\nannouncements of innovations or new products or services by us or our competitors;\n\u25cf\nannouncements by the government relating to regulations that govern our industry;\n\u25cf\nsignificant sales of our Class B Common Stock or other securities in the open market;\n\u25cf\nvariations in interest rates;\n\u25cf\nchanges in the market valuations of other comparable companies; and\n\u25cf\nchanges in accounting principles.\nOur principal stockholders and management own a significant percentage of our stock and an even greater percentage of the Company\u2019s voting power and will be able to exert significant control over matters subject to stockholder approval.\nOur executive officers and directors as a group beneficially own shares of our Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock representing approximately 74.5% in aggregate of our voting power, including approximately 62.5% in aggregate voting power held by Messrs. Chesrown and Berrard as the only holders of our 1,000,000 outstanding shares of our Class A Common Stock, which has ten votes for each one share outstanding. As a result, these stockholders have the ability to determine all matters requiring stockholder approval. For example, these stockholders are able to control elections of directors, amendments of our organizational documents approval of any merger, sale of assets, or other major corporate transaction. This may prevent or discourage unsolicited acquisition proposals or offers for our common stock that you may believe are in your best interest as a stockholder or to take other action that you may believe are not in your best interest as a stockholder. This may also adversely affect the market price of our Class B Common Stock.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business, or if they issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding our stock, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our Class B Common Stock may be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If any of the analysts who cover us issue an adverse or misleading opinion regarding us, our business model, our intellectual property or our stock performance, or if our operating results fail to meet the expectations of analysts, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of us or fail to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nBecause our Class B Common Stock may be deemed a low-priced \u201cpenny\u201d stock, an investment in our Class B Common Stock should be considered high risk and subject to marketability restrictions.\nWhen the trading price of our Class B Common Stock is $5.00 per share or lower, it is deemed a penny stock, as defined in Rule 3a51-1 under the Exchange Act, and subject to the penny stock rules of the Exchange Act specified in rules 15g-1 through 15g-10. Those rules require broker-dealers, before effecting transactions in any penny stock, to:\n\u25cf\ndeliver to the customer, and obtain a written receipt for, a disclosure document;\n\u25cf\ndisclose certain price information about the stock;\n\u25cf\ndisclose the amount of compensation received by the broker-dealer or any associated person of the broker-dealer;\n\u25cf\nsend monthly statements to customers with market and price information about the penny stock; and\n\u25cf\nin some circumstances, approve the purchaser\u2019s account under certain standards and deliver written statements to the customer with information specified in the rules.\nConsequently, if our Class B Common Stock is $5.00 per share price or lower, the penny stock rules may restrict the ability or willingness of broker-dealers to sell the Class B Common Stock and may affect the ability of holders to sell their Class B Common Stock in the secondary market and the price at which such holders can sell any such securities. These additional procedures could also limit our ability to raise additional capital in the future.\nA significant portion of our total outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock is restricted from immediate resale but may be sold into the market in the near future. This could cause the market price of our Class B Common Stock to drop significantly, even if our business is doing well.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our Class B Common Stock in the public market or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of our Class B Common Stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. We are unable to predict the effect that sales may have on the prevailing market price of our Class B Common Stock.\nOn February 8, 2017, our executive officers, directors, and certain stockholders entered into an Amended and Restated Stockholders Agreement (the \u201cStockholders Agreement\u201d), restricting the stockholders\u2019 ability to transfer shares of our common stock through the earlier of (i) October 19, 2017, or (ii) the date on which we receive at least $3,500,000 in proceeds of any equity financing, subject to certain exceptions. Approximately 7.3 million shares of our Class B Common Stock were subject to these restrictions. In addition to the Stockholders Agreement, our executive officers, directors and certain stockholders entered into lock-up agreements, which restricted the sale of our common stock by such parties through December 31, 2017. Approximately 7.1 million shares of our Class B Common Stock were subject to these lock-up agreements. In addition, approximately 6.3 million shares of our Class B Common Stock are currently subject to a contractual lock-up through April 21, 2018 with the underwriters of the 2017 Public Offering. Subject to certain limitations, including sales volume limitations with respect to shares held by our affiliates, following April 21, 2018, substantially all of our outstanding shares of common stock will become eligible for sale. Sales of stock by the stockholders currently subject to these lock-ups could have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nWe do not currently or for the foreseeable future intend to pay dividends on our common stock.\nWe have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We currently do not intend to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future on the shares of common stock. We intend to reinvest any earning in the development and expansion of our business. As a result, any return on your investment in our common stock will be limited to the appreciation in the price of our common stock, if any.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the JOBS Act of 2012, and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (\u201cJOBS Act\u201d), and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and shareholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nWe will remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d for up to five years, although we will lose that status sooner if our revenue exceeds $1 billion, if we issue more than $1 billion in non-convertible debt in a three-year period, or if the market value of our common stock that is held by non-affiliates exceeds $700 million.\nEven if we no longer qualify as an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d we may still be subject to reduced reporting requirements so long as we are considered a \u201csmaller reporting company.\u201d\nMany of the exemptions available for emerging growth companies are also available to smaller reporting companies like us that have less than $75 million of worldwide common equity held by non-affiliates. So, although we may no longer qualify as an emerging growth company, we may still be subject to reduced reporting requirements.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, stockholders could lose confidence in our financial and other public reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our common stock.\nEffective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and, together with adequate disclosure controls and procedures, are designed to prevent fraud. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. In addition, any testing by us conducted in connection with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, or any subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm, may reveal deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses or that may require prospective or retroactive changes to our financial statements or identify other areas for further attention or improvement. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nWe are required to disclose changes made in our internal controls and procedures on a quarterly basis and our management will be required to assess the effectiveness of these controls annually. However, for as long as we are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the JOBS Act, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404. We could be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d for up to five years. An independent assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls could detect problems that our management\u2019s assessment might not. Undetected material weaknesses in our internal controls could lead to financial statement restatements and require us to incur the expense of remediation.\nAnti-takeover provisions may limit the ability of another party to acquire us, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nNevada law and our charter, bylaws, and other governing documents contain provisions that could discourage, delay or prevent a third party from acquiring us, even if doing so may be beneficial to our stockholders, which could cause our stock price to decline. In addition, these provisions could limit the price investors would be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock.", "PERMNO": 16999, "SIC": 5961, "TIC": "RMBL"}
