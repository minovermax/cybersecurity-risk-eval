{"cik": "701374", "company": "Six Flags Entertainment Corp", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-02-24", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A.RISK FACTORS\nSet forth below are the principal risks that we believe are most significant to our business and should be considered by our security holders. We operate in a continually changing business environment and, therefore, new risks emerge from time to time. This section contains forward-looking statements. For an explanation of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements, see \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.\"\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has had, and could continue to have, a significant negative impact on our financial condition and operations.\nSince early 2020, the world has been, and continues to be, impacted by COVID-19 and its variants. COVID-19 and measures to prevent its spread has impacted our business especially when we were required to temporarily suspend operations at our theme parks and waterparks in March 2020. Many of our parks resumed operations, generally at reduced capacity, at various points beginning in June 2020. As of January 2, 2022, we expect all of our parks to open in accordance with their normal operating schedules, subject at certain locations to moderate restrictions due to the pandemic.\nThe impacts of COVID-19 on our business will continue for an unknown length of time. Future developments relating to COVID-19, including severity, rate of transmission, variants, treatment, testing and vaccinations, are uncertain and difficult to predict. Additionally, COVID-19 impacts that have subsided (such as temporary park closures, operating at reduced capacity and requiring advanced reservations) may again impact our business in the future and new impacts may emerge from COVID-19 developments or other pandemics.\nOur mitigation efforts in response to the impacts of COVID-19 on our business have had, or may have, negative impacts. We reduced seasonal labor during the period that our parks were closed or operating under capacity restrictions and extended the benefits of 2020 season passes and memberships through 2021. During 2020, we increased the available borrowings under the Second Amended and Restated Credit Facility by $131 million, issued $725 million of senior secured notes, deferred or eliminated certain capital projects, reduced certain discretionary spending (such as spending on marketing), temporarily reduced salaries for full-time employees, and did not pay a dividend on Holdings\u2019 common stock. These and other of our mitigating actions may have an adverse impact on our business. Additionally, there are limitations on our ability to mitigate the adverse financial impact of COVID-19, including the fixed costs of operating our business and the impact COVID-19 may have on capital markets and our cost of borrowing.\nGovernmental authorities have issued and continue to issue a variety of mandates in an effort to slow the spread of COVID-19, including travel restrictions, border closures, restrictions on public gatherings, capacity limits, \u201cshelter at home\u2019\u2019 orders and advisories, and quarantine requirements. The impact of any future outbreak of any COVID-19 variants or any other highly infectious or contagious disease is unpredictable and could result in further restrictions. Additionally, we may impose our own COVID-19 related restrictions in addition to what is required by state and local governments in the interest of safety for our guests and employees. Any of these measures could further disrupt our operations, or have a negative impact on our financial results. If future developments require subsequent disruptive measures to be implemented, such as prolonged park closures, our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation may be materially and adversely affected.\nConsumers may change their behavior and consumption patterns in response the pandemic. The demand for our parks, other entertainment and recreation activities generally, and discretionary travel is highly sensitive to downturns in the economy and the corresponding impact on discretionary consumer spending. Any actual or perceived deterioration or weakness in general, regional or local economic conditions, unemployment levels, the job or housing markets, consumer debt levels or consumer confidence, as well as other adverse economic or market conditions due to COVID-19 or otherwise, may reduce our customers\u2019 discretionary income to spend on parks, entertainment, recreation activities and travel. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic could have longer-term impacts on consumer tastes and preferences and could shift consumer entertainment and recreation behaviors toward digital entertainment experiences and other off-premises experiences and technologies. As a result, attendance, revenue and per capita spending at our theme parks and waterparks could be adversely affected, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations, liquidity, cash flows, financial condition, and prospects.\nThe extent and duration of the impact of the ongoing pandemic on our operations, financial performance and condition, liquidity and cash flows, will depend largely on future developments, including the duration of the pandemic and any variants that may be highly contagious and/or impact the effectiveness of vaccines, vaccination rates in the communities in which we operate, any continuing or newly imposed travel restrictions or vaccination requirements in connection with travel, and the related impact on factors affecting guest behavior, including individuals\u2019 risk tolerance regarding health matters going forward, consumer confidence and spending, all of which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nThe ongoing pandemic continues to present material uncertainty and risk with respect to our operations, financial performance and condition, liquidity and cash flows. To the extent the pandemic adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in the Risk Factors in this Annual Report. Any future outbreak of any other highly infectious or contagious disease could have a similar impact.\nGeneral economic conditions may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur results can be impacted by a number of macroeconomic factors, including but not limited to consumer confidence and spending levels, tax rates, unemployment, consumer credit availability, raw materials costs, pandemics (such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic) and natural disasters, fuel and energy costs (including oil prices), and credit market conditions. The COVID-19 pandemic has severely impacted and will likely continue to impact many of these factors. A general economic slowdown or recession resulting in a decrease in discretionary spending could adversely affect the frequency with which guests choose to visit our parks and the amount that our guests spend when they visit.\nAdditionally, difficult economic conditions throughout the world, including global supply chain issues, could impact our ability to obtain supplies, services and credit as well as the ability of third parties to meet their obligations to us, including, for example, manufacturers\u2019 ability to supply rides, payment of claims by our insurance carriers, funding of our lines of credit, or payment by our international agreement partner. Changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies could reduce international demand for our products, increase our labor and supply costs in non-U.S. markets or reduce the U.S. dollar value of revenue we earn in other markets.\nOur growth strategy and strategic plan may not achieve the anticipated results.\nOur future success depends on our ability to grow and evolve our business, including through capital investments to improve existing parks, rides, attractions and other entertainment offerings, technological advancements and improvements to enhance the guest experience and to increase productivity, as well as through our food and beverage and retail offerings.\nOur strategies may not enhance guest experiences or increase productivity as planned, may not increase our revenues at the rate we expect or at all, and may require the expenditure of capital resources or operating costs in excess of what we originally budgeted and allocated for such purposes. In addition, our increased focus on improving our food and beverage offerings and simplifying our admissions products may not be successful. If we are unable to achieve our strategic objectives and grow and evolve our business, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nBad or extreme weather conditions and forecasts of bad or mixed weather conditions, which may be due to climate change, can adversely impact attendance at our parks.\nBecause most of the attractions at our parks are outdoors, attendance at our parks is adversely affected by bad or extreme weather conditions and forecasts of bad or mixed weather conditions that may be a result of climate change, which negatively affects our revenues. The effects of bad weather on attendance can be more pronounced at our waterparks. We believe our operating results in certain years were adversely affected by abnormally hot, cold and/or wet weather in a number of our major U.S. markets. In addition, since a number of our parks are geographically concentrated in the eastern portion of the United States, a weather pattern that affects that area could adversely affect a number of our parks and disproportionately impact our results of operations. In addition, our parks in California and Texas are more likely to be impacted by extreme heat, wildfires, mudslides and floods, which may be exacerbated by the effects of climate change, than our parks in other locations. Bad weather and forecasts of bad weather on weekends, holidays or other peak periods will typically have a greater negative impact on our revenues and could disproportionately impact our results of operations.\nConditions beyond our control could damage our properties and could adversely impact attendance at our parks and result in decreased revenues.\nNatural disasters, public heath crises, epidemics, pandemics, such as the outbreak of COVID-19, terrorist activities, power outages or other events outside our control could disrupt our operations, impair critical systems, damage our properties or reduce attendance at our parks or require temporary park closures. Damage to our properties could take a long time to repair and there is no guarantee that we would have adequate insurance to cover the costs of repair or the expense of the interruption to our business. Furthermore, natural disasters such as fires, earthquakes or hurricanes may\ninterrupt or impede access to our affected properties or require evacuations and may cause attendance at our affected properties to decrease for an indefinite period. For example, our waterpark in Oaxtepec, Mexico was closed for several months during 2017 following the earthquakes in central Mexico. The occurrence of such events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, since some of our parks are near major urban areas and appeal to teenagers and young adults, there may be disturbances at one or more parks that could negatively affect our reputation or brand. This may result in a decrease in attendance at the affected parks and could adversely impact our results of operations. While we work with local law enforcement authorities on security-related precautions to prevent certain types of disturbances, we can make no assurance that these precautions will be able to prevent or mitigate these types of events.\nWe cannot predict the frequency, duration or severity of these activities and the effect that they may have on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur operations are seasonal.\nOur operations are seasonal. In a typical year, approximately 75% of our annual park attendance and revenue occurs during the second and third calendar quarters of each year. As a result, when conditions or events described in the above risk factors occur during the operating season, particularly during the peak months of July and August, there is only a limited period of time during which the impact of those conditions or events can be mitigated. Accordingly, such conditions or events may have a disproportionately adverse effect on our revenues and cash flow. In addition, most of our maintenance and capital expenses are incurred in the off-season. For this reason, a sequential quarter-to-quarter comparison is not a good indication of our performance or of how we will perform in the future.\nAdverse litigation judgments or settlements resulting from legal proceedings in which we may be involved in the normal course of our business could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are subject to allegations, claims and legal actions arising in the ordinary course of our business, which may include claims by third parties, including guests who visit our parks, our employees or regulators. The outcome of these proceedings cannot be predicted. If any of these proceedings is determined adversely to us, or if we receive a judgment, a fine or a settlement involving a payment of a material sum of money, or injunctive relief is issued against us, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. Litigation can also be expensive, lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations, including to our management due to the increased time and resources required to respond to and address the litigation.\nAdditionally, from time to time, animal activist and other third party groups may make negative public statements about us or bring claims before government agencies or lawsuits against us. Such claims and lawsuits sometimes are based on allegations that we do not properly care for some of our featured animals. On other occasions, such claims and/or lawsuits are specifically designed to change existing law or enact new law in order to impede our ability to retain, exhibit, acquire or breed animals. While we seek to comply with all applicable federal and state laws and vigorously defend ourselves in any lawsuits, there are no assurances as to the outcome of future claims and lawsuits that could be brought against us. An unfavorable outcome in any legal proceeding could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, associated negative publicity could adversely affect our reputation, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailures in, material damage to, or interruptions in our information technology systems, software or websites and difficulties in updating our systems or software or implementing new systems or software could adversely affect our business or operations.\nWe rely extensively on our information technology systems in the conduct of our business. We use software and other technology systems, among other things, to sell tickets and admit guests to our parks, to sell food, beverages and other products in our parks, to manage our workforce, to manage our inventory, and to monitor and manage our business on a day-to-day basis. We also use mobile devices, social networking and other online platforms to connect with our employees, business partners and customers. These technology systems and our uses thereof are vulnerable to damage or\ndisruption from circumstances beyond our control including fire, natural disasters, power outages, system and equipment failures, viruses, malicious attacks, security breaches, theft, and inadvertent release of information. Damage or disruption to these technology systems may require a significant investment to update, remediate or replace with alternate systems, and we may suffer disruptions in our operations as a result.\nWe rely on third parties for the performance of a significant portion of our information technology functions. In particular, our ticket, season pass and membership sales system relies on data communications networks and technology systems and software operated by third parties. The success of our business depends in part on maintaining our relationships with these third parties and their continuing ability to perform these functions and services in a timely and satisfactory manner. If we experience a loss or disruption in the provision of any of these functions or services, or they are not performed in a satisfactory manner, we may have difficulty in finding alternate providers on terms favorable to us, in a timely manner or at all, and our business could be adversely affected.\nFurther, as we implement our strategy to pursue new initiatives that improve our operations and cost structure, we are also expanding and upgrading our information technologies. Potential problems and disruptions associated with the implementation of new or upgraded systems and technology or with maintenance or adequate support of existing systems could also disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our operations. Any material interruptions or failures in our systems, including those that may result from our failure to adequately develop, implement and maintain a robust disaster recovery plan and backup systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, could adversely affect our business operations and financial performance.\nCyber-attacks could have a disruptive effect on our business.\nOur business involves the storage and transmission of numerous classes of sensitive and/or confidential information and intellectual property, including guests\u2019 personal information, private information about employees and financial and strategic information about the Company and our business.\nWe have experienced and continue to experience cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities in our systems and those of our third party providers, including cyber-attacks targeting our information technology systems and networks, which could result in a loss of sensitive business or customer information, systems interruption or the disruption of our operations.\nFurther, implementing our strategy to pursue new initiatives that improve our operations and cost structure will result in a larger technological presence and corresponding exposure to cybersecurity risk. Failure to adequately assess and identify cybersecurity risks associated with new initiatives would increase our vulnerability to such risks.\nDue to the increased remote workforce, we must increasingly rely on information technology systems that are outside our direct control. These systems are potentially vulnerable to cyber-based attacks and security breaches. In addition, cyber criminals are increasing their attacks on individual employees, utilizing interest in pandemic-related information to increase business email compromise scams designed to trick victims into transferring sensitive data or funds, or steal credentials that compromise information systems.\nEven if we are fully compliant with legal standards and contractual or other requirements, we still may not be able to prevent security breaches involving sensitive data. We have, and require certain of our third party service providers to have, programs in place to detect, contain and respond to data security incidents. However, the actions and controls we have implemented and continue to implement, or which we seek to cause or have caused third party service providers to implement, may be insufficient to protect our systems, information or other intellectual property. In addition, the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or interfere with systems change frequently and may be difficult to detect for long periods of time, and we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventive measures. The sophistication of efforts by hackers to gain unauthorized access to information technology systems has continued to increase in recent years. Breaches, thefts, losses or fraudulent uses of customer, employee or company data could cause customers to lose confidence in the security of our websites, mobile applications, point of sale systems and other information technology systems and choose not to purchase from us. Such security breaches also could expose us\nto risks of data loss, business disruption, litigation and other costs or liabilities, any of which could adversely affect our business.\nTo date, these cybersecurity threats have not had a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. However, the potential consequences of a future material cybersecurity attack on us or our third party service providers include business disruption; disruption to systems; theft, destruction, loss, corruption, misappropriation or unauthorized release of sensitive and/or confidential information or intellectual property (including personal information in violation of one or more privacy laws); reputational and brand damage; and potential liability, including litigation or other legal actions against us or the imposition by governmental authorities of penalties, fines, fees or liabilities, which, in turn, could cause us to incur significantly increased cybersecurity protection and remediation costs and the loss of customers.\nFailure to keep pace with developments in technology could adversely affect our operations or competitive position.\nThe theme park and waterpark industry demands the use of sophisticated technology and systems for operation of our parks, ticket, membership and season pass sales and management, and labor and inventory management. Information technology systems continue to evolve and, in order to remain competitive, we must implement new technologies and systems in a timely and efficient manner. The development and maintenance of these technologies may require significant investment by us and we may not achieve the anticipated benefits from such new developments or upgrades.\nThere is a risk of accidents occurring at our parks or competing parks which may reduce attendance and negatively impact our operations.\nOur brand and our reputation are among our most important assets. Our ability to attract and retain customers depends, in part, upon the external perceptions of the Company, the quality and safety of our parks, services and rides, and our corporate and management integrity. While we carefully maintain the safety of our rides, there are inherent risks involved with these attractions. An accident or an injury (including water- or air-borne illnesses) at any of our parks or at parks operated by competitors, particularly an accident or injury involving the safety of guests and employees, that receives media attention, could negatively impact our brand or reputation, cause loss of consumer confidence in the Company, reduce attendance at our parks, and negatively impact our results of operations. For example, in September 2019, a coaster accident at La Feria, a competing park in Mexico, resulted in two fatalities. We believe that the publicity surrounding this accident had a significant negative impact on attendance at our park in Mexico during that period. The considerable expansion in the use of social media over recent years has compounded the impact of negative publicity. If any such incident occurs during a time of high seasonal demand, the effect could disproportionately impact our results of operations for the year.\nIncreases in labor costs and employee health and welfare benefits could have a negative impact on our cash flows, financial condition, and results of operations.\nLabor is a primary component in the cost of operating our business. We devote significant resources to recruiting and training our employees in order to meet our guests\u2019 high expectations for service. Wage and benefit increases to attract and retain employees in a tight labor market have driven-up labor costs. These increased costs pressure our margins and could have a negative impact on our financial results. Our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous external factors, including market pressures with respect to prevailing wage rates, unemployment levels, and health and other insurance costs, as well as the impact of legislation or regulations governing labor relations, minimum wage, and healthcare benefits. Our results of operations are also substantially affected by costs of retirement, including as a result of macroeconomic factors beyond our control, such as declines in investment returns on pension plan assets and changes in discount rates used to calculate pension and related liabilities.\nIn addition, we may experience material increase in the cost of securing our seasonal workforce in the future. Increased minimum wage requirements, seasonal wages or an inadequate workforce could have an adverse impact on our results of operations. We anticipate that the recent increases to the minimum wage rates will increase our salary, wage and benefit expenses in 2022 and future years and further legislative changes or competitive wage rates could continue to increase these expenses in the future.\nAdditionally, we contribute to multiple defined benefit multiemployer pension plans on behalf of our collectively bargained employees of Six Flags Great Adventure LLC. If we were to cease contributing to or otherwise incur a withdrawal from any such plans, we could be obligated to pay withdrawal liability assessments based on the underfunded status (if any) of such plans at the time of the withdrawal. The amount of any multiemployer pension plan underfunding can fluctuate from year to year, and thus there is a possibility that the amount of withdrawal liability that we could incur in the future could be material, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition.\nWe depend on a seasonal workforce to meet our operational needs.\nOur park operations depend in part on our ability to attract, train, motivate and retain qualified employees, many of whom are seasonal employees. We seek to manage seasonal wages and the timing of the hiring process to ensure the appropriate workforce is in place for peak and low seasons. If we are unable to hire sufficient personnel or successfully manage our seasonal workforce needs, we may not be able to meet our operational needs and our financial results could be negatively impacted.\nThe theme park and waterpark industry competes with numerous entertainment alternatives and such competition may have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur parks compete with other theme parks, waterparks and amusement parks and with other types of recreational facilities and forms of entertainment, including movies, home entertainment options, sporting events, restaurants and vacation travel. Our business is also subject to factors that affect the recreation and leisure time industries generally, such as general economic conditions, including relative fuel prices, and changes in consumer spending habits. The principal competitive factors of a park include location, price, the uniqueness and perceived quality of the rides and attractions, the atmosphere and cleanliness of the park and the quality of its food and entertainment. If we are unable to compete effectively against entertainment alternatives or on the basis of principal competitive factors of the park, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe could be adversely affected by changes in consumer tastes and preferences for entertainment and consumer products.\nThe success of our parks depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that can change in often unpredictable ways and on our ability to ensure that our parks meet the changing preferences of the broad consumer market. We conduct research and analysis before acquiring new parks or opening new rides or attractions and often invest substantial amounts before we learn the extent to which these new parks and new rides or attractions will earn consumer acceptance. If visitor volumes at our parks were to decline significantly or if new rides and entertainment offerings at our parks do not achieve sufficient consumer acceptance, revenues and margins may decline. Our results of operations may also be adversely affected if we fail to retain long-term customer loyalty or provide satisfactory customer service.\nData privacy regulation and our ability to comply could harm our business.\nWe are subject to laws that regulate the collection, use, retention, security, and transfer of our customer\u2019s data. Data privacy is subject to frequently changing rules and regulations, such as California\u2019s Consumer Privacy Act (the \u201cCCPA\u201d) that became effective January 1, 2020, which provides a private right of action for data breaches and requires companies that process information on California residents to make certain disclosures to consumers about their data collection, use and sharing practices and allow consumers to opt out of certain data sharing with third parties. Compliance with the CCPA, and other current and future applicable privacy and related laws can be costly and time-consuming, and violations of privacy-related laws can result in significant damages and penalties. These laws continue to evolve in ways we cannot predict, both through regulatory and legislative action and judicial decisions, and that may harm our business.\nOur privacy policies and practices concerning the collection, use and disclosure of user data are available on our website. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with our posted privacy policies or with any regulatory requirements or orders or other privacy or consumer protection-related laws and regulations, including the CCPA, could result in proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others (e.g., class action privacy litigation), subject\nus to significant penalties and negative publicity, require us to change our business practices, increase our costs and adversely affect our business. Data collection, privacy and security have become the subject of increasing public concern. If internet and mobile users were to reduce their use of our websites, mobile platforms, products, and services as a result of these concerns, our business could be harmed.\nOur insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all possible losses that we could suffer, and our insurance costs may increase.\nAlthough we maintain various safety and loss prevention programs and carry property and casualty insurance to cover certain risks, our insurance policies do not cover all types of losses and liabilities. Additionally, there can be no assurance our insurance will be sufficient to cover the full extent of all losses or liabilities for which we are insured. The majority of our current insurance policies have annual terms and expire on December 31, 2022, and we cannot guarantee we will be able to renew our current insurance policies on favorable terms, or at all. In addition, if we or other theme or waterpark operators sustain significant losses or make significant insurance claims, then our ability to obtain future insurance coverage at commercially reasonable rates could be materially adversely affected. If our insurance coverage is not adequate, or we become subject to damages that cannot by law be insured against, such as punitive damages or certain intentional misconduct by our employees, this could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nIf we are not able to fund capital expenditures and invest in future attractions and projects in our parks, our revenues could be negatively impacted.\nBecause a principal competitive factor for a theme park or a waterpark is the uniqueness and perceived quality of its rides and attractions, we need to make continued capital investments through maintenance and the regular addition of new rides and attractions. A key element for our revenue growth is strategic capital spending on such investments. Our ability to fund capital expenditures will depend on our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations and to raise capital from third parties. We cannot provide assurance our operations will be able to generate sufficient cash flow to fund such costs, or that we will be able to obtain sufficient financing on adequate terms, or at all, which could cause us to delay or abandon certain projects or plans. In addition, any construction delays or ride downtime can adversely affect our attendance and our ability to realize revenue growth.\nIncidents involving food contamination, product recalls, product liability claims and associated costs could adversely affect our reputation and our financial condition.\nThe sale of food, toys and other retail products involves legal and other risks. While we dedicate substantial resources to food safety matters to enable customers to enjoy safe, quality food products, food safety events, including instances of food-borne illness (such as salmonella or E. Coli) could occur in our parks. Instances or reports, whether true or not, of food-safety issues could negatively affect our sales and reputation and could possibly lead to product liability claims, litigation (including class actions), or other damages. We may need to recall food products if they become contaminated, and we may need to recall toys, games or other retail merchandise if there is a design or product defect. Even though we are resellers of food, toys and other retail products, we may be liable if the consumption or purchase of any of the products we sell causes illness or injury. A recall could result in losses due to the cost of the recall, the destruction of product and lost sales due to the unavailability of product for a period of time. A significant food or retail product recall could also result in adverse publicity, damage to our reputation and loss of consumer confidence in our parks, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may be unable to purchase or contract with third parties to manufacture theme park or waterpark rides and attractions.\nWe may be unable to purchase or contract with third parties to build high quality rides and attractions and to continue to service and maintain those rides and attractions at competitive or beneficial prices, or to provide the replacement parts needed to maintain the operation of such rides. Global supply chain issues may also cause delays in the receipt of required goods or services. In addition, if our third party suppliers\u2019 financial condition deteriorates or they\ngo out of business, we may not be able to obtain the full benefit of manufacturer warranties or indemnities typically contained in our contracts or may need to incur greater costs for the maintenance, repair, replacement or insurance of these assets.\nWe may not be able to realize the benefits of our international agreements.\nVarious external factors, including difficult economic and political conditions throughout the world, could negatively affect the progress of our initiatives to develop new Six Flags-branded parks outside of North America. These initiatives could be delayed, and the ultimate success of such parks may be uncertain. For example, on February 14, 2020, we terminated our agreements with our partner in China to build parks as a result of its uncured payment defaults.\nSome factors that will be important to the success of our international agreement initiatives are different than those affecting our existing parks. Tastes naturally vary by region, and consumers in new international markets into which we expand our brand may not embrace the parks\u2019 offerings to the same extent as consumers in our existing markets. International agreements are also subject to additional risks, including the performance of our partners and their ability to obtain financing and government approvals; the impact of economic fluctuations in economies outside of the U.S.; difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations due to distance, language and cultural differences; changes or uncertainties in economic, legal, regulatory, social and political conditions; the enforceability of intellectual property and contract rights; and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, currency controls, and potentially adverse tax consequences of overseas operations. If we do not realize the benefits of such transactions, it could have an adverse effect on our financial performance.\nOur leases contain default provisions that, if enforced or exercised by the landlord, could significantly impact our operations at those parks.\nOf our 27 theme parks and waterparks, 12 are located on property that we lease and do not own. Certain of our leases permit the landlord to terminate the lease if there is a default under the lease, including, for example, our failure to pay rent, utilities and applicable taxes in a timely fashion or to maintain certain insurance. If a landlord were to terminate a lease, it would halt our operations at that park and, depending on the size of the park, could have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, any disputes that may result from such a termination may be expensive to pursue and may divert money and management\u2019s attention from our other operations and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability or material increase in the cost to protect them could adversely affect our business.\nOur intellectual property, including our trademarks and domain names and other proprietary rights, constitutes a significant part of our value. To protect our intellectual property rights, we rely upon a combination of trademark, trade secret and unfair competition laws of the United States and other countries, as well as contract provisions and third party policies and procedures governing internet/domain name registrations. However, there can be no assurance these measures will be successful in any given case, particularly in those countries where the laws do not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the United States. We may be unable to prevent the misappropriation, infringement or violation of our intellectual property rights, breach of any contractual obligations to us, or independent development of intellectual property that is similar to ours, any of which could reduce or eliminate any competitive advantage we have developed, adversely affect our revenues or otherwise harm our business. In addition, pursuant to our license agreements, we have exclusive theme park usage rights in the U.S. (except for the Las Vegas metropolitan area), Canada and Mexico to certain Warner Bros. and DC Comics animated characters. The license fee is subject to periodic scheduled adjustments and CPI increases, and Warner Bros. has the right to terminate the agreements under certain circumstances, such as a default under the Subordinated Indemnity Agreement. The termination of these licenses, or a material increase in the cost to retain these licenses, could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition.\nUnionization activities or labor disputes may disrupt our operations and affect our profitability.\nAs of January 2, 2022, approximately 9% of our full-time and approximately 11% of our seasonal employees were subject to labor agreements with local chapters of national unions. We have collective bargaining agreements in place for certain employees at Six Flags Over Georgia, Six Flags Magic Mountain, Six Flags Great Adventure, Six Flags Over Texas, Six Flags St. Louis, and La Ronde. New unionization activity or a labor dispute involving our employees could disrupt our operations and reduce our revenues, and resolution of unionization activities or labor disputes could increase our costs. Litigation relating to employment and/or wage and hour disputes could also increase our operating expenses. Such disrupted operations, reduced revenues or increased costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations and our ownership of property subject us to environmental, health and safety, climate change, and other regulations, which create uncertainty regarding future expenditures and liabilities.\nOur operations involve wastewater and stormwater discharges and air emissions, and as a result are subject to environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and permitting requirements. These requirements are administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the states and localities where our parks are located (and can also often be enforced through citizen suit provisions) and include the requirements of the Clean Water Act and the Clean Air Act. Our operations also involve maintaining underground and aboveground storage tanks, and managing and disposing of hazardous substances, chemicals and materials and are subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations regarding the use, generation, manufacture, storage, handling and disposal of these substances, chemicals and materials, including the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (\"CERCLA\"). A portion of our capital expenditures budget is intended to ensure continued compliance with environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and permitting requirements. In the event of contamination or injury as a result of a release of or exposure to regulated materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages. For example, pursuant to CERCLA, past and current owners and operators of facilities and persons arranging for disposal of hazardous substances may be held strictly, jointly and severally liable for costs to remediate releases and threatened releases of hazardous substances. The costs of investigation, remediation or removal of regulated materials may be substantial, and the presence of those substances, or the failure to remediate property properly, may impair our ability to use, transfer or obtain financing regarding our property. Our activities may be affected by new legislation or changes in existing environmental, health and safety laws. For example, the state or federal government having jurisdiction over a given area may enact legislation and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency or applicable state entity may propose new regulations or change existing regulations that could require our parks to reduce certain emissions or discharges. Such action could require our parks to install costly equipment or increase operating expenses. We may be required to incur costs to remediate potential environmental hazards, mitigate environmental risks in the future, or comply with other environmental requirements. Concern over climate change may result in new or increased legal and regulatory requirements to reduce or mitigate the effects of climate change on the environment. Increased costs of energy or compliance with emissions standards due to increased legal or regulatory requirements may cause disruptions in or increased costs associated with park services.\nWe also are subject to federal and state laws, which prohibit discrimination and other laws regulating the design and operation of facilities, such as the Americans With Disabilities Act. Compliance with these laws and regulations can be costly and increase our exposure to litigation and governmental proceedings, and a failure or perceived failure to comply with these laws could result in negative publicity that could harm our reputation, which could adversely affect our business.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness and Common Stock\nA portion of our cash flow is required to be used to fund our substantial monetary obligations.\nWe have significant financial obligations under our debt instruments and the Partnership Park arrangements. See the Partnership Parks section in Note 15, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report for a detailed discussion of our obligations with respect to the Partnership Parks. In the event of a default by us under the Partnership Parks arrangements, Time Warner has the right to take control of the Partnership\nParks. In addition, such a default could trigger an event of default under the Credit Agreement. See \"Business-Partnership Park Arrangements\" for additional information.\nIf we are unable to make payments on our debt or satisfy our other obligations, or if we fail to obtain future financing that may be necessary for working capital, capital expenditures, payment of debt, or the Partnership Park obligations, it could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe plan to strategically reinvest in our properties to improve the guest experience and our business plan includes targeted annual capital spending. However, depending on various factors including strategic initiatives, the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, unanticipated delays in the completion of our projects, weather conditions, increased labor costs, and availability and cost of ride components, we may spend more or less than our planned target amount. In 2021, we spent $121.7 million on capital expenditures, net of property insurance recoveries.\nWe cannot be sure that cash generated from our parks will be as high as we expect or that our expenses will not be higher than we expect. Because a portion of our expenses are fixed in any given year, our operating cash flows are highly dependent on revenues, which are largely driven by attendance levels, in-park sales, accommodations and sponsorship and international agreement activity. A lower amount of cash generated from our parks or higher expenses than expected, when coupled with our debt obligations, could adversely affect our ability to fund our operations.\nOur leverage could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry, and prevent us from meeting our obligations under our indebtedness.\nAs of January 2, 2022, our total indebtedness was approximately $2.639 billion. Our high degree of leverage could have important consequences, including the following: (i) a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations is dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on indebtedness, thereby reducing the funds available for operations, capital expenditures, future business opportunities and/or repurchases of Holdings common stock; (ii) our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, acquisitions and general corporate purposes in the future may be limited; (iii) certain of the borrowings are at variable rates of interest, which will increase our vulnerability to increases in interest rates; (iv) we are at a competitive disadvantage to less leveraged competitors; (v) we may be unable to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions; (vi) the debt service requirements of our other indebtedness could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations; and (vii) we may be vulnerable in a downturn in general economic conditions or in our business and we may be unable to carry out activities that are important to our growth.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, or to pay interest on, or to refinance indebtedness depends on and is subject to our financial and operating performance, which in turn is affected by general and regional economic, financial, competitive, business and other factors beyond our control, including the availability of financing in the banking and capital markets. If unable to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs, we will need to restructure or refinance all or a portion of our debt, which could cause us to default on our obligations and impair our liquidity. There can be no assurance that any refinancing of our indebtedness will be possible and any such refinancing could be at higher interest rates and may require us to comply with more onerous covenants that could further restrict our business operations. If we are unable to meet our debt obligations or to fund our other liquidity needs, we may be forced to reduce or delay strategic initiatives and capital expenditures, sell material assets or operations, obtain additional capital or restructure our debt, which could cause us to default on our debt obligations and impair our liquidity. We from time to time may increase the amount of our indebtedness, modify the terms of our financing arrangements, make capital expenditures, issue dividends and take other actions that may substantially increase our leverage.\nDespite our significant leverage, we may incur additional amounts of debt, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our significant leverage.\nChanges to, or the elimination of, LIBOR may adversely affect interest expense related to our indebtedness.\nBorrowings under the Second Amended and Restated Term Loan B are calculated on a London Inter-Bank Offered Rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d) plus an additional percentage based on credit risk. LIBOR is the subject of recent proposals for reform. In July 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. At the end of 2021, the ICE Benchmark Administration, the administrator for LIBOR, ceased publishing one-week and two-month U.S. dollar LIBOR and will cease publishing all remaining U.S. dollar LIBOR tenors in mid-2023. These reforms may cause LIBOR to cease to exist, new methods of calculating LIBOR to be established or the establishment of an alternative reference rate. The consequences cannot be entirely predicted and could have an adverse impact on the interest payments under our debt. Changes in market interest rates may influence our future financing costs and could reduce our earnings and cash flows.\nThe stock price of Holdings\u2019 common stock may change significantly, and you may not be able to sell shares of Holdings\u2019 common stock at or above the price you paid or at all, and you could lose all or part of your investment as a result.\nThe trading price of Holdings\u2019 common stock has been, and may continue to be, volatile. In addition to the risk factors discussed in this Annual Report, the trading price of Holdings\u2019 common stock may be adversely affected due to a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including: (i) our operating and financial performance; (ii) our ability to repay our debt; (iii) our ability to refinance our debt; (iv) investor perceptions of us and the industry and markets in which we operate; (v) our dividend policy; (vi) changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by analysts; and (viii) general financial, domestic, economic and other market conditions.\nIn addition, our business and long-range planning process is designed to maximize our long-term strength, growth, and profitability. We believe that this longer-term focus is in the best interests of the Company and stockholders. At the same time, however, we recognize that, when possible, it is helpful to provide investors with guidance as to our forecast of EBITDA and other financial metrics or projections from time to time. We do not have any responsibility to provide guidance or to update any of our forward-looking statements at such times or otherwise. In addition, any longer-term guidance that we provide is based on goals that we believe, at the time guidance is given, are reasonably attainable for growth and performance over a number of years. However, such long-range targets are difficult to predict. For example, in 2016 we established a long-term aspirational goal to achieve Modified EBITDA of $750 million by 2020 but this goal was not ultimately achieved. If, or when, we announce actual results that differ from those that have been predicted by us, outside investment analysts, or others, our stock price could be adversely affected. Investors who rely on these stated goals when making investment decisions with respect to our securities do so at their own risk. We take no responsibility for any losses suffered as a result of such changes in our stock price.\nWe periodically return value to investors through payment of quarterly dividends and common stock repurchases. In 2020, pursuant to amendments to the Credit Agreement, we suspended our quarterly dividend payment and stock repurchase program due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic until the earlier December 31, 2022, or such time as Six Flags Theme Parks Inc. (\u201cSFTP\u201d) reduces the incremental revolving credit commitments by $131 million and begins using actual results to test covenant compliance. However, given the uncertainty associated with the ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and operations, we may determine that it is prudent to continue these suspensions for longer depending on any then-existing limitations on our working capital. Investors may have an expectation that we will resume our dividend at a certain time and at certain levels or repurchase shares available under Holdings\u2019 repurchase program. The stock price of Holdings\u2019 common stock could be adversely affected if our cash dividend rate or common stock repurchase activity differs from investors\u2019 expectations.\nOur existing debt agreements contain, and future debt agreements may contain, financial and other restrictions that limit our flexibility in operating our business.\nOur existing debt agreements contain, and documents governing our future indebtedness may contain, financial and operating covenants that limit the discretion of management with respect to certain business matters. These covenants place restrictions on, among other things, our ability to incur additional indebtedness, pay dividends and other distributions, create liens, make investments and other restricted payments, repurchase stock, engage in transactions with affiliates, sell certain assets or engage in mergers, acquisitions and other business combination. Our existing debt\nagreements also require, and documents governing our future indebtedness may require, us to meet certain financial ratios and tests.\nOur ability to comply with these and other provisions of the existing debt agreements is dependent on our future performance, which will be subject to many factors, some of which are beyond our control including weather and economic, financial and industry conditions. The breach of any of these covenants or non-compliance with any of these financial ratios and tests could result in an event of default under the existing debt agreements, which, if not cured or waived, could result in acceleration of the related debt and the acceleration of debt under other instruments evidencing indebtedness that may contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions. We cannot provide assurance that our liquidity would be sufficient to repay or refinance such indebtedness if it was accelerated upon an event of default. We discuss certain key covenants and financial ratios to which we are subject under our debt agreements in greater detail under the caption \u201cRestrictive Covenants\u201d in Note 8, Long-Term Indebtedness, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Annual Report and under \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations- Liquidity, Capital Commitments and Resources-Indebtedness-Covenant Compliance.\u201d\nChanges in our credit ratings could adversely affect the price of Holdings\u2019 common stock.\nWe receive debt ratings from the major credit rating agencies in the United States. Factors that may impact our credit ratings include the sizable attendance and revenue generated from our portfolio of geographically diversified regional theme parks and waterparks, vulnerability to cyclical discretionary consumer spending, and seasonality of our operations. As the result of the COVID-19 pandemic and impact of expanding restrictions and quarantines on the entertainment industry, the credit rating agencies lowered the ratings on several theme park companies in 2020. In June 2021, Moody\u2019s changed our outlook from \u201cnegative\u201d to \u201cstable\u201d and reaffirmed our issuer credit rating of B2 and reaffirmed our issuer-level ratings of Ba2 and B3 on our senior secured and senior unsecured issuances, respectively. Additionally, in June 2021, Standard and Poor\u2019s changed our outlook from \u201cnegative\u201d to \u201cpositive.\u201d In August 2021, Standard and Poor\u2019s increased our issuer credit rating from B- to B+ and our issue-level ratings from B to BB- and CCC to B- on our senior secured and senior unsecured issuances, respectively, while maintaining a \u201cpositive\u201d outlook. We cannot provide assurance our ratings will improve or remain the same. A negative change in our ratings or the perception such a change might occur could adversely affect the market price of Holdings\u2019 common stock.\nHoldings is a holding company and is dependent on dividends and other distributions from its subsidiaries.\nHoldings is a holding company and substantially all of its operations are conducted through direct and indirect subsidiaries. As a holding company, it has no significant assets other than its equity interests in its subsidiaries. Accordingly, Holdings is dependent on dividends and other distributions from its subsidiaries to meet its obligations, including the obligations under the Company\u2019s debt agreements, and, at such time as dividend payments by Holdings are no longer suspended, to pay dividends on Holdings\u2019 common stock. If these dividends and other distributions are not sufficient for Holdings to meets its financial obligations, or not available to Holdings due to restrictions in the instruments governing our indebtedness, it could cause Holdings to default on its debt obligations, which would impair our liquidity and adversely affect our financial condition and our business. We had $335.6 million of cash and cash equivalents on a consolidated basis at January 2, 2022, of which $38.9 million was held at Holdings.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our organizational documents, debt agreements and Delaware law could delay or prevent change of control.\nCertain provisions in Holdings\u2019 charter, bylaws and debt agreements could have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a merger, takeover attempt, or other change of control transaction that a stockholder might consider in its best interest, including those attempts that might result in a premium price over the market price for shares of Holdings\u2019 common stock. Holdings is also subject to the anti-takeover provisions of Delaware law, which could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control in some circumstances.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe may not be able to attract and retain key management and other key employees.\nOur employees, particularly our key management, are vital to our success and difficult to replace. We may be unable to retain them or to attract other highly qualified employees, particularly if we do not offer employment terms competitive with the rest of the market. Failure to attract and retain highly qualified employees, or failure to develop and implement a viable succession plan, could result in inadequate depth of institutional knowledge or skill sets, adversely affecting our business.\nRisk related to tariffs and other duties\nWe source merchandise for resale and other products used in our business from entities located outside of North America. Additionally, some of our ride manufacturers may be located in foreign countries or may utilize components or materials manufactured or sourced from foreign countries. Our business exposes us to risks associated with global commerce, including changes to tariffs, quotas and other restrictions on imports. While existing tariffs and duties have not had a material impact on our business, the U.S. government may impose additional tariffs on thousands of products sourced from foreign countries and has expressed a willingness to impose additional or increased tariffs on goods imported from China, including many items that we purchase for our business. While the impact has been immaterial to date, tariffs or duties could lower our gross margin on impacted products. Additionally, even if the products that we import are not affected directly by tariffs or other duties, the imposition of such additional tariffs on goods imported into the United States could cause increased pricing of other consumer goods, which could lower the discretionary income of our potential guests and decrease attendance or in-park spending.\nWe may be subject to claims for infringing the intellectual property rights of others, which could be costly and result in the loss of intellectual property rights.\nWe cannot be certain that we do not and will not infringe the intellectual property rights of others. We have been in the past, and may be in the future, subject to litigation and other claims in the ordinary course of our business based on allegations of infringement or other violations of the intellectual property rights of others. Regardless of their merits, intellectual property claims can divert the efforts of our personnel and are often time-consuming and expensive to litigate or settle. In addition, to the extent claims against us are successful, we may have to pay substantial monetary damages or discontinue, modify, or rename certain products or services that are found to be in violation of another party\u2019s rights. We may have to seek a license (if available on acceptable terms, or at all) to continue offering products and services, which may increase our operating expenses.", "PERMNO": 93423, "SIC": 7996, "TIC": "SIX"}
