{"cik": "1020569", "company": "IRON MOUNTAIN INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-13", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nWe face many risks. If any of the events or circumstances described below actually occur, we and our businesses, financial condition or results of operations could suffer, and the trading price of our debt or equity securities could decline. Our current and potential investors should consider the following risks and the information contained under the heading \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" before deciding to invest in our securities.\nBusiness Risks\nOur customers may shift from paper and tape storage to alternative technologies that require less physical space.\nWe derive most of our revenues from rental fees for the storage of physical records and computer backup tapes and from storage related services. Alternative storage technologies exist, many of which require significantly less space than traditional physical records and tape storage, and as alternative technologies are adopted, storage volume and/or requirements for storage related services may decline. For example, volumes in our Global RIM Business segment were relatively steady in 2019 and we expect them to remain relatively consistent in the near term. We can provide no assurance that our customers will continue to store most or a portion of their records as paper documents or as tapes, or that the paper documents or tapes they do store with us will require our storage related services at the same levels as they have in the past. A significant shift by our customers to storage of data through non-paper or non-tape-based technologies, whether now existing or developed in the future, could adversely affect our businesses. In addition, the digitization of records may shift our revenue mix from the more predictable storage revenue to service revenue, which is inherently more volatile.\nFailure to execute our strategic growth plan may adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nAs part of our strategic growth plan, we expect to continue to invest in our existing businesses, including records and information management storage and services businesses in our higher-growth markets, data centers and adjacent businesses, and in new businesses, business strategies, products, services, technologies and geographies, and we may selectively divest certain businesses. These initiatives may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including:\n\u2022\nour inability to identify suitable companies to acquire or invest in;\n\u2022\nour inability to complete acquisitions or investments on satisfactory terms;\n\u2022\nour inability to structure investments or acquisitions in a manner that complies with our debt covenants and is consistent with our leverage ratio goals;\n\u2022\nincreased demands on our management, operating systems, internal controls and financial and physical resources and, if necessary, our inability to successfully expand our infrastructure;\n\u2022\nour inability to execute on our plans to help our customers digitize their records or incorporate new technologies into our offerings;\n\u2022\nfailure to achieve satisfactory returns on acquired companies or other investments, particularly in markets where we do not currently operate;\n\u2022\nincurring additional debt necessary to acquire suitable companies or make other growth investments if we are unable to pay the purchase price or make the investment out of working capital, common stock or other equity securities;\n\u2022\nour inability to manage the budgeting, forecasting and other process control issues presented by future growth, particularly with respect to operations in countries outside of the United States or in new lines of business;\n\u2022\ninsufficient revenues to offset expenses and liabilities associated with new investments; and\n\u2022\nour inability to attract, develop and retain skilled employees to lead and support our strategic growth plan.\nOur data center expansion in particular requires significant capital commitments. Our data center expansion and other new ventures are inherently risky and we can provide no assurance that such strategies and offerings will be successful in achieving the desired returns within a reasonable timeframe, if at all, and that they will not adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results.\nWe also face competition from other companies in our efforts to grow our data center, international and complementary businesses, some of which possess substantial financial and other resources. As a result, we may be unable to acquire, invest in, or may pay a premium purchase price for, data centers, technology and higher-growth markets and adjacent businesses that support our strategic growth plan, or we may fail to manage the growth of any businesses we acquire or invest in, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nAs stored records and tapes become less active our service revenue growth and profitability from related services may decline.\nOur Records Management and Data Management service revenue growth is being negatively impacted by declining activity rates as stored records and tapes are becoming less active and more archival. The amount of information available to customers digitally or in their own information systems has been steadily increasing in recent years, and we believe this trend continues to accelerate. As a result, our customers are less likely than they have been in the past to retrieve records and rotate tapes, thereby reducing their activity levels. At the same time, many of our costs related to records and tape related services remain fixed. In addition, our reputation for providing secure information storage is critical to our success, and actions to manage cost structure, such as outsourcing certain transportation, security or other functions, could negatively impact our reputation and adversely affect our business. Ultimately, if we are unable to appropriately align our cost structure with decreased levels of service activity, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nOur program to simplify our global structure may not be successful.\nIn October 2019, we announced Project Summit, a global program designed to better position us for future growth and achievement of our strategic objectives. Project Summit focuses on simplifying our global records and information management structure, streamlining our managerial structure and leveraging our global and regional customer facing resources. As a result of the program, we expect to reduce the number of positions at vice president and above by approximately 45%. The total program is expected to have reduced our total managerial and administrative workforce by approximately 700 positions by the end of 2021. We also plan to implement systems and process changes designed to make our organization more agile and dynamic, streamline our organization and reallocate our resources to better align with our strategic goals. We expect the total program benefits associated with Project Summit to be fully realized by the end of 2022. We have included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K estimates of expected improvements to our Adjusted EBITDA and the costs (including operating and capital expenditures) we expect to incur. However, we may not be able to realize the full amount of our expected improvements to Adjusted EBITDA in a timely manner, or at all, and the costs associated Project Summit may exceed our expectations. In addition, this program may yield unintended consequences, such as attrition beyond our intended reduction in force, distraction of our employees and our anticipated systems and process changes may not work as expected and may create additional risks to our business. As a result, Project Summit could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nOur future growth depends in part upon our ability to continue to effectively manage and execute on revenue management.\nOver the past several years, our organic revenue growth has been positively impacted by our ability to effectively introduce, expand and monitor revenue management initially in our more established markets, and subsequently in our higher-growth markets. If we are not able to continue and effectively manage pricing, our results of operations could be adversely affected and we may not be able to execute on our strategic growth plan.\nChanges in customer behavior with respect to document destruction could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOver the past year, our destruction rates as a percentage of records stored have fluctuated. When destruction rates increase, it has a positive impact on our service revenues in the year of destruction, but negatively impacts our longer term storage revenues, adversely affecting our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe and our customers are subject to laws and governmental regulations relating to data privacy and cybersecurity and our customers' demands in this area are increasing. This may cause us to incur significant expenses and non-compliance with such regulations and demands could harm our business.\nWe are subject to numerous U.S. federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations relating to data privacy and cybersecurity. These regulations are complex, change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time. There are also a number of legislative proposals pending before the U.S. Congress, various state legislative bodies and foreign governments concerning data protection that could affect us. In addition, a growing number of U.S. and foreign legislative and regulatory bodies have adopted consumer notification and other requirements if consumer information is accessed by unauthorized persons and additional regulations regarding the use, access, accuracy and security of such information are possible. In the U.S., we are subject to various state laws which provide for disparate notification regimes. In addition, as a result of the continued emphasis on information security and instances in which personal information has been compromised, our customers are requesting that we take additional measures to enhance security, store electronic data locally, and assume higher liability under our contracts.\nWe devote substantial resources, and may in the future have to devote significant additional resources, to facilitate compliance with laws and regulations, our customers\u2019 demands and to investigate, defend or remedy actual or alleged violations or breaches. Any failure by us to comply with, or remedy any violations or breaches of, laws and regulations or customer requirements could result in the curtailment of certain of our operations, the imposition of fines and penalties, liability resulting from litigation, restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations, significant costs and expenses and reputational harm. For example, we have experienced incidents in which customers' information has been lost, and we have been informed by customers that some of the incidents involved the loss of personal information, resulting in monetary costs to those customers for which we have provided reimbursement. It is difficult to predict the impact on our business if we were subject to allegations of having violated existing laws or regulations.\nAttacks on our internal IT systems could damage our reputation, harm our business and adversely impact our results of operations.\nOur reputation for providing secure information storage to customers is critical to the success of our business. Although we seek to prevent and detect attempts by unauthorized users to gain access to our IT systems, our IT and network infrastructure may be vulnerable to attacks by hackers or breaches due to employee error or other disruptions. Moreover, until we have migrated businesses we acquire on to our IT systems, we may face additional risks because of the continued use of predecessor IT systems. We have outsourced, and expect to continue to outsource, certain support services to third parties, which may subject our IT and other sensitive information to additional risk. A successful breach of the security of our IT systems could lead to theft or misuse of our customers' proprietary or confidential information and result in third party claims against us and reputational harm. If our reputation is damaged, we may become less competitive, which could negatively impact our businesses, financial condition or results of operations.\nChanging fire and safety standards may result in significant expense.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we operated approximately 1,450 facilities worldwide, including over 650 in the United States. Many of these facilities were built and outfitted by third parties and added to our real estate portfolio as part of acquisitions. Some of these facilities contain fire suppression and safety features that are different from our current specifications and current standards for new facilities, although we believe all of our facilities were constructed, in all material respects, in compliance with applicable laws and regulations in effect at the time of their construction or outfitting. In some instances, local authorities may take the position that our fire suppression and safety features in a particular facility are insufficient and require additional measures that may involve considerable expense to us. In addition, where we determine that the fire suppression and safety features of a facility require improvement, we will develop and implement a plan to remediate the issue, although implementation may require an extended period to complete. A significant aspect of the integration of businesses we have acquired or may acquire is the process of making investments in the acquired facilities to conform such facilities to our standards of operations. This process is complex and time-consuming. If additional fire safety and suppression measures beyond our current operating plan were required at a large number of our facilities, the expense required for compliance could negatively impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nChanges to environmental laws and standards may increase the cost to operate some of our businesses. Furthermore, if we fail to meet our commitment to transition to more renewable and sustainable sources of energy, it may negatively impact our ability to attract and retain customers and investors who focus on this commitment. This could impact our results of operations and the trading of our stock.\nChanges in environmental laws in any of the jurisdictions in which we operate could increase compliance costs or impose limitations on our operations. For example, our emergency generators at our data centers are subject to regulations and permit requirements governing air pollutants, and the heating, ventilation and air conditioning and fire suppression systems at some of our data centers and data management locations may include ozone-depleting substances that are subject to regulation. While environmental regulations do not normally impose material costs upon operations at our facilities, unexpected events, equipment malfunctions, human error and changes in law or regulations, among other factors, could result in unexpected costs, which could be material.\nFurthermore, we have made a commitment to transition to more renewable and sustainable sources of energy. If we are not successful in this transition, it may negatively impact our ability to attract and retain customers and investors who focus on this commitment. This could negatively impact our results of operations and the trading of our stock.\nFailure to successfully integrate acquired businesses could negatively impact our balance sheet and results of operations.\nStrategic acquisitions are an important element of our growth strategy and the success of any acquisition we make depends in part on our ability to integrate the acquired business and realize anticipated synergies. The process of integrating acquired businesses, particularly in new markets, may involve unforeseen difficulties and may require a disproportionate amount of our management's attention and our financial and other resources.\nFor example, the success of our significant acquisitions depends, in large part, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits, including cost savings from combining the acquired businesses with ours. To realize these anticipated benefits, we must be able to successfully integrate our business and the acquired businesses, and this integration is complex and time-consuming. We may encounter challenges in the integration process including the following:\n\u2022\nchallenges and difficulties associated with managing our larger, more complex, company;\n\u2022\nconforming standards, controls, procedures and policies, business cultures and compensation and benefits structures between the two businesses;\n\u2022\nconsolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures;\n\u2022\ncoordinating geographically dispersed organizations;\n\u2022\npotential unknown liabilities and unforeseen expenses or delays associated with an acquisition; and\n\u2022\nour ability to deliver on our strategy going forward.\nFurther, our acquisitions subject us to liabilities (including tax liabilities) that may exist at an acquired company, some of which may be unknown. Although we and our advisors conduct due diligence on the operations of businesses we acquire, there can be no guarantee that we are aware of all liabilities of an acquired company. These liabilities, and any additional risks and uncertainties related to an acquired company not known to us or that we may deem immaterial or unlikely to occur at the time of the acquisition, could negatively impact our future business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe can give no assurance that we will ultimately be able to effectively integrate and manage the operations of any acquired business or realize anticipated synergies. The failure to successfully integrate the cultures, operating systems, procedures and information technologies of an acquired business could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur customer contracts may not always limit our liability and may sometimes contain terms that could lead to disputes in contract interpretation.\nOur customer contracts typically contain provisions limiting our liability regarding the loss or destruction of, or damage to, records, information, or other items stored with us. Our liability for physical storage is often limited to a nominal fixed amount per item or unit of storage (such as per cubic foot) and our liability for IGDS, data center, destruction and other services unrelated to records, information and other items stored with us is often limited to a percentage of annual revenue under the contract; however, some of our contracts with large customers and some of the contracts assumed in our acquisitions contain no such limits or contain higher limits. We can provide no assurance that our limitation of liability provisions will be enforceable in all instances or, if enforceable, that they would otherwise protect us from liability. In addition to provisions limiting our liability, our customer contracts generally include a schedule setting forth the majority of the customer-specific terms, including storage rental and related service pricing and service delivery terms. Our customers may dispute the interpretation of various provisions in their contracts. In the past, we have had relatively few disputes with our customers regarding the terms of their customer contracts, and most disputes to date have not been material, but we can provide no assurance that we will not have material disputes in the future. Moreover, as we expand our operations in storage of fine arts and other valuable items and respond to customer demands for higher limitation of liability as a result of regulatory changes, our exposure to contracts with higher or no limitations of liability and disputes with customers over the interpretation of their contracts may increase. Although we maintain a comprehensive insurance program, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to maintain insurance policies on acceptable terms or with high enough coverage amounts to cover losses to us in connection with customer contract disputes.\nInternational operations may pose unique risks.\nAs of December 31, 2019, we operated in approximately 50 countries outside the United States. Our international operations account for a significant portion of our overall operations, and as part of our growth strategy, we expect its share to increase as we continue to acquire or invest in businesses in select foreign markets, including countries where we do not currently operate. International operations are subject to numerous risks, including:\n\u2022\nthe impact of foreign government regulations and United States regulations that apply to us in foreign countries where we operate; in particular, we are subject to United States and foreign anticorruption laws, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the United Kingdom Bribery Act, and, although we have implemented internal controls, policies and procedures and training to deter prohibited practices, our employees, partners, contractors or agents may violate or circumvent such policies and the law;\n\u2022\nthe volatility of certain foreign economies in which we operate;\n\u2022\npolitical uncertainties and changes in the global political climate or other global events, such as the recent trade wars involving the U.S. or global pandemics, which may impose restrictions on, or create additional risk in relation to, global operations;\n\u2022\nunforeseen liabilities, particularly within acquired businesses;\n\u2022\ncosts and difficulties associated with managing international operations of varying sizes and scale;\n\u2022\nour operations in the United Kingdom and the European Union may be adversely affected by the exit from the European Union (\u201cBrexit\u201d) by the United Kingdom, and the uncertainty associated therewith;\n\u2022\nthe risk that business partners upon whom we depend for technical assistance or management and acquisition expertise in some markets outside of the United States will not perform as expected;\n\u2022\ndifficulties attracting and retaining local management and key employees to operate our business in certain countries;\n\u2022\ncultural differences and differences in business practices and operating standards; and\n\u2022\nforeign currency fluctuations.\nWe have operations in numerous foreign countries and, as a result, are subject to foreign exchange translation risk, which could have an adverse effect on our financial results.\nWe conduct business operations in numerous foreign countries through our foreign subsidiaries or affiliates, which primarily transact in their respective local currencies. Those local currencies are translated into United States dollars at the applicable exchange rates for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements. The results of operations of, and certain of our debt balances (including intercompany debt balances) associated with, our international businesses are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Upon translation, operating results may differ materially from expectations, and significant shifts in foreign currencies can impact our short-term results, as well as our long-term forecasts and targets. In addition, because we intend to distribute 100% of our REIT taxable income to our stockholders, and any exchange rate fluctuations may negatively impact our REIT taxable income, our distribution amounts may fluctuate because of exchange rate fluctuations.\nSignificant costs or disruptions at our data centers could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nSince 2017, we have substantially expanded our Global Data Center Business through acquisitions and organically and we expect to continue to grow our Global Data Center Business in both ways going forward. For example, we paid an aggregate cash purchase price of over $1.7 billion for data center businesses we acquired in 2017 and 2018 and incurred other costs associated with the development of real estate to support this business. Our Global Data Center Business depends on providing customers with highly reliable facilities, power infrastructure and operations solutions, and we will need to retain and hire qualified personnel to manage our data centers. Service interruptions or significant equipment damage could result in difficulty maintaining service level commitment obligations that we owe to certain of our customers. Service interruptions or equipment damage may occur at one or more of our data centers because of numerous factors, including:\n\u2022\nhuman error;\n\u2022\nequipment failure;\n\u2022\nphysical, electronic and cyber security breaches;\n\u2022\nfire, hurricane, flood, earthquake and other natural disasters;\n\u2022\nwater damage;\n\u2022\nfiber cuts;\n\u2022\nextreme temperatures;\n\u2022\npower loss or telecommunications failure;\n\u2022\nwar, terrorism and any related conflicts or similar events worldwide; and\n\u2022\nsabotage and vandalism.\nIn addition, climate change may increase the likelihood that our data centers are affected by some of these factors.\nWhile these risks could impact our overall business, they could have a more significant impact on our Global Data Center Business, where we have service level commitment obligations to certain of our customers. As a result, service interruptions or significant equipment damage at our data centers could result in difficulty maintaining service level commitments to these customers and potential claims related to such failures. Because our data centers are critical to many of our customers\u2019 businesses, service interruptions or significant equipment damage at our data centers could also result in lost profits or other indirect or consequential damages to our customers.\nOur Global Data Center Business is susceptible to regional costs of power, power shortages, planned or unplanned power outages and limitations on the availability of adequate power resources. We rely on third parties to provide power to our data centers. We are therefore subject to an inherent risk that such third parties may fail to deliver such power in adequate quantities or on a consistent basis. If the power delivered to our data centers is insufficient or interrupted, we would be required to provide power through the operation of our on-site generators, generally at a significantly higher operating cost. Additionally, global fluctuations in the price of power can increase the cost of energy, and we may be limited in our ability to, or may not always choose to, pass these increased costs on to our customers. We also rely on third party telecommunications carriers to provide internet connectivity to our customers. These carriers may elect not to offer or to restrict their services within our data centers or may elect to discontinue such services. Furthermore, carriers may face business difficulties, which could affect their ability to provide telecommunications services or the quality of such services. If connectivity is interrupted or terminated, our financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected. Events such as these may also impact our reputation as a data center provider which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur data center expansion requires a significant amount of capital and, if we are not able to raise that capital on advantageous terms, our ability to fund our data center expansion may be limited.\nOur data center expansion requires significant capital commitments. In addition, we may be required to commit significant operational and financial resources in connection with the organic growth of our Global Data Center Business, generally 12 to 18 months in advance of securing customer contracts, and we may not have enough customer demand to support these data centers when they are built. There can be no assurance we will have sufficient customer demand to support these data centers or data centers we have acquired or that we will not be adversely affected by the risks noted above, which could make it difficult for us to realize expected returns on our investments, if any.\nWe may expand our use of joint ventures which could expose us to risks and liabilities, some of which differ from the risks and liabilities related to the operation of our wholly owned subsidiaries, and our joint venture partners on whom we may rely may have economic and business interests that are inconsistent with our business interests.\nAs part of our growth strategy we may expand our use of joint ventures, particularly in connection with our data center expansion. These joint ventures could result in our acquisition of non-controlling interests in, or shared responsibility for, managing the affairs of a property or portfolio of properties, business, partnership, joint venture or other entity. As a result, in connection with pursuing or entering into any new joint ventures, we may be subject to additional risks, including:\n\u2022\nwe may not have the right to exercise sole decision-making authority regarding the properties, business, partnership, joint venture or other entity;\n\u2022\nif our partners become bankrupt or fail to fund their share of required capital contributions, we may choose or be required to contribute such capital;\n\u2022\nour partners may have economic, tax or other interests or goals that are inconsistent with our interests or goals, and that could affect our ability to negotiate satisfactory joint venture terms, to operate the property or business or maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT;\n\u2022\nour partners may be subject to different laws or regulations than us, or may be structured differently than us for tax purposes, which could create conflicts of interest and/or affect our ability to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT;\n\u2022\nour partners may take actions that are not within our control, which could require us to dispose of the joint venture asset, transfer it to a taxable REIT subsidiary (\"TRS\") in order for us to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT, or purchase such partner's interests or assets at an above-market price;\n\u2022\nin connection with our joint ventures, we may agree to restrictions on our ability to expand our business in certain geographies independently or with other partners;\n\u2022\ndisputes between us and our partners may result in litigation or arbitration that would increase our expenses and prevent our management from focusing their time and effort on our day-to-day business; and\n\u2022\nwe may in certain circumstances be liable for the actions of our third-party partners or guarantee all or a portion of the joint venture's liabilities, which may require the company to pay an amount greater than its investment in the joint venture.\nEach of these factors may result in returns on these investments being less than we expect or in losses, and our financial and operating results may be adversely affected.\nFailure to comply with certain regulatory and contractual requirements under our United States Government contracts could adversely affect our revenues, operating results and financial position and reputation.\nHaving the United States Government as a customer subjects us to certain regulatory and contractual requirements. Failure to comply with these requirements could subject us to investigations, price reductions, up to treble damages, and civil penalties. Noncompliance with certain regulatory and contractual requirements could also result in us being suspended or barred from future United States Government contracting. We may also face private derivative securities claims because of adverse government actions. Any of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, operating results, financial position and reputation.\nWe may be unable to continue our international expansion.\nAn important part of our growth strategy involves expanding operations in international markets, including in markets where we currently do not operate, and we expect to continue this expansion. Europe, Latin America, Asia and Australia have historically been our primary areas of focus for international expansion of our records and information management services business, with expansion of our records and information management services business into Africa and the Middle East and expansion of our data center and adjacent business operations becoming more of a focus recently. We have entered into joint ventures or have acquired all or a majority of the equity in storage and information management services and data center businesses operating in these areas and may enter into joint ventures and/or acquire other storage and information management services, data center or adjacent businesses in the future, including in new countries or markets where we currently do not operate. A changing global political climate may impose restrictions on our ability to expand internationally. This growth strategy involves risks. We may be unable to pursue this strategy in the future at the desired pace or at all.\nWe may be subject to certain costs and potential liabilities associated with the real estate required for our business.\nBecause our business is heavily dependent on real estate, we face special risks attributable to the real estate we own or lease. Such risks include:\n\u2022\nacquisition and occupancy costs that make it difficult to meet anticipated margins and difficulty locating suitable facilities due to a relatively small number of available buildings having the desired characteristics in some real estate markets;\n\u2022\nuninsured losses or damage to our storage facilities due to an inability to obtain full coverage on a cost-effective basis for some casualties, such as fires, hurricanes and earthquakes, or any coverage for certain losses, such as losses from riots or terrorist activities;\n\u2022\ninability to use our real estate holdings effectively and costs associated with vacating or consolidating facilities if the demand for physical storage were to diminish; and\n\u2022\nliability under environmental laws for the costs of investigation and cleanup of contaminated real estate owned or leased by us, whether or not (i) we know of, or were responsible for, the contamination, or (ii) the contamination occurred while we owned or leased the property.\nSome of our current and formerly owned or leased properties were previously used by entities other than us for industrial or other purposes, or were affected by waste generated from nearby properties, that involved the use, storage, generation and/or disposal of hazardous substances and wastes, including petroleum products. In some instances this prior use involved the operation of underground storage tanks or the presence of asbestos-containing materials. Where we are aware of environmental conditions that require remediation, we undertake appropriate activity, in accordance with all legal requirements. Although we have from time to time conducted limited environmental investigations and remedial activities at some of our former and current facilities, we have not undertaken an environmental review of all of our properties, including those we have acquired. We therefore may be potentially liable for environmental costs like those discussed above and may be unable to sell, rent, mortgage or use contaminated real estate owned or leased by us. Environmental conditions for which we might be liable may also exist at properties that we may acquire in the future. In addition, future regulatory action and environmental laws may impose costs for environmental compliance that do not exist today.\nUnexpected events could disrupt our operations and adversely affect our reputation and results of operations.\nUnexpected events, including fires or explosions at our facilities, natural disasters such as hurricanes and earthquakes, war or terrorist activities, unplanned power outages, supply disruptions and failure of equipment or systems, could adversely affect our reputation and results of operations. Our customers rely on us to securely store and timely retrieve their critical information, and these events could result in customer service disruption, physical damage to one or more key operating facilities and the information stored in those facilities, the temporary closure of one or more key operating facilities or the temporary disruption of information systems, each of which could negatively impact our reputation and results of operations. During the past several years we have seen an increase in severe weather events and we expect this trend to continue due to climate change. Some of our key facilities worldwide are vulnerable to severe weather events.\nDamage to our reputation could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur reputation for providing highly secure information storage to customers is critical to the success of our business. Our reputation or brand, and specifically, the trust our customers place in us, could be negatively impacted in the event of perceived or actual failures by us to store information securely. For example, events such as fires, natural disasters, attacks on our IT systems or security breaches involving us could negatively impact our reputation, particularly if such incidents result in adverse publicity, governmental investigations or litigation. Damage to our reputation could make us less competitive, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFluctuations in commodity prices may affect our operating revenues and results of operations.\nOur operating revenues and results of operations are impacted by significant changes in commodity prices. In particular, our secure shredding operations generate revenue from the sale of shredded paper for recycling. Further, significant declines in the cost of paper may continue to negatively impact our revenues and results of operations, and increases in other commodity prices, including steel, may negatively impact our results of operations.\nThe performance of our businesses relies on our ability to attract, develop, and retain talented personnel, while controlling our labor costs.\nWe are highly dependent on skilled and qualified personnel to operate our businesses. The failure to attract and retain qualified employees or to effectively control our labor costs could negatively affect our competitive position and operating results. Our ability to control labor costs and attract qualified personnel is subject to numerous external factors, including prevailing wages, labor shortages, the impact of legislation or regulations governing wages and hours, labor relations, immigration, healthcare and other benefits, other employment-related costs and the hiring practices of our competitors.\nWe face competition for customers.\nWe compete with multiple businesses in all geographic areas where we operate; our current or potential customers may choose to use those competitors instead of us. In addition, if we are successful in winning customers from competitors, the process of moving their stored records into our facilities is often costly and time consuming. We also compete, in some of our business lines, with our current and potential customers' internal storage and information management services capabilities and their cloud-based alternatives. These organizations may not begin or continue to use us for their future storage and information management service needs.\nWe have guaranteed certain obligations of Recall to Brambles relating to Brambles' prior demerger transaction.\nOn December 18, 2013, Brambles Limited, an Australian corporation (\"Brambles\"), implemented a demerger transaction by way of a distribution of shares of Recall Holdings Limited (\"Recall\") to Brambles\u2019 shareholders (the \u201cDemerger\u201d). Prior to and in connection with the Demerger, Brambles spun off certain of its United States and Canadian subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, to Recall. Such spin-offs were intended to be tax-free or tax-deferred under United States and Canadian tax laws, respectively, and Brambles obtained rulings from the United States Internal Revenue Service (the \"IRS\") (with respect to the United States spin-off) and the Canada Revenue Agency (with respect to the Canadian spin-off), as well as opinions of its tax advisors, to such effect. However, the tax-free status of the spin-off of such United States subsidiaries could be adversely affected under certain circumstances if a 50% or greater interest in such United States subsidiaries were acquired as part of a plan or series of related transactions that included such spin-off. Similarly, the tax-deferred status of the spin-off of the Canadian subsidiaries could be adversely affected under certain circumstances if control of such subsidiaries were acquired as part of a series of transactions or events that included such spin-off.\nIn connection with the Demerger, Recall agreed to indemnify Brambles and certain of its affiliates for taxes to the extent that actions by Recall (e.g., an acquisition of Recall shares) resulted in the United States spin-off or the Canadian spin-off described above failing to qualify as tax-free or tax-deferred for United States or Canadian tax purposes, respectively. In addition, Recall agreed, among other things, that it would not, within two years of the 2013 spin-offs, enter into a proposed acquisition transaction, merger or consolidation (with respect to the United States spin-off) or take any action that could reasonably be expected to jeopardize, directly or indirectly, any of the conclusions reached in the Canadian tax ruling or opinion, without obtaining either a supplemental tax ruling from the relevant taxing authority, the consent of Brambles or an opinion of a tax advisor, acceptable to Brambles in its reasonable discretion, that such transaction should not result in the spin- offs failing to be tax-free under United States federal income tax law or Canadian tax law, respectively. Recall has obtained such tax opinions, based on, among other things, representations and warranties made by Recall and us. Such opinions do not affect Recall\u2019s obligation to indemnify Brambles for an adverse impact on the tax-free status of such prior spin-offs.\nWe have guaranteed the foregoing indemnification obligations of Recall. Consistent with the foregoing tax opinions, we believe that our acquisition of Recall is not part of a plan or series of related transactions, or part of a series of transactions or events, that included the United States spin-off or the Canadian spin-off, respectively. However, if the IRS or the Canadian Revenue Agency were to prevail in asserting a contrary view, we would be liable for the resulting taxes, which could be material.\nRisks Related to Our Indebtedness\nOur substantial indebtedness could adversely affect our financial health and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under our various debt instruments.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2019, our total long-term debt was approximately $8.8 billion, stockholders equity was approximately $1.5 billion and we had cash and cash equivalents (including restricted cash) of approximately $193.6 million. Our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences to our current and potential investors. These risks include:\n\u2022\ninability to satisfy our obligations with respect to our various debt instruments;\n\u2022\ninability to make borrowings to fund future working capital, capital expenditures and strategic opportunities, including acquisitions, further organic development of our Global Data Center Business and expansions into adjacent businesses, and other general corporate requirements, including possible required repurchases, redemptions or prepayments of our various indebtedness;\n\u2022\nlimits on our distributions to stockholders; in this regard if these limits prevented us from satisfying our REIT distribution requirements, we could fail to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT or, if these limits do not jeopardize our qualification for taxation as a REIT but do nevertheless prevent us from distributing 100% of our REIT taxable income, we will be subject to federal corporate income tax, and potentially a nondeductible excise tax, on the retained amounts;\n\u2022\nlimits on future borrowings under our existing or future credit arrangements, which could affect our ability to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs;\n\u2022\ninability to generate sufficient funds to cover required interest payments;\n\u2022\nrestrictions on our ability to refinance our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms;\n\u2022\nlimits on our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the information management services industry; and\n\u2022\ninability to adjust to adverse economic conditions that could place us at a disadvantage to our competitors with less debt and who, therefore, may be able to take advantage of opportunities that our indebtedness prevents us from pursuing.\nWe are subject to risks associated with debt financing, including the risk that our cash flow could be insufficient to meet required payments on our debt. Our Credit Agreement (as defined in Note 4 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report) and our indentures contain customary restrictive covenants and financial restrictions on us, including a maximum allowable net total lease adjusted leverage ratio of 6.5 (subject to certain exceptions) under the Credit Agreement and a maximum allowable leverage ratio of 6.5 (subject to certain exceptions) under certain of our indentures. As of December 31, 2019, our leverage ratio under our indentures was 5.9. In addition, potential changes to, or the elimination of, the London Interbank Offered Rate may adversely affect interest expense related to borrowings under the Credit Agreement and interest rate swaps, which could potentially negatively impact our financial condition.\nDespite our current indebtedness levels, we may still be able to incur substantially more debt. The terms of our indentures generally do not cap the maximum amount of additional funds that may be borrowed under our Credit Agreement and possible future credit arrangements.\nRestrictive debt covenants may limit our ability to pursue our growth strategy.\nOur indentures and our Credit Agreement contain covenants restricting or limiting our ability to, among other things:\n\u2022\nincur additional indebtedness;\n\u2022\npay dividends or make other restricted payments;\n\u2022\nmake asset dispositions;\n\u2022\ncreate or permit liens;\n\u2022\nsell, transfer or exchange assets;\n\u2022\nguarantee certain indebtedness;\n\u2022\nmake acquisitions and other investments; and\n\u2022\nenter into partnerships and joint ventures.\nThese restrictions and our long-term commitment to reduce our leverage ratio may adversely affect our ability to pursue our acquisition and other growth strategies.\nWe may not have the ability to raise the funds necessary to finance the repurchase of outstanding senior or senior subordinated notes upon a change of control event as required by our indentures.\nUpon the occurrence of a \"change of control,\" as defined in our indentures, we will be required to offer to repurchase all of our outstanding senior and senior subordinated notes. However, it is possible that we will not have sufficient funds at the time of a change of control to make the required repurchase of any outstanding notes or that restrictions in our Credit Agreement will not allow such repurchases. Certain important corporate events, however, such as leveraged recapitalizations that would increase the level of our indebtedness, would not constitute a \"change of control\" under our indentures.\nIron Mountain Incorporated (\"IMI\") is a holding company, and, therefore, its ability to make payments on its various debt obligations depends in large part on the operations of its subsidiaries.\nIMI is a holding company; substantially all of its assets consist of the equity in its subsidiaries, and substantially all of its operations are conducted by its direct and indirect consolidated subsidiaries. As a result, its ability to make payments on its debt obligations will be dependent upon the receipt of sufficient funds from its subsidiaries, whose ability to distribute funds may be limited by local capital requirements, joint venture structures and other applicable restrictions. However, our various debt obligations are guaranteed, on a joint and several and full and unconditional basis, by IMI\u2019s U.S. subsidiaries that represent the substantial majority of its U.S. operations.\nRisks Related to Our Taxation as a REIT\nIf we fail to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT, we will be subject to tax at corporate income tax rates and will not be able to deduct distributions to stockholders when computing our taxable income.\nWe have elected to be taxed as a REIT since our 2014 taxable year; however, we can provide no assurance that we will remain qualified for taxation as a REIT. If we fail to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT, we will be taxed at corporate income tax rates unless certain relief provisions apply.\nQualification for taxation as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \"Code\"), to our operations as well as various factual determinations concerning matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. There are limited judicial or administrative interpretations of applicable REIT provisions.\nIf, in any taxable year, we fail to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT and are not entitled to relief under the Code:\n\u2022\nwe will not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income;\n\u2022\nwe will be subject to federal and state income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate income tax rates; and\n\u2022\nwe would not be eligible to elect REIT status again until the fifth taxable year that begins after the first year for which we failed to qualify as a REIT.\nAny such corporate tax liability could be substantial and would reduce the amount of cash available for other purposes. If we fail to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT, we may need to borrow additional funds or liquidate some investments to pay any additional tax liability. Accordingly, funds available for investment and distributions to stockholders could be reduced.\nAs a REIT, failure to make required distributions would subject us to federal corporate income tax.\nWe expect to continue paying regular quarterly distributions; however, the amount, timing and form of our regular quarterly distributions will be determined, and will be subject to adjustment, by our board of directors. To remain qualified for taxation as a REIT, we are generally required to distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gain) each year, or in limited circumstances, the following year, to our stockholders. Generally, we expect to distribute all or substantially all of our REIT taxable income. If our cash available for distribution falls short of our estimates, we may be unable to maintain distributions that approximate our REIT taxable income and may fail to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT. In addition, our cash flows from operations may be insufficient to fund required distributions as a result of differences in timing between the actual receipt of income and the payment of expenses and the recognition of income and expenses for federal income tax purposes, or the effect of nondeductible expenditures, such as capital expenditures, payments of compensation for which Section 162(m) of the Code denies a deduction, the creation of reserves or required debt service or amortization payments.\nTo the extent that we satisfy the 90% distribution requirement but distribute less than 100% of our REIT taxable income, we will be subject to federal corporate income tax on our undistributed taxable income. In addition, we will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on our undistributed taxable income if the actual amount that we distribute to our stockholders for a calendar year is less than the minimum amount specified under the Code.\nWe may be required to borrow funds, sell assets or raise equity to satisfy REIT distribution requirements, to comply with asset ownership tests or to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives.\nIn order to meet the REIT distribution requirements and maintain our qualification and taxation as a REIT, or to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives, we may need to borrow funds, sell assets or raise equity, even if our financial condition or the then-prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings, sales or offerings. Furthermore, the REIT distribution requirements and our commitment to investors on dividend growth may result in increasing our financing needs to fund capital expenditures, future growth and expansion initiatives, which would increase our indebtedness. An increase in our outstanding debt could lead to a downgrade of our credit ratings, which could negatively impact our ability to access credit markets. Further, certain of our current debt instruments limit the amount of indebtedness we and our subsidiaries may incur. Additional financing, therefore, may be unavailable, more expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness. For a discussion of risks related to our substantial level of indebtedness, see \"Risks Related to Our Indebtedness.\" See also \u201cRisks Related to our Common Stock\u201d for certain risks related to our issuances of equity securities or debt convertible into equity securities.\nComplying with REIT requirements may limit our flexibility, cause us to forgo otherwise attractive opportunities that we would otherwise pursue to execute our growth strategy, or otherwise reduce our income and amounts available for distribution to our stockholders.\nTo remain qualified for taxation as a REIT, we must satisfy tests concerning, among other things, the sources of our income, the nature and diversification of our assets and the amounts we distribute to our stockholders. Thus, compliance with these tests may require us to refrain from certain activities and may hinder our ability to make certain attractive investments, including the purchase of non-REIT qualifying operations or assets, the expansion of non-real estate activities, and investments in the businesses to be conducted by our TRSs, and to that extent limit our opportunities and our flexibility to change our business strategy. This may restrict our ability to enter into joint ventures or acquire minority interests of companies. Furthermore, acquisition opportunities in domestic and international markets may be adversely affected if we need or require the target company to comply with some REIT requirements prior to closing.\nWe conduct a significant portion of our business activities, including our information management services businesses and several of our international operations, through domestic and foreign TRSs. Under the Code, no more than 25% of the value of the assets of a REIT may be represented by securities of one or more TRSs and other nonqualifying assets. In addition, no more than 20% of the value of the assets of a REIT may be represented by securities of one or more TRSs within the overall 25% nonqualifying assets limitation. These limitations may affect our ability to make additional investments in non-REIT qualifying operations or assets or in international operations through TRSs.\nIf we fail to comply with specified asset ownership tests applicable to REITs as measured at the end of any calendar quarter, we generally must correct such failure within 30 days after the end of the applicable calendar quarter or qualify for statutory relief provisions to avoid losing our qualification for taxation as a REIT. As a result, we may be required to liquidate assets or to forgo our pursuit of otherwise attractive investments. These actions may reduce our income and amounts available for distribution to our stockholders.\nAs a REIT, we are limited in our ability to fund distribution payments using cash generated through our TRSs.\nOur ability to receive distributions from our TRSs is limited by the rules with which we must comply to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT. In particular, at least 75% of our gross income for each taxable year as a REIT must be derived from real estate, which principally includes gross income from providing customers with secure storage space or colocation or wholesale data center space. Consequently, no more than 25% of our gross income may consist of dividend income from our TRSs and other nonqualifying types of income. Thus, our ability to receive distributions from our TRSs may be limited, which may impact our ability to fund distributions to our stockholders using cash flows from our TRSs. Specifically, if our TRSs become highly profitable, we might become limited in our ability to receive net income from our TRSs in an amount required to fund distributions to our stockholders commensurate with that profitability.\nIn addition, a significant amount of our income and cash flows from our TRSs is generated from our international operations. In many cases, there are local withholding taxes and currency controls that may impact our ability or willingness to repatriate funds to the United States to help satisfy REIT distribution requirements.\nOur extensive use of TRSs, including for certain of our international operations, may cause us to fail to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT.\nOur operations include an extensive use of TRSs. The net income of our TRSs is not required to be distributed to us, and income that is not distributed to us generally is not subject to the REIT income distribution requirement. However, there may be limitations on our ability to accumulate earnings in our TRSs and the accumulation or reinvestment of significant earnings in our TRSs could result in adverse tax treatment. In particular, if the accumulation of cash in our TRSs causes (1) the fair market value of our securities in our TRSs to exceed 20% of the fair market value of our assets or (2) the fair market value of our securities in our TRSs and other nonqualifying assets to exceed 25% of the fair market value of our assets, then we will fail to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT. Further, a substantial portion of our operations are conducted overseas, and a material change in foreign currency rates could also affect the value of our foreign holdings in our TRSs, negatively impacting our ability to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT.\nEven if we remain qualified for taxation as a REIT, some of our business activities are subject to corporate level income tax and foreign taxes, which will continue to reduce our cash flows, and we will have potential deferred and contingent tax liabilities.\nEven if we remain qualified for taxation as a REIT, we may be subject to some federal, state, local and foreign taxes, including taxes on any undistributed income, and state, local or foreign income, franchise, property and transfer taxes. In addition, we could in certain circumstances be required to pay an excise or penalty tax, which could be significant in amount, in order to utilize one or more relief provisions under the Code to maintain our qualification for taxation as a REIT.\nOur information management services businesses, several of our international operations and certain of our other businesses are conducted through wholly owned TRSs because these activities could generate nonqualifying REIT income as currently structured and operated. The income of our domestic TRSs will continue to be subject to federal and state corporate income taxes. In addition, we and our subsidiaries continue to be subject to foreign income taxes in jurisdictions in which we have business operations or a taxable presence, regardless of whether assets are held or operations are conducted through subsidiaries disregarded for federal income tax purposes or TRSs. Any of these taxes would decrease our earnings and our available cash.\nWe will also be subject to a federal corporate level income tax at the highest regular corporate income tax rate (currently 21%) on gains we recognize within a specified period from a sale of a REIT asset where our basis in the asset is determined by reference to the basis of the asset in the hands of a C corporation (such as an asset that we hold in one of our qualified REIT subsidiaries (\"QRSs\") following the liquidation or other conversion of a former TRS). This 21% tax is generally applicable to any disposition of such an asset during the five-year period after the date we first owned the asset as a REIT asset to the extent of the built-in-gain based on the fair market value of such asset on the date we first held the asset as a REIT asset. In addition, any depreciation recapture income that we recognize because of accounting method changes that we make in connection with our acquisition activities will be fully subject to this 21% tax.\nComplying with REIT requirements may limit our ability to hedge effectively and increase the cost of our hedging and may cause us to incur tax liabilities.\nThe REIT provisions of the Code limit our ability to hedge assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Generally, income from hedging transactions that we enter into to manage risk of interest rate changes with respect to borrowings made or to be made by us to acquire or carry real estate assets and income from certain currency hedging transactions related to our non- United States operations, as well as income from qualifying counteracting hedges, do not constitute \"gross income\" for purposes of the REIT gross income tests. To the extent that we enter into other types of hedging transactions, the income from those transactions is likely to be treated as nonqualifying income for purposes of the REIT gross income tests. As a result of these rules, we may need to limit our use of advantageous hedging techniques or implement those hedges through our TRSs. This could increase the cost of our hedging activities because our TRSs would be subject to tax on income or gains resulting from hedges entered into by them and may expose us to greater risks associated with changes in interest rates or exchange rates than we would otherwise want to bear. In addition, hedging losses in any of our TRSs generally will not provide any tax benefit, except for being carried forward for possible use against future income or gain in the TRSs.\nDistributions payable by REITs generally do not qualify for preferential tax rates.\nDividends payable by United States corporations to noncorporate stockholders, such as individuals, trusts and estates, are generally eligible for reduced United States federal income tax rates applicable to \u201cqualified dividends.\u201d Distributions paid by REITs generally are not treated as \u201cqualified dividends\u201d under the Code, and the reduced rates applicable to such dividends do not generally apply. However, for tax years beginning before 2026, REIT dividends paid to noncorporate stockholders are generally taxed at an effective tax rate lower than applicable ordinary income tax rates due to the availability of a deduction under the Code for specified forms of income from passthrough entities. More favorable rates will nevertheless continue to apply to regular corporate \u201cqualified\u201d dividends, which may cause some investors to perceive that an investment in a REIT is less attractive than an investment in a non-REIT entity that pays dividends, thereby reducing the demand and market price of our common stock.\nThe ownership and transfer restrictions contained in our certificate of incorporation may not protect our qualification for taxation as a REIT, could have unintended antitakeover effects and may prevent our stockholders from receiving a takeover premium.\nIn order for us to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT, no more than 50% of the value of outstanding shares of our capital stock may be owned, beneficially or constructively, by five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of each taxable year. In addition, pursuant to attribution rules under the Code, we are treated as the owner of each affiliate of any person who owns 10% or more of our outstanding shares; if such an affiliate is a customer and we are treated under these attribution rules as owning 10% or more of the vote or value of such customer, rents from that \"affiliated tenant\" will not qualify as qualifying REIT income. Subject to certain exceptions, our certificate of incorporation prohibits any stockholder from owning, beneficially or constructively, more than (i) 9.8% in value of the outstanding shares of all classes or series of our capital stock or (ii) 9.8% in value or number, whichever is more restrictive, of the outstanding shares of any class or series of our capital stock. We refer to these restrictions collectively as the \"ownership limits\" and we included them in our certificate of incorporation to facilitate our compliance with REIT tax rules. The constructive ownership rules under the Code are complex and may cause the outstanding stock owned by a group of related individuals or entities to be deemed to be constructively owned by one individual or entity. As a result, the acquisition of less than 9.8% of our outstanding common stock (or the outstanding shares of any class or series of our capital stock) by an individual or entity could cause that individual or entity or another individual or entity to own constructively in excess of the relevant ownership limits. Any attempt to own or transfer shares of our common stock or of any of our other capital stock in violation of these restrictions may result in the shares being automatically transferred to a charitable trust or may be void. Even though our certificate of incorporation contains the ownership limits, there can be no assurance that these provisions will be effective to prevent our qualification for taxation as a REIT from being jeopardized, including under the affiliated tenant rule. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that we will be able to monitor and enforce the ownership limits. If the restrictions in our certificate of incorporation are not effective and as a result we fail to satisfy the REIT tax rules described above, then absent an applicable relief provision, we will fail to remain qualified for taxation as a REIT.\nIn addition, the ownership and transfer restrictions could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for our stock or otherwise be in the best interest of our stockholders. As a result, the overall effect of the ownership and transfer restrictions may be to render more difficult or discourage any attempt to acquire us, even if such acquisition may be favorable to the interests of our stockholders.\nLegislative or other actions affecting REITs could have a negative effect on us or our stockholders.\nAt any time, the federal or state income tax laws governing REITs, or the administrative interpretations of those laws, may be amended. Federal and state tax laws are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process, the IRS, the United States Department of the Treasury (the \"Treasury\") and state taxing authorities. Changes to the tax laws, regulations and administrative interpretations, which may have retroactive application, could adversely affect us. In addition, some of these changes could have a more significant impact on us as compared to other REITs due to the nature of our business and our substantial use of TRSs, particularly non-United States TRSs. We cannot predict with certainty whether, when, in what forms, or with what effective dates, the tax laws, regulations and administrative interpretations applicable to us may be changed.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock\nSales or issuances of shares of our common stock may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nFuture sales or issuances of common stock or other equity related securities may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, including any shares of our common stock issued to finance capital expenditures, finance acquisitions or repay debt. In October 2017, we entered into a distribution agreement (the \u201cDistribution Agreement\u201d) with a syndicate of 10 banks (the \u201cAgents\u201d) pursuant to which we may sell, from time to time, up to an aggregate sales price of $500.0 million of our common stock through the Agents (the \u201cAt The Market (ATM) Equity Program\u201d). As of December 31, 2019, we have sold 1,754,539 shares of our common stock for gross proceeds of approximately $68.8 million under the At The Market (ATM) Equity Program. See Note 12 to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in this Annual Report.\nSales or issuances of equity securities or debt convertible into equity securities could negatively impact our existing stockholders.\nFuture sales or issuances of equity securities or debt convertible into equity securities, the percentage of stock ownership by our existing stockholders may be reduced. In addition, new equity securities or convertible debt securities could have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our current stockholders, which could substantially decrease the value of our securities owned by them. Depending upon the market price of our common stock at the time of any potential issuances of equity securities, we may have to sell a significant number of shares in order to raise the capital we deem necessary to execute our long-term strategy, and our stockholders may experience dilution in the value of their shares as a result.\nOur cash distributions are not guaranteed and may fluctuate.\nAs a REIT, we are generally required to distribute at least 90% of our REIT taxable income to our stockholders. Furthermore, we are committed to growing our dividends, and have stated this publicly.\nOur board of directors, in its sole discretion, will determine, on a quarterly basis, the amount of cash to be distributed to our stockholders based on a number of factors including, but not limited to, our results of operations, cash flow and capital requirements, economic conditions, tax considerations, borrowing capacity and other factors, including debt covenant restrictions that may impose limitations on cash payments, future acquisitions and divestitures, any stock repurchase program and general market demand for our space and related services. Consequently, our distribution levels may fluctuate and we may not be able to meet our public commitments with respect to dividend growth.", "PERMNO": 83143, "SIC": 6798, "TIC": "IRM"}
