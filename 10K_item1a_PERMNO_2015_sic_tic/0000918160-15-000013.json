{"cik": "918160", "company": "AK STEEL HOLDING CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-20", "item_1A": "Item 1A.\nRisk Factors.\nThe Company cautions readers that its business activities involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those currently expected by the Company. The most significant of those risks are:\nRisk of reduced selling prices, shipments and profits associated with a highly competitive industry with excess capacity. An increase in global capacity and new or expanded production capacity in the United States in recent years has resulted in capacity in excess of demand globally, as well as in the Company\u2019s primary markets in North America. The competitive landscape reflects an improving, but uneven, domestic economy; uncertain, and in some cases, slowing foreign economies; an uneven recovery within certain sectors of the domestic and global economies; and continued intense competition from both foreign and domestic steel competitors. These conditions directly impact the pricing for AK Steel\u2019s products. At this time it is impossible to determine whether the domestic and/or global economies or industry sectors of those economies that are key to AK Steel\u2019s sales will continue to improve and generate demand that will utilize more of the existing excess capacity in the steel industry. Furthermore, it is unknown how competitors will react to these and other factors and how their actions could affect market dynamics and AK Steel\u2019s sales of and prices for its products. There is a risk of continued adverse effects on demand for AK Steel\u2019s products, the prices for those products, and AK Steel\u2019s sales and shipments of those products, which could negatively affect AK Steel\u2019s business, financial results and cash flows.\nRisk of changes in the cost of raw materials and energy. The price that AK Steel pays for energy and key raw materials, such as electricity, natural gas, industrial gases, iron ore, coal and scrap, can fluctuate significantly based on market factors. The prices at which AK Steel sells steel will not necessarily change in tandem with changes in its raw material and energy costs. A significant portion of AK Steel\u2019s shipments are in the spot market, and pricing for these products fluctuates based on prevailing market conditions. The remainder\n- 5-\nof AK Steel\u2019s shipments are pursuant to contracts typically having durations of one year or less. Some of those contracts contain fixed prices that do not allow AK Steel to pass through changes in the event of increases or decreases in raw material and energy costs. However, some of AK Steel\u2019s shipments to contract customers are pursuant to contracts with variable-pricing mechanisms that allow AK Steel to adjust the price or to impose a surcharge based upon changes in certain raw material and energy costs. Those adjustments, however, do not always reflect all of AK Steel\u2019s underlying raw material and energy cost changes. The scope of the adjustment may be limited by the terms of the negotiated language or by the timing of when the adjustment is effective relative to a cost increase. On balance, even for its contracts that contain variable-pricing mechanisms, AK Steel typically does not recover all of its underlying raw material and energy cost increases through such mechanisms. For shipments made to the spot market, market conditions or timing of sales may not allow AK Steel to recover the full amount of an increase in raw material or energy costs. As a result of the factors set forth above with respect to spot market sales and contract sales, AK Steel is not generally able to recover through the price of its steel the full amount of cost increases associated with its purchase of energy or key raw materials. In such circumstances a significant increase in raw material or energy costs likely would adversely impact AK Steel\u2019s financial results and cash flows. Conversely, in certain circumstances, AK Steel\u2019s financial results and cash flows also can be adversely affected when raw material prices decline. This can occur when the Company locks in the price of a raw material over a period and the spot market price for the material declines during that period. Because there often is a correlation between the price of finished steel and the raw materials of which it is comprised, a decline in raw material prices may coincide with lower steel prices, compressing the Company\u2019s margins. The impact of a change in raw materials prices also may be delayed by the need to consume existing inventories. New inventory may not be purchased until some portion of the existing inventory purchased earlier is consumed. The impact of this risk is particularly significant with respect to iron ore, coke and scrap because of the volume used by operations and the associated costs. The exposure of the Company to the risk of price increases with respect to iron ore has been reduced by virtue of its investment in Magnetation, which is expected to supply approximately 30% of the Company\u2019s annual iron ore needs when fully ramped up in the second half of 2015. The Company also manages its exposure to the risk of iron ore price increases by hedging a portion of its annual iron ore supply. The risk to the Company of price increases for metallurgical coal has been reduced through its investment in and development of AK Coal. Although AK Coal is only expected to supply approximately 10% of AK Steel\u2019s coal needs in 2015, its production could be expanded relatively quickly in the event coal prices increase significantly. However, there is a risk that the volume of iron ore and coal supplied to the Company by Magnetation and AK Coal, respectively, will be less than forecast in the event of delays in development or otherwise, or that the cost of raw materials from these operations will be higher than expected or above market prices. To the extent that the Company must acquire its iron ore and coal at market prices, these prices are sensitive to global demand and thus have been volatile in recent years. Future cost increases could be significant with respect to iron ore and coal, as well as certain other raw materials, such as scrap. The impact of significant fluctuations in the price AK Steel pays for its raw materials can be exacerbated by AK Steel\u2019s \u201clast in, first out\u201d (\u201cLIFO\u201d) method for valuing inventories when there are changes in the cost of raw materials or energy or in AK Steel\u2019s raw material inventory levels as well as AK Steel\u2019s finished and semi-finished inventory levels. The impact of LIFO accounting may be particularly significant with respect to period-to-period comparisons.\nRisk related to the Company\u2019s significant amount of debt and other obligations. As of December 31, 2014, AK Steel had outstanding $2,484.3 of indebtedness (excluding unamortized discount) and additional obligations, as well as pension and other postretirement benefit obligations totaling $1,280.9. Based on current actuarial assumptions, the Company expects to contribute to its pension plans approximately $35.0 and $15.0 in 2015 and 2016, respectively. AK Steel has the ability to borrow additional amounts under its $1.5 billion revolving credit facility. At December 31, 2014, AK Steel had outstanding borrowings of $605.0 under its credit facility and outstanding letters of credit of $73.7, resulting in remaining availability of $821.3 (subject to customary borrowing conditions, including a borrowing base). The amount of AK Steel\u2019s indebtedness and other financial obligations could have important consequences. For example, it could increase AK Steel\u2019s vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; require a substantial portion of the Company\u2019s cash flows to be dedicated to debt service payments, reducing the amount of cash flows available for other purposes, such as working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, joint ventures or general corporate purposes; limit AK Steel\u2019s ability to obtain additional financing in the future to be used for such other purposes; reduce AK Steel\u2019s planning flexibility for, or ability to react to, changes in the Company\u2019s business and the industry; and place AK Steel at a competitive disadvantage with competitors who may have less indebtedness and other obligations or greater access to financing.\nRisk of severe financial hardship or bankruptcy of one or more of the Company\u2019s major customers. Sales and operations of a majority of the Company\u2019s customers are sensitive to general economic conditions, especially as they affect the North American automotive and housing industries. In the event of a significant weakening of current economic conditions, whether as a result of secular or cyclical issues, it could lead to financial difficulties or even bankruptcy filings by customers of AK Steel. The concentration of customers in a specific industry, such as the automotive industry, may increase the risk to AK Steel because of the likelihood that circumstances may affect multiple customers at the same time. AK Steel could be adversely impacted by such financial hardships or bankruptcies. The nature of that impact would likely include lost sales or losses associated with the potential inability to collect all outstanding accounts receivables. Such an event could negatively impact AK Steel\u2019s financial results and cash flows.\nRisk of reduced demand in key product markets due to competition from aluminum or other alternatives to steel. The automotive market is an important element of AK Steel\u2019s business. Automotive manufacturers are under pressure to achieve increasing government-mandated fuel economy standards by 2025. One major automotive company recently elected to substitute aluminum for carbon steel in the production of the body of one of its vehicles, and may increase the use of aluminum in others. Other automotive manufacturers are currently investigating the potential use of aluminum and other alternatives to steels. If demand from one or more of AK Steel\u2019s major\n- 6-\nautomotive customers were to significantly decline as a result of increased use of aluminum or other competing materials in substitution for steel, it likely would negatively affect AK Steel\u2019s sales, financial results and cash flows.\nRisk of increased global steel production and imports. Actions by AK Steel\u2019s domestic or foreign competitors to increase production in and/or exports to the United States could result in an increased supply of steel in the United States, which could result in lower prices and shipments of AK Steel\u2019s products. In fact, significant increases in production capacity in the United States by competitors of AK Steel already have occurred in recent years as new carbon and stainless steelmaking and finishing facilities have begun production. In addition, foreign competitors, especially those in China, have substantially increased their production capacity in the last few years, and in some instances appear to have targeted the U.S. market for imports. In addition, some foreign economies, such as China, are slowing relative to recent historical norms, resulting in an increased volume of steel products that cannot be consumed by industries in those foreign steel producers\u2019 own countries. These and other factors have contributed to a high and growing level of imports of foreign steel into the United States in recent years and create a risk of even greater levels of imports, depending upon foreign market and economic conditions, the value of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies, and other variables beyond AK Steel\u2019s control. A significant further increase in domestic capacity or foreign imports could adversely affect AK Steel\u2019s sales, financial results and cash flows.\nRisks of excess inventory of raw materials. AK Steel has certain raw material supply contracts, particularly with respect to iron ore and coke, which have terms providing for minimum annual purchases, subject to exceptions for force majeure and other circumstances. If AK Steel\u2019s need for a particular raw material is reduced for an extended period significantly below what was projected at the contract\u2019s inception, or what was projected at the time an annual nomination was made under that contract, AK Steel could be required to purchase quantities of raw materials, particularly iron ore and coke, which exceed its anticipated annual needs. If that circumstance was to occur, and if AK Steel was not successful in reaching agreement with a particular raw material supplier to reduce the quantity of raw materials it purchases from that supplier, then AK Steel would likely be required to purchase more of a particular raw material in a given year than it needs, negatively affecting its financial results and cash flows. The impact on financial results could be exacerbated by AK Steel\u2019s LIFO method for valuing inventories, which could be affected by changes in AK Steel\u2019s raw material inventory levels, as well as AK Steel\u2019s finished and semi-finished inventory levels.\nRisk of supply chain disruptions or poor quality of raw materials. The Company\u2019s sales, financial results and cash flows could be adversely affected by transportation, raw material or energy supply disruptions, or poor quality of raw materials, particularly scrap, coal, coke, iron ore, alloys and purchased carbon steel slabs. For example, extreme cold weather conditions in the United States and Canada impact shipping on the Great Lakes and could disrupt the delivery of iron ore to the Company and/or increase the Company\u2019s costs related to iron ore. Such disruptions or quality issues, whether the result of severe financial hardships or bankruptcies of suppliers, natural or man-made disasters or other adverse weather events, or other unforeseen circumstances or events, could reduce production or increase costs at one or more of AK Steel\u2019s plants and potentially adversely affect customers or markets to which AK Steel sells its products. Any such significant disruption or quality issue would adversely affect AK Steel\u2019s sales, financial results and cash flows.\nRisk of production disruption or reduced production levels. When business conditions permit, AK Steel operates its facilities at production levels at or near capacity. High levels of production are important to AK Steel\u2019s financial results because it enables AK Steel to spread its fixed costs over a greater number of tons. Production disruptions could be caused by the idling of facilities due to reduced demand resulting from economic downturns, or from excess capacity. Such production disruptions also could be caused by unanticipated plant outages or equipment failures, particularly under circumstances where AK Steel lacks adequate redundant facilities, such as with respect to its Middletown Works hot mill. In addition, the occurrence of natural or man-made disasters, adverse weather conditions, or similar events or circumstances could significantly disrupt AK Steel\u2019s operations, negatively impact the operations of other companies or contractors AK Steel depends upon in its operations, or adversely affect customers or markets to which AK Steel sells its products. Any such significant disruption or reduced level of production would adversely affect AK Steel\u2019s sales, financial results and cash flows.\nRisks associated with the Company\u2019s healthcare obligations. AK Steel provides healthcare coverage to its active employees and to a significant portion of its retirees, as well as to certain members of their families. AK Steel is self-insured with respect to substantially all of its healthcare coverage. While AK Steel has substantially mitigated its exposure to rising healthcare costs through cost sharing, healthcare cost caps and the establishment of VEBA trusts, the cost of providing such healthcare coverage may be greater on a relative basis for AK Steel than for other steel companies against which AK Steel competes because such competitors either provide a lesser level of benefits, require that their participants pay more for the benefits they receive, or do not provide coverage to as broad a group of participants (e.g., they do not provide retiree healthcare benefits). In addition, AK Steel\u2019s costs with respect to its retiree healthcare obligations could be affected by fluctuations in interest rates or by existing or new federal healthcare legislation.\nRisks associated with the Company\u2019s pension obligations. The Company has a substantial pension obligation that, along with the related pension expense (income) and funding requirements, is directly affected by various changes in assumptions, including the selection of appropriate mortality assumptions and discount rates. These items also are affected by the rate and age of employee retirements, actual experience compared to actuarial projections and asset returns in the securities markets. Such changes could increase the cost to AK Steel of those obligations, which could have a material adverse effect on AK Steel\u2019s results and its ability to meet those obligations. In addition, changes in the law, rules, or governmental regulations with respect to pension funding could also materially and adversely affect the cash flow of AK Steel and its ability to meet its pension obligations. Also, under the method of accounting used by AK Steel with\n- 7-\nrespect to its pension obligations, AK Steel recognizes into its results of operations, as a \u201ccorridor\u201d adjustment, any unrecognized actuarial net gains or losses that exceed 10% of the larger of projected benefit obligations or plan assets. These corridor adjustments are driven mainly by changes in assumptions and by events and circumstances beyond AK Steel\u2019s control, primarily changes in interest rates, performance of the financial markets, and mortality and retirement projections. A corridor adjustment, if required after a re-measurement of AK Steel\u2019s pension obligations, historically has been recorded in the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. In certain past years, corridor adjustments have had a significant negative impact on AK Steel\u2019s financial statements in the year in which a charge was recorded, although the immediate recognition of the charge in that year has the beneficial effect of reducing its impact on future years. The recognition of a corridor charge does not have any immediate impact on the Company\u2019s cash flows.\nRisk of not reaching new labor agreements on a timely basis. Most of AK Steel\u2019s hourly employees are represented by various labor unions and are covered by collective bargaining agreements with expiration dates between May 2015 and February 2019. One of those contracts is scheduled to expire in 2015. The labor contract with the United Auto Workers, Local 4104, which represents approximately 130 hourly employees at the Company\u2019s Zanesville Works located in Zanesville, Ohio, expires on May 20, 2015. The Company intends to negotiate with this union to reach a new, competitive labor agreement in advance of the current expiration date. The Company cannot predict at this time, however, when a new, competitive labor agreement with the union at the Zanesville Works will be reached or what the impact of such agreement will be on the Company\u2019s operating costs, operating income and cash flow. There is the potential of a work stoppage at this location in 2015 as the collective bargaining agreement expires if the Company and the union cannot reach a timely agreement in contract negotiations. If there was to be a work stoppage, it could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s operations, financial results and cash flows. To the extent that the Company has labor contracts with unions at other locations which expire after 2015, a similar risk applies.\nRisks associated with major litigation, arbitrations, environmental issues and other contingencies. The Company has described several significant legal and environmental proceedings in Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements in Item 8. With respect to environmental issues, changes in application or scope of regulations applicable to AK Steel could have significant adverse impacts, including requiring capital expenditures to ensure compliance with the regulations, increased difficulty in obtaining future permits or meeting future permit requirements, incurring costs for emission allowances, restriction of production, and higher prices for certain raw materials. One or more of these adverse developments could negatively impact the Company\u2019s operations, financial results and cash flows. With respect to litigation, arbitrations and other legal proceedings, it is not possible to predict with certainty the outcome of such matters and the Company could in the future incur judgments, fines or penalties or enter into settlements of lawsuits, arbitrations and claims that could have an adverse effect on its business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, while the Company maintains insurance coverage with respect to certain claims, it may not be able to obtain such insurance on acceptable terms in the future and, to the extent it obtains such insurance, it may not provide adequate coverage against all claims. The Company establishes reserves based on its assessment of contingencies, including contingencies related to claims asserted against it in connection with litigation, arbitrations and environmental issues. Adverse developments in litigation, arbitrations, environmental issues or other legal proceedings may affect the Company\u2019s assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a reserve and require the Company to make payments in excess of its reserves, which could negatively affect its operations, financial results and cash flows.\nRisk associated with regulatory compliance and changes. AK Steel\u2019s business and the businesses of its customers and suppliers are subject to a wide variety of government oversight and regulation, including those relating to environmental permitting requirements. The regulations promulgated or adopted by various government agencies, and the interpretations and application of such regulations, are dynamic and constantly evolving. To the extent new regulations arise, the application of existing regulations expands, or the interpretation of applicable regulations changes, AK Steel may incur additional costs for compliance, including capital expenditures. For example, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) is required to routinely reassess the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (\u201cNAAQS\u201d) for criteria pollutants like nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, lead, ozone and particulate matter. These standards are frequently subject to litigation and revision. Revisions to the NAAQS could require the Company to make significant capital expenditures to ensure compliance and could make it more difficult for the Company to obtain required permits in the future. These risks are further heightened for the Company\u2019s facilities that are located in non-attainment areas. With respect to AK Coal, the coal mining industry is subject to numerous and extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, including laws and regulations pertaining to permitting and licensing requirements, air quality standards, plant and wildlife protection, reclamation and restoration of mining properties, the discharge of materials into the environment, the storage, treatment and disposal of wastes, surface subsidence from underground mining and the effects of mining on groundwater quality and availability. With respect to Magnetation, its pellet plant is subject to most of the same federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations as AK Coal. AK Steel may also be indirectly affected through regulatory changes impacting its customers or suppliers, who may incur higher costs that are indirectly incurred by the Company though higher prices charged by suppliers or lower sales prices to which customers are willing to agree. Such changes could reduce the competitiveness or even the viability of AK Steel products to AK Steel customers or cause AK Steel suppliers to pass their increased costs of compliance through to AK Steel in the form of higher prices for their goods or services.\nRisks associated with climate change and greenhouse gas emission limitations. The United States has not ratified the 1997 Kyoto Protocol Treaty (the \u201cKyoto Protocol\u201d) and AK Steel does not produce steel in a country that has ratified that treaty. Negotiations for a treaty that would succeed the Kyoto Protocol are ongoing and it is not known yet what the terms of that successor treaty ultimately will be or if the United States will ratify it. AK Steel\u2019s operations may become subject to legislation intended to limit climate change or\n- 8-\ngreenhouse gas emissions. It is possible that limitations on greenhouse gas emissions may be imposed in the United States at some point in the future through federally-enacted legislation or regulation. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (\u201cEPA\u201d) has issued and/or proposed regulations addressing greenhouse gas emissions, including regulations that will require reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from large sources and suppliers in the United States. Legislation has been introduced from time to time in the United States Congress aimed at limiting carbon emissions from companies that conduct business that is carbon-intensive. Among other potential material items, such bills could include a system of carbon emission credits issued to certain companies, similar to the European Union\u2019s existing \u201ccap and trade\u201d system. It is impossible at this time, however, to forecast what the final regulations and legislation, if any, will look like and the resulting effects on AK Steel. Depending upon the terms of any such regulations or legislation, however, AK Steel could suffer negative financial impacts as a result of increased energy, environmental and other costs in order to comply with the limitations that would be imposed on greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, depending upon whether similar limitations are imposed globally, the regulations and/or legislation could negatively impact AK Steel\u2019s ability to compete with foreign steel companies situated in areas not subject to such limitations. Unless and until all of the terms of such regulation and legislation are known, however, AK Steel cannot reasonably or reliably estimate their impact on its financial condition, operating performance or ability to compete.\nRisks associated with financial, credit, capital and banking markets. In the ordinary course of business, AK Steel seeks to access competitive financial, credit, capital and/or banking markets. Currently, AK Steel believes it has adequate access to these markets to meet its reasonably anticipated business needs. AK Steel both provides and receives normal trade financing to and from its customers and suppliers. To the extent, if at all, access to competitive financial, credit, capital and/or banking markets by AK Steel, or its customers or suppliers, was to be impaired, AK Steel\u2019s operations, financial results and cash flows could be adversely impacted.\nRisk associated with the Company\u2019s use of derivative contracts to hedge commodity pricing volatility. The Company uses cash-settled commodity price swaps and options to hedge the market risk for a portion of its raw material and energy purchases and the market risk associated with the sale of certain of its commodity steel products (hot roll carbon steel coils) to mitigate the risk of pricing volatility. For example, in the event the price of an underlying commodity falls below the price at which the Company has hedged such commodity, the Company will benefit from the lower market price for the commodity purchased, but may not realize the full benefit of the lower commodity price because of the amount that it has hedged. In certain circumstances the Company also could be required to provide collateral for its potential derivative liability or close its hedging transaction for the commodity. Additionally, there may be a lag in timing (particularly with respect to iron ore) between a decline in the price of a commodity underlying a derivative contract, which could cause the Company to make payments in the short-term to provide collateral or settle its relevant hedging transaction, and the period in which the Company experiences the benefits of the lower cost input through its direct purchases of the commodity. Each of these risks related to the Company\u2019s hedging transactions could adversely affect the Company\u2019s financial results and cash flows.\nRisk of ongoing challenges faced by Magnetation. Magnetation has experienced challenges to its business and operations, which has contributed to reduced liquidity since the third quarter of 2014. Foremost among these challenges has been the dramatic and sustained decrease in the IODEX that occurred throughout 2014 and has continued into 2015. Thus, although Magnetation is expected to have low costs of production relative to many other iron ore producers when its operations have fully ramped up and are operating at capacity, the recent significant reduction in the IODEX has adversely affected Magnetation\u2019s current profitability. Other key factors contributing to Magnetation\u2019s business challenges and reduced liquidity include the ongoing ramp up of its pellet plant and additional concentrate plant (both of which are expected to reach full run rate capacity in the second half of 2015), as well as its incurrence of aggregate cost overruns of approximately $40.0 (about 8% of the estimated cost) in the construction of these two facilities. Magnetation accomplished several actions in December 2014 and January 2015 to increase its liquidity and intends to continue to undertake efforts to further enhance liquidity and reduce costs. However, should such liquidity enhancement and cost reduction efforts be unsuccessful or insufficient, or if the IODEX remains at depressed levels or Magnetation experiences operational issues with the ramp-up of its pellet plant or additional concentrate plant, Magnetation\u2019s operations, financial results and liquidity will be adversely affected. As Magnetation\u2019s primary customer and an equityholder, challenges with production, liquidity or other adverse events at Magnetation may negatively impact the Company\u2019s operations, cash flows and financial results.\nRisk of inability to fully realize benefits of long-term cost savings initiatives. In recent years the Company has undertaken several significant projects in an effort to lower its costs and enhance its margins. In addition, it has identified many initiatives to achieve synergies in connection with its acquisition of Dearborn. These projects and initiatives include efforts to lower the Company\u2019s costs and increase its control over certain key raw materials through a strategy of vertically integrating into its supply of these key raw materials. AK Steel has implemented this strategy with respect to iron ore through its investment in Magnetation and with respect to coal through AK Coal\u2019s mining operations. Other projects and strategic initiatives to lower AK Steel\u2019s costs include increasing the utilization, yield and productivity of its facilities, implementing strategic purchasing procurement improvements, controlling maintenance spending, producing lower cost metallic burdens and reducing transportation costs. The Company also has identified several other areas for enhancing its profitability, including increasing its percentage of contract sales (and lowering spot market sales), producing and selling a higher-value mix of products and developing new products that can command higher prices from customers. To the extent that one or more of the Company\u2019s significant cost-savings or margin enhancement projects or strategic initiatives are unsuccessful, or are significantly less effective in achieving the level of combined cost-savings or margin enhancement than the Company is anticipating, or that the Company does not achieve such results as quickly as anticipated, the Company\u2019s financial results and cash flows could be adversely impacted.\n- 9-\nRisk of inability to hire or retain skilled labor and experienced manufacturing and mining managers. Modern steel-making and mining uses specialized techniques and advanced equipment and requires experienced managers and skilled laborers. The manufacturing and mining industries in the United States are in the midst of a shortage of experienced managers and skilled laborers. This shortage is due in large part to demographic changes, as such laborers and managers are retiring at a faster rate than replacements are entering the workforce or achieving a comparable level of experience. If AK Steel, AK Coal or Magnetation is unable to hire or contract sufficient experienced managers and skilled laborers, there could be an adverse impact on the productivity of these operations and the ultimate benefits to AK Steel.\nRisk of information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) security threats and cybercrime. The Company relies upon IT systems and networks in connection with a variety of business activities. In addition, the Company and certain of its third-party providers collect and store sensitive data. The Company has taken, and intends to continue to take, what it believes are appropriate and reasonable steps to prevent security breaches in its systems and networks. In recent years, however, there appears to have been an increase in both the number and sophistication of IT security threats and cybercrimes. These IT security threats and increasingly sophisticated cybercrimes, including advanced persistent attacks, pose a risk to system security and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of the Company\u2019s data. A failure of or breach in security could expose the Company to risks of production downtimes and operations disruptions, misuse of information or systems, or the compromising of confidential information, which in turn could adversely affect the Company\u2019s reputation, competitive position, business and financial results.\nRisk of failure to achieve the estimated synergies and other expected benefits of the Dearborn acquisition and/or to integrate Dearborn successfully. The Company may be unable to achieve the strategic, operational, financial and other benefits, and/or the resulting estimated synergies, contemplated by the Company with respect to the acquisition of Dearborn to the full extent expected or in a timely manner. The integration of Dearborn\u2019s operations into the Company will be a complex and lengthy endeavor, and if the Company is not as successful as expected in integrating Dearborn, the cost savings, synergies, accretion to earnings, increased shipments and other anticipated benefits and opportunities from the acquisition may not be fully realized or may take longer to realize than expected. Some of the anticipated synergies depend on increased production at Dearborn based on a certain level of customer demand. If this level of customer demand does not occur, the synergies will not be fully realized, which could have an adverse effect on the Company\u2019s business, financial results and cash flows.\nWhile the previously listed items represent the most significant risks to the Company, the Company regularly monitors and reports risks to Management and the Board of Directors by means of a formal Total Enterprise Risk Management program.", "PERMNO": 80303, "SIC": 3312, "TIC": "AKS"}
