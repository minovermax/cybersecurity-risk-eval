Risk Factors\nIn your evaluation of our company and business, you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with information disclosed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes and \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in Part II of this Annual Report, and other documents we file with the SEC. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material but are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us. If any of these risks or uncertainties actually occurs, our business, financial condition or operating results could be materially harmed and the price of our stock could decline. Our business is also subject to general risks and uncertainties that affect many other companies, such as our ability to collect receivables, overall U.S. and global economic and industry conditions, geopolitical events, changes in laws or accounting rules, fluctuations in interest and exchange rates, terrorism, international conflicts, major health concerns, climate change or other disruptions of expected economic and business conditions. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may materially harm our business, financial condition or operating results and result in a decline in the price of our stock.\nSummary of Risk Factors\nThis risk factor summary contains a high-level summary of risks associated with our business. It does not contain all of the information that may be important to you, and you should read this risk factor summary together with the more detailed discussion of risks and uncertainties set forth following this summary. A summary of our risks includes, but is not limited to, the following:\n\u2022We depend on government agencies as our primary customers and if our reputation or relationships with these agencies were harmed, our future revenues and growth prospects could be adversely affected.\n\u2022A decline in the U.S. government budget, changes in spending or budgetary priorities or delays in contract awards may significantly and adversely affect our future revenues and limit our growth prospects.\n\u2022Because we depend on U.S. government contracts, a delay in the completion of the U.S. government's budget and appropriation process could delay procurement of the products, services and solutions we provide and have an adverse effect on our future revenues.\n\u2022The extent to which our business will be adversely affected by COVID-19 or other health epidemics, pandemics and similar outbreaks is highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\n\u2022Our failure to comply with a variety of complex procurement rules and regulations could result in our being liable for penalties, including termination of our U.S. government contracts, disqualification from bidding on future U.S. government contracts and suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracting.\n\u2022The U.S. government may adopt new contract rules and regulations or revise its procurement practices in a manner adverse to us at any time.\n\u2022As a U.S. government contractor, we and our partners are subject to reviews, audits and cost adjustments by the U.S. government, which, if resolved unfavorably to us, could adversely affect our profitability, cash position or growth prospects.\n\u2022Our business is subject to governmental review and investigation, which could adversely affect our financial position, operating results and growth prospects.\n\u2022Misconduct of employees, subcontractors, agents, suppliers, business partners or joint ventures and others working on our behalf could cause us to lose existing contracts or customers and adversely affect our ability to obtain new contracts and customers and could have a significant adverse impact on our business and reputation.\n\u2022Due to the competitive process to obtain contracts and the likelihood of bid protests, we may be unable to achieve or sustain revenue growth and profitability.\n\u2022The U.S. government may terminate, cancel, modify or curtail our contracts at any time prior to their completion and, if we do not replace them, this may adversely affect our future revenues and profitability.\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 15\nPART I\n\u2022We face intense competition that can impact our ability to obtain contracts and therefore affect our future revenues and growth prospects.\n\u2022A failure to attract, train, retain and motivate skilled employees, including our management team, would adversely affect our ability to execute our strategy and may disrupt our operations.\n\u2022We may not realize as revenues the full amounts reflected in our backlog, which could adversely affect our expected future revenues and growth prospects.\n\u2022Our earnings and profitability may vary based on the mix of our contracts and may be adversely affected by our failure to accurately estimate and manage costs, time and resources.\n\u2022Investigations, audits, claims, disputes, enforcement actions, litigation, arbitration or other legal proceedings could require us to pay potentially large damage awards and could be costly to defend, which would adversely affect our cash balances and profitability, and could damage our reputation.\n\u2022Our business and operations expose us to numerous legal and regulatory requirements, and any violation of these requirements could harm our business.\n\u2022Cybersecurity breaches and other information security incidents could negatively impact our business and financial results, impair our ability to effectively provide our services to our clients and cause harm to our reputation or competitive position.\n\u2022Internal system or service failures, or failures in the systems or services of third parties on which we rely, could disrupt our business and impair our ability to effectively provide our services and products to our customers, which could damage our reputation and adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\n\u2022Customer systems failures could damage our reputation and adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\n\u2022Our success depends, in part, on our ability to work with complex and rapidly changing technologies to meet the needs of our customers.\n\u2022We have made and continue to make acquisitions, investments, joint ventures and divestitures that involve numerous risks and uncertainties.\n\u2022We cannot assure you that we will continue to pay dividends on our common stock.\n\u2022Provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could delay or prevent transactions that many stockholders may favor.\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 16\nPART I\nIndustry and Economic Risks\nWe depend on government agencies as our primary customers and if our reputation or relationships with these agencies were harmed, our future revenues and growth prospects could be adversely affected.\nWe generated 87% of our total revenues during fiscal 2020 and 2019 and 85% of our total revenues during fiscal 2018 from contracts with the U.S. government (including all branches of the U.S. military), either as a prime contractor or a subcontractor to other contractors engaged in work for the U.S. government. We expect to continue to derive most of our revenues from work performed under U.S. government contracts. Our reputation and relationship with the U.S. government, and in particular with the agencies of the DoD and the U.S. Intelligence Community, are key factors in maintaining and growing our revenues. Negative press reports or publicity, regardless of accuracy, which could pertain to employee or subcontractor misconduct, conflicts of interest, poor contract performance, deficiencies in services, reports, products or other deliverables, information security breaches or other aspects of our business, could harm our reputation, particularly with these agencies. Due to the sensitive nature of our work and our confidentiality obligations to our customers, we may be unable to or limited in our ability to respond to such negative publicity, which could also harm our reputation and our business. If our reputation is negatively affected, certain customers could cease to do business with us and our ability to hire or retain employees and our standing in professional communities, to which we contribute and from which we receive expert knowledge, could be diminished. If any of the foregoing occurs, the amount of business with the U.S. government and other customers could decrease and our business, future revenues, financial condition and growth prospects could be adversely affected.\nA decline in the U.S. government budget, changes in spending or budgetary priorities or delays in contract awards may significantly and adversely affect our future revenues and limit our growth prospects.\nRevenues under contracts with the DoD and U.S. Intelligence Community, either as a prime contractor or subcontractor to other contractors, represented approximately 49% of our total revenues for fiscal 2020 and 48% of our total revenues for fiscal 2019 and 2018. Levels of U.S. government and DoD spending are difficult to predict and subject to significant risk. Laws and plans adopted by the U.S. government relating to, along with pressures on and uncertainty surrounding the U.S. federal budget, potential changes in budgetary priorities and defense spending levels, sequestration, the appropriations process and the permissible federal debt limit, could adversely affect the funding for individual programs and delay purchasing or payment decisions by our customers. Considerable uncertainty exists regarding how future budget and program decisions will unfold, including the defense spending priorities of the U.S. Presidential Administration and Congress, and what challenges budget reductions will present for us and our industry generally.\nCurrent U.S. government spending levels for defense-related or other programs may not be sustained and future spending and program authorizations may not increase or may decrease or shift to programs in areas in which we do not provide services or are less likely to be awarded contracts. Such changes in spending authorizations and budgetary priorities may occur as a result of uncertainty surrounding the federal budget, increasing political pressure and legislation, shifts in spending priorities from defense-related or other programs as a result of competing demands for federal funds, the number and intensity of military conflicts or other factors. In the event government funding relating to our contracts with the U.S. government or DoD becomes unavailable, or is reduced or delayed, or planned orders are reduced, our contract or subcontract under such programs may be terminated or adjusted by the U.S. government or the prime contractor, if applicable. Our operating results could also be adversely affected by spending caps or changes in the budgetary priorities of the U.S. government or the DoD, as well as delays in program starts or the award of contracts or task orders under contracts.\nThe U.S. government also conducts periodic reviews of U.S. defense strategies and priorities, which may shift DoD or other budgetary priorities, reduce overall U.S. government spending or delay contract or task order awards for defense-related or other programs from which we would otherwise expect to derive a significant portion of our future revenues. In addition, changes to the federal or DoD acquisition system and contracting models could affect whether and how we pursue certain opportunities and the terms under which we are able to do so. A significant decline in overall U.S. government spending, including in the areas of national security, intelligence and homeland security, a significant shift in its spending priorities, the substantial reduction or elimination of particular defense-related programs or significant delays in contract or task order awards for large programs could adversely affect our future revenues and results of operations and limit our growth prospects.\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 17\nPART I\nBecause we depend on U.S. government contracts, a delay in the completion of the U.S. government's budget and appropriation process could delay procurement of the products, services and solutions we provide and have an adverse effect on our future revenues.\nThe funding of U.S. government programs is subject to an annual congressional budget authorization and appropriations process. In years when the U.S. government does not complete its appropriations before the beginning of the new fiscal year on October 1, government operations are typically funded pursuant to a \"continuing resolution,\" which allows federal government agencies to operate at spending levels approved in the previous appropriations cycle, but does not authorize new spending initiatives. When the U.S. government operates under a continuing resolution, delays can occur in the procurement of the products, services and solutions that we provide and may result in new initiatives being canceled. We have from time to time experienced a decline in revenues in our fourth quarter as a result of this annual appropriations cycle, and we could experience similar declines in revenues from future delays in the appropriations process. When the U.S. government fails to complete its appropriations process or to provide for a continuing resolution, a full or partial federal government shutdown may result. A federal government shutdown could, in turn, result in our incurrence of substantial labor or other costs without reimbursement under customer contracts, the delay or cancellation of key programs or the delay of contract payments, which could have a negative effect on our cash flows and adversely affect our future results of operations. For many programs, Congress appropriates funds on an annual fiscal year basis even though the program performance period may extend over several years. Consequently, programs are often partially funded initially and additional funds are committed only as Congress makes further appropriations. If we incur costs in excess of funds obligated on a contract, we may be at risk for reimbursement of those costs unless or until additional funds are obligated to the contract. In addition, when supplemental appropriations are required to operate the U.S. government or fund specific programs and passage of legislation needed to approve any supplemental appropriations bill is delayed, the overall funding environment for our business could be adversely affected.\nDue to the competitive process to obtain contracts and the likelihood of bid protests, we may be unable to achieve or sustain revenue growth and profitability.\nWe expect that a majority of the business that we seek in the foreseeable future will be awarded through a competitive bidding process. The U.S. government has increasingly relied on contracts that are subject to a continuing competitive bidding process, including GSA Schedule and other multi-award contracts, which has resulted in greater competition and increased pricing pressure. The competitive bidding process involves substantial costs and a number of risks, including significant cost and managerial time to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that may not be awarded to us, may be split among competitors or that may be awarded but for which we do not receive meaningful task orders, and to the risk of inaccurately estimating the resources and costs that will be required to fulfill any contract we win.\nFollowing contract award, we may encounter significant expense, delay, contract modifications or even contract loss as a result of our competitors protesting the award of contracts to us in competitive bidding. Any resulting loss or delay of start-up and funding of work under protested contract awards may adversely affect our revenues and/or profitability. In addition, multi-award contracts require that we make sustained post-award efforts to obtain task orders under the contract. As a result, we may not be able to obtain these task orders or recognize revenues under these multi-award contracts. We are also experiencing increased competition generally which impacts our ability to obtain contracts; see the risk factor \u201cWe face intense competition that can impact our ability to obtain contracts and therefore affect our future revenues and growth prospects.\u201d Our failure to compete effectively in this procurement environment would adversely affect our revenues and/or profitability.\nThe U.S. government may terminate, cancel, modify or curtail our contracts at any time prior to their completion and, if we do not replace them, this may adversely affect our future revenues and profitability.\nMany of the U.S. government programs in which we participate as a contractor or subcontractor extend for several years and include one or more base years and one or more option years. These programs are normally funded on an annual basis. Under our contracts, the U.S. government generally has the right to not exercise options to extend or expand our contracts and may otherwise terminate, cancel, modify or curtail our contracts at its convenience. Any decisions by the U.S. government to not exercise contract options or to terminate, cancel, modify or curtail our major programs or contracts would adversely affect our revenues, revenue growth and profitability.\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 18\nPART I\nWe have experienced and continue to experience periodic performance issues under certain of our contracts. Some of our contracts involve the development of complex systems and products to achieve challenging customer goals in a competitive procurement environment. As a result, we sometimes experience technological or other performance difficulties, which have in the past and may in the future result in delays, cost overruns and failures in our performance of these contracts. If a government customer terminates a contract for default, we may be exposed to liability, including for excess costs incurred by the customer in procuring undelivered services and products from another source. Depending on the nature and value of the contract, a performance issue or termination for default could cause our actual results to differ from those anticipated and could harm our reputation.\nWe face intense competition that can impact our ability to obtain contracts and therefore affect our future revenues and growth prospects.\nOur business is highly competitive and we compete with larger companies that have greater name recognition, financial resources and a larger technical staff. We also compete with smaller, more specialized companies that are able to concentrate their resources on particular areas. Additionally, we compete with the U.S. government\u2019s own capabilities and federal non-profit contract research centers.\nThe markets in which we operate are characterized by rapidly changing technology and the needs of our customers change and evolve regularly. Accordingly, our success depends on our ability to invest in and develop services and products that address these changing needs and to provide people and technology needed to deliver these services and products. To remain competitive, we must consistently provide superior service, technology and performance on a cost-effective basis to our customers while understanding customer priorities and maintaining customer relationships. Our competitors may be able to provide our customers with different or greater capabilities or technologies or better contract terms than we can provide, including technical qualifications, past contract experience, geographic presence, price and the availability of qualified professional personnel. Some of our competitors have made or could make acquisitions of businesses, or establish teaming or other agreements among themselves or third parties, that allow them to offer more competitive and comprehensive solutions. As a result of such acquisitions or arrangements, our current or potential competitors may be able to accelerate the adoption of new technologies that better address customer needs, devote greater resources to bring these products and services to market, initiate or withstand substantial price competition or develop and expand their product and service offerings more quickly than we do. These competitive pressures in our market or our failure to compete effectively may result in fewer orders, reduced revenue and margins and loss of market share. In addition, it is possible that industry consolidation may impact customers\u2019 perceptions of the viability of smaller or even mid-size software firms and consequently customers\u2019 willingness to purchase from such firms.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nOur failure to comply with a variety of complex procurement rules and regulations could result in our being liable for penalties, including termination of our U.S. government contracts, disqualification from bidding on future U.S. government contracts and suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracting.\nWe must comply with laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration and performance of U.S. government contracts, which affect how we do business with our customers. Such laws and regulations may potentially impose added costs on our business and our failure to comply with them may lead to civil or criminal penalties, termination of our U.S. government contracts, or suspension or debarment from contracting with federal agencies. Some significant laws and regulations that affect us include:\n\u2022the FAR and supplements, which regulate the formation, administration and performance of U.S. government contracts;\n\u2022the Truth in Negotiations Act, which requires certification and disclosure of cost and pricing data in connection with certain contract negotiations;\n\u2022the Procurement Integrity Act, which regulates access to competitor bid and proposal information and government source selection information and our ability to provide compensation to certain former government officials;\n\u2022the Civil False Claims Act, which provides for substantial civil penalties for violations, including for submission of a false or fraudulent claim to the U.S. government for payment or approval;\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 19\nPART I\n\u2022the False Statements Act, which imposes civil and criminal liability for making false statements to the U.S. government; and\n\u2022the U.S. government CAS, which imposes accounting requirements that govern our right to reimbursement under certain cost-based U.S. government contracts.\nFor additional background on the regulations that apply to our business and the related compliance risks, see \u201cRegulation\u201d within Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the risk factor \u201cOur business is subject to governmental review and investigation, which could adversely affect our financial position, operating results and growth prospects.\"\nThe FAR and many of our U.S. government contracts contain organizational conflict of interest clauses that may limit our ability to compete for or perform certain other contracts or other types of services for particular customers. Organizational conflicts of interest arise when we engage in activities that may make us unable to render impartial assistance or advice to the U.S. government, impair our objectivity in performing contract work or provide us with an unfair competitive advantage. A conflict of interest issue that precludes our competition for or performance on a significant program or contract could harm our prospects.\nThe U.S. government may adopt new contract rules and regulations or revise its procurement practices in a manner adverse to us at any time.\nOur industry has experienced, and we expect it will continue to experience, significant changes to business practices as a result of an increased focus on affordability, efficiencies and recovery of costs, among other items. U.S. government agencies may face restrictions or pressure regarding the type and amount of services that they may obtain from private contractors. Legislation, regulations and initiatives dealing with procurement reform, mitigation of potential conflicts of interest and environmental responsibility or sustainability, as well as any resulting shifts in the buying practices of U.S. government agencies, such as increased usage of fixed-price contracts, multiple-award contracts and small business set-aside contracts, could have adverse effects on government contractors, including us. Any of these changes could impair our ability to obtain new contracts or renew our existing contracts when customers recompete those contracts. Any new contracting requirements or procurement methods could be costly or administratively difficult for us to implement and could adversely affect our future revenues, profitability and prospects.\nAs a U.S. government contractor, we and our partners are subject to reviews, audits and cost adjustments by the U.S. government, which, if resolved unfavorably to us, could adversely affect our profitability, cash position or growth prospects.\nU.S. government contractors (including their subcontractors and others with whom they do business) operate in a highly regulated environment and are routinely audited and reviewed by the U.S. government and its agencies, including the DCAA, DCMA, the DoD Inspector General and others. These agencies review a contractor's performance on government contracts, cost structure, indirect rates and pricing practices and compliance with applicable contracting and procurement laws, regulations, terms and standards, as well as the adequacy of our systems and processes in meeting government requirements. They also review the adequacy of the contractor\u2019s compliance with government standards for its business systems, including a contractor's accounting system, earned value management system, estimating system, materials management and accounting system, property management system and purchasing system.\nBoth contractors and the U.S. government agencies conducting these audits and reviews have come under increased scrutiny. As a result, the current audits and reviews have become more rigorous and the standards to which we are held are being more strictly interpreted, increasing the likelihood of an audit or review resulting in an adverse outcome.\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 20\nPART I\nA finding of significant control deficiencies in our system audits or other reviews can result in decremented billing rates to our U.S. government customers until the control deficiencies are corrected and our remediations are accepted by the DCMA. Government audits and reviews may conclude that our practices are not consistent with applicable laws and regulations and result in adjustments to contract costs and mandatory customer refunds. Such adjustments can be applied retroactively, which could result in significant customer refunds. Our receipt of adverse audit findings or the failure to obtain an \"approved\" determination of our various business systems from the responsible U.S. government agency could significantly and adversely affect our business, including our ability to bid on new contracts and our competitive position in the bidding process. A determination of non-compliance with applicable contracting and procurement laws, regulations and standards could also result in the U.S. government imposing penalties and sanctions against us, including reductions of the value of contracts, contract modifications or termination, withholding of payments, the loss of export/import privileges, administrative or civil judgements and liabilities, criminal judgements or convictions, liabilities and consent or other voluntary decrees or agreements, other sanctions, the assessment of penalties, fines or compensatory, treble or other damages or non-monetary relief or actions, suspension or debarment, suspension of payments and increased government scrutiny that could negatively impact our reputation, delay or adversely affect our ability to invoice and receive timely payment on contracts, perform contracts or compete for contracts with the U.S. government.\nAs of January 1, 2021, indirect cost audits by the DCAA remain open for fiscal 2015 and subsequent fiscal years. Although we have recorded contract revenues based upon our estimate of costs that we believe will be approved upon final audit or review, we cannot predict the outcome of any ongoing or future audits or reviews and adjustments and, if future adjustments exceed our estimates, our profitability may be adversely affected.\nOur business is subject to governmental review and investigation, which could adversely affect our financial position, operating results and growth prospects.\nWe are routinely subject to governmental investigations relating to compliance with various laws and regulations with respect to our role as a contractor to federal, state and local government customers and in connection with performing services in countries outside the U.S. If a review or investigation identifies improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to disgorgement of profits, fines, damages, litigation, civil or criminal penalties, exclusion from sales channels or sales opportunities, injunctions or administrative sanctions, including the termination of contracts, the triggering of price reduction clauses, suspension of payments, suspension or debarment from doing business with governmental agencies or other consequences. We may suffer harm to our reputation if allegations of impropriety are made against us, which would impair our ability to win new contract awards or receive contract renewals. Penalties and sanctions are not uncommon in our industry. If we incur a material penalty or administrative sanction or otherwise suffer harm to our reputation, our revenues, profitability, cash position and future prospects could be adversely affected. More generally, increases in scrutiny and investigations from government organizations, legislative bodies or agencies into business practices and into major programs supported by contractors may lead to increased legal costs and may harm our reputation, revenues, profitability and growth prospects.\nInvestigations, audits, claims, disputes, enforcement actions, litigation, arbitration or other legal proceedings could require us to pay potentially large damage awards and could be costly to defend, which would adversely affect our cash balances and profitability, and could damage our reputation.\nWe are subject to a number of lawsuits and claims described in \"Note 24-Contingencies\" of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained within this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as may be updated in our future filings with the SEC, including our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q. We are also subject to, and may become a party to, a variety of other litigation, claims, investigations, audits, enforcement actions, arbitrations or other legal proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Adverse judgments or settlements in some or all of these legal disputes may result in significant monetary damages, penalties or injunctive relief against us. Any claims or litigation could be costly to defend, and even if we are successful or if fully indemnified or insured, could damage our reputation and make it more difficult to compete effectively or obtain adequate insurance in the future. In addition, responding to any action may result in a significant diversion of management's attention and resources. Litigation and other claims, including those described in \"Note 24-Contingencies,\" are subject to inherent uncertainties and management\u2019s view of these matters may change in the future.\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 21\nPART I\nOur business and operations expose us to numerous legal and regulatory requirements, and any violation of these requirements could harm our business.\nWe are subject to numerous state, federal and international laws and directives and regulations in the U.S. and abroad that involve matters central to our business, including data privacy and protection, employment and labor relations, immigration, taxation, anti-corruption, anti-bribery, import-export controls, trade restrictions, internal and disclosure control obligations, securities regulation and anti-competition. Compliance with diverse and changing legal requirements is costly, time-consuming and requires significant resources. We also conduct business in certain identified growth areas, such as health information technology, energy and environmental services, which are highly regulated and may expose us to increased compliance risk. Violations of one or more of these diverse legal requirements in the conduct of our business could result in significant fines and other damages, criminal sanctions against us or our officers, prohibitions on doing business and damage to our reputation. Violations of these regulations or contractual obligations related to regulatory compliance in connection with the performance of customer contracts could also result in liability for significant monetary damages, fines and/or criminal prosecution, unfavorable publicity and other reputational damage, restrictions on our ability to compete for certain work and allegations by our customers that we have not performed our contractual obligations.\nOur business is subject to complex and evolving laws and regulations regarding privacy and data security which could subject us to investigations, claims or monetary penalties against us, require us to make changes to our business practices or otherwise adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nWe are subject to a variety of international, federal, state and local laws and regulations in the U.S. and abroad relating to privacy, data security, protection, storage, retention, transfer and disposal, technology protection and personal information. Foreign laws and regulations in these areas can impose different obligations or be more restrictive than those in the U.S. These laws and regulations, which, depending on the regime, may be enforced by private parties or government entities, are constantly evolving and may be subject to significant change in the future. In addition, the application, interpretation and enforcement of these laws and regulations are often uncertain, particularly in new and rapidly evolving areas of technology, and may be interpreted and applied inconsistently from country to country and inconsistently with our current policies and practices.\nAs a contractor supporting defense and national security clients, we are also subject to certain additional regulatory compliance requirements relating to data privacy and cybersecurity. Under DFARS and other federal regulations, certain of our networks and information technology systems are required to comply with the security and privacy controls in National Institute of Standards and Technology Special Publications. To the extent that we do not comply with the applicable security and control requirements, unauthorized access or disclosure of sensitive information could potentially result in a contract termination, which could materially and adversely affect our business and financial results and lead to reputational harm. We are also subject to the DoD Cybersecurity Maturity Model Certification (\u201cCMMC\u201d) requirements, which requires all contractors to receive specific third-party certifications relating to specified cybersecurity standards in order to be eligible for contract awards. The DoD expects that all new contracts will be required to comply with the CMMC by 2026, with initial requests for information beginning in June 2020 and requests for proposal beginning in September 2020. We are in the process of evaluating our readiness and preparing for the CMMC, but to the extent we are unable to achieve certification in advance of contract awards that specify the requirement, we will be unable to bid on such contract awards or on follow-on awards for existing work with the DoD, depending on the level of standard as required for each solicitation, which could adversely impact our revenue and profitability. In addition, any obligations that may be imposed on us under the CMMC may be different from or in addition to those otherwise required by applicable laws and regulations, which may cause additional expense for compliance.\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 22\nPART I\nAny failure or perceived failure by us, our service providers, suppliers, subcontractors or other business partners to comply with international, federal, state or local laws and regulations in these areas could result in regulatory actions or lawsuits against us, legal liability, fines, damages and other costs. We may also incur substantial expenses in implementing and maintaining compliance with such laws. For example, the European Union's (\"EU\u2019s\") General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), which took effect in May 2018, has created new compliance obligations for companies that process data of EU data subjects, which require investment into ongoing data protection activities and documentation requirements, and creates the potential for significantly increased fines for noncompliance. In the U.S., the California Consumer Protection Privacy Act of 2018 (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which took effect on January 1, 2020, provides new consumer privacy rights to natural persons residing in California by regulating the processing of personal information of California residents and increasing the obligations on businesses in connection with such activities. Additionally, a new privacy law, the California Privacy Rights Act (\u201cCPRA\u201d), was approved by California voters in the election on November 3, 2020 and will take effect in most material respects on January 1, 2023. The CPRA modifies the CCPA significantly, including by expanding consumers\u2019 rights with respect to certain sensitive personal information and creating a new state agency to oversee implementation and enforcement efforts. It is possible that the CCPA or similar laws, now or in the future, will be deemed applicable to some aspects of our business, which would impose new compliance obligations and require additional investment into privacy law compliance and data protection activities on an ongoing basis. Any obligations that may be imposed on us under the CCPA, the CPRA or similar laws may be different from or in addition to those required by the GDPR or other relevant foreign laws, which may cause additional expense for compliance across various jurisdictions. Various U.S., EU and other foreign privacy or data security laws, regulations, directives, policies, industry standards or legal obligations that may be relevant to our business also impose obligations to maintain a cybersecurity program at certain levels of quality, as well as obligations to give notice to affected individuals and to certain regulators in the event of a data breach.\nThe overarching complexity of privacy and data security laws and regulations around the world pose a compliance challenge that could manifest in costs, damages or liability in other forms as a result of failure to implement proper programmatic controls, failure to adhere to those controls or the malicious or inadvertent breach of applicable privacy and data security requirements by us, our employees, our business partners (including our service providers, suppliers or subcontractors) or our customers. We also expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws and regulations concerning privacy and data security, and we cannot yet determine the impact such future laws, regulations and standards, or amendments to or re-interpretations of, existing laws and regulations, industry standards or other obligations may have on our business.\nBusiness and Operational Risks\nThe extent to which our business will be adversely affected by COVID-19 or other health epidemics, pandemics and similar outbreaks is highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nThe outbreak and global spread of COVID-19, and the preventative or protective actions that governments, corporations, individuals and we are taking and may continue to take in an effort to limit the impact of COVID-19, have resulted in a period of business disruption and increased economic uncertainty. The spread of COVID-19 has caused us to modify our business practices (including employee travel, access to customer sites, employee and contractor remote work and cancellation of physical participation in meetings, events and conferences), and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers and business partners. There is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by COVID-19 or otherwise be satisfactory to government authorities. If significant portions of our workforce are unable to work effectively, including because of illness, quarantines, government actions, facility closures or other restrictions due to COVID-19, our operations and results will likely be impacted.\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 23\nPART I\nGovernment agencies are our primary customers and the long-term impact of increased government spending in response to COVID-19 is uncertain. This could result in a re-evaluation of U.S. government spending levels and priorities, which could impact our business performance. The situation surrounding COVID-19 remains fluid and the likelihood of an impact on us that could be material increases the longer the virus impacts activity levels in the locations in which we operate. In particular, a delay in wide distribution of vaccines, or a lack of public acceptance of vaccines, could lead people to continue to self-isolate and not participate in the economy at pre-pandemic levels for a prolonged period of time. Further, even if vaccines are widely distributed and accepted, there can be no assurance that vaccines will ultimately be successful in limiting or stopping the spread of COVID-19. Even after COVID-19 has subsided, we may experience materially adverse impacts on our business as a result of the pandemic's global economic impact, including any recession that is occurring or may occur in the future. For example, the global spread of COVID-19 has resulted in a substantial decline in demand for air travel, which has adversely impacted the demand for products and services related to our airport security detection and automation business. We are not able to predict whether COVID-19 will result in permanent changes to air travel behaviors, including a permanent reduction in business travel as a result of the increased use of teleconferencing products and, more broadly, a general reluctance to travel by consumers, each of which has, and could continue to, impact our business. Further, new contract awards have been and may continue to be delayed and our ability to perform on our existing contracts has been and may continue to be delayed or impaired, which will negatively impact our revenues. In addition, our program costs have increased and may continue to increase as a result of COVID-19, and these cost increases may not be fully recoverable or adequately covered by insurance, or equitable adjustments to contract prices or reimbursement of costs under Section 3610 of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act, which could impact our profitability. The continued spread of COVID-19 has had and may continue to have similar negative impacts on our customers, subcontractors, service providers and suppliers, causing delay or limiting their ability to perform, including in making timely payments to us. Any resulting financial impact cannot be reasonably estimated at this time but may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The extent to which COVID-19 impacts our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information that may emerge concerning the severity and duration of COVID-19 and actions to contain it or treat its impact, among others. In addition, to the extent COVID-19 or any worsening of the global business and economic environment as a result adversely affects our business and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described herein.\nMisconduct of employees, subcontractors, agents, suppliers, business partners or joint ventures and others working on our behalf could cause us to lose existing contracts or customers and adversely affect our ability to obtain new contracts and customers and could have a significant adverse impact on our business and reputation.\nMisconduct could include fraud or other improper activities such as falsifying time or other records and violations of laws, such as the Anti-Kickback Act, and the failure to comply with our policies and procedures or with federal, state or local government procurement regulations, regulations regarding the use and safeguarding of classified or other protected information, legislation regarding the pricing of labor and other costs in government contracts, laws and regulations relating to environmental, health or safety matters, bribery of foreign government officials, import-export control, lobbying or similar activities and any other applicable laws or regulations. Any data loss or information security lapses resulting in the compromise of personal information or the improper use or disclosure of sensitive or classified information could result in claims, remediation costs, regulatory investigations or sanctions against us, corruption or disruption of our systems or those of our customers, impairment of our ability to provide services to our customers, loss of current and future contracts, indemnity obligations, serious harm to our reputation and other potential liabilities. See also the risk factor \u201cCybersecurity breaches and other information security incidents could negatively impact our business and financial results, impair our ability to effectively provide our services to our clients and cause harm to our reputation or competitive position.\u201d\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 24\nPART I\nAlthough we have implemented policies, procedures, training and other compliance controls to prevent and detect these activities, these precautions may not prevent all misconduct, and as a result, we could face unknown risks or losses. This risk of improper conduct may increase as we continue to expand and do business with new partners. In the ordinary course of our business we form and are members of joint ventures (meaning joint efforts or business arrangements of any type). We may be unable to prevent misconduct or violations of applicable laws by these joint ventures (including their officers, directors and employees) or our partners. Our failure to comply with applicable laws or regulations or misconduct by any of our employees, subcontractors, agents, suppliers, business partners or joint ventures and others working on our behalf could damage our reputation and subject us to administrative, civil or criminal investigations and enforcement actions, fines and penalties, restitution or other damages, loss of security clearance, loss of current and future customer contracts, loss of privileges and other sanctions, including suspension or debarment from contracting with federal, state or local government agencies, any of which would adversely affect our business, reputation and our future results.\nA failure to attract, train, retain and motivate skilled employees, including our management team, would adversely affect our ability to execute our strategy and may disrupt our operations.\nOur business involves the development of tailored services and solutions for our customers, a process that relies heavily upon the expertise and services of our employees. Our continued success and ability to compete in a highly competitive environment depend on our ability to recruit and retain highly trained and skilled science, engineering, technical, math and professional personnel. Competition for skilled personnel is intense and competitors in our industry and others in the private sector aggressively recruit key employees. In addition, many U.S. government programs require contractors to have security clearances. Depending on the level of required clearance, security clearances can be difficult and time-consuming to obtain and personnel with security clearances are in great demand. Particularly in highly specialized areas, it has become more difficult to retain employees and meet all of our needs for employees in a timely manner, which may affect our growth. Although we intend to continue to devote significant resources to recruit, train and retain qualified employees, we may not be able to attract, effectively train and retain these employees. Any failure to do so could impair our ability to perform our contractual obligations efficiently and timely meet our customers\u2019 needs and win new business, which could adversely affect our future results. In addition, certain personnel may be required to receive various security clearances in order to work on certain customer engagements or to perform certain tasks. Necessary security clearances may be delayed or not obtained, which may negatively impact our ability to perform on such engagements contracts in a timely manner or at all.\nIn addition to attracting and retaining qualified engineering, technical and professional personnel, we believe that our success will also depend on the continued employment of a highly qualified and experienced senior management team and its ability to retain existing business and generate new business and the continued development of new members of senior management. Our senior management team is important to our business because personal reputations and individual business relationships are a critical element of retaining and obtaining customer contracts in our industry, particularly with agencies performing classified operations. An inability to retain appropriately qualified and experienced senior executives or our failure to continue to develop new members could cause us to lose customers or new business opportunities.\nWe may not realize as revenues the full amounts reflected in our backlog, which could adversely affect our expected future revenues and growth prospects.\nAs of January 1, 2021, our total backlog was $31.9 billion, including $6.6 billion in funded backlog. Due to the U.S. government's ability to not exercise contract options or to terminate, modify or curtail our programs or contracts and the rights of our non-U.S. government customers to cancel contracts and purchase orders in certain circumstances, we may realize less than expected revenues or may never realize revenues from some of the contracts that are included in our backlog. Our unfunded backlog, in particular, contains management\u2019s estimate of amounts expected to be realized on unfunded contract work that may never be realized as revenues. If we fail to realize as revenues amounts included in our backlog, our future revenues, profitability and growth prospects could be adversely affected.\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 25\nPART I\nOur earnings and profitability may vary based on the mix of our contracts and may be adversely affected by our failure to accurately estimate and manage costs, time and resources.\nWe generate revenues under various types of contracts, which include cost-reimbursement, FP-IF, T&M, FP-LOE and FFP contracts. Our earnings and profitability may vary materially depending on changes in the proportionate amount of revenues derived from each type of contract, the nature of services or products provided, as well as the achievement of performance objectives and the stage of performance at which the right to receive fees, particularly under incentive-fee and award-fee contracts, is finally determined. Cost-reimbursement and T&M contracts are generally less profitable than FFP contracts. Our operating results in any period may also be affected, positively or negatively, by customers' variable purchasing patterns of our more profitable proprietary products.\nOur profitability is adversely affected when we incur contract costs that we cannot bill to our customers. To varying degrees, each of our contract types involves some risk that we could underestimate the costs and resources necessary to fulfill the contract. While FFP contracts allow us to benefit from cost savings, these contracts also increase our exposure to the risk of cost overruns. Revenues from FFP contracts represented approximately 36% of our total revenues for fiscal 2020. When making proposals on these types of contracts, we rely heavily on our estimates of costs and timing to complete the associated projects, as well as assumptions regarding technical issues. In each case, our failure to accurately estimate costs or the resources and technology needed to perform our contracts or to effectively manage and control our costs during performance could result, and in some instances has resulted, in reduced profits or in losses. More generally, any increased or unexpected costs or unanticipated delays in the performance of our contracts, including costs and delays caused by contractual disputes or other factors outside of our control, such as performance failures of our subcontractors, natural disasters or other force majeure events, could make our contracts less profitable than expected or unprofitable.\nWe use estimates in recognizing revenues, and if we make changes to estimates used in recognizing revenues, our profitability may be adversely affected.\nWe recognize revenue on our service-based contracts primarily over time as there is continuous transfer of control to the customer over the duration of the contract as we perform the promised services, which generally requires estimates of total costs at completion, fees earned on the contract, or both. This estimation process, particularly due to the technical nature of the services performed and the long-term nature of certain contracts, is complex and involves significant judgment. Adjustments to original estimates are often required as work progresses, experience is gained and additional information becomes known, even though the scope of the work required under the contract may not change. Any adjustment as a result of a change in estimate is recognized as events become known. Changes in the underlying assumptions, circumstances or estimates could result in adjustments that may adversely affect our future financial results.\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 26\nPART I\nCybersecurity breaches and other information security incidents could negatively impact our business and financial results, impair our ability to effectively provide our services to our clients and cause harm to our reputation or competitive position.\nAs a government contractor and a provider of information technology services operating in multiple regulated industries and geographies, we and our service providers, suppliers and subcontractors collect, store, transmit and otherwise process sensitive information, including personally identifiable information, protected health information, personnel information, classified information, contractor unclassified information and financial information, concerning our business, employees and customers. Therefore, we are continuously exposed to unauthorized attempts to compromise such sensitive information through cyber-attacks, insider threats and other information security threats, including physical break-ins and malicious insiders. Any electronic or physical break-in or other security breach or compromise of our information technology systems and networks or facilities, or those of our service providers, suppliers or subcontractors, may jeopardize the security of information stored or transmitted through these systems and networks or stored in those facilities. This could lead to disruptions in mission-critical systems, unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information and corruption of data or systems. We are also increasingly subject to customer-driven cybersecurity certification requirements, which are expected to be necessary to win future contracts. Such security incidents also could result in liability or trigger other obligations under such contracts or increase the difficulty of winning future contracts. Many statutory requirements, both in the U.S. and abroad, also include obligations for companies to provide notice of data security incidents involving certain types of data (including obligations to notify affected individuals and regulators in the event of security breaches involving certain personal data), which could result from breaches experienced by us or our service providers, suppliers or subcontractors.\nAlthough we have implemented policies, procedures and controls to protect against, detect and mitigate these threats and attacks, we and our service providers, suppliers and subcontractors have faced and continue to face advanced and persistent attacks on our information systems. We cannot guarantee that future incidents will not occur, and if an incident does occur, our incident response planning may not prove fully adequate and we may not be able to successfully mitigate the impacts. Techniques used by others to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information, or to disrupt systems and networks for economic or strategic gain, are constantly evolving, increasingly sophisticated and increasingly difficult to detect and successfully defend against. These techniques include cyberattacks (including covertly introducing ransomware, viruses, worms or other malware to our computers and networks and denial of service attacks), phishing and impersonating authorized users, among others, and may be perpetrated by internal bad actors, such as employees or contractors, or by third parties (including traditional computer hackers, persons involved with well-funded organized crime or state-sponsored efforts).\nWe seek to detect and investigate all information security incidents and to prevent their occurrence, prolongation or recurrence. We continue to invest in and improve our threat protection, detection and mitigation policies, procedures and controls. In addition, we work with other companies in the industry and government participants on increased awareness and enhanced protections against information security and malicious insider threats. However, because of the evolving nature and sophistication of these security threats, which can be difficult to detect, there can be no assurance that our policies, procedures and controls, or those of our service providers, suppliers or subcontractors, have protected against, detected, mitigated or will detect, prevent or mitigate, any of these threats and we cannot predict the full impact of any such past or future incident. We may be currently unaware of certain vulnerabilities or lack the capability to detect them, which may allow them to persist in our information technology environment over long periods of time and, even if discovered, our remediation efforts may not be completely successful.\nWe also may experience similar security threats to the information technology systems that we develop, install or maintain under customer contracts. Although we work cooperatively with our customers and other business partners, including our service providers, suppliers and subcontractors, to seek to minimize the potential for and impact of cyberattacks and other security threats, we must rely on the safeguards put in place by those entities. See also the risk factor \u201cInternal system or service failures, or failures in the systems or services of third parties on which we rely, could disrupt our business and impair our ability to effectively provide our services and products to our customers, which could damage our reputation and adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\u201d\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 27\nPART I\nThe occurrence of any unauthorized access to, attacks on or security breaches of our or our service providers', suppliers' or subcontractors' information technology infrastructure, systems or networks or data, could disrupt our infrastructure, systems, networks or those of our customers, impair our ability to provide services to our customers and may jeopardize the security of data collected, stored, transmitted or otherwise processed through our information technology infrastructure, systems and networks. As a result, we could be exposed to claims, fines, penalties, loss of revenues, product development delays, compromise, corruption or loss of confidential, proprietary or sensitive information (including personal information or technical business information), contract terminations and damages, remediation costs and other costs and expenses, regulatory investigations or sanctions, indemnity obligations and other potential liabilities. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our reputation, ability to win work on sensitive contracts or loss of current and future contracts (including sensitive U.S. government contracts), business operations and financial results. In addition, any remedial costs or other liabilities related to cyber or other security threats may not be fully insured or indemnified by other means.\nInternal system or service failures, or failures in the systems or services of third parties on which we rely, could disrupt our business and impair our ability to effectively provide our services and products to our customers, which could damage our reputation and adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nAny system or service disruptions, including those caused by ongoing projects to improve our information technology systems and the delivery of services, whether through our shared services organization or outsourced services, if not anticipated and appropriately mitigated, could materially and adversely affect our business including, among other things, an adverse effect on our ability to perform on contracts, bill our customers for work performed on our contracts, collect the amounts that have been billed and produce accurate financial statements in a timely manner. We, and the service providers, suppliers and subcontractors on which we rely, are also subject to systems failures, including network, software or hardware failures, whether caused by us, third-party service providers, cybersecurity threats, malicious insiders, natural disasters, power shortages, terrorist attacks, pandemics or other events, which could cause loss of data and interruptions or delays in our business, cause us to incur remediation costs, subject us to claims and damage our reputation. In addition, the failure or disruption of our communications, or those of our service providers, suppliers or subcontractors, could cause us to interrupt or suspend our operations or otherwise adversely affect our business. Our property and business interruption insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for all losses that may occur as a result of any system or operational failure or disruption and, as a result, our future results could be adversely affected.\nOur business is subject to disruption caused by natural disasters that could adversely affect our profitability and our overall financial position.\nWe have significant operations located in regions that may be exposed to hurricanes, earthquakes, other damaging storms, water levels, forest fires and other natural disasters. Our subcontractors and suppliers are also subject to natural disasters that could affect their ability to deliver or perform under a contract, including as a result of disruptions to their workforce and critical industrial infrastructure needed for normal business operations. Although preventative measures may help to mitigate damage, the damage and disruption resulting from natural disasters and delays in recovery may be significant.\nIf insurance or other risk transfer mechanisms are unavailable or insufficient to recover all costs or if we experience a significant disruption to our business due to a natural disaster, it could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nCustomer systems failures could damage our reputation and adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nMany of the systems and networks that we develop, install and maintain for our customers involve managing and protecting personal information and information relating to national security and other sensitive government functions. While we have programs designed to comply with relevant privacy and security laws and restrictions, if a system or network that we develop, install or maintain were to fail or experience a security breach or service interruption, whether caused by us, third-party service providers, cybersecurity threats or other events, we may experience loss of revenue, remediation costs or face claims for damages or contract termination. Any such event could cause serious harm to our reputation and prevent us from having access to or being eligible for further work on such systems and networks. Our errors and omissions liability insurance may be inadequate to compensate us for all of the damages that we may incur and, as a result, our future results could be adversely affected.\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 28\nPART I\nOur success depends, in part, on our ability to work with complex and rapidly changing technologies to meet the needs of our customers.\nWe design and develop technologically advanced and innovative products and services applied by our customers in a variety of environments. The needs of our customers change and evolve regularly and in particular by complex and rapidly changing technologies. Our success depends upon our ability to identify emerging technological trends, develop technologically advanced, innovative and cost-effective products and services and market these products and services to our customers. Our success also depends on our continued access to suppliers of important technologies and components.\nMany of our contracts contain performance obligations that require innovative design capabilities, are technologically complex or are dependent upon factors not wholly within our control. Problems and delays in development or delivery as a result of issues with respect to design, technology, licensing and patent rights, labor, learning curve assumptions or materials and components could prevent us from achieving such contractual requirements. Failure to meet these obligations could adversely affect our profitability and future prospects.\nIn addition, our offerings cannot be tested and proven in all situations and are otherwise subject to unforeseen problems that could negatively affect revenue and profitability such as problems with quality and workmanship, country of origin, delivery of subcontractor components or services and unplanned degradation of product performance. Among the factors that may affect revenue and profits could be unforeseen costs and expenses not covered by insurance or indemnification from the customer, diversion of management focus in responding to unforeseen problems, loss of follow-on work, and, in the case of certain contracts, repayment to the government customer of contract costs and fee payments we previously received.\nIf we are unable to work with complex and rapidly changing technologies successfully we may be unable to meet the needs of our customers and our future success, revenue and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe have contracts with the U.S. government that are classified, which may limit investor insight into portions of our business.\nWe derive a portion of our revenues from programs with the U.S. government and its agencies that are subject to security restrictions (e.g., contracts involving classified information and classified programs), which preclude the dissemination of information and technology that is classified for national security purposes under applicable law and regulation. In general, access to classified information, technology, facilities or programs requires appropriate personnel security clearances, is subject to additional contract oversight and potential liability and may also require appropriate facility clearances and other specialized infrastructure. In the event of a security incident involving classified information, technology, facilities, programs or personnel holding clearances, we may be subject to legal, financial, operational and reputational harm. We are limited in our ability to provide information about these classified programs, their risks or any disputes or claims relating to such programs. As a result, investors have less insight into our classified business or our business overall. However, historically the business risks associated with our work on classified programs have not differed materially from those of our other government contracts.\nWe have made and continue to make acquisitions, investments, joint ventures and divestitures that involve numerous risks and uncertainties.\nWe selectively pursue strategic acquisitions, investments and joint ventures. These transactions require significant investment of time and resources and may disrupt our business and distract our management from other responsibilities. Even if successful, these transactions could reduce earnings for a number of reasons, including the amortization of intangible assets, impairment charges, acquired operations that are not yet profitable or the payment of additional consideration under earn-out arrangements if an acquisition performs better than expected. Acquisitions, investments and joint ventures pose many other risks that could adversely affect our reputation, operations or financial results, including:\n\u2022we may not be able to identify, compete effectively for or complete suitable acquisitions and investments at prices we consider attractive;\n\u2022we may not be able to accurately estimate the financial effect of acquisitions and investments on our business, and we may not realize anticipated synergies or acquisitions may not result in improved operating performance;\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 29\nPART I\n\u2022we may not be able to successfully manage the integration process for acquisitions and the integration process may divert management time and focus from operating our business;\n\u2022acquired technologies, capabilities, products and service offerings, particularly those that are still in development when acquired, may not perform as expected, may have defects or may not be integrated into our business as expected;\n\u2022we may have trouble retaining key employees and customers of an acquired business, including due to cultural challenges, or otherwise integrating such businesses, such as incompatible accounting, information management or other control systems, which could result in unforeseen difficulties;\n\u2022we may assume material liabilities that were not identified as part of our due diligence or for which we are unable to receive a purchase price adjustment or reimbursement through indemnification or there may be other unanticipated write-offs or charges;\n\u2022financial reporting, revenue recognition or other financial or control deficiencies of the acquired company that we don't adequately address and that cause our reported results to be incorrect;\n\u2022we may need to implement or improve controls, procedures and policies at a business that prior to the acquisition may have lacked sufficiently effective controls, procedures and policies;\n\u2022we may assume legal or regulatory risks, particularly with respect to smaller businesses that have immature business processes and compliance programs, or we may face litigation with respect to the acquired company, including claims from terminated employees, customers, former stockholders or other third parties;\n\u2022acquired entities or joint ventures may not achieve expected business growth or operate profitably, which could adversely affect our operating income or operating margins, and we may be unable to recover investments in any such acquisitions;\n\u2022acquisitions, investments and joint ventures may require us to spend a significant amount of cash, to incur debt, resulting in increased fixed payment obligations and could also result in covenants or other restrictions on us, or to issue capital stock, resulting in dilution of ownership; and\n\u2022we may not be able to effectively influence the operations of our joint ventures, or we may be exposed to certain liabilities if our joint venture partners do not fulfill their obligations.\nIf our acquisitions, investments or joint ventures fail, perform poorly or their value is otherwise impaired for any reason, including contractions in credit markets and global economic conditions, our business and financial results could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, we periodically divest businesses, including businesses that are no longer a part of our ongoing strategic plan. These divestitures similarly require significant investment of time and resources, may disrupt our business, distract management from other responsibilities and may result in losses on disposal or continued financial involvement in the divested business, including through indemnification, guarantee or other financial arrangements, for a period of time following the transaction, which would adversely affect our financial results.\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 30\nPART I\nGoodwill and other intangible assets represent approximately 60% of our total assets and any impairment of these assets could negatively impact our results of operations.\nIntangible assets with indefinite lives, including goodwill, are tested for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Intangible assets with finite lives are assessed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Examples of events or changes in circumstances indicating that the carrying value of intangible assets may not be recoverable could include a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate, an adverse action or assessment by a regulator, unanticipated competition, loss of key personnel, or a more-likely-than-not expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or otherwise disposed. We face continued uncertainty in our business environment due to the substantial fiscal and economic challenges facing the U.S. government, our primary customer, as well as challenges in the commercial healthcare industry, compounded by lower levels of U.S. government reimbursements, including reductions in Medicare reimbursements which in turn impact hospital information technology spending. Adverse changes in fiscal and economic conditions, such as the manner in which budget cuts are implemented, including sequestration, and issues related to the nation\u2019s debt ceiling, could adversely impact our future revenues and profitability. These circumstances could result in an impairment of goodwill and/or other intangibles. Also, adverse equity market conditions that result in a decline in market multiples and our stock price could result in an impairment of goodwill and/or other intangibles. Any future impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets would have a negative impact on our profitability and financial results.\nWe depend on our teaming arrangements and relationships with other contractors and subcontractors. If we are not able to maintain these relationships, or if these parties fail to satisfy their obligations to us or the customer, our revenues, profitability and growth prospects could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on our teaming relationships with other prime contractors and subcontractors, who are also often our competitors in other contexts, in order to submit bids for large procurements or other opportunities where we believe the combination of services and products provided by us and other companies will help us to win and perform the contract. Our future revenues and growth prospects could be adversely affected if other contractors eliminate or reduce their contract relationships with us, or if the U.S. government terminates or reduces these other contractors\u2019 programs, does not award them new contracts or refuses to pay under a contract. Companies that do not have access to U.S. government contracts may perform services as our subcontractor and that exposure could enhance such companies\u2019 prospect of securing a future position as a prime U.S. government contractor which could increase competition for future contracts and impair our ability to perform on contracts.\nWe may have disputes with our subcontractors arising from, among other things, the quality and timeliness of work performed by the subcontractor, customer concerns about the subcontractor, our failure to extend existing task orders or issue new task orders under a subcontract, our hiring of a subcontractor\u2019s personnel or the subcontractor\u2019s failure to comply with applicable law. Uncertain economic conditions heighten the risk of financial stress of our subcontractors, which could adversely impact their ability to meet their contractual requirements to us. If any of our subcontractors fail to timely meet their contractual obligations or have regulatory compliance or other problems, our ability to fulfill our obligations as a prime contractor or higher tier subcontractor may be jeopardized. Significant losses could arise in future periods and subcontractor performance deficiencies could result in our termination for default. A termination for default could eliminate a revenue source, expose us to liability and have an adverse effect on our ability to compete for future contracts and task orders, especially if the customer is an agency of the U.S. government.\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 31\nPART I\nOur services and operations sometimes involve using, handling or disposing of hazardous substances, which could expose us to potentially significant liabilities.\nSome of our services and operations involve the assessment or remediation of environmental hazards, as well as the use, handling or disposal of hazardous substances. These activities and our operations generally subject us to extensive foreign, federal, state and local environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations, which, among other things, require us to incur costs to comply with these regulations and could impose liability on us for handling or disposing of hazardous substances. Furthermore, failure to comply with these environmental protection and health and safety laws and regulations could result in civil, criminal, regulatory, administrative or contractual sanctions, including fines, penalties or suspension or debarment from contracting with the U.S. government. Our current and previous ownership and operation of real property also subjects us to environmental protection laws, some of which hold current or previous owners or operators of businesses and real property liable for hazardous substance releases, even if they did not know of and were not responsible for the releases. If we have any violations of, or incur liabilities pursuant to these laws or regulations, our financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.\nWe could incur significant liabilities and suffer negative publicity if our inspection or detection systems fail to detect bombs, explosives, weapons, contraband or other threats.\nWe design, develop, manufacture, sell, service and maintain various inspection systems and related integration and automation systems that are designed to assist in the detection of bombs, explosives, weapons, contraband or other threats. In some instances, we also train operators of such systems. Such systems utilize software algorithms to interpret data produced by the system and to signal to the operator when a dangerous object or substance may be present. Such algorithms are probabilistic in nature and are generally designed to meet requirements established by regulatory agencies. Many of these systems require that an operator interpret an image of suspicious items within a bag, parcel, container, vehicle or other vessel. Others signal to the operator that further investigation is required. In either case, the training, reliability and competence of the customer's operator are crucial to the detection of suspicious items. Nevertheless, if such a system were to fail to signal to an operator when an explosive or other contraband was in fact present, resulting in significant damage, we could become the subject of significant product liability claims.\nThere are many factors, some of which are beyond our control, which could result in the failure of our products to help detect the presence of bombs, explosives, weapons, contraband or other threats. Some of these factors could include inherent limitations in our systems and misuse or malfunction of our systems. The failure of our systems to help detect the presence of any of these dangerous materials could lead to injury, death and extensive property damage and may lead to product liability, professional liability or other claims against us. Further, if our security and inspection systems fail to, or are perceived to have failed to, help detect a threat, we could experience negative publicity and reputational harm, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur insurance, customer indemnifications or other liability protections may be insufficient to protect us from product and other liability claims or losses.\nWe maintain insurance coverage with third-party insurers as part of our overall risk management strategy and because some of our contracts require us to maintain specific insurance coverage limits. However, not every risk or liability is or can be protected by insurance, and, for those risks we insure, the limits of coverage we purchase or that are reasonably obtainable in the market may not be sufficient to cover all actual losses or liabilities incurred. If any of our third-party insurers fail, cancel our coverage or otherwise are unable to provide us with adequate insurance coverage, then our overall risk exposure and our operational expenses would increase and the management of our business operations would be disrupted. Our insurance may be insufficient to protect us from significant product and other liability claims or losses. Moreover, there is a risk that commercially available liability insurance will not continue to be available to us at a reasonable cost, if at all. If liability claims or losses exceed our current or available insurance coverage, our business, financial position, operating results and prospects may be harmed. Regardless of the adequacy of our liability insurance coverages, any significant claim may have an adverse effect on our industry and market reputation, leading to a substantial decrease in demand for our products and services and reduced revenues.\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 32\nPART I\nIn some circumstances we are entitled to certain legal protections or indemnifications from our customers through contractual provisions, laws, regulations or otherwise. However, these protections are not always available, can be difficult to obtain, are typically subject to certain terms or limitations, including the availability of funds, and may not be sufficient to cover all losses or liabilities incurred.\nWe face risks associated with our international business.\nOur international business operations may be subject to additional and different risks than our U.S. business. These risks and challenges include:\n\u2022failure to comply with U.S. government and foreign laws and regulations applicable to international business, employment, privacy, data protection, information security or data transfer, could have an adverse impact on our business with the U.S. government and could expose us to risks and costs of non-compliance with such laws and regulations, in addition to administrative, civil or criminal penalties;\n\u2022U.S. and foreign government import and export control requirements and regulations, including International Traffic in Arms Regulations and the anti-boycott provisions of the U.S. Export Administration Act, technology transfer restrictions and other administrative, legislative or regulatory actions that could materially interfere with our ability to offer our products or services in certain countries;\n\u2022increased risk for economic, legal or political changes that may adversely affect the performance of our services, sale of our products or repatriation of our profits;\n\u2022international transactions can involve increased financial and legal risks arising from foreign exchange rate variability, imposition of tariffs or additional taxes, restrictive trade policies, longer payment cycles, any delay or failure to collect amounts due to us and differing legal systems;\n\u2022we provide services and products in support of U.S. government and other customers in countries with governments that may be or may become unstable, which increases the risk of an incident resulting in injury or loss of life, damage or destruction of property or inability to meet our contractual obligations; and\n\u2022volatility in non-U.S. political and economic environments, including by way of examples, the potential effects of COVID-19 and the U.K.'s departure from the EU.\nIn addition, we are subject to laws prohibiting improper payments and bribery, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar foreign anti-corruption laws that generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, or obtaining an unfair advantage. Our failure to comply with these laws might subject us to civil and criminal penalties that might have a materially adverse impact on our business operations and our financial position or results of operations.\nAlthough our international operations have historically generated a small proportion of our revenues, we are seeking to grow our international business, in which case these regulatory, geopolitical and other factors may have a greater impact on our business in the future and could adversely affect our business.\nWe have only a limited ability to protect our intellectual property rights, which are important to our success. Our failure to adequately obtain, maintain, protect and enforce our proprietary information and intellectual property rights could adversely affect our competitive position.\nWe rely principally on trade secrets to protect much of our intellectual property in cases where we do not believe that patent protection is appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect and, despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights, third parties may attempt to obtain, copy, use or disclose our intellectual property or other proprietary information or technology without our authorization. In addition to protection under intellectual property laws, we rely on confidentiality or license agreements that we generally enter into with our corporate partners, employees, consultants, advisors, service providers, suppliers, subcontractors and customers, and we generally attempt to limit access to and distribution of our proprietary information. Although our employees and contractors are subject to confidentiality obligations and use restrictions, this protection may be inadequate to deter or prevent them from infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating our confidential information, technology or other intellectual property or proprietary rights. Furthermore, non-disclosure provisions can be difficult to enforce and, even if successfully enforced, may not be entirely effective.\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 33\nPART I\nWe may be unable to detect unauthorized use of our intellectual property or otherwise take appropriate steps to enforce our rights. We may be required to expend significant resources and efforts to monitor and protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights, and we may conclude that, in at least some instances, the benefits of protecting our intellectual property or other proprietary rights may be outweighed by the expense or distraction to our management. We may initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement, misappropriation or other violations of our intellectual property or other proprietary rights or to establish the validity of our intellectual property or other proprietary rights, but outcomes in any such litigation can be difficult to predict. Any such litigation, whether or not it is resolved in our favor, could be time-consuming, result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel. If we are unable to detect or prevent third parties from infringing, misappropriating or otherwise violating our rights in our patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets or other proprietary rights or information, our competitive position could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, in connection with our performance of services for the U.S. government, the U.S. government has certain rights to inventions, data, software codes and related material that we develop under government-funded contracts and subcontracts, which means that the U.S. government may disclose or license our information to third parties, including, in some instances, our competitors. Any exercise by the U.S. government of such rights could have an adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nAssertions by third parties of infringement, misappropriation or other violations by us of their intellectual property rights could result in significant costs and could limit our ability to use certain technologies, which would result in substantial harm to our business and operating results.\nIn recent years, there has been significant litigation involving intellectual property rights in technology industries. In the course of conducting our business, we may inadvertently infringe the intellectual property rights of others, resulting in claims against us or our customers, or we may face allegations, with or without merit, that we or our service providers, suppliers, subcontractors or customers have infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated the intellectual property rights of others. If, with respect to any claim against us for violation of third-party intellectual property rights, we are unable to prevail in the litigation, retain or obtain sufficient rights, develop non-infringing solutions or otherwise alter our business practices on a timely or cost-efficient basis, our business and competitive position may be adversely affected. Such claims also could subject us to significant liability for damages, potentially including treble damages if we are found to have willfully infringed a third party's intellectual property rights. In addition, our contracts generally indemnify our customers for third-party claims for intellectual property infringement by the services and products we provide. Besides the expense of defending such claims, and the cost of any large indemnity payments, any dispute with a customer with respect to such obligations also could have adverse effects on our relationship with that customer and other existing customers and new customers, any of which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Our Stock\nWe cannot assure you that we will continue to pay dividends on our common stock.\nIn March 2012, our Board of Directors approved the initiation of a quarterly dividend program. The timing, declaration, amount and payment of any future dividends fall within the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on many factors, including our available cash, estimated cash needs, earnings, financial condition, operating results and capital requirements, as well as limitations in our contractual agreements, applicable law, regulatory constraints, industry practice and other business considerations that our Board of Directors considers relevant. A change in our dividend program could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nLeidos Holdings, Inc. Annual Report - 34\nPART I\nProvisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could delay or prevent transactions that many stockholders may favor.\nSome provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws may have the effect of delaying, discouraging or preventing a merger or acquisition that our stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which stockholders might receive a premium for their shares. These restrictions, which may also make it more difficult for our stockholders to elect directors not endorsed by our current directors and management, include the following:\n\u2022Our certificate of incorporation contains a provision that mergers and certain other business combinations between us and a related person be approved by the holders of a majority of the voting power of such securities that are not owned by the related person, unless approved by a majority of continuing directors or certain other exceptions.\n\u2022Our stockholders may not act by written consent. As a result, a holder, or holders, controlling a majority of our capital stock are limited in their ability to take certain actions other than in connection with its annual stockholders' meeting or a special meeting called at the request of qualified stockholders as provided in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws.\n\u2022Our Board of Directors may issue, without stockholder approval, shares of undesignated preferred stock. The ability to authorize undesignated preferred stock makes it possible for our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to acquire us.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to certain restrictions on business combinations. Under Delaware law, a corporation may not engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years, or among other things, our Board of Directors has approved the business combination or the transaction pursuant to which such person became a 15% holder prior to the time the person became a 15% holder.", "PERMNO": 91547, "SIC": 7373, "TIC": "LDOS"}
