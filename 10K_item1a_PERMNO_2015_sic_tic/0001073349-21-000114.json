{"cik": "1073349", "company": "BOTTOMLINE TECHNOLOGIES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-08-30", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nInvesting in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. The discussion below addresses the most significant factors, of which we are currently aware, that could affect our business, operating results and financial condition. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below before making an investment decision involving our common stock. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties may also impact our business operations.\nIf any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations would likely suffer. In that case, the trading price of our common stock could fall, and you may lose all or part of the money you paid to buy our common stock.\nRisks Related To COVID-19\nOur business, results of operations and financial condition may be materially adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic\nThe consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic may adversely impact our business, consolidated results of operations, cash flows and our financial condition. Global health concerns arising from the COVID-19 pandemic and related government actions have caused significant disruption to the global economic environment and increased economic uncertainty. There are growing, recent uncertainties related to the evolution of the pandemic itself, including the impact of disease variants, the effectiveness of vaccines against these variants and the consequence to unvaccinated individuals. In response, restrictions have started to be re-implemented by various government bodies and private businesses. There is no recent, comparable event that provides guidance on the myriad of impacts that COVID-19 may ultimately have, however its impact on market and economic conditions clearly remains a significant risk. The long-term consequences of the pandemic remain difficult to predict and depend in large part on the duration of the pandemic and any future recurrence of outbreak, further actions that may be taken by governmental authorities, the impact to the businesses of our customers, the demand for our products and our ability to sell and provide new goods and services, including as a result of travel restrictions, employees working from home and other factors. Our customers may also slow-down decision making in respect of new purchases, delay work that had previously been scheduled or seek price concessions or modified payment terms in responses to strains on their own businesses.\nSince March 2020 we have continued to take proactive measures intended to help minimize the risk of the virus to our employees including suspending travel worldwide, temporarily closing our offices and requiring employees to work remotely. While we believe we are currently operating our business effectively in spite of these challenges, substantially all of our employees continue to work remotely.\nDeteriorating economic conditions arising from the consequences of COVID-19 such as increased unemployment, a decline in business and consumer confidence and spending or a recession could adversely impact the demand for our products and cause a decline in our revenues. Any material adverse change to our business results would increase the risk of impairment to our goodwill and other intangible assets and any such impairment charge would likely be material. Even after the current COVID-19 pandemic has subsided, we may continue to be exposed to materially adverse risks to our business as a result of the breadth of its economic impact, including how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions resume.\nRisks Related To Our Business\nThe markets in which we compete are extremely competitive and we may not be able to compete effectively\nThe markets in which we compete are intensely competitive and characterized by rapid technological change. There is no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current market share or our customer base.\nWe compete with a wide range of companies ranging from small start-up enterprises with limited resources, with whom we compete principally on the basis of technology features or specific customer relationships, to very large companies which can leverage significantly larger customer bases and greater financial resources. Many of our competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical, and sales and marketing resources, greater brand recognition and a larger customer base than we do. We anticipate that the markets in which we compete will continue to attract new competitors and new technologies and we may not be able to compete successfully with them.\nTo compete successfully, we need to maintain a successful research and development function. If we fail to enhance our current products and develop new, innovative solutions or if we fail to bring new solutions to market quickly enough, our products could become less competitive or obsolete.\nWe continue to make significant investments in our existing products and our new product offerings, which may adversely affect our operating results or may not be successful\nGiven the highly competitive and rapidly evolving technology environment we operate within, we believe that it is important to constantly enhance our existing product offerings as well as to develop new product offerings to meet strategic opportunities as they evolve. This includes developing and enhancing our products to include what we believe is necessary to meet the future needs of our customers.\nOur operating results have consistently been affected by increases in product development expenses as we have continued to make investments in our products and as we have funded new product innovation based on the market opportunities we see. We expect to continue to make investments in product innovation and may at any time, based on product need or marketplace demand, decide to significantly increase our product development expenditures.\nInvestments in existing products and new product offerings can have a negative impact on our operating results and any new product enhancement or offering may not be accepted in the marketplace or generate material revenues for us. Any significant changes in revenue estimates relating to software development costs we have capitalized could also result in the write-off of previously capitalized costs.\nAcquisitions could disrupt our business and harm our financial condition\nAn active acquisition program has been an important element of our corporate strategy. We have been an acquisitive company historically, and we expect to continue to make acquisitions in the future. Any acquisition or strategic investment we have made or may make in the future may entail numerous risks, including the following:\n\u2022difficulties integrating acquired operations, personnel, technologies, products or corporate cultures;\n\u2022entrance into markets and operating geographies in which we have no or limited prior experience or knowledge;\n\u2022failure to realize anticipated revenue increases for any number of reasons, including if a larger than expected number of acquired customers decline to renew software maintenance contracts or subscription-based contracts, if we are unsuccessful in selling the acquired products into our existing customer base or if the terms of the acquired contracts do not permit us to recognize revenue on a timely basis;\n\u2022costs incurred to combine the operations of companies we acquire, such as integration costs, transitional employee expenses and employee retention or relocation expenses, may be significantly higher than expected;\n\u2022regulatory challenges that may arise prior to or after an acquisition, such as related to governmental review of competition and anti-trust considerations;\n\u2022write-offs related to existing or acquired assets such as deferred tax assets, goodwill or other intangible assets;\n\u2022inability to retain key personnel of the acquired company;\n\u2022inadequacy of existing operating, financial and management information systems to support the combined organization, including the difficulty in integrating an acquired company\u2019s accounting, financial reporting and other administrative systems to permit effective management;\n\u2022difficulties implementing controls, procedures and policies appropriate for a public company at companies that, prior to the acquisition, may have lacked such controls, policies and procedures;\n\u2022in the case of foreign acquisitions, challenges integrating operations across different cultures and languages and addressing the particular regulatory, economic, currency and political risks associated with different countries or regions;\n\u2022diversion of management\u2019s focus from our core business concerns;\n\u2022dilution to existing stockholders and our earnings per share;\n\u2022incurrence of substantial debt;\n\u2022exposure to litigation from third parties, including claims related to intellectual property or other assets acquired or liabilities assumed; and\n\u2022failure to realize anticipated benefits of the acquisition due to the above factors or other factors.\nThere can be no assurance that our acquired businesses will fully integrate successfully or that all future potential benefits will be realized. Any such difficulties encountered as a result of any merger, acquisition or strategic investment could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nAs a result of our acquisitions, we could be subject to significant future write-offs with respect to intangible assets, which may adversely affect our future operating results\nThe carrying value of our intangible assets, including goodwill, represents approximately 50% of our total assets at June 30, 2021. We periodically review our goodwill and our other intangible assets for impairment or indicators of impairment and could, in any future period, be subject to impairment charges with respect to these assets or intangible assets arising as a result of acquisitions in future periods. Indicators that our goodwill or intangible assets may not be recoverable include a decline in our stock price and market capitalization, reduced future revenue or cash flow estimates and slower growth rates in the markets in which we participate. Any such charges, to the extent occurring, would likely have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nCatastrophic events may disrupt our business, including our third party data centers\nWe are a highly-automated business and we rely on our network infrastructure, various software applications and many internal technology systems and data networks for our customer support, development, sales and marketing and accounting and finance functions to process, record, monitor and report data on a continuous basis and to do so accurately, quickly and securely. Our SaaS offerings provide services to our customers from third party data center facilities in different U.S. and international locations over which we have no control. A disruption or failure of these systems or data centers in the event of a natural disaster, pandemic, telecommunications failure, power outage, cyber-attack, war, terrorist attack, or other catastrophic event could cause system interruptions, reputational harm, delays in product development, breaches of data security and loss of critical data. Such an event could also prevent us from fulfilling customer orders or maintaining certain service level requirements. Our insurance coverage may not be adequate to compensate us for all losses or failures that may occur. While we have developed disaster recovery plans and maintain backup systems to reduce the potentially adverse effect of such events, a catastrophic event that resulted in the destruction or disruption of any of our data centers or our critical business or information technology systems would likely severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations, particularly in the short-term and, as a result, our business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nWe could incur substantial costs resulting from warranty claims or product liability claims\nOur product agreements typically contain provisions that afford customers a degree of warranty protection in the event that our products fail to conform to written specifications. These agreements normally contain provisions intended to limit the nature and extent of our risk of warranty and product liability claims. A court, however, might interpret these terms in a limited way or conclude that part or all of these terms are unenforceable. Furthermore, some of our agreements are governed by non-U.S. law and there is a risk that foreign law might provide us less or different protection. While we maintain general liability insurance, including coverage for errors and omissions, we cannot be sure that our existing coverage will continue to be available on reasonable terms or will be available in amounts sufficient to cover one or more large claims.\nA warranty or product liability claim, whether or not meritorious, could harm our reputation, result in substantial financial costs or divert management\u2019s attention, which could have an adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe failure of our cyber fraud and risk management products to prevent a security breach or detect cyber fraud, or the failure of our customers to take action based on the risks identified by these products, could harm our reputation and adversely impact our operating results\nOur cyber fraud and risk management products provide our customers the ability to configure a multitude of settings and establish certain rule-based alerts and it is possible that a customer could misconfigure these products or fail to configure these products in an optimal manner which could cause threats to go undetected. Similarly, if our cyber fraud and risk management products detect threats or otherwise alert a customer to suspicious activity but the customer does not take action to investigate those threats or alerts, customers may erroneously believe that our products were not effective.\nAny real or perceived defects, errors or vulnerabilities in our cyber fraud and risk management products or any failure of these products to prevent, detect or alert a customer to a threat could result in:\n\u2022a loss of customers or potential customers;\n\u2022delayed or lost revenue and harm to our financial condition and results of operations;\n\u2022a delay in attaining, or the failure to attain, market acceptance for our cyber fraud and risk management solutions;\n\u2022an increase in warranty claims;\n\u2022harm to our reputation; or\n\u2022litigation, regulatory inquiries or investigations that may be expensive and that would further harm our reputation.\nWe rely on certain third-party hardware and software which could cause errors, interruptions or failures to our solutions or be difficult to replace\nWe rely on third party hardware and software to deliver certain of our solutions. These third party products may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. The loss of the right to use any of these products could result in delays in our ability to provide our solutions until equivalent technology is either developed by us or acquired from another third party, if available, which may not be possible on a cost-effective basis. In addition, errors or defects in third-party products used in conjunction with our solutions could adversely affect the operation of our products.\nWe face risks associated with our international operations that could harm our financial condition and results of operations\nA significant percentage of our revenues have been generated by our international operations, and our future growth rates and success are in part dependent on our continued growth and success in international markets. As is the case with most international operations, the success and profitability of these operations are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that include, in addition to the risks our business as a whole faces, the following:\n\u2022currency exchange rate fluctuations, particularly with respect to the British Pound Sterling, the Swiss Franc, the European Euro and the Israeli Shekel;\n\u2022difficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022differing regulatory and industry standards and certification requirements;\n\u2022the complexities of tax laws in foreign jurisdictions;\n\u2022the complexities of foreign data privacy laws and regulations;\n\u2022the complexities of various sanctions regimes and related commercial restrictions;\n\u2022reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries; and\n\u2022import or export licensing requirements.\nWe are subject to the political, economic and security conditions in Israel\nWe have a subsidiary headquartered in Tel Aviv, Israel. Since the establishment of the State of Israel, a number of armed conflicts have taken place between Israel and its neighbors, including recently. In the past, Israel has experienced periodic armed conflicts which at times have disrupted day-to-day civilian activity in Israel.\nThere can be no assurance that future conflicts will not occur and that such conflicts will not affect our premises or major infrastructure and transport facilities in the country, which could have an adverse effect on our ability to conduct business in Israel. In addition, acts of terrorism, armed conflicts or political instability in the region could negatively affect global as well as local economic conditions and adversely impact our operating results.\nOur business and operating results are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates\nWe conduct a substantial portion of our operations outside of the U.S., principally in the UK and in continental Europe and, to a lesser extent, in the Asia-Pacific and Middle East regions. During the twelve months ended June 30, 2021, approximately 40% of our revenues and 42% of our operating expenses were attributable to customers or operations located outside of North America. During the twelve months ended June 30, 2021 as compared to the twelve months ended June 30, 2020, the foreign currency exchange rate of the British Pound Sterling appreciated against the U.S. Dollar. Future appreciation of the U.S. Dollar against the foreign currencies in which our international operations are denominated will have the impact of reducing both our revenues and operating expenses associated with our operations in those regions.\nOur future financial results will be affected by our success in continuing to sell our products in a subscription and transaction model, which carries with it certain risks\nWe generate the substantial majority of our revenue under a subscription based revenue model. We believe a subscription based revenue model has certain advantages over a perpetual license model, including better predictability of revenue; however, it also presents a number of risks to us including the following:\n\u2022arrangements entered into on a subscription basis generally delay the timing of revenue recognition and can require the incurrence of up-front cash outlays, which may be significant;\n\u2022subscription based revenue arrangements often include specific performance requirements or service levels that we may be unable to consistently achieve, subjecting us to penalties or other costs. A material breach of these arrangements by us, such as a persistent failure to achieve required service levels, might permit the customer to exit the contract prior to its expiration without additional compensation to us;\n\u2022customer retention is critical to our future growth rates. Some of our competitors may offer more attractive prices or other services that we do not offer. Customers in a subscription arrangement may elect not to renew their contract with us upon\nexpiration or they may attempt to renegotiate pricing or other contractual terms at the point of (or prior to) renewal on terms that are less favorable to us; and\n\u2022there is no assurance that the solutions we offer on a subscription basis, including new revenue models or new products that we may introduce, will receive broad marketplace acceptance.\nBecause we recognize subscription revenue from our customers over the term of their agreements, downturns or upturns in sales of our subscription based offerings will not be immediately reflected in our operating results and may adversely affect revenue in the future\nWe recognize subscription revenue over the term of our customer agreements. As a result, most of our subscription revenue arises from agreements entered into during previous periods. A shortfall in orders for our subscription based solutions in any one period would most likely not significantly reduce our subscription revenue for that period but could adversely affect the revenue contribution in future periods. In addition, we may be unable to quickly reduce our cost structure in response to a decrease in these orders. Accordingly, the effect of downturns in sales of our subscription based solutions will not be fully reflected in our operating results until future periods. A subscription revenue model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional subscription sales in any one period, as revenue is generally recognized over time, rather than up-front.\nOur ability to attract and retain qualified employees is critical to the success of our business and failure to do so could adversely affect our operating results\nOur success depends upon the efforts and abilities of our executive officers and technical and sales employees who are skilled in e-commerce, payment methodology and regulation, business banking technologies, and web, database and network technologies. Our success and future growth depends to a significant degree on the skills and continued services of our management team. Our current key employees and employees whom we seek to hire in order to support our growth are in high demand within the marketplace. The loss of one or more of our key employees or our failure to consistently attract and retain sufficient qualified employees to grow our operations could have a material adverse effect on our business. We do not maintain key man life insurance policies on any of our employees and our employees are generally free to terminate their employment with us at any time. The loss of the services of any of our executive officers or other key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe engage off-shore development resources which may not be successful and which may put our intellectual property at risk\nIn order to optimize our research and development capabilities and to meet development timeframes, we use our India subsidiary for certain product development activities and we further contract with off-shore third-party development vendors. While our experience to date has been positive, there are a number of risks associated with off-shore development activities including:\n\u2022less efficient and less accurate communication and information flow as a consequence of time, distance and language barriers between our primary development organization and the off-shore resources, resulting in delays or deficiencies in development efforts;\n\u2022disruption due to political or military conflicts;\n\u2022misappropriation of intellectual property, which we may not readily detect; and\n\u2022currency exchange rate fluctuations that could adversely impact the cost advantages intended from these agreements.\nTo the extent that these or unforeseen risks occur, our operating results and financial condition could be adversely impacted.\nRegulatory and Compliance Risks\nA cyber-attack or security or data breach could have an adverse effect on our business and create the perception that our solutions are not secure\nIn the course of providing services to our customers we collect, store, process and transmit highly sensitive and confidential information. We rely on our employees and certain third parties in our current operations who may, as a result of human error or misconduct, expose us to operational risk. Certain of our solutions also facilitate the actual transfer of cash or transmit instructions that initiate cash transfer. Our products and services, particularly our SaaS offerings, may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses, cyber-attacks, distributed denial of service attacks and other disruptive problems, which could result in the theft, destruction or misappropriation of confidential information. Security risks in recent years have increased significantly given the increased sophistication and activities of hackers, organized crime, including state-sponsored organizations and nation-states, and other external parties. Cyber threats are rapidly evolving, increasing the difficulty of defending against them and even the most advanced internal control environment is vulnerable to compromise. Targeted social engineering attacks are becoming more sophisticated and are extremely difficult to prevent. The techniques used by bad actors change frequently and may not be recognized until well after a breach has occurred. In addition, employees, customers and other counterparties who may access our network increasingly use personal mobile devices or computing devices that are outside of our network and control environments and are therefore subject to their own cyber-security risks. Breaches of our network could disrupt our internal systems and business applications, including services provided to our customers. Additionally, data breaches could compromise technical and proprietary information, harming our\ncompetitive position. We spend significant capital and allocate significant resource to ensure effective ongoing protection against the threat of security breaches, however these amounts might ultimately prove inadequate. We also maintain cyber insurance but there can be no assurance that liabilities or losses that we may incur would be covered under those policies or that the amount of insurance coverage would be adequate. Our Board of Directors, Audit Committee and senior management are regularly briefed on our cybersecurity policies and practices and on-going efforts to improve security. Despite all of our efforts, a security breach or computer virus could still occur which could have a significant negative impact on our business, including reputational harm, the loss of customers and material financial liability to us.\nIf our products and services do not comply with laws, regulations and industry standards to which we and our customers are subject, our business could be adversely affected\nOur product offerings facilitate the transmission of cash, business documents and confidential information including, in some cases, personally identifiable information related to individuals and corporations. Our products store and transmit this data electronically, and therefore our products must operate within the laws, regulations and industry standards regarding security, data protection and electronic commerce. There has been an increased global regulatory focus on privacy issues with respect to the handling of personal information, such as the EU's General Data Protection Regulation. Various U.S. federal, U.S. state, and foreign legislative, regulatory, or other government bodies may enact new or additional laws or regulations, or issue rulings that invalidate prior laws or regulations, concerning privacy, data storage, data protection, and cross-border transfer of data that could materially adversely impact our business. For example, in the European Union, the Court of Justice of the European Union invalidated the U.S.-EU Privacy Shield in July 2020. The U.S.-EU Privacy Shield provided a mechanism to lawfully transfer personal data from the European Union to the United States and certain other countries. If and when we transfer certain personal data from the European Union to the United States, the invalidation of the U.S.-EU Privacy Shield will require us to identify alternative legally sufficient mechanisms to transfer such personal data, which could result in substantial costs, require changes to our business practices, limit our ability to provide certain products in certain jurisdictions, or materially adversely affect our business and operating results. While we believe that our products comply with current regulatory requirements, the interpretation and application of these requirements continues to evolve and may evolve in ways that we cannot predict; so there can be no assurance that future legal or regulatory actions will not adversely impact us. To the extent that current or future regulatory or legal developments mandate a change in any of our products or services, require us or our customers to comply with any industry specific licensing or compliance requirements, alter the demand for or the competitive environment of our products and services or require us to make material changes to how we operate our business, including any changes to our internal operating, financial or management information systems, we might not be able to respond to such requirements in a timely or cost effective manner. If this were to occur, our business, operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nFailure to comply with the regulations provided by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) for certain of our UK operations could adversely impact our business\nA portion of our UK operations involves holding and disbursing client funds and is subject to the regulatory framework of the FCA. The FCA has significant enforcement authority which includes, but is not limited to, withdrawing an organization\u2019s authorization, issuing fines and suspending firms from carrying out regulated activities. While we believe we have appropriate controls and procedures around these operations, any failure to comply with FCA requirements may result in disciplinary actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nDefects or disruptions in our products or services could diminish demand for our solutions and have a material adverse effect on our future financial results\nOur software products are inherently complex. Despite testing prior to their release and throughout the lifecycle of a product or service, software and SaaS offerings often contain undetected errors or defects that can impact their function, performance and security. Any unanticipated performance problems or defects in our products or services could result in additional development costs, diversion of technical and other resources from our other development efforts, service disruptions for our SaaS offerings, negative publicity and reputational harm to us and our products and exposure to potential liability claims. As a result, any error or defect in our products or services could adversely affect our future financial results.\nWe could be adversely affected if we are unable to protect our proprietary technology and could be subject to litigation regarding intellectual property rights, which could cause serious harm to our business\nWe rely upon a combination of patent, copyright and trademark laws and non-disclosure and other intellectual property contractual arrangements to protect our proprietary rights. However, there is no assurance that our patents, pending applications for patents that may be issued in the future, or other intellectual property will be of sufficient scope and strength to provide meaningful protection for our technology or any commercial advantage to us. Further, we cannot be certain that our patents will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. We enter into agreements with our employees and customers that seek to limit and protect the distribution of proprietary information. Despite our efforts to safeguard and maintain our proprietary rights, there is no assurance that such rights will remain protected or that we will be able to detect unauthorized use and take appropriate steps to enforce our intellectual property rights.\nLitigation involving patents and other intellectual property rights is common in the United States and in other countries where we operate. We may be a party to litigation in the future to protect our intellectual property rights or as a result of an alleged infringement of the intellectual property rights of others. Any such claims, whether or not meritorious, could result in reputational harm to us, require us to spend significant sums in litigation costs or damages, delay product implementations, or require us to develop non-infringing intellectual property or acquire licenses to intellectual property that is the subject of the infringement claim. In addition, under many of our customer contracts, we are required to indemnify our customers for third-party intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase the costs to us of any such claims. These claims could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe may have larger than anticipated tax liabilities\nThe determination of our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment and estimation and there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. We are subject to tax in multiple U.S. and foreign tax jurisdictions and the determination of our tax liability is always subject to audit and review by the applicable domestic or foreign taxing authority. In light of fiscal challenges in U.S. federal and state governments and in many international locations, taxing authorities are increasingly focused on ways to increase revenues which may make resolving tax disputes more difficult. We are regularly under audit by tax authorities in different jurisdictions. While we have established tax reserves using assumptions and estimates that we believe to be reasonable, these reserves may prove insufficient in the event that a taxing authority asserts a tax position that is contrary to our position.\nChanges in financial accounting standards may cause unexpected financial reporting fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations\nChanges in accounting standards or practices could adversely affect our reported results of operations. New accounting pronouncements or varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements that occur or may occur in the future may materially affect our reported results of operations or the way we conduct our business in future periods.\nIf we fail to maintain appropriate and effective internal control over financial reporting, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired which could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price\nEnsuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures in place so that we can produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort that we re-evaluate regularly. Our internal controls over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. However, despite our efforts, any failure to maintain or implement the necessary internal controls could cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations or result in misstatements in our financial statements, either of which could cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and lead to a decline in the trading price of our common stock.\nRisks Related to our Indebtedness\nWe are party to a credit agreement with Bank of America, N.A. and certain other lenders which provides for a revolving credit facility in the amount of up to $300 million (the Credit Facility) through July 16, 2023. At June 30, 2021 we owed $130 million under the Credit Facility.\nOur level of indebtedness may limit our financial flexibility\nOur level of indebtedness affects our operations in several ways, including:\n\u2022a portion of our cash flows from operating activities must be used to service our indebtedness and is not available for other purposes;\n\u2022we may be at a competitive disadvantage as compared to similar companies that have less debt; and\n\u2022additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate or other purposes may have higher costs and contain restrictive covenants, or may not be available to us.\nThe factors that will affect our ability to obtain additional financing may be beyond our control and include financial market conditions, the value of our assets and our performance at the time we need financing.\nThe credit agreement contains financial and other covenants, and our failure to comply with any of those covenants could materially adversely impact us or limit or eliminate our ability to access funds under the Credit Facility\nThe credit agreement requires us to comply with certain financial covenants. Our ability to meet those financial covenants can be affected by events beyond our control and while at June 30, 2021 we were in compliance with those covenants, we may fail to maintain compliance in future periods. The credit agreement contains customary representations, warranties and covenants including, but not limited to, material adverse events, specified restrictions on indebtedness, liens, investments, acquisitions, sales of assets,\ndividends and other restricted payments, and transactions with affiliates. These restrictions could place us at a disadvantage relative to our competitors that are not subject to such limitations. A breach of any of these covenants or restrictions could result in an event of default under the credit agreement. Upon the occurrence of an event of default, the lenders could elect to declare all amounts outstanding under the Credit Facility, together with accrued interest, to be immediately due and payable. If we were unable to repay those amounts, the lenders could seek recovery against our assets, including any collateral granted to them to secure the indebtedness. If the lenders under the Credit Facility were to accelerate the payment of any indebtedness, we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to satisfy our obligations.\nOur variable rate could cause our debt service obligations to increase or decrease based on changes in market rates\nBorrowings under the Credit Facility are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk. If interest rates were to increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same and our net income and cash flows, including cash available for servicing our indebtedness, would correspondingly decrease. We have entered into interest rate swap agreements intended to mitigate interest rate volatility arising from the Credit Facility, however, the interest rate swaps and any additional interest rate swap we may enter into in the future might not fully mitigate our variable interest rate risk.\nChanges to and replacement of the LIBOR benchmark interest rate could adversely affect our business, financial results and operation\nIn July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA, the regulatory authority over LIBOR) stated they will plan for a phase out of regulatory oversight of LIBOR interest rate indices after 2021 to allow for an orderly transition to an alternate reference rate. On March 5, 2021 the FCA announced that it will not compel panel banks to contribute to the overnight, 1, 3, 6 and 12 months USA LIBOR tenors after June 30, 2023 and all other tenors after December 31, 2021. At this time, no consensus exists as to what rate or rates may become acceptable alternatives to LIBOR and it is impossible to predict the effect of any such alternatives on the value of LIBOR-based securities and variable rate loans, or other securities or financial arrangements, given LIBOR's role in determining market interest rates globally. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC) has proposed that the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) is the rate that represents the best alternative to LIBOR for derivatives and other financial contracts that are currently indexed to LIBOR. The ARRC has proposed a market transition plan to SOFR from LIBOR, and organizations are currently working on transition plans as it relates to derivatives and cash markets exposed to LIBOR. We are evaluating the potential impact of the eventual replacement of the LIBOR benchmark interest rate, including the possibility of SOFR as the dominant replacement in the United States. In addition, other benchmarks may emerge or other rates may be adopted outside of the United States. The market transition away from LIBOR towards SOFR is expected to be complicated. There can be no guarantee that SOFR will become a widely accepted benchmark in place of LIBOR. Borrowings under our Credit Facility, as hedged by our interest swaps, are indexed to LIBOR. It is uncertain at this time, what the impact of a possible transition to SOFR may be on our business, financial results and operations.\nRisks Related To Owning Our Common Stock\nOur common stock has experienced and may continue to undergo significant market price fluctuations\nThe market price of our common stock has recently experienced and may continue to experience significant fluctuations due to a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022general and industry-specific business, economic and market conditions;\n\u2022actual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022the extent of the impact and the duration of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022changes in or our failure to meet analysts\u2019 or investors\u2019 estimates or expectations;\n\u2022public announcements concerning us, our competitors or our industry;\n\u2022acquisitions, divestitures, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, or capital commitments by us or our competitors;\n\u2022adverse developments in patent or other proprietary rights; and\n\u2022announcements of technological innovations by our competitors.\nWe have never declared nor paid dividends on our common stock and we do not anticipate doing so in the foreseeable future. Accordingly, the only opportunity for a return on investment in our Company will be if the market price of our common stock increases and acquired shares are sold at a profit.\nIf our revenues or mix of revenues are below anticipated levels or if our operating results are below analyst or investor expectations, the market price of our common stock could be adversely affected\nA significant percentage of our expenses, particularly personnel and facilities costs, are relatively fixed and based in part on anticipated revenue levels which can be difficult to predict. A decline in revenues without a corresponding and timely slowdown in expense growth could adversely affect our business. Significant revenue shortfalls in any quarter may cause significant declines in operating results since we may be unable to reduce spending in a timely manner.\nQuarterly or annual operating results that are below the expectations of public market analysts could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Factors that could cause fluctuations in our operating results include:\n\u2022a change in customer demand for our products, which is highly dependent on our ability to continue to offer innovative technology solutions in very competitive markets;\n\u2022the timing of customer orders;\n\u2022for our cloud solutions, the time it takes us to deliver to the customer a fully functional live production environment, since revenue recognition generally does not commence prior to that achievement;\n\u2022the timing of product implementations, which are highly dependent on customers\u2019 resources and discretion;\n\u2022overall economic conditions, which may affect our customers\u2019 and potential customers\u2019 budgets for information technology expenditures;\n\u2022foreign exchange rate volatility, which can have a significant effect on our total revenues and costs when our foreign operations are translated to U.S. dollars;\n\u2022the incurrence of costs relating to the integration of software products and operations in connection with acquisitions of technologies or businesses; and\n\u2022the timing and market acceptance of new products or product enhancements by either us or our competitors.\nCertain anti-takeover provisions contained in our charter and under Delaware law could hinder a takeover attempt\nWe are subject to the provisions of Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware prohibiting, under some circumstances, publicly-held Delaware corporations from engaging in business combinations with some stockholders for a specified period of time without the approval of the holders of substantially all of our outstanding voting stock. Such provisions could delay or impede the removal of incumbent directors and could make more difficult a merger, tender offer or proxy contest involving us, even if such events could be beneficial, in the short term, to the interests of our stockholders. In addition, such provisions could limit the price that some investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions relating to the limitation of liability and indemnification of our directors and officers, dividing our board of directors into three classes of directors serving three-year terms and providing that our stockholders can take action only at a duly called annual or special meeting of stockholders.\nGeneral Risks\nWeakness or deterioration in domestic and global economic conditions could have a significant adverse impact on our business, financial condition and operating results\nOur business, financial condition and operating results are significantly affected by general economic conditions, including those related to the COVID-19 pandemic. Economic weakness or any downturn in the U.S. or global economies could result in a variety of risks to our business, including:\n\u2022increased volatility in our stock price;\n\u2022increased volatility in foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u2022delays in, or curtailment of, purchasing decisions by our customers or potential customers either as a result of continuing economic uncertainty or as a result of their inability to access the liquidity necessary to engage in purchasing initiatives;\n\u2022pricing pressures for our products and services, including reductions in the duration or renewal rates for our subscription contracts and software maintenance contracts;\n\u2022increased credit risk associated with our customers or potential customers, particularly those that may operate in industries or geographic regions most affected by the economic downturn; and\n\u2022impairment of our goodwill or other assets.\nTo the extent that economic conditions become uncertain or deteriorate, or any of the above risks occur, our business and operating results could be significantly and adversely affected.\nThe withdrawal of the United Kingdom (UK) from the European Union (EU) (referred to as Brexit), could create disruption and uncertainty to our business, including our relationships with our existing and future customers, suppliers and employees, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial results and operations\nIn January 2020, the UK and EU entered into a withdrawal agreement pursuant to which the UK formally withdrew from the EU on January 31, 2020. Following such withdrawal, the UK entered into a transition period which ended on December 31, 2020. The UK and EU signed a European Union-United Kingdom Trade and Cooperating Agreement (TCA), which became effective in May 2021.\nThe ultimate effects of Brexit will depend, in part, on how the terms of the TCA and any future agreements signed by the UK and EU take effect in practice. There remains uncertainties and risks to our business related to Brexit and the new relationship between the UK and EU, which will continue to be developed and defined, as well as any resulting political and economic instability created by Brexit. These uncertainties could disrupt the markets we serve and the tax jurisdictions in which we operate and create uncertainty and challenges (particularly in the near term) with respect to trading relationships between our UK subsidiary and other EU nations. Remaining EU member countries may also seek to make it more difficult for us to trade effectively or competitively in those regions. In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations, including with respect to employment law or data privacy, as the UK determines which EU laws to replace or replicate, which could create additional uncertainty and challenges for us.", "PERMNO": 86717, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "EPAY"}
