RISK FACTORS\nYou should consider carefully the following risk factors before making an investment decision with respect to our securities. You are cautioned that the risk factors discussed below are not exhaustive.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nThe outbreak of, and local, state and federal governmental responses to, the COVID-19 pandemic have significantly disrupted and will continue to disrupt our business, which has and could continue to materially affect our financial condition and operating results for an extended period of time.\nThe global crisis resulting from the spread of COVID-19 had a substantial impact on our restaurant operations in fiscal 2020. During portions of the month of March 2020 through late May 2020, all of the Company\u2019s Bad Daddy\u2019s Burger Bar restaurants were open only for delivery and carry-out service, with dining rooms closed by government orders. Beginning in late May 2020, we began to re-open dining rooms at Bad Daddy\u2019s as local regulations allowed. By early June, we had re-opened all the dining rooms at Bad Daddy\u2019s. Although our dining rooms were open, all operated at some reduction of capacity, whether driven by explicit capacity reductions under government orders, or due to social distancing protocols that were either mandated by the same government orders, or which we abide by under our own internal protocols designed to maintain a safe foodservice environment, both for our employees and for our customers. In November 2020, due to increased incidence and positivity rates in certain counties, all of our Bad Daddy\u2019s Burger Bar restaurants in Colorado again closed dining rooms per government orders, and will remain closed for an indeterminate period of time, though at this time the outdoor patios at those restaurants remain open and available for customer seating.\nOur operating results substantially depend upon our ability to drive traffic to our restaurants, and for our Bad Daddy\u2019s Burger Bar restaurants, to serve guests in our dining rooms. We cannot currently estimate the duration of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business; neither are we able to predict how the pandemic will evolve nor how various government entities will respond to its evolution. Should governments choose to re-close additional dining rooms, our business would be adversely affected. Even without government orders, customers may choose to reduce or eliminate in-restaurant dining because of increasing numbers of COVID-19 cases, hospitalizations, or deaths.\nAdditionally, in connection with spread of COVID-19, there have been disruptions in various food supply chains in the United States. Our operating results substantially depend upon our ability to obtain sufficient quantities of products such as beef, bacon, and other products used in the production of items served and sold to our guests. Ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic could result in product shortages and in-turn could require us to serve a limited menu, restrict number of items purchased per guest, or close some or all of our restaurants for an indeterminate period of time. Ongoing material adverse impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic could result in reduced revenue and cash flow and could affect our assessments of impairment of intangible assets, long-lived assets, or goodwill.\nWe took extraordinary actions to manage our liquidity position in response to COVID-19, including temporarily reducing employee pay, reductions in force, and obtaining PPP loans under the CARES Act. We have since significantly increased employment levels and restored pay to employees. Although we currently have a meaningful cash balance and generated significant cash flow from operations during this quarter, should business decline significantly as a result of the pandemic we would not likely be able to take some of the same actions without negatively impacting the long-term viability of the business. The COVID-19 pandemic is adversely affecting the availability of liquidity generally in the credit markets, and there can be no guarantee that additional liquidity will be available on favorable terms, or at all, especially the longer the COVID-19 pandemic lasts or if it were to reoccur.\nThe equity markets in the United States have been extremely volatile due to the COVID-19 outbreak and our stock price has fluctuated.\nWe have incurred indebtedness under the CARES Act which may be subject to audit, may not be forgivable and may eventually have to be repaid.\nThe PPP Loans are subject to forgiveness under the PPP upon the Company\u2019s request to the extent that the proceeds are used to pay expenses permitted by the PPP, including payroll costs, covered rent and mortgage obligations, and covered utility payments.\nThe U.S. Department of the Treasury has announced that it will conduct audits for PPP loans that exceed $2 million. Should we be audited or reviewed by the U.S. Department of the Treasury or the SBA as a result of the PPP Loans or filing an application for forgiveness or otherwise, such audit or review could result in the diversion of management\u2019s time and attention, generate negative publicity and cause us to incur legal and reputational costs. If we were to be audited and receive an adverse outcome in such an audit, we could be required to return the full amount of the PPP Loan and may potentially be subject to civil and criminal fines and penalties. We may not have the resources to repay the PPP Loans if required to do so by the federal government.\nThe Company cannot provide assurance that the principal and interest amounts under the PPP Loans will be forgiven. If all or substantially all of the PPP Loans are not forgiven or it is subsequently determined that they must be repaid, we may be required to repay the PPP Loans. Any such repayment of the PPP Loans will reduce the funds available to us for working capital and other corporate purposes and may limit our ability to obtain additional financing. Additionally, though we believe we are eligible for the PPP Loans under the PPP, our receipt of the PPP Loans could result in negative publicity, or expose us to liability under the federal False Claims Act, which prohibits the known filing of a false claim or the known use of false statements to obtain payment from the federal government, if it is determined that we were in fact not eligible to take the PPP Loans in the first instance.\nWe have accumulated losses and expect losses in the future.\nWe have incurred losses in 29 of our 33 years since inception. As of September 29, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $44,467,000. Especially in light of the uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic, we cannot reasonably predict whether we will produce income or again generate a loss for the fiscal year ending September 28, 2021.\nIf we are unable to continue to increase same store sales at existing restaurants, our ability to attain profitability may be adversely affected.\nWe have increased same-store sales for nine of the past ten years at Good Times. We have operated Bad Daddy\u2019s for a shorter period of time and have had negative same store sales for that concept in the last two fiscal years. Same-store sales increases will depend in part on the success of our advertising and promotion of new and existing menu items and consumer acceptance and could be greatly impacted by future effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. We cannot assure that our advertising and promotional efforts will in fact be successful, nor that sales volumes will be fully restored after COVID-19 subsides. If our same-store sales decrease, and our other operating costs increase, our ability to attain profitability will be adversely affected.\nNew restaurants, when and if opened, may not be profitable, if at all, for several months.\nWe anticipate that our new restaurants, when and if opened, will generally take several months to reach normalized operating levels due to inefficiencies typically associated with new restaurants, including lack of market awareness, the need to hire and train a sufficient number of employees, operating costs which are often materially greater during the first several months of operation than thereafter, preopening costs and other factors. In addition, restaurants opened in new markets may open at lower average weekly sales volumes than restaurants opened in existing markets and may have higher restaurant level operating expense ratios than in existing markets. Sales at restaurants opened in new markets may take longer to reach average annual company-owned restaurant sales, if at all, thereby affecting the profitability of these restaurants. Lastly, the opening of any new restaurants has been significantly delayed because of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, and it is unknown when development activities will be fully restored.\nOur operations are susceptible to the cost of and changes in food availability which could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur profitability depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in food costs. Various factors beyond our control, including adverse weather conditions, governmental regulation, production, availability, recalls of food products, seasonality and COVID-19-related factors may affect our food costs or cause a disruption in our supply chain. We enter into annual contracts with our chicken and other miscellaneous suppliers. Our Good Times contracts for chicken are fixed price contracts. Our Bad Daddy\u2019s contracts for chicken and all contracts for beef are generally based on current market prices plus a processing fee. Changes in the price or availability of our all-natural chicken or beef supply or other commodities could materially adversely affect our profitability. We cannot predict whether we will be able to anticipate and react to changing food costs by adjusting our purchasing practices and menu prices, and a failure to do so could adversely affect our operating results. In addition, we may not be able to pass along higher costs through price increases to our customers.\nMacroeconomic conditions could affect our operating results.\nGeneral economic conditions, including economic downturns related to the COVID-19 pandemic, have adversely affected our results of operations and may continue to do so. If the economy experiences a more significant economic downturn or there are uncertainties regarding economic recovery, consumer spending and the unemployment rate may be affected, which may adversely affect our sales in the future. A proliferation of heavy discounting by our major competitors may also negatively affect our sales and operating results.\nPrice increases may impact customer visits.\nWe may make price increases on selected menu items in order to offset increased operating expenses we believe will be recurring. Although we have not experienced significant consumer resistance to our past price increases, future price increases may deter customers from visiting our restaurants or affect their purchasing decisions.\nThe hamburger restaurant market is highly competitive.\nThe hamburger restaurant market is highly competitive. Our competitors in the quick-service restaurant segment include many recognized national and regional fast-food hamburger restaurant chains, such as McDonald\u2019s, Burger King, Wendy\u2019s, Carl\u2019s Jr., Sonic, Jack in the Box, Freddy\u2019s and Culver\u2019s. In-N-Out has expanded into the state of Colorado, the primary state in which we operate, and is continuing to expand in the market. We also compete with small regional and local hamburger and other fast-food restaurants, many of which feature drive-through service. Most of our competitors have greater financial resources, marketing programs and name recognition than we do. Discounting by our quick-service restaurant competitors may adversely affect the revenues and profitability of our restaurants.\nWhile Bad Daddy\u2019s Burger Bar operates in the \u201cbetter burger\u201d restaurant segment, it offers a relatively broad menu and also competes with other full-service restaurants in the bar and grill segment. Additionally, customers of both our Good Times restaurants and Bad Daddy\u2019s Burger Bar restaurants are also customers of fast casual hamburger restaurants. Further, changes in customer taste preferences, dietary trends, and preference for delivery and/or carry-out options often affect the restaurant business. If we are unable to continue to compete effectively with other restaurant concepts, our traffic, sales, and restaurant-level profitability could be negatively affected.\nSites for new restaurants may be difficult to acquire.\nLocating our restaurants in high-traffic and readily accessible areas is an important factor for our success. We intend to continue to locate Bad Daddy\u2019s Burger Bar restaurants in leased in-line and end-cap retail locations. Since suitable locations are in great demand, in the future we may not be able to obtain optimal sites for either of our restaurant concepts at a reasonable cost or at all. In addition, we cannot assure you that the sites we do obtain will be successful.\nOur franchisees could take actions that could harm our business.\nFranchisees are independent contractors and are not our employees. We provide training and support to franchisees; however, franchisees operate their restaurants as independent businesses. Consequently, the quality of franchised restaurant operations may be diminished by any number of factors beyond our control. Moreover, franchisees may not successfully operate restaurants in a manner consistent with our standards and requirements or may not hire and train qualified managers and other restaurant personnel. Our image and reputation, and the image and reputation of other franchisees, may suffer materially, and system-wide sales could significantly decline, if our franchisees do not operate successfully.\nWe depend on key management employees.\nWe believe our current operations and future success depend largely on the continued services of our management employees, in particular Ryan Zink, our President, Chief Executive Officer, Principal Financial Officer and Treasurer; Susan Knutson, our Controller and Corporate Secretary and Scott LeFever, our Vice President of Operations Although we have entered into employment agreements with Messrs. Zink, LeFever and Ms. Knutson, they may voluntarily terminate their employment with us at any time. In addition, we do not currently maintain key-person insurance on the lives of Messrs. Zink, LeFever or Ms. Knutson. The loss of Messrs. Zink\u2019s, LeFever\u2019s and Ms. Knutson\u2019s services, or other key management personnel, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nLabor shortages could slow our growth or harm our business.\nOur success depends in part upon our ability to attract, motivate and retain a sufficient number of qualified, high-energy employees. Qualified individuals needed to fill these positions are in short supply in some areas. The inability to recruit and retain these individuals may delay the planned openings of new restaurants or result in high employee turnover in existing restaurants, which could harm our business. Additionally, competition for qualified employees could require us to pay higher wages to attract enough employees, which could result in higher labor costs. Most of our employees are paid market wages on an hourly basis that are influenced by applicable minimum wage regulations. Accordingly, any increase in the minimum wage, whether state or federal, could have a material adverse impact on our business.\nSecurity breaches of confidential customer information in connection with our electronic processing of credit and debit card transactions may adversely affect our business.\nThe majority of our restaurant sales are by credit or debit cards. Other restaurants and retailers have experienced security breaches in which credit and debit card information of their customers has been stolen. We may in the future become subject to lawsuits or other proceedings for purportedly fraudulent transactions arising out of the actual or alleged theft of our customers\u2019 credit or debit card information. In addition, most states have enacted legislation requiring notification of security breaches involving personal information, including credit and debit card information. Any such claim, proceeding, or mandatory notification could cause us to incur significant unplanned expenses, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Further, adverse publicity resulting from these allegations may have a material adverse effect on us and our restaurants.\nWe are subject to extensive government regulation that may adversely hinder or impact our ability to govern various aspects of our business including our ability to expand and develop our restaurants.\nThe restaurant industry is subject to various federal, state and local government regulations, including those relating to the sale of food. Our failure to maintain necessary governmental licenses, permits and approvals, including food licenses, could adversely affect our operating results. Difficulties or failures in obtaining the required licenses and approvals could delay, or result in our decision to cancel, the opening of new restaurants. Local authorities may suspend or deny renewal of our food licenses if they determine that our conduct does not meet applicable standards or if there are changes in regulations. In addition, any adverse food safety event could result in regulatory and other investigations, and/or fines and penalties, any of which could disrupt our operations, increase our costs, require us to respond to findings from regulatory agencies that may divert resources and assets, and result in potential fines and penalties as well as other gal action, any of which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nVarious federal, state and labor laws govern our relationship with our employees and affect operating costs. These laws govern minimum wage requirements, overtime pay, meal and rest breaks, unemployment tax rates, workers\u2019 compensation rates, citizenship or residency requirements, child labor regulations and sales taxes. Additional government-imposed increases in minimum wages, overtime pay, paid leaves of absence and mandated health benefits may increase our operating costs. Several states and cities, including the city of Denver and the state of Colorado, where many of our restaurants are located, have legislation passed which provides for annual increases in their respective minimum wage. Additional states may raise their respective minimum wage in the future. This could impact the profitability of existing restaurants as well as impact development opportunities in those states.\nThe federal Americans with Disabilities Act prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability in public accommodations and employment. Although our restaurants are designed to be accessible to the disabled, we could be required to make modifications to our restaurants to provide service to, or make reasonable accommodations for, disabled persons.\nWe are also subject to federal and state laws that regulate the offer and sale of franchises and aspects of the licensor-licensee relationship. Many state franchise laws impose restrictions on the franchise agreement, including limitations on non-competition provisions and the termination or non-renewal of a franchise. Some states require that franchise materials be registered before franchises can be offered or sold in the state.\nOur Bad Daddy\u2019s Burger Bar restaurants are also subject to state and local laws that regulate the sale of alcoholic beverages. Alcoholic beverage control regulations govern various aspects of these restaurants\u2019 daily operations, including the minimum age of patrons and employees, hours of operation, advertising, wholesale purchasing and inventory control, handling and storage. Typically, licenses to sell alcoholic beverages require annual renewal and may be suspended or revoked at any time for cause, the definition of which varies by locality. The failure of any of our Bad Daddy\u2019s Burger Bar restaurants to timely obtain and maintain any required licenses, permits or approvals to serve alcoholic beverages could delay or prevent the opening of a new restaurant or prevent regular day-to-day operations, including the sale of alcoholic beverages, at a restaurant that is already operating, any of which would adversely affect our business.\nConcerns relating to food safety, food-borne illness, pandemics and other diseases could reduce customer traffic to our restaurants, or cause us to be the target of litigation, which could materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nWe face food safety risks, including the risk of food-borne illness and food contamination (including allergen cross contamination), which are common both in the restaurant industry and the food supply chain. While we dedicate substantial resources and provide training to ensure the safety and quality of the food we serve, these risks cannot be completely eliminated. Additionally, we rely on our network of suppliers to properly handle, store and transport our ingredients for delivery to our restaurants. Any failure by our suppliers, or their suppliers, could cause our ingredients to be contaminated, which could be difficult to detect and put the safety of our food in jeopardy.\nIn addition to the novel coronavirus that causes COVID-19, consumer preferences could be affected by health concerns about outbreaks of other viruses, including various strains of influenza; the consumption of beef, the key ingredient in many of our menu items; or negative publicity concerning food quality, illness and injury generally, such as negative publicity concerning E. coli, \u201cmad cow\u201d or \u201cfoot-and-mouth\u201d disease, publication of government or industry findings concerning food products served by us, or other health concerns or operating issues stemming from one restaurant or a limited number of restaurants. This negative publicity may adversely affect demand for our food and could result in a decrease in customer traffic to our restaurants. If we react to the negative publicity by changing our concept or our menu, we may lose customers who do not prefer the new concept or menu, and we may not be able to attract a sufficient new customer base to produce the revenue needed to make our restaurants profitable. In addition, we may have different or additional competitors for our intended customers as a result of a concept change and may not be able to compete successfully against those competitors. A decrease in customer traffic to our restaurants as a result of these health concerns or negative publicity or as a result of a change in our menu or concept could materially harm our business. Additionally, if our customers or staff members become infected with a pathogen which was actually or claimed to be contracted at our restaurants, customers may avoid our restaurants and/or it may become difficult to adequately staff our restaurants. Any adverse food safety occurrence may result in litigation against us. The negative publicity associated with such an event could damage our reputation and materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nIf we are unable to protect our reputation, the value of our brands and sales at our restaurants may be negatively impacted, which may materially adversely affect our financial performance.\nOne of our largest assets is the value of our brands, which is directly linked to our reputation. We must protect our reputation in order to continue to be successful and to grow the value of our brands. Negative publicity directed at any of our brands, regardless of factual basis, such as, relating to food quality, restaurant facilities, customer complaints or litigation alleging injury or food-borne illnesses, food tampering or contamination or poor health inspection scores, sanitary or other issues with respect to food processing by us or our suppliers, the condition of our restaurants, labor relations, any failure to comply with applicable regulations or standards, allegations of harassment, or other negative publicity, could damage our reputation. Negative publicity about us could harm our reputation and damage the value of our brands, which could materially and adversely affect our financial performance.\nOur ability to succeed with the Bad Daddy\u2019s Burger Bar restaurant concept will require significant capital expenditures and management attention.\nWe believe that new openings of Bad Daddy\u2019s Burger Bar restaurants are likely to serve as the primary contributor of our new unit growth and increased profitability over the longer term based on the unit economics of that concept. Our ability to succeed with this concept will require significant capital expenditures and management attention and is subject to certain risks in addition to those of opening a new Good Times restaurant, including customer acceptance of and competition with the Bad Daddy\u2019s Burger Bar concept. If the \u201cramp-up\u201d period for new Bad Daddy\u2019s Burger Bar restaurants does not meet our expectations, our operating results may be adversely affected. There can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully develop and grow the Bad Daddy\u2019s Burger Bar concept to a point where it will become profitable or generate positive cash flow. We may not be able to attract enough customers to meet targeted levels of performance at new Bad Daddy\u2019s Burger Bar restaurants because potential customers may be unfamiliar with the concept or the atmosphere or menu might not be appealing to them. If we cannot successfully execute our growth strategies for Bad Daddy\u2019s Burger Bar, our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nOur growth, including the development of Bad Daddy\u2019s Burger Bar restaurants, may strain our management and infrastructure.\nAny growth of our business would increase our operating complexity and place increased demands on our management and infrastructure, including our current restaurant management systems, financial and management controls, and information systems. If our infrastructure is insufficient to support our growth, our ability to open new restaurants, including the development of the Bad Daddy\u2019s Burger Bar concept, would be adversely affected.\nBad Daddy\u2019s Burger Bar is subject to all of the risks of a relatively new business, including competition, and there is no guarantee of a return on our capital investment.\nThe Bad Daddy\u2019s Burger Bar concept has been in existence for approximately twelve years. Existing restaurants are currently located in Colorado, Georgia, Oklahoma, North Carolina, South Carolina, Alabama, and Tennessee. Because of the small number of existing Bad Daddy\u2019s Burger Bar restaurants and the relatively short period of time that they have been in operation, there is substantial uncertainty that additional restaurants in other locations will be successful. There is no guarantee that we will be successful in offering Bad Daddy\u2019s Burger Bar franchises throughout the U.S. or that, if and when such franchises are granted, the restaurants developed by franchisees will be successful. There is also substantial uncertainty that the franchising business will be successful in view of the facts that we have sold only two Bad Daddy\u2019s Burger Bar restaurant franchises to date and that the restaurant franchising business is very competitive.\nRisks Related to the Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur business could be negatively affected as a result of significant stockholders or potential stockholders attempting to effect changes or acquire control over our company, which could cause us to incur significant expense, hinder execution of our business strategy and impact the trading value of our securities.\nStockholders may from time to time attempt to effect changes, engage in proxy solicitations or advance shareholder proposals. Responding to proxy contests and other actions by activist stockholders can be costly and time-consuming, disrupting our operations and diverting the attention of our board of directors and senior management from the pursuit of business strategies. Any of these impacts could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results. Further, the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected by the events, risks and uncertainties described above.\nFuture changes in financial accounting standards may cause adverse unexpected operating results and affect our reported results of operations.\nChanges in accounting standards can have a significant effect on our reported results and may affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective. See Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. New pronouncements and varying interpretations of pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future. Changes to existing rules or differing interpretations with respect to our current practices may adversely affect our reported financial results.\nBecause we currently qualify as a \u201csmaller reporting company,\u201d our non-financial and financial information are less than is required by non-smaller reporting companies.\nCurrently we qualify as a \u201csmaller reporting company\u201d under SEC rules. A smaller reporting company prepares and files SEC reports and registration statements using the same forms as other SEC reporting companies, though the information required to be disclosed may differ and be less comprehensive.\nWe cannot predict whether investors will find our common stock less attractive because of our reliance on any of the reduced disclosure requirements available to smaller reporting companies. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly.\nThe trading price of our shares of common stock has from time-to-time fluctuated widely and, in the future may be subject to similar fluctuations. This volatility may affect the price at which you could sell your common stock. The market price of our common stock is likely to continue to be volatile and may fluctuate significantly in response to many factors, including:\n\u00b7 the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our business;\n\u00b7 operating results that vary from the expectations of management, securities analysts and investors;\n\u00b7 developments in our business;\n\u00b7 the operating and securities price performance of companies that investors consider to be comparable to us;\n\u00b7 announcements of implementation of strategic transactions or developments and other material events by us or our competitors;\n\u00b7 negative economic conditions that adversely affect the economy, commodity prices, the job market and other factors that may affect the markets in which we operate;\n\u00b7 publication of research reports about us or the sectors in which we operate generally;\n\u00b7 changes in market valuations of similar companies;\n\u00b7 additions or departures of key management personnel;\n\u00b7 actions by institutional stockholders;\n\u00b7 speculation in the press or investment community; and\n\u00b7 the realization of any of the other risk factors included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nHolders of our common stock will be subject to the risk of volatile and depressed market prices of our common stock. In addition, many of the factors listed above are beyond our control. These factors may cause the market price of our common stock to decline, regardless of our financial condition, results of operations, business or prospects. It is impossible to assure investors in our common stock that the market price of our common stock will not fall in the future.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market by our existing Stockholders could cause our stock price to fall.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market, or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise adequate capital through the sale of additional equity securities. We are unable to predict the effect that sales may have on the prevailing market price of our common stock.\nThere may be future sales or other dilution of our equity, which may adversely affect the market price of the shares of our common stock and/or dilute the value of shares of our common stock.\nWe are not restricted from issuing, and shareholder approval is not required in order to issue, additional shares of common stock, including securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive, shares of common stock, except any shareholder approval required by The NASDAQ Capital Markets. We have in the past, and may in the future, sell such equity and equity-linked securities. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock or other equity-related securities in the public market could depress the market price of our shares of common stock. We cannot predict the effect that future sales of our common stock or other equity-related securities would have on the market price of our shares of common stock. The market price of our common stock may be adversely affected if we issue additional shares of our common stock.\nProvisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws and provisions of Nevada law may prevent or delay an acquisition of our company, which could decrease the trading price of our common stock.\nWe are subject to anti-takeover laws for Nevada corporations. These anti-takeover laws prevent a Nevada corporation from engaging in a business combination with any shareholder, including all affiliates and associates of the shareholder, who is the beneficial owner of 10% or more of the corporation\u2019s outstanding voting stock, for two years following the date that the shareholder first became the beneficial owner of 10% or more of the corporation\u2019s voting stock, unless specified conditions are met. If those conditions are not met, then after the expiration of the two-year period the corporation may not engage in a business combination with such shareholder unless certain other conditions are met.\nOur articles of incorporation and our bylaws contain several provisions that may deter or impede takeovers or changes of control or management. These provisions:\n\u00b7 authorize our board of directors to establish one or more series of preferred stock the terms of which can be determined by the board of directors at the time of issuance;\n\u00b7 do not allow for cumulative voting in the election of directors unless required by applicable law. Under cumulative voting a minority shareholder holding a sufficient percentage of a class of shares may be able to ensure the election of one or more directors;\n\u00b7 state that special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by the chairman of the board of directors, the president or any two directors and must be called by the president upon the written request of the holders of 25% of the outstanding shares of capital stock entitled to vote at such special meeting; and\n\u00b7 provide that the authorized number of directors is no more than five, as determined by our board of directors.\nThese provisions, alone or in combination with each other, may discourage transactions involving actual or potential changes of control, including transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices to stockholders for their common stock.", "PERMNO": 76360, "SIC": 5812, "TIC": "GTIM"}
