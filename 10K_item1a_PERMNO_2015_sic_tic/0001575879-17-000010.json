{"cik": "1575879", "company": "Caesars Acquisition Co", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-02-15", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nRisks Related to the Pending Acquisition of the Company by Caesars Entertainment\nWe may not be able to consummate our announced acquisition by CEC in the anticipated timeframe, or at all.\nAs previously announced, on December 21, 2014, we entered into the Merger Agreement with CEC, pursuant to which, subject to satisfaction or waiver of certain conditions, CAC will merge with and into CEC, with CEC as the surviving company. On July 9, 2016, we agreed with CEC to amend and restate the Merger Agreement (as amended the \"Amended Merger Agreement\"). There are a number of risks and uncertainties associated with the consummation of the Proposed Merger with CEC, and completion of the Proposed Merger is contingent upon customary closing conditions, including approval of the Amended Merger Agreement by our stockholders as well as CEC's stockholders and receipt of certain regulatory approvals. In addition to obtaining the stockholder approvals, consummation of the Proposed Merger is also subject to other conditions, including the CEOC restructuring plan confirmed by the bankruptcy court containing the Debtor Release, the Third-Party Release and the Exculpation, each as defined in the CEOC restructuring plan. The order approving the disclosure statement and the order approving solicitation procedures for creditors to vote on the third amended joint plan of reorganization were both approved on June 28, 2016. On October 19, 2016, the objection and voting deadline for the third amended joint plan of reorganization was scheduled for November 21, 2016. The confirmation hearing was held on January 17, 2017, at which point the Bankruptcy Court approved CEOC's restructuring plan. Failure to obtain the other required approvals within the expected time frame, or having to make significant changes to the structure, terms, or conditions of the Proposed Merger to obtain such approvals, may result in a material delay in, or the abandonment of, the Proposed Merger. There can be no assurance that these conditions of the Proposed Merger will be satisfied, and if satisfied, when they will be satisfied. In no event will the Proposed Merger be completed later than December 31, 2017, unless CAC and CEC otherwise agree.\nThough the CEOC restructuring plan confirmed by the bankruptcy court contains the Debtor Release, Third-Party Release and Exculpation, under certain circumstances the exchange ratio, pursuant to which shares of CAC's class A common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the \"Class A Common Stock\") and CAC's class B common stock, par value $0.001 per share (the \"Class B Common Stock,\" and together with the Class A Common Stock, the \"CAC Common Stock\"), will become exchangeable for shares of CEC's common stock (the \"Exchange Ratio\"), may be adjusted or the Amended Merger Agreement may be terminated.\nAdditionally, CEC is subject to litigation which if decided adversely may increase the risk the conditions to consummation of the Proposed Merger are not satisfied. As further discussed in the section entitled Item 3. Legal Proceedings - CEOC Bondholder Litigation, or Noteholder Disputes, on July 22, 2015, the bankruptcy judge presiding over the CEOC bankruptcy denied CEOC's request to stay certain litigation against CEC including the Delaware Second Lien Lawsuit, the New York First Lien Lawsuit, the New York Second Lien Lawsuit and the Senior Unsecured Lawsuits and, following multiple appeals, on December 23, 2015, a panel of the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the bankruptcy court's denial of CEOC's requested stay and remanded the issue to the bankruptcy court for further consideration. On January 11, 2015, CEOC petitioned the Seventh Circuit to rehear the appeal. CEOC's petition for rehearing was denied on January 25, 2016, and the case was remanded to the bankruptcy court on February 2, 2016. On February 26, 2016, the bankruptcy court issued a ruling granting CEOC's request to stay the litigation identified above until the earlier of (i) 60 days after the examiner files his initial final report and (ii) May 9, 2016. The second lien notes trustee BOKF, N.A. (\"BOKF\") sought limited relief from the bankruptcy court's order on March 3, 2016, requesting that all pre-trial matters and rulings be allowed to move forward. On March 10, 2016, the bankruptcy court modified the preliminary injunction to clarify that BOKF may engage in all pre-trial matters. On May 10, 2016, BOKF moved for partial summary judgment on claims related to breach of contract and violation of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939. The parties completed summary judgment briefing prior to the bankruptcy court's June 15, 2016 grant of a temporary stay through August 29, 2016 of the Parent Guarantee Lawsuits, as defined below. On October 5, 2016, the Bankruptcy Court granted CEOC's motion for a stay of the Parent Guarantee Lawsuits. The Bankruptcy Court ordered this stay to remain in effect until the earlier of (a) the first omnibus hearing after the Bankruptcy Court issues its decision confirming or denying confirmation of the CEOC reorganization plan (February 15, 2017), (b) the termination of the Second Lien RSA or (c) further order of the Bankruptcy Court. Adverse rulings may result in reinstatement of the CEC guarantee of certain CEOC debt which could increase the risk the conditions to consummation of the Proposed Merger are not satisfied. Adverse rulings may also result in the possibility that Caesars Entertainment enters bankruptcy or is unable to continue as a going concern.\nAdditionally, the significant amounts CEC has agreed to pay in connection with CEOC's reorganization raises substantial doubt about CEC's ability to continue as a going concern. It is possible that the amount of money CEC will be required to pay will be so substantial that it will diminish the value of CEC to such an extent that the proposed merger between CAC and CEC cannot be consummated. The proposed merger between CAC and CEC is subject to an exchange ratio governing the relative percentage ownership in the combined entity that CAC and CEC would each hold. Any revision to the exchange ratio must be approved by a special committee of the CAC board and ultimately by shareholder vote of CAC stockholders. Should CEC be required to pay such a substantial amount of money or other consideration to a reorganized CEOC that the value of CEC requires a revision to the exchange ratio for the merged entity, it is possible that the CAC special committee or CAC's\nstockholders would not approve the merger and the merger would not be consummated. See risk factor below entitled \"If a court were to find in favor of the claimants in the Noteholder Disputes, it would likely have a material adverse effect on CEC's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and, absent an intervening event, a reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code would likely be necessary due to the limited resources available at CEC to resolve such matters. The significant amounts CEC has agreed to pay in connection with CEOC's reorganization raise substantial doubt about CEC's ability to continue as a going concern. In addition, CEC estimates that it will require additional sources of funding to meet the ongoing financial commitments of the CEC holding company for amounts other than committed to under the RSAs.\"\nWe can therefore give you no assurance that the Proposed Merger will be consummated, in which case we would not realize the anticipated benefits of having completed the Proposed Merger, which may adversely affect us.\nThe combined company will require significant liquidity to fund CEOC's emergence from Chapter 11 and to achieve successful integration and achieve targeted synergies post-closing.\nAt emergence from Chapter 11, CEOC will be required to or may deem it advisable to settle in cash certain obligations (such as professional fees, certain accrued and unpaid interest and debt obligations) that matured during the Chapter 11 bankruptcy cases. Additionally, under the now confirmed CEOC restructuring plan, Caesars Entertainment will be required to (i) contribute over $400 million to pay a forbearance fee, for general corporate purposes and to fund sources and uses and (ii) purchase up to approximately $1.2 billion of new equity in the restructured CEOC and its subsidiaries. As a result of these payments and investments, Caesars Entertainment may have less cash available in future periods for investments and operating expenses and, as a result, the confirmation of the CEOC reorganization plan and emergence of CEOC from bankruptcy may have a negative impact on the combined company and on its ability to sustain its operations. An order approving the disclosure statement and an order approving solicitation procedures for creditors to vote on the third amended joint plan of reorganization were both approved on June 28, 2016. On October 19, 2016, the objection and voting deadline for the third amended joint plan of reorganization was scheduled for November 21, 2016. The confirmation hearing for the third amended joint plan was held on January 17, 2017, where the Bankruptcy Court confirmed the CEOC restructuring plan. CEOC believes that the restructuring plan may become effective as early as May 2017.\nWhile the Proposed Merger with CEC is pending, we are subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions that could disrupt our business.\nWe have experienced and, whether or not the pending Proposed Merger with CEC is completed, we may continue to experience disruption of our current plans and operations due to the pending Proposed Merger, which could have an adverse effect on our business and financial results. Our employees and other key personnel may have uncertainties about the effect of the pending Proposed Merger, and those uncertainties may impact our ability to retain, recruit and hire key personnel while the Proposed Merger is pending or if it is not consummated. To date, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, significant costs, expenses and fees for professional services and other transaction costs in connection with the Proposed Merger with CEC, and these fees and costs are payable by us whether or not the Proposed Merger is consummated. Furthermore, we cannot predict how our suppliers and customers will view or react to the Proposed Merger, and some may be hesitant to do business with us in light of uncertainties about our ability to perform due to the proposed acquisition of us by CEC. If we are unable to reassure our customers and suppliers to continue transacting business with us, whether or not the Proposed Merger is consummated, our financial results may be adversely affected.\nUnder the terms of the Amended Merger Agreement, we are required to operate our business in the ordinary course, and we are also subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to the consummation of the Proposed Merger without the consent of CEC, including, among other things, certain restrictions on our ability to enter new lines of business; make certain investments and acquisitions; sell, transfer, lease, dispose of or grant our assets; enter into certain contracts; incur indebtedness; and make certain capital expenditures. These restrictions, which could be in place for an extended period of time if the consummation of the Proposed Merger is delayed, could prevent us from pursuing otherwise attractive business opportunities, result in our inability to respond effectively to competitive pressures, industry developments and future opportunities and may otherwise harm our business, financial results and operations.\nIn the event that the pending Proposed Merger with CEC is not completed, the trading price of our common stock and our future business and financial results may be negatively impacted.\nAs noted above, the conditions to the completion of the Proposed Merger with CEC may not be satisfied, and even if the CEOC restructuring plan confirmed by the bankruptcy court contains such Debtor Release, Third-Party Release and Exculpation, under certain circumstances the Exchange Ratio may be adjusted or the Amended Merger Agreement may be terminated. If the Proposed Merger with CEC is not completed for any reason, we would still be liable for significant transaction costs and the focus of our management would have been diverted from seeking other potential opportunities without realizing any benefits of the completed Proposed Merger. If we do not complete the Proposed Merger, certain litigation against us such as the Debtor Release and the Third Party Release will remain outstanding and not be released. Furthermore, if we do not complete the Proposed Merger, it is possible that CEOC or its creditors could institute additional litigation against us, asserting claims\nsuch as those identified in the examiner's report. If we do not complete the Proposed Merger, the price of our common stock may decline significantly from the current market price, which may reflect a market assumption that the Proposed Merger will be completed.\nIf the Proposed Merger is not completed or we are not otherwise acquired, we may consider other strategic alternatives, which are subject to risks and uncertainties.\nIf the Proposed Merger with CEC is not completed, our Board will review and consider various alternatives available to us, including, among others, continuing as a public company with no material changes to our business or capital structure or other alternative transactions. Any alternative transaction may involve various additional risks to our business, including, among others, distraction of our management team and associated expenses similar to those described above in connection with the Proposed Merger, our ability to consummate an alternative transaction, the valuation assigned to our business in the alternative transaction, our ability or a potential buyer's ability to access capital on acceptable terms or at all and other variables that may adversely affect our operations.\nWe are subject to litigation initiated in connection with the Proposed Merger, which could be time consuming and divert the resources and the attention of management.\nCAC and the individual members of our Board have been named as defendants in certain lawsuits relating to the Amended Merger Agreement and the Proposed Merger, and may be named in additional lawsuits relating to the Amended Merger Agreement and the Proposed Merger. The lawsuit filed to date generally alleges that the directors breached their fiduciary duties by engaging in a flawed sales process, by approving an inadequate price, and by agreeing to provisions that would allegedly preclude another interested buyer from making a financially superior proposal to acquire the company. The lawsuit filed to date was dismissed without prejudice for lack of prosecution on October 13, 2016. On November 14, 2016, the deadline to seek reinstatement of that lawsuit lapsed, without action by the plaintiff. The defense of any such lawsuits, and any additional lawsuits relating to the Amended Merger Agreement and the Proposed Merger, may be expensive and may divert management's attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition.\nThe Proposed Merger may be completed on terms different than those contained in the Amended Merger Agreement.\nPrior to the completion of the Proposed Merger, the parties may, by their mutual agreement, amend or alter the terms of the Amended Merger Agreement, including with respect to, among other things, the merger consideration to be received by our stockholders or any covenants or agreements with respect to the parties' respective operations pending completion of the Proposed Merger. In addition, either party may choose to waive certain requirements of the Amended Merger Agreement, including some conditions to closing the Proposed Merger. Any such amendments, alterations or waivers may have negative consequences to the other parties or their respective stockholders, including the possibility that consideration paid in the Proposed Merger may be reduced.\nOur stockholders cannot be certain of the date they will receive the merger consideration or of the aggregate value of the merger consideration they will receive.\nThe date that our stockholders will receive the merger consideration depends on the completion date of the Proposed Merger, which is uncertain. In no event will the Proposed Merger be completed later than December 31, 2017 unless CAC and CEC otherwise agree. The date that the Proposed Merger becomes effective may be later than the date of the special meeting of our stockholders to approve the Proposed Merger, and at the time of our special meeting, our stockholders will not know the exact market value of the CEC common stock that they will receive upon completion of the Proposed Merger. The dollar value of the consideration received by our stockholders will depend upon the market value of CEC common stock at the effective time of the Proposed Merger, and such dollar value may be different from, and lower than, the dollar value of the merger consideration today or the date of the special meeting of our stockholders to approve the Proposed Merger.\nCIE has a significant amount of cash held in escrow, and it is unclear whether and to what extent such cash will be released.\nIn connection with the RSAs, the amended and restated restructuring support agreement that we entered into with CEOC and the agreement for the sale of CIE's social and mobile games business, we entered into the CIE Proceeds and Reservation of Rights Agreement on September 9, 2016, with CIE, CEC and CEOC (the \"CIE Proceeds Agreement\"), pursuant to which CIE deposited into an escrow account $2.7 billion of the proceeds received from the sale of its social and mobile games business. The proceeds may only be released in accordance with the terms set forth in the CIE Proceeds Agreement, with the joint written consent of CIE and CEOC or pursuant to an order of a court of competent jurisdiction. As of December 31, 2016, $62.7 million has been distributed from the escrow account pursuant to the terms of the CIE Proceeds Agreement. The CIE Proceeds Agreement provides, that at the request of CIE, proceeds may be released to CAC or CGP LLC in the event that there is a full and final release, or a dismissal in full with prejudice of the claims for actual and constructive fraudulent conveyances and transfers against CAC, CIE, the purchaser of the social and mobile games business, or the company or any of the subsidiaries acquired by such purchaser (\"Caesar Claims\"), on the August 9, 2016 suit filed by CEOC, or if there is a judgment in such proceedings and such judgment has been satisfied in full by CAC and CIE, or a plan of reorganization for CEOC which\nprovides that CAC, CIE, such purchaser, such purchaser's acquired company and any of its subsidiaries are fully and finally released of all liability arising for such Caesar Claims. Upon consummation of the CEOC restructuring plan confirmed on January 17, 2017, it is anticipated that the funds in the CIE Escrow Account, as defined in Note 3 - Development, Acquisition and Divestiture Activity to the CGP LLC Combined and Consolidated Financial Statements in Exhibit 99.1, will be released. We cannot provide assurance as to when the CEOC restructuring plan will be consummated.\nIn addition, CIE placed $264.0 million into escrow (the \"Indemnity Escrow\") to secure the potential indemnity claims of Purchaser for a period of twelve months from the SMG Business Sale Closing date pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement. During the fourth quarter of 2016, upon finalization of the purchase price adjustment pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, CIE paid $4.5 million to Purchaser from the Indemnity Escrow account. At December 31, 2016, the remaining balance in the Indemnity Escrow was $259.5 million, which is included as short-term Restricted cash on CGP LLC's Consolidated Balance Sheet. There have been no claims made against the Indemnity Escrow account. It is unclear whether and to what extent the funds in the Indemnity Escrow will be released.\nRisks Related to CGP LLC's Continued Dependence on Caesars Entertainment and CES\nCAC and CGP LLC (including CGPH) are dependent on CES, CEOC and its subsidiaries to provide corporate services, back-office support and business advisory services through the CGP LLC Management Services Agreement and the Omnibus Agreement. CAC and CGP LLC cannot operate without the services provided by subsidiaries of Caesars Entertainment and will be adversely affected if either the CGP LLC Management Services Agreement or Omnibus Agreement is terminated.\nCES, a services joint venture among CEOC, CERP, a subsidiary of CEC, and CGPH, (together the \"Members\" and each a \"Member\") manages our properties and provides us with access to Caesars Entertainment's management expertise, intellectual property, back office services and Total Rewards loyalty program. Pursuant to the CGP LLC Management Services Agreement, CEOC and its subsidiaries provide certain corporate services, back-office support and business advisory services to CAC and CGP LLC, however, generally, the services that would otherwise be performed under the CGP LLC Management Services Agreement are now performed by CES pursuant to other arrangements. Additionally, pursuant to the Omnibus License and Enterprise Services Agreement (the \"Omnibus Agreement\"), CES provides, among other services, corporate services and back-office support to CGPH. Moreover, CES provides management services to CGP LLC owned casinos. CAC and CGP LLC have a very short history of operating casinos and interactive entertainment. Therefore, the business and operations of CAC and CGP LLC are dependent on the services provided by Caesars Entertainment and its subsidiaries, and CAC and CGP LLC cannot operate without these services. If the quality of the services provided by Caesars Entertainment and its subsidiaries deteriorates, or if the terms under which Caesars Entertainment and its subsidiaries provide such services change in a manner that is adverse to CGP LLC, it could have a material adverse effect on CAC and CGP LLC's business, financial condition and operating results.\nIn addition, if the CGP LLC Management Services Agreement or the Omnibus Agreement were to be terminated and not replaced, or if Caesars Entertainment or its subsidiaries were to suffer significant liquidity or operational difficulties, becoming incapable of providing support and management services (or unable to provide such services at agreed upon levels) to CAC or CGP LLC or cease operations altogether, CAC and/or CGP LLC would no longer have access to the operational support and management expertise provided by Caesars Entertainment and its subsidiaries and it could have a material adverse effect on CAC and CGP LLC's business, financial condition and operating results. The management of Caesars Entertainment has concluded that, due to the material uncertainty related to certain of the litigation proceedings against Caesars Entertainment, as more fully described in Item 3. Legal Proceedings - CEOC Bondholder Litigation, or Noteholder Disputes, there is substantial doubt about Caesars Entertainment's ability to continue as a going concern. Adverse rulings may result in reinstatement of the CEC guarantee of certain CEOC debt which could increase the risk the conditions to consummation of the Proposed Merger are not satisfied. Adverse rulings may also result in the possibility that Caesars Entertainment enters bankruptcy or is unable to continue as a going concern.\nIf Caesars Entertainment were unable to continue as a going concern, CERP and CEOC, as subsidiaries of Caesars Entertainment, could be unable to provide CES with their respective contributions to CES's operating funds and capital, which would also render CES incapable of providing us with the support and management services we require. In addition, if CES were to become a debtor in a bankruptcy case, it may seek bankruptcy court approval to assume the Omnibus Agreement or the management agreements under the Bankruptcy Code, to assign such agreements to a third party or to reject such agreements. See \"Our operations depend on material contracts with third parties, including Caesars Entertainment, the continued enforcement of which may be adversely impacted by a bankruptcy of Caesars Entertainment or CES.\" Any failure by CAC or CGP LLC to obtain the operational and management support of Caesars Entertainment and its subsidiaries, and particularly any failure by CGP LLC to obtain Caesars Entertainment's expertise in operating casinos or maintaining access to the Total Rewards loyalty program, would adversely affect CAC and/or CGP LLC's business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe do not control CES, and the interests of our co-investors may not align with our interests.\nCEOC, CERP and CGPH are members of CES, and CGPH and its subsidiaries rely on CES to provide it with intellectual property licenses and property management services, among other services. Each member of CES is required to\ncontribute as necessary to fund CES's operating costs and capital requirements in accordance with the terms of the operating agreement that governs CES. The amount CGPH will be required to fund in the future may be greater than its initial contribution, and will be subject to the review and approval of the CES steering committee. CGPH, CEOC and CERP control CES through its steering committee, which is comprised of one representative from each of CGPH, CEOC and CERP. In the event that CGPH's interests do not align with those of CEOC or CERP, the interests of CEOC or CERP may be met before CGPH. In addition, certain decisions by CES may not be made without unanimous consent of the members, including CGPH. These actions include any decision with respect to liquidation or dissolution of CES, merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all the assets of CES, usage of CES assets in a manner inconsistent with the purposes of CES, material amendment to CES's operating agreement, admission of new investors to CES and filing of any bankruptcy or similar action by CES. Thus, any Member may block those actions requiring unanimous consent of the Members notwithstanding that such actions are in our interest. As a result of an annual review undertaken in September 2015 but effective July 2015, the allocation percentages of CEOC, CERP and CGPH were revised to 65.4%, 21.8% and 12.8%, respectively. CGPH has notified CES, CEOC and CERP that it objected to the September 2015 expense allocation but would pay the revised expense allocations under protest and reserved all rights. As a result of an annual review undertaken in August 2016 but effective January 2017, the allocation percentages for CEOC, CERP and CGPH were revised to 62.9%, 22.9% and 14.2%, respectively. CGPH has notified CES, CEOC and CERP that it objects to the August 2016 expense allocation but will pay the revised expense allocations under protest and reserves all rights.\nCGP LLC is dependent on the expertise of Caesars Entertainment's and CES senior management, who may not be directly invested in CGP LLC's success, which may have an adverse effect on CGP LLC and/or CAC's business, financial condition and operating results.\nCGP LLC relies a great deal on the expertise and guidance of Caesars Entertainment's senior management who do not receive direct compensation from CGP LLC. As a result, Caesars Entertainment's senior management may devote substantially less time to the business and operations of CGP LLC than were they to be employed by CGP LLC. Senior management that is not invested in the success of CGP LLC's business may have an adverse effect on CGP LLC and/or CAC's business, financial condition and operating results.\nLoss of the services of any key personnel from Caesars Entertainment or CES could have a material adverse effect on the business of CGP LLC.\nThe leadership of Caesars Entertainment's and CES' senior management has been a critical element of Caesars Entertainment's success. The advisory and management services provided to CGP LLC depend on this senior management. The death or disability of, or other extended or permanent loss of services, or any negative market or industry perception of Caesars Entertainment's or CES' senior management could have a material adverse effect on CGP LLC's business. CGP LLC is not protected by key man insurance or similar life insurance covering members of Caesars Entertainment's senior management, nor does CGP LLC have employment agreements with any of Caesars Entertainment's senior management.\nA default by Caesars Entertainment on certain of its debt obligations could adversely affect CGP LLC's business, financial condition and operating results.\nCaesars Entertainment (including its consolidated subsidiaries) is a highly leveraged company and has pledged a significant portion of its assets and the assets of its subsidiaries as collateral under certain of its debt obligations, including the trademarks for which CIE has licensed the right to use, including \"Caesars,\" \"Total Rewards\" and \"Harrah's.\" The stock of CEOC is also pledged to secure these debt obligations. CEOC and its subsidiaries that are the owners of these trademarks filed for bankruptcy in January 2015. If Caesars Entertainment or its subsidiaries were to default on these obligations, its lenders could exercise significant influence over CGP LLC's business. CGP LLC is dependent on a number of services from Caesars Entertainment, CEOC, CES and other subsidiaries of Caesars Entertainment, pursuant to the CGP LLC Management Services Agreement, the Omnibus Agreement and CIE's Shared Services Agreement. If Caesars Entertainment and/or its subsidiaries file for bankruptcy protection under the U.S. bankruptcy code, their filing may materially and adversely affect CGP LLC's assets and operations. For example, in the event of a default by Caesars Entertainment, its lenders or their successors may elect to reject the CGP LLC Management Services Agreement or the Omnibus Agreement as an executory contract in a bankruptcy proceeding. Furthermore, in the event of such a default, Caesars Entertainment's lenders also may seek to reject CIE's cross marketing and trademark license agreement with Caesars Entertainment in connection with a bankruptcy proceeding and, as a result, CIE would no longer have licenses to use certain trademarks owned by Caesars Entertainment or its subsidiaries. The result of this influence and any related disruption in CGP LLC's business could have a material adverse effect on CGP LLC's business, financial condition and operating results. Recent litigation against CEC may increase the risk these events occur. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings - CEOC Bondholder Litigation, or Noteholder Disputes.\nWe attribute no value to the CEOC Notes held by CAC and such attribution could adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock.\nAs a result of a pro rata dividend distribution to its members on 2014, CAC received $137.5 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.50% senior notes previously issued by CEOC, which matured on June 1, 2016, and $151.4 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.75% senior notes, maturing October 1, 2017. Under the CEOC restructuring plan confirmed on January 17, 2017, CAC receives no recovery for any of the CEOC Notes held by it, and CAC has written down the full value of such CEOC Notes for the calendar year 2016. Accordingly, we attribute no value to the CEOC Notes held by CAC and such attribution could adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock.\nCGP LLC has an obligation to give a right of first refusal for any development opportunities to Caesars Entertainment, but Caesars Entertainment has no obligation to give any development opportunities to CGP LLC. Caesars Entertainment may keep all potential development opportunities for itself. CGP LLC would need to rely on a separate party to pursue any opportunities without the approval and assistance of Caesars Entertainment.\nPursuant to the CGP Operating Agreement, CGP LLC is required to first provide any potential development opportunities to Caesars Entertainment to be considered by a committee of the Caesars Entertainment board of directors comprised of disinterested directors. CGP LLC can only proceed with such investment or opportunity to the extent such Caesars Entertainment committee declines the opportunity for itself or CEOC. If the committee provides an opportunity to CGP LLC, we expect that CGP LLC will retain a 50% interest in the management fee to be received by Caesars Entertainment, unless otherwise agreed. However, because each opportunity will be negotiated as a separate transaction, there can be no assurances that CGP LLC and Caesars Entertainment will share equally (or that CGP LLC will share at all) in the management fee. If the committee does not provide the opportunity to CGP LLC, the committee can also decide to keep the opportunity for Caesars Entertainment. No assurances can be provided that the committee will ever provide an opportunity to CGP LLC.\nAlthough certain employees of Apollo Global Management, LLC (\"Apollo\") and TPG Global, LLC (\"TPG\" and, together with Apollo, the \"Sponsors\") are on the boards of directors of Caesars Entertainment and CAC, the certificates of incorporation of both companies provide that neither the Sponsors nor directors have any obligation to present any corporate opportunity to Caesars Entertainment or CAC. Accordingly, the Sponsors may pursue gaming, entertainment or other activities outside of Caesars Entertainment or CAC and have no obligation to present such opportunity to Caesars Entertainment or CAC; however, if any choose to present such opportunity to Caesars Entertainment or CAC, then such opportunity must follow the rights of first offer.\nIf the committee declines an opportunity altogether and CGP LLC pursues the opportunity without the support of Caesars Entertainment, CGP LLC will be required to identify and obtain the necessary services from a third-party. No assurances can be provided that CGP LLC will be able to find a third-party to pursue an opportunity without Caesars Entertainment and any services provided may be more expensive than, or of less quality than, those that are provided by Caesars Entertainment, and as a result, could have a material adverse impact on the success of the opportunity.\nCaesars Entertainment's interests may conflict with CGP LLC's interests.\nThe interests of Caesars Entertainment could conflict with CGP LLC's interests. Caesars Entertainment is in a casino and entertainment business similar to CGP LLC and may, from time to time in the future, pursue for itself acquisitions that would be complementary to CGP LLC's business, in which case, and as a result, those acquisition opportunities would not be available to us. Without access to acquisition opportunities, CGP LLC will be limited in growing its business.\nThe success of CGP LLC's business depends in part on its continued participation in Caesars' Total Rewards loyalty program. If casinos owned by CGP LLC are unable to access the Total Rewards loyalty program database, it could have a material adverse impact on CGP LLC's business.\nThe success of CGP LLC's business depends in part on its ability to direct targeted marketing efforts to important casino and hospitality customers. The ability of CGP LLC's business to undertake those marketing efforts depends to a significant extent on its continued participation in the Total Rewards loyalty program owned and maintained by CEOC and its subsidiaries, and following its commencement of operations, licensed to CES. In connection with this program, the casinos owned by CGP LLC can develop information which allows them to track casino play and award complimentaries and other promotional opportunities to their customers. Complimentaries and other similar rewards are customarily offered by casino and gaming facilities to their customers and are important incentives to those customers. If the casinos owned by CGP LLC are unable to access the Total Rewards loyalty program database, it could have a material adverse impact on CGP LLC's business. Participation in the Total Rewards loyalty program is one of our competitive strengths and our business and growth strategy are, in part, based on tracked play and targeted marketing efforts.\nIn the past, the removal of the Total Rewards loyalty program from a casino property has resulted in negative impacts on such property's financial results. Similarly, if we are unable to access the Total Rewards loyalty program database, we expect our annual revenue would decline, which could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nCIE and CGP LLC license their right to use and sublicense various trademarks and service marks from Caesars Entertainment and certain of its affiliates. Accordingly, if a third-party successfully challenges Caesars Entertainment or its affiliates' ownership of, or right to use, the Caesars-related marks or if CIE or CGP LLC is unable to stop unauthorized use of such marks, or if Caesars Entertainment or its affiliates use such marks in a way that negatively impacts the value of such marks, CIE's and CGP LLC's business or results of operations could be harmed.\nCIE and CGP LLC have licensed the right to use certain trademarks and service marks owned or used by various affiliates of Caesars Entertainment, including Caesars World, Inc., Caesars License Company, LLC and CEOC. These licensed trademarks and service marks include, among others, \"Caesars,\" \"Harrah's,\" and \"Total Rewards.\" CGP LLC's rights to use these trademarks and service marks are among its most valuable assets. Caesars World, Inc., Caesars License Company, LLC and CEOC filed for bankruptcy protection in January 2015, as more fully discussed in the risk factor above entitled \"A default by Caesars Entertainment on certain of its debt obligations could adversely affect CGP LLC's business, financial condition and operating results.\"\nIf the existing licensing arrangements were terminated and CGP LLC fails to enter into new arrangements in respect of these marks, CGP LLC could lose their rights to use these marks and the corresponding domain names, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and operating results. If a third-party successfully challenges Caesars Entertainment or its affiliates' ownership of, or right to use, these marks (including, for example, due to Caesars Entertainment or its affiliates' failure to file for protection of such marks), such a challenge could also have a material adverse effect on CIE's, and therefore CGP LLC's, business, financial condition and operating results.\nIn addition, these trademarks and service marks are used by Caesars Entertainment and its affiliates around the United States and internationally. Any negative events associated with the use of these marks by Caesars Entertainment or its affiliates may be out of CGP LLC's control, and may negatively impact the \"Caesars,\" \"Harrah's\" or \"Total Rewards\" brands, which could harm CGP LLC's business and results of operations.\nFailure by CES or CEOC and its subsidiaries to protect the trademarks, technology and other intellectual property that CGP LLC uses could have a negative impact on the value of CGPH's brand names and adversely affect our business. In addition, CES or CEOC and its subsidiaries may have the right to limit the expansion of scope or usage of our intellectual property.\nCGP LLC currently licenses from CES and CEOC and its subsidiaries, intellectual property and technology material to its overall business strategy, and CGP LLC regards such intellectual property and technology to be an important element of its success. CGP LLC relies on CES and CEOC and its subsidiaries to seek to establish and maintain proprietary rights in such intellectual property and technology through the use of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secret laws. In addition, CGP LLC relies on CES and CEOC and its subsidiaries to maintain the trade secrets and confidential information licensed to CGP LLC by nondisclosure policies and through the use of appropriate confidentiality agreements. Despite these efforts to protect the proprietary rights on which CGP LLC relies, parties may infringe such intellectual property and use licensed information and technology that CGP LLC regards as proprietary and CGPH's rights may be invalidated or unenforceable. Monitoring the unauthorized use of CGP LLC's licensed intellectual property and technology is difficult. Litigation by CEOC and its subsidiaries or CES, as applicable, may be necessary to enforce the intellectual property rights and other rights on which we rely or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Litigation of this type could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources. We cannot assure you that all of the steps that CGP LLC, CEOC and its subsidiaries or CES have taken or will take to protect the licensed trademarks that CGP LLC uses in the United States will be adequate to prevent imitation of such trademarks by others. The unauthorized use or reproduction of the trademarks that CGPH uses could diminish the value of its brand and its market acceptance, competitive advantages or goodwill, which could adversely affect its business. In addition, the expansion of the scope or use of CGP LLC's intellectual property licensed from CEOC or CES, as applicable, in many cases is subject to the consent of CEOC or CES. Accordingly, CGP LLC may not be able to take advantage of new applications or uses of these licensed trade names, trademarks or other intellectual property without the consent of CEOC or CES, which may adversely affect CGP LLC's ability to compete or expand its business scope.\nCIE may be reliant on Caesars Entertainment or CEOC to obtain online gaming licenses in many commercial jurisdictions and if the affiliation is terminated, or costs to maintain such affiliation exceed revenue generated from such affiliation, it would adversely affect CIE's, and therefore CGP LLC's, business and results of operations.\nNevada, Delaware and New Jersey have enacted laws that require online casinos to also have a license to operate a brick-and-mortar casino, either directly or indirectly through an affiliate. If, like Nevada, Delaware and New Jersey, other U.S. jurisdictions enact legislation legalizing real money casino gaming subject to this brick-and-mortar requirement, CIE may be unable to offer online real money gaming in such jurisdictions if CIE does not have or is unable to establish an affiliation with a brick-and-mortar casino in such jurisdiction. If CIE is able to offer online real money gaming in such jurisdictions because of CIE's affiliation with Caesars Entertainment or CEOC, CIE will be reliant on continuing its relationship with Caesars Entertainment or CEOC, and there can be no assurances that Caesars Entertainment or CEOC will continue to maintain such affiliation. If CIE's affiliation with Caesars Entertainment or CEOC is terminated or the costs to maintain such affiliation exceed\nrevenue generated from online real money gaming, it would adversely affect CIE's, and therefore CGP LLC's, business and results of operations.\nA bankruptcy court may conclude that each of the formation transactions and the Asset Purchase Transactions constitutes a financing rather than a true sale, and as a result we would no longer have ownership and control over assets sold or contributed to CGP LLC to the same extent as we do now.\nCaesars Entertainment and its consolidated subsidiaries, as well as CEOC and its consolidated subsidiaries, have reported significant net losses during the past three fiscal years. In a bankruptcy of Caesars Entertainment or any of its subsidiaries (such as the bankruptcy proceeding of CEOC and certain of its subsidiaries that was filed in January 2015) that sold or contributed assets to CGP LLC, including CEOC, the court may conclude that each of the formation transactions and the Asset Purchase Transactions constitutes a disguised financing rather than a true sale. In such case, the court would deem CGP LLC's assets as belonging to Caesars Entertainment, and consider us to be a lender to Caesars Entertainment or its subsidiaries to the extent of the purchase price CGP LLC paid for those assets. While we should have a claim against Caesars Entertainment and its subsidiaries for the amounts paid to them for the assets, we would no longer have ownership and control over the assets to the same extent as we do now. Moreover, if our claim against Caesars Entertainment and its subsidiaries is considered a financing, no guarantee exists that our claim will be deemed a secured claim entitled to a priority right of repayment from the assets, rather than a general unsecured claim against Caesars Entertainment's or CEOC's bankruptcy estate that shares pro rata with other creditors in any recovery from the residual value of the bankruptcy estate. Finally, a risk exists that any such claim might be primed in favor of a debtor-in-possession financing, or that the court might equitably subordinate our claim to those of other creditors, recharacterize the claim as equity or otherwise not allow the claim (including on equitable grounds).\nA bankruptcy court may substantively consolidate the bankruptcy estates of Caesars Entertainment and its debtor subsidiaries with CGP LLC, which would, among other things, allow the creditors of the bankrupt entities to satisfy their claims from the combined assets of the consolidated entities, including CGP LLC.\nEven though CGP LLC has certain bankruptcy remote features that restrict its ability to file for bankruptcy relief, there can be no assurance that a bankruptcy court will not direct CGP LLC's or any of its subsidiaries' substantive consolidation with Caesars Entertainment or a subsidiary of Caesars Entertainment in a bankruptcy case of Caesars Entertainment (including the pending bankruptcy of CEOC and certain of its subsidiaries filed in January 2015) or such subsidiary even if CGP LLC or its subsidiaries do not themselves file a bankruptcy petition. CGP LLC's or its subsidiaries' substantive consolidation with Caesars Entertainment or its subsidiaries in their bankruptcy cases would, among other things, allow the creditors of the bankrupt entities to satisfy their claims from the combined assets of the consolidated entities, including CGP LLC and its subsidiaries. This may dilute the value of distributions available for recovery to CGP LLC's creditors, and may prevent recovery by our stockholders of any value at all if the combined creditor claims exceed the combined value of the entities. In addition, substantive consolidation with Caesars Entertainment or its subsidiaries' bankruptcies may subject our assets and operations to the automatic stay, and may impair CGP LLC's ability to operate independently, as well as otherwise restrict our operations and capacity to function as a standalone enterprise.\nAn independent investigation of the formation transactions and the Asset Purchase Transactions in connection with CEOC's bankruptcy is currently ongoing, which will expose our and CGP LLC's contractual relationships with Caesars Entertainment and its subsidiaries to heightened scrutiny.\nThe Bankruptcy Court previously engaged an independent examiner to investigate possible claims CEOC might have against CEC, CAC, CGP LLC, other entities and certain individuals. On March 15, 2016, the examiner released his report in redacted form (to the public) and in unredacted form (to certain entities and individuals). On May 16, 2016, the examiner issued a substantially unredacted version of his report. CAC, CGP LLC and CIE do not have access to the unredacted report, and accordingly the description below is based on the substantially unredacted publicly-available report.\nThe examiner's report identifies a variety of potential claims against CAC, CGP LLC, CIE, other entities and certain individuals related to a number of transactions dating back to 2009. Most of the examiner's findings are based on his view that CEOC was \"insolvent\" at the time of the applicable transactions. The examiner's report includes his conclusions on the relative strength of these possible claims, many of which are described in Note 6 of the Notes to Financial Statements. The examiner calculates an estimated range of potential damages for these potential claims as against all parties from $3.6 billion to $5.1 billion. The examiner calculates an estimated range of potential damages for potential claims against CAC, CGP LLC and CIE from $1.7 billion to $2.3 billion, ignoring potential duplication of recovery from other defendants. Neither calculation takes into account probability of success, likelihood of collection, or the time or cost of litigation.\nAlthough this report was prepared at the request of the Bankruptcy Court, none of the findings are legally binding on the Bankruptcy Court or any party. CAC, CGP LLC and CIE contest many of the examiner's findings, including his finding that CEOC did not receive fair value for assets transferred, any suggestion that certain of the potential claims against CAC, CGP LLC and CIE have merit, and his calculation of potential damages. CAC, CGP LLC and its subsidiaries believe that each of the\ndisputed transactions involving them provided substantial value to CEOC that was reasonably equivalent to the value of the asset(s) transferred, and that they at all times acted in good faith.\nOn June 28, 2016, an order approving the disclosure statement and an order approving solicitation procedures for creditors to vote on the third amended joint plan of reorganization were entered in the bankruptcy court. On October 19, 2016, the objection and voting deadline for the third amended joint plan of reorganization was scheduled for November 21, 2016. The confirmation hearing for the third amended joint plan was held on January 17, 2017, where the Bankruptcy Court confirmed the CEOC restructuring plan. CEOC believes that the restructuring plan may become effective as early as May 2017.\nWe are subject to fraudulent transfer litigation that, if adversely decided, may require us to return the assets acquired in the formation transactions and the Asset Purchase Transactions, or their value, to Caesars Entertainment and its subsidiaries.\nCreditors of Caesars Entertainment and its subsidiaries have sued CAC and CGP LLC under state law in an effort to recover, for their benefit, the assets CGP LLC acquired in the formation transactions and the Asset Purchase Transactions as fraudulent transfers. See Item 3. Legal Proceedings - CEOC Bondholder Litigation, or Noteholder Disputes for a discussion of these proceedings. As a general matter, fraudulent transfer law allows a creditor to recover assets, or their value, from an initial or subsequent transferee if the debtor conveyed the assets with an actual intent to hinder, delay or defraud its creditors, or if the transfer was a constructive fraudulent transfer. The principal elements of a constructive fraudulent transfer are a transfer, made while a debtor was insolvent or that rendered a debtor insolvent, for less than reasonably equivalent value.\nCAC and CGP LLC strongly believe there is no merit to the actions described in Item 3. Legal Proceedings - CEOC Bondholder Litigation, or Noteholder Disputes and CAC and CGP LLC will defend themselves vigorously and seek appropriate relief should any action be brought. However, in the CEOC Bondholder Litigation, or Noteholder Disputes, plaintiffs seek, among other remedies, return to CEOC of six casino properties CGP LLC acquired in the formation transactions and the Asset Purchase Transactions for approximately $3.1 billion in cash and assumed debt. The six casino properties acquired in the formation transactions and the Asset Purchase Transactions are the only casino properties owned by CGP LLC and account for 100% of CGP LLC's revenue from casino operations. If CAC and CGP LLC lose the lawsuits described above, they may have to return the assets or their value to Caesars Entertainment and its subsidiaries, or be forced to pay additional amounts therefor. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2016, revenue from casino operations accounted for 97.3% of CGP LLC's total net revenue. If CGP LLC were forced to return the casino properties to Caesars Entertainment and its subsidiaries, that could cause it to lose the benefit of substantial revenue generated by those properties. Additionally, if a court were to find that the transfers and sales in the formation transactions and the Asset Purchase Transactions were improper, that could trigger a default under the debt that we raised to finance these transfers. These consequences could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nCES may be subject to fraudulent transfer or other litigation that may result in its unwinding, or its licensing agreements with CEOC may otherwise be rescinded or terminated.\nCreditors of Caesars Entertainment, CEOC and their subsidiaries may commence an action against CES under state or federal bankruptcy law in an effort to rescind, avoid or otherwise terminate, for their benefit, the licensing agreements CEOC entered into with CES. Alternatively, as CEOC and certain of its subsidiaries has filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, they may reject their licensing agreements with CES. If CES can no longer enforce such licensing agreements, it may be unable to perform under its licensing agreements with CGP LLC and its subsidiaries. As a result, among other things, CGP LLC and its subsidiaries may no longer have access to the Total Rewards loyalty program and may no longer be able to use certain intellectual property, such as the Caesars trademark, which could have a material adverse effect on CAC and CGP LLC's business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur operations depend on material contracts with third parties, including Caesars Entertainment, the continued enforcement of which may be adversely impacted by a bankruptcy of Caesars Entertainment or CES.\nA debtor operating under the protection of the Bankruptcy Code may exercise certain rights that may adversely affect our contractual relations and ability to participate in the Caesars Entertainment system. For example, the protection of the statutory automatic stay which arises by operation of Section 362 of the Bankruptcy Code upon the commencement of a bankruptcy case prohibits us from terminating a contract with CEOC or any of its debtor subsidiaries. The Bankruptcy Code also invalidates clauses that permit the termination of contracts automatically upon the filing by one of the parties of a bankruptcy petition or which are conditioned on a party's insolvency. Meanwhile in this circumstance, we would ordinarily be required to continue performing our obligations under such agreement. As a practical matter, legal proceedings to obtain relief from the automatic stay and to enforce rights to payments or terminate agreements can be time consuming, costly and uncertain as to outcome.\nIn addition, under Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code, a debtor may decide whether to assume or reject an executory contract, including the CGP LLC Management Services Agreement, the management contracts for all of the casino properties owned by CGP LLC, the shared service agreement with CIE, or any licensing agreement with CES. Assumption of a contract\nwould permit the debtor to continue operating under the assumed contract; provided that the debtor (i) immediately cures all existing defaults thereunder or provides adequate assurance that such defaults will be promptly cured, (ii) compensates the non-debtor party for any actual monetary loss incurred as a result of the debtor's default or provides adequate assurance that such compensation will be forthcoming and (iii) provides the non-debtor party with adequate assurance of future performance under the contract. As a general matter, a bankruptcy court approves a debtor's assumption of a contract as long as assumption appears to be in the best interest of the debtor's estate, the debtor is able to perform and it is a good business decision to assume the contract. Subject to bankruptcy court approval and satisfaction of the \"business judgment\" rule, a debtor in Chapter 11 may reject an executory contract, and rejection of an executory contract in a Chapter 7 case may occur automatically by operation of law. If a debtor rejects an executory contract, the non-debtor party to the contract generally has an unsecured claim against the debtor's bankruptcy estate for breach of contract damages arising from the rejection. On request of any party to such contract, a bankruptcy court may order the debtor to determine within a specific period of time whether to assume or reject an executory contract.\nFurther, CEOC and its subsidiaries that filed for bankruptcy protection, as debtors, may seek bankruptcy court approval to assume material contracts, including among others, the CGP LLC Management Services Agreement, the Omnibus Agreement, the CIE Cross-Marketing Agreement or other valuable license agreements under Section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code and may also seek to assign such agreement to a third-party. A debtor may also seek to reject such contracts. If CEOC, for example, rejects the Omnibus Agreement, CES may not be able to provide us operational support and management expertise, with the result that we may lack sufficient support to manage our operations, and may no longer be able to use certain licensed intellectual property, such as certain trademarks.\nIn addition, Caesars Entertainment, if it were to become a debtor for a bankruptcy, may attempt to reject the CGP Operating Agreement as an executory contract. This might affect our continued existence and other corporate governance rights. It may also relieve Caesars Entertainment from performing its obligations under CGP LLC's limited liability company agreement, including honoring its obligations under the liquidation right and call right.\nClaims of our stockholders and CGP LLC against Caesars Entertainment or CEOC in a Caesars Entertainment or CEOC bankruptcy might be equitably subordinated or disallowed.\nBankruptcy law allows the court to equitably subordinate claims to those of other creditors or equity holders based on inequitable conduct. A bankruptcy court may also recharacterize a claim for debt as equity, or not allow a claim for other reasons including on equitable grounds. Claims of insiders, including stockholders, are subject to heightened scrutiny and a court may find inequitable conduct in the form of overreaching or self-dealing transactions. If a claim is subordinated to those of other creditors, or recharacterized as equity, the claim will likely receive no distribution from the bankruptcy estate unless the estate has enough assets to satisfy the non-subordinated creditors in full; a claim that is disallowed would not share in recoveries from the estate to the extent of such disallowance. The equitably subordinated or disallowed claim need not necessarily relate to the inequitable conduct. Therefore, a damages claim arising from the rejection of an executory contract may be subordinated or disallowed based on conduct wholly unrelated to the contractual relationship itself. Under these principles, should a court determine that they are triggered in the bankruptcy of CEOC or in a bankruptcy of CEC, if one were to occur, claims of our stockholders and CGP LLC, including claims based on notes issued by Caesars Entertainment or CEOC or guarantees by Caesars Entertainment, may not share ratably with claims from other general unsecured creditors or may be disallowed.\nFollowing assignment of the management agreements to CES upon its commencing operations as of October 1, 2014, CGPH is dependent upon CES to operate CGPH's properties.\nEach of CGPH's properties is managed by CES. CGPH is dependent upon CES to provide the services necessary to operate CGPH's properties. CGPH does not have a history of operating casinos. Therefore, CGPH's properties are dependent on the services provided by CES and CGPH cannot operate CGPH's properties without these services. If the quality of the services provided by CES deteriorates, or the terms under which CES provides services change in a manner that is adverse to CGPH, it could have a material adverse effect on CGPH's business, financial condition and operating results. Following the commencement of operations and receipt of regulatory approvals for CES, at CGPH's request, the property management agreements were assigned to CES. CES is a newly formed entity and will not receive the management fees under the property management agreements. Furthermore, CES is dependent upon its members (CGPH, CEOC and CERP) to provide it with the operating funds and capital requirements (the allocation of which shall be based on each member's ownership interest in CES) necessary to provide services under the property management agreements. If any of the members of CES fail to provide it with the operating funds necessary to operate CES, CES may not be able to fully provide the services required by the property management agreements to operate CGPH's properties.\nIn addition, if the property management agreements were to be terminated, or if CES were to suffer significant liquidity or operational difficulties, becoming incapable of providing property management services (or unable to provide such services at agreed upon level) to CGPH or cease operations altogether, CGPH may be unable to continue to operate its properties, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIf a court were to find in favor of the claimants in the Noteholder Disputes, it would likely have a material adverse effect on CEC's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and, absent an intervening event, a reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code would likely be necessary due to the limited resources available at CEC to resolve such matters. The significant amounts CEC has agreed to pay in connection with CEOC's reorganization raise substantial doubt about CEC's ability to continue as a going concern. In addition, CEC estimates that it will require additional sources of funding to meet the ongoing financial commitments of the CEC holding company for amounts other than committed to under the RSAs.\nCEC is subject to a number of Noteholder Disputes related to various transactions that CEOC has completed since 2008. Plaintiffs in certain of these actions raise allegations of breach of contract, intentional and constructive fraudulent transfer, and breach of fiduciary duty, among other claims. Although the Delaware First Lien Lawsuit has been subject to a consensual stay pursuant to the First Lien Bond RSA since CEOC's filing for Chapter 11, and the Delaware Second Lien Lawsuit is not proceeding with respect to fraud or breach of fiduciary duty claims, should a court find in favor of the plaintiffs on such claims in any of the Noteholder Disputes, including the New York First Lien Lawsuit, the New York Second Lien Lawsuit or the Senior Unsecured Lawsuits, the transactions at issue in those lawsuits may be subject to rescission and/or CEC may be required to pay damages to the plaintiffs. In the event of an adverse outcome on one or all of these matters, it is likely that a reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code would be necessary for CEC due to the limited resources available at CEC to resolve such matters.\nA number of the Noteholder Disputes also involve claims that CEC is liable for all amounts due and owing on certain notes issued by CEOC, based on allegations that provisions in the governing indentures pursuant to which CEC guaranteed CEOC's obligations under those notes remain in effect (the \"Guarantee Claims\"). Such Guarantee Claims were most recently raised against Caesars Entertainment in the New York Senior Notes Lawsuit. Adverse rulings on the Guarantee Claims in this action or any of the other Noteholder Disputes could negatively affect CEC's position on such Guarantee Claims in other Noteholder Disputes, or with respect to potential claims by other holders of certain other notes issued by CEOC. If the court in any of these Noteholder Disputes were to find in favor of the plaintiffs on the Guarantee Claims, CEC may become obligated to pay all principal, interest, and other amounts due and owing on the notes at issue. If CEC became obligated to pay amounts owed on CEOC's indebtedness as a result of the Guarantee Claims, it is likely that a reorganization of CEC under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code would be necessary due to the limited resources available at CEC to resolve such matters. However, on January 26, 2017, the Bankruptcy Court ordered the stay of the Guarantee Claims to remain in effect until the earlier of (a) the effective date of the plan of reorganization confirmed on January 17, 2017, (b) the termination of any restructuring support agreement with the Official Committee of Second Priority Noteholders, or (c) further order of the Bankruptcy Court.\nIn addition to the liquidity issues raised as a result of complying with the material commitments CEC made under the RSAs, CEC estimates that it will require additional sources of funding to meet the ongoing financial commitments of the CEC holding company for amounts other than committed to under the RSAs, primarily resulting from significant expenditures made to (1) defend CEC against the matters disclosed in \"Legal Proceedings\" and (2) support CEOC's plan of reorganization. As a result of the foregoing, there is substantial doubt about CEC's ability to continue as a going concern, which could have a materially adverse effect on CAC and CGP LLC, and could also have a material adverse effect on the Proposed Merger.\nRisks Related to Caesars Growth Partners, LLC's Business\nCGP LLC may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of current or potential future acquisitions.\nOn May 20, 2014, we closed a transaction whereby CGPH, an indirect, wholly-owned subsidiary of CGP LLC acquired from Caesars Entertainment certain of its properties and related assets as more fully described in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015. There are incremental risks and uncertainties related to the formation transactions and the Asset Purchase Transactions contemplated thereunder, many of which are outside of our control, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe diversion of our management's attention from our ongoing business concerns;\n\u2022\nthe outcome of any legal proceedings that may be instituted against us and/or others relating to the formation transactions; and\n\u2022\nthe amounts of the costs, fees, expenses and charges related to the Asset Purchase Transactions.\nFor example, we and CGP LLC have been named in two separate lawsuits related to the Asset Purchase Transactions, as more fully described in Item 3. Legal Proceedings - CEOC Bondholder Litigation, or Noteholder Disputes.\nIn addition, CGP LLC's ability to realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions, including, but not limited to the Asset Purchase Transactions, will depend, in part, on its ability to integrate the businesses acquired with its business. The combination of two independent companies is a complex, costly and time consuming process. This process may disrupt the business of either\nor both of the companies, and may not result in the full benefits expected. The difficulties of combining the operations of two companies include, among others:\n\u2022\ncoordinating marketing functions;\n\u2022\nundisclosed liabilities;\n\u2022\nunanticipated issues in integrating information, communications and other systems;\n\u2022\nunanticipated incompatibility of purchasing, marketing and administration methods;\n\u2022\nretaining key employees;\n\u2022\nconsolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures;\n\u2022\nthe diversion of management's attention from ongoing business concerns;\n\u2022\ncoordinating geographically separate organizations; and\n\u2022\nobtaining all necessary gaming regulatory approvals.\nCGP LLC may sell or divest different properties or assets as a result of its evaluation of its portfolio of businesses. Such sales or divestitures could affect CGP LLC's costs, revenues, profitability and financial position.\nFrom time to time, CGP LLC may evaluate its properties and portfolio of businesses and may, as a result, sell or attempt to sell, divest or spin-off different properties or assets. For example, on September 23, 2016, CIE sold its social and mobile games business.\nThese sales or divestitures may affect its costs, revenues, profitability, and financial position. Divestitures have inherent risks, including possible delays in closing transactions (including potential difficulties in obtaining regulatory approvals), the risk of lower-than-expected sales proceeds for the divested businesses, and potential post-closing claims for indemnification. In addition, current economic conditions and relatively illiquid real estate markets may result in fewer potential bidders and unsuccessful sales efforts. Expected costs savings, which are offset by revenue losses from divested properties, may also be difficult to achieve or maximize.\nCGP LLC may require additional capital to support business growth, and this capital might not be available on acceptable terms or at all.\nCGP LLC intends to continue to make significant investments to support its business growth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges, expand into new markets, develop new games and features or enhance CIE's existing games, improve its operating infrastructure or acquire complementary businesses, personnel and technologies. Accordingly, CAC and CGP LLC may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. If CAC raises additional funds through future issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our Class A common stock. Any debt financing we or CGP LLC secure in the future could involve restrictive covenants relating to capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. CAC and CGP LLC are recently formed entities and may not be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms, if at all. For instance, the lack of operating history and relationship with Caesars Entertainment may impede CGP LLC's ability to raise debt or equity financing on acceptable terms, if at all, and there can be no assurances that we could pursue a future offering of securities at an appropriate price to raise the necessary financing. If CAC and CGP LLC are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to them when they require it, their ability to continue to support CGP LLC's business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly impaired, which could have a material adverse effect on CGP LLC's, business, financial condition and operating results.\nCAC and CGP LLC do not have restrictions on their ability to raise debt and may highly leverage their capital structure, which could adversely affect CGP LLC's ability to pursue certain opportunities.\nCAC and CGP LLC have no restrictions on their ability to raise a significant amount of debt financing and/or alter their capital structures. Should CAC or CGP LLC significantly leverage themselves, CAC or CGP LLC will be subject to considerable interest payment expenses that could adversely affect our ability to obtain additional financing. Further, once CAC has a highly leveraged capital structure, CGP LLC may lose certain advantages it has against competitors that have similar capital structures that makes pursuing new, capital-intensive opportunities more challenging.\nWe may not realize any or all of our projected cost savings, which would have a negative effect on our results of operations.\nAs part of our business strategy, CEC and CES have implemented certain cost savings programs and are in the process of identifying opportunities to improve profitability by reducing costs. For example, Caesars Entertainment and CES have identified cost savings, a portion of which would directly reduce our expenses. Any cost savings that we realize from such efforts\nmay differ materially from our estimates. In addition, any cost savings that we realize may be offset, in whole or in part, by reductions in revenues, or through increases in other expenses. For example, cutting advertising or marketing expenses may have an unintended negative affect on our revenues. These cost savings plans are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties that may change at any time. We cannot assure you that cost-savings initiatives will be completed as anticipated or that the benefits we expect will be achieved on a timely basis or at all.\nOur historical financial information may not be a reliable indicator of our future results.\nThe historical financial information we have included in this Form 10-K has been prepared using assumptions and allocations that we believe are reasonable. However, such historical financial information does not necessarily reflect what our financial position, results of operations and cash flows would have been as a stand-alone entity separate from Caesars Entertainment during the periods presented. In addition, the historical information is not necessarily indicative of what our results of operations, financial position and cash flows will be in the future.\nCGP LLC's business may be subject to seasonal fluctuations which could result in volatility or have an adverse effect on the market price of our Class A common stock.\nCGP LLC's business may be subject to some degree of seasonality. In the case of CGP LLC's casino properties, weather conditions may deter or prevent customers from reaching the facilities or undertaking trips. Such conditions would particularly affect customers who are traveling longer distances to visit CGP LLC's casino properties. We believe the number of customer visits to CGP LLC's casino properties will fluctuate based on the season, with winter months experiencing lower visitation; however, volume of business generated by our Las Vegas properties is generally lower during the summer months. Seasonality may cause CGP LLC's casino properties working capital cash flow requirements to vary from quarter to quarter depending on the variability in the volume and timing of sales. These factors, among other things, make forecasting more difficult and may adversely affect CGP LLC's casino properties ability to manage working capital and to predict financial results accurately, which could adversely affect the market price of our Class A common stock.\nThere may be a significant degree of difficulty in operating CGP LLC's businesses separately from Caesars Entertainment, and managing that process effectively could require a significant amount of management's time.\nThe separation from Caesars Entertainment could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the operation of CGP LLC's businesses. Management may be required to devote considerable amounts of time to the separation, which will decrease the time they will have to manage their ordinary responsibilities. If management is not able to manage the separation effectively, or if any significant business activities are interrupted as a result of the separation, CGP LLC's businesses and operating results could suffer.\nWe will be allocated taxable income from CGP LLC for U.S. federal income tax purposes regardless of whether we receive corresponding cash distributions from CGP LLC to pay our tax liability.\nBecause CGP LLC is a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we will be allocated taxable income from CGP LLC for U.S. federal income tax purposes for each fiscal year according to the terms of the CGP Operating Agreement. We will be required to pay U.S. federal income tax on such income at the current U.S. federal corporate income tax rate, regardless of whether CGP LLC makes corresponding cash distributions to us to pay our tax liability. The CGP Operating Agreement provides for quarterly cash tax distributions (other than in connection with a liquidation or certain partial liquidations) to be made to us and Caesars Entertainment, but there is no guarantee that such tax distributions (or other cash distributions from CGP LLC) will be sufficient for us to pay our tax liabilities.\nThere are no assurances that there will be future development opportunities for CGP LLC or that CGP LLC will obtain a development project.\nCGP LLC's ability to expand into new markets to pursue development opportunities depends on passage of legislation that legalizes gambling in new markets and Caesars Entertainment not exercising its right of first offer. Although in the past few years a number of states have passed legislation permitting the development of gaming facilities, there can be no assurances that such trend will continue, and it is possible that legislatures and public sentiment will turn against permitting the development of gaming facilities. Should the states pass no additional legislation for issuing licenses or permitting the development of gaming facilities, CGP LLC will be unable to pursue development opportunities in new markets. Moreover, even if new markets open up, there can be no assurances that Caesars Entertainment and/or CGP LLC will be successful in the bid process for any new development opportunities; therefore, there can be no assurances that CGP LLC will be able to enter those new markets. For example, CGP LLC recently bid for a gaming license in the State of New York but was not selected. Further, there can be no assurances that Caesars Entertainment will not exercise its right of first refusal, thereby depriving CGP LLC of access to any potential development project.\nCGP LLC and CAC are subject to extensive governmental regulation and taxation policies, the enforcement of which could adversely impact CGP LLC's business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCGP LLC and CAC are subject to extensive gaming regulations and political and regulatory uncertainty. Regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions where CGP LLC operates have broad powers with respect to the licensing of casino operations and may revoke, suspend, condition or limit the gaming or other licenses of CGP LLC's casino properties or developments, impose substantial fines and take other actions, any one of which could adversely impact CGP LLC's business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, regulatory authorities in one or more jurisdictions may require CGP LLC or CAC to obtain new licenses in connection with the formation transactions and the Asset Purchase Transactions or due to future changes in regulation. For instance, the Missouri Gaming Commission has required that CAC obtain certain licenses after the closing of the formation transactions even though CGP LLC does not operate in Missouri. The failure of CAC to maintain a license from the Missouri Gaming Commission could, among other things, result in the loss of Caesars Entertainment's gaming license in Missouri. If other jurisdictions require CGP LLC or CAC to obtain new licenses in connection with its operations, the formation of CES or due to future changes in regulation, and CGP LLC or CAC is unable to obtain those licenses, it could adversely impact CGP LLC's business, financial condition and results of operations. As another example, CGP LLC's ability to expand its operations at Harrah's New Orleans, which could include increasing the number of rooms at the hotel or opening new restaurants at the complex, is subject to regulatory approval, and any such proposal may or may not be approved.\nAs a result of CIE holding an online gaming license, its operations and activities are subject to various gaming laws and laws in Nevada and New Jersey. We also expect CIE to be subject to these or similar laws as CIE seeks additional licenses for online real money gaming in the United States if additional states legalize and regulate online gaming. For example, CIE has obtained a license in Nevada as an \"operator of an interactive gaming system\" and obtained regulatory approval to launch online poker in Nevada. In addition, CIE holds a license in New Jersey to operate internet gaming in New Jersey. Among these laws are various \"suitability\" requirements which could limit CIE's ability to conduct business with certain third parties, make certain acquisitions and otherwise freely conduct its business. The results of such restrictions could have a material adverse effect on CIE's, and therefore CGP LLC's, business, financial condition and operating results.\nFurthermore, interpretations of laws and local regulations and ordinances on which CGP LLC and CAC rely may change or be made conditional on certain other factors, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, Harrah's New Orleans is currently subject to a local ordinance in New Orleans related to the minimum number of people who must be employed at Harrah's New Orleans. A change in the interpretation of this ordinance or a change in this ordinance could force a reevaluation of staffing at that property in a manner that could adversely affect the financial results of Harrah's New Orleans.\nFurthermore, because CGP LLC and CAC are subject to regulation in each jurisdiction in which they operate, and because regulatory agencies within each jurisdiction review our compliance with gaming laws in other jurisdictions, it is possible that gaming compliance issues in one jurisdiction may lead to reviews and compliance issues in other jurisdictions.\nFrom time to time, individual jurisdictions have also considered legislation or referendums, such as bans on smoking in casinos and other entertainment and dining facilities, which could adversely impact the operations of CGP LLC's casino properties. For example, Maryland law prohibits smoking inside the Horseshoe Baltimore facility. Additionally, the city council in New Orleans enacted an ordinance restricting smoking indoors in public places, including in Harrah's New Orleans, which went into effect in April 2015. The likelihood or outcome of similar legislation in such jurisdictions and referendums in the future cannot be predicted, though any smoking ban would be expected to negatively impact CGP LLC's financial performance.\nThe casino entertainment industry represents a significant source of tax revenues to the various jurisdictions in which casinos operate. From time to time, various state and federal legislators and officials have proposed changes in tax laws, or in the administration of such laws, including increases in tax rates, which would affect the industry. If adopted, such changes could adversely impact CGP LLC's business, financial condition and results of operations.\nActs of terrorism, natural disasters, severe weather and political, economic and military conditions may impede CGP LLC's ability to operate or harm its financial results.\nTerrorist attacks and other acts of war or hostility have created many economic and political uncertainties. For example, a substantial number of the customers of CGP LLC's casinos in Las Vegas and New Orleans use air travel for transportation to and from the casino. As a result of terrorist acts, domestic and international travel was severely disrupted, which resulted in a decrease in customer visits to Las Vegas and New Orleans. We cannot predict the extent to which disruptions in air or other forms of travel as a result of any further terrorist act, security alerts or war, uprisings, or hostilities in places such as Iraq and Afghanistan, or other countries throughout the world, will continue to directly or indirectly impact CGP LLC's business and operating results. As a consequence of the threat of terrorist attacks and other acts of war or hostility in the future, premiums for a variety of insurance products have increased, and some types of insurance are no longer available. If any such event were to affect our properties, we would likely be adversely impacted. In addition, natural and man-made disasters such as major fires, floods, hurricanes, earthquakes and oil spills, or severe or inclement weather affecting the ability of CGP LLC's casino\ncustomers to travel can have a negative impact on its results of operations. In most cases, we have insurance that covers portions of any losses from a natural disaster, but it is subject to deductibles and maximum payouts in many cases. Although we may be covered by insurance from a natural disaster, the timing of our receipt of insurance proceeds, if any, is out of our control. In some cases, however, we may receive no proceeds from insurance. Additionally, a natural disaster affecting one or more of our properties may affect the level and cost of insurance coverage we may be able to obtain in the future, which may adversely affect our financial position. As our operations depend in part on our customers' ability to travel, severe or inclement weather can also have a negative impact on our results of operations.\nAny violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or other similar laws and regulations could have a negative impact on us.\nCGP LLC is subject to risks associated with doing business outside of the United States, which exposes CGP LLC to complex foreign and U.S. regulations inherent in engaging in a cross-border business and in each of the countries in which CGP LLC and its businesses transact business. CGP LLC is subject to requirements imposed by the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\"FCPA\") and other anti-corruption laws that generally prohibit U.S. companies and their affiliates from offering, promising, authorizing or making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Violations of the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws may result in severe criminal and civil sanctions as well as other penalties and the SEC and U.S. Department of Justice have increased their enforcement activities with respect to the FCPA. Policies and procedures and employee training and compliance programs that CGP LLC has implemented to deter prohibited practices may not be effective in prohibiting our employees, contractors or agents from violating or circumventing our policies and the law. If the employees, contractors or agents of CGP LLC's casino properties or CIE fail to comply with applicable laws or company policies governing its international operations, CGP LLC may face investigations, prosecutions and other legal proceedings and actions which could result in civil penalties, administrative remedies and criminal sanctions. Any determination that CGP LLC has violated any anti-corruption laws could have a material adverse effect on CGP LLC's financial condition. Compliance with international and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to CGP LLC's international operations increase CGP LLC's cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. CGP LLC and its businesses also deal with significant amounts of cash in its operations and are subject to various reporting and anti-money laundering (\"AML\") regulations. Any violation of AML or regulations, on which in recent years, governmental authorities have been increasingly focused, with a particular focus on the gaming industry, by any of our resorts could have a negative effect on our results of operations. As an example, a major gaming company recently settled a U.S. Attorney investigation into its AML practices. In October 2013, CEOC's subsidiary, Desert Palace, Inc. (the owner of and referred to herein as Caesars Palace), received a letter from Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the United States Department of the Treasury (\"FinCEN\"), stating that FinCEN was investigating Caesars Palace for alleged violations of the Bank Secrecy Act to determine whether it is appropriate to assess a civil penalty and/or take additional enforcement action against Caesars Palace. Caesars Palace responded to FinCEN's letter in January 2014. Additionally, CEC was informed in October 2013 that a federal grand jury investigation regarding anti-money laundering practices of CEC and its subsidiaries had been initiated. CEC and Caesars Palace have been cooperating with FinCEN, the Department of Justice and the Nevada Gaming Control Board (the \"GCB\") on this matter. On September 8, 2015, FinCEN announced a settlement pursuant to which Caesars Palace agreed to an $8 million civil penalty for its violations of the Bank Secrecy Act, which penalty shall be treated as a general unsecured claim in Caesars Palace's bankruptcy proceedings. In addition, Caesars Palace agreed to conduct periodic external audits and independent testing of its AML compliance program, report to FinCEN on mandated improvements, adopt a rigorous training regime, and engage in a \"look-back\" for suspicious transactions. The terms of the FinCEN settlement were approved by the bankruptcy court on October 19, 2015. CEOC and the GCB reached a settlement on the same facts as above, wherein CEC agreed to pay $1.5 million and provide to the GCB the same information that is reported to FinCEN and to resubmit its updated AML policies. On September 17, 2015, the settlement agreement was approved by the Nevada Gaming Commission.\nWe are, or may become involved, in legal proceedings that if adversely adjudicated or settled, could impact our financial condition.\nFrom time to time, CAC and CGP LLC are defendants in various lawsuits or other legal proceedings relating to matters incidental to our business. The nature of our business subjects CAC and CGP LLC to the risk of lawsuits filed by customers, past and present employees, competitors, business partners, and others in the ordinary course of business. As with all legal proceedings, however, no assurance can be provided as to the outcome of these matters and in general, legal proceedings can be expensive and time consuming. CAC and CGP LLC may not be successful in the defense or prosecution of these lawsuits, which could result in settlements or damages that could significantly impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCAC and CGP LLC are defendants in certain legal proceedings, including the lawsuits relating to the Amended Merger Agreement and the Proposed Merger, as discussed in Item 3. Legal Proceedings - CEOC Bondholder Litigation, or Noteholder Disputes. If a court were to find in favor of the claimants in these proceedings, such determination could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur obligation to fund multi-employer pension plans to which we contribute may have an adverse impact on us.\nWe contribute to and participate in various multi-employer pension plans for employees represented by certain unions. We are required to make contributions to these plans in amounts established under collective bargaining agreements. We do not administer these plans and, generally, are not represented on the boards of trustees of these plans. The Pension Protection Act enacted in 2006, or the PPA, requires under-funded pension plans to improve their funding ratios. Based on the information available to us, some of the multi-employer plans to which we contribute are either \"critical\" or \"endangered\" as those terms are defined in the PPA. Specifically, the Pension Plan of the UNITE HERE National Retirement Fund is less than 65% funded. We cannot determine at this time the amount of additional funding, if any, we may be required to make to these plans. However, plan assessments could have an adverse impact on our results of operations or cash flows for a given period. Furthermore, under current law, upon the termination of a multi-employer pension plan, due to the withdrawal of all its contributing employers (a mass withdrawal), or in the event of a withdrawal by us, which we consider from time to time, we would be required to make payments to the plan for our proportionate share of the plan's unfunded vested liabilities, that would have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. See also litigation between the National Retirement Fund and CEC described in Item 3. Legal Proceedings.\nCGP LLC's Casino Properties and Developments business is particularly sensitive to reductions in discretionary consumer spending resulting from downturns in the economy, the volatility and disruption of the capital and credit markets, adverse changes in the global economy and other factors which could negatively impact our financial performance and our ability to access financing.\nChanges in discretionary consumer spending or consumer preferences are driven by factors beyond CGP LLC's control, such as perceived or actual general economic conditions; high energy, fuel and other commodity costs; the cost of travel; the potential for bank failures; a soft job market; an actual or perceived decrease in disposable consumer income and wealth; fears of recession and changes in consumer confidence in the economy; and terrorist attacks or other global events. CGP LLC's Casino Properties and Developments business is particularly susceptible to any such changes because CGP LLC's casino properties offers a highly discretionary set of entertainment and leisure activities and amenities. If discretionary consumer spending declines, then CGP LLC's results of operations will be adversely impacted.\nThe adverse conditions in certain local, regional, national and global markets have negatively affected CGP LLC and may continue to negatively affect CGP LLC in the future. During periods of economic contraction, CGP LLC's revenues may decrease while some of its costs remain fixed or even increase, resulting in decreased earnings. In addition, CGP LLC may also be unable to find additional cost savings to offset any decrease in revenues. Even an uncertain economic outlook may adversely affect consumer spending in CGP LLC's gaming operations and related facilities, as consumers spend less in anticipation of a potential economic downturn.\nTheoretical win rates for CGP LLC's casino operations depend on a variety of factors, some of which are beyond its control.\nThe gaming industry is characterized by an element of chance. Accordingly, CGP LLC's casino properties employ theoretical win rates to estimate what a certain type of game, on average, will win or lose in the long run. In addition to the element of chance, theoretical win rates are also affected by the spread of table limits and factors that are beyond CGP LLC's control, such as a player's skill and experience and behavior, the mix of games played, the financial resources of players, the volume of bets placed and the amount of time players spend gambling. As a result of the variability in these factors, the actual win rates at the casino may differ from the theoretical win rates and could result in the winnings of CGP LLC's gaming customers exceeding those anticipated. The variability of these factors, alone or in combination, have the potential to negatively impact our actual win rates, which may adversely affect CGP LLC's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCGP LLC's casino operations extend credit to its customers and may not be able to collect gaming receivables from its credit players.\nCGP LLC's casino properties conduct their gaming activities on a credit basis as well as a cash basis, which credit is unsecured. Table games players are typically extended more credit than slot players, and high stakes players are typically extended more credit than patrons who tend to wager lower amounts. High-end gaming is more volatile than other forms of gaming, and variances in win-loss results attributable to high-end gaming may have a significant positive or negative impact on cash flow and earnings in a particular quarter.\nCGP LLC's casino properties extend credit to those customers whose level of play and financial resources warrant, in the opinion of management, an extension of credit. These receivables could have a significant impact on our results of operations if deemed uncollectible. While gaming debts are evidenced by a credit instrument, including what is commonly referred to as a \"marker,\" and judgments on gaming debts are enforceable under the current laws of the jurisdictions in which CGP LLC allows play on a credit basis and judgments in such jurisdictions on gaming debts are enforceable in all states under the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the U.S. Constitution, other jurisdictions may determine that enforcement of gaming debts is against public\npolicy. Although courts of some foreign nations will enforce gaming debts directly and the assets in the U.S. of foreign debtors may be reached to satisfy a judgment, judgments on gaming debts from U.S. courts are not binding on the courts of many foreign nations.\nWe face the risk of fraud and cheating.\nCasino gaming customers may attempt or commit fraud or cheat in order to increase winnings. Acts of fraud or cheating could involve the use of counterfeit chips or other tactics, possibly in collusion with the employees of CGP LLC's casinos. Internal acts of cheating could also be conducted by employees through collusion with dealers, surveillance staff, floor managers or other casino or gaming area staff. Failure to discover such acts or schemes in a timely manner could result in losses in gaming operations. In addition, negative publicity related to such schemes could have an adverse effect on CGP LLC's reputation, potentially causing a material adverse effect on CGP LLC's business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nBecause a majority of CGP LLC's major gaming resorts are concentrated on the Las Vegas Strip, we are subject to greater risks than a gaming company that is more geographically diversified.\nGiven that a majority of CGP LLC's major resorts are concentrated on the Las Vegas Strip, CGP LLC's business may be significantly affected by risks common to the Las Vegas tourism industry. For example, the cost and availability of air services and the impact of any events that disrupt air travel to and from Las Vegas can adversely affect our business. We cannot control the number or frequency of flights to or from Las Vegas, but CGP LLC relies on air traffic for a significant portion of its visitors. Reductions in flights by major airlines as a result of higher fuel prices or lower demand can impact the number of visitors to CGP LLC's resorts. Additionally, there is one principal interstate highway between Las Vegas and Southern California, where a large number of CGP LLC's customers reside. Capacity constraints of that highway or any other traffic disruptions may also affect the number of customers who visit CGP LLC's facilities.\nCGP LLC's business is particularly sensitive to energy prices and a rise in energy prices could harm its operating results.\nCGP LLC is a large consumer of electricity and other energy and, therefore, higher energy prices may have an adverse effect on its results of operations. Accordingly, increases in energy costs may have a negative impact on its operating results. Additionally, higher electricity and gasoline prices that affect its customers may result in reduced visitation to its resorts and a reduction in its revenues. CGP LLC may be indirectly impacted by regulatory requirements aimed at reducing the impacts of climate change directed at up-stream utility providers, as it could experience potentially higher utility, fuel, and transportation costs.\nIf we are unable to effectively compete against our competitors, our profits will decline.\nThe gaming industry is highly competitive and CGP LLC's competitors vary considerably in size, quality of facilities, number of operations, brand identities, marketing and growth strategies, financial strength and capabilities, and geographic diversity. CGP LLC also competes with other non-gaming resorts and vacation areas, and with various other entertainment businesses. Competitors in each market that CGP LLC participates may have greater financial, marketing, or other resources than CGP LLC does, and there can be no assurance that they will not engage in aggressive pricing action to compete with CGP LLC. Although we believe CGP LLC is currently able to compete effectively in each of the various markets in which we participate, we cannot ensure that CGP LLC will be able to continue to do so or that they will be capable of maintaining or further increasing their current market share. CGP LLC's failure to compete successfully in their various markets could adversely affect their business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow.\nIn recent years, many casino operators have been reinvesting in existing markets to attract new customers or to gain market share, thereby increasing competition in those markets. As companies have completed new expansion projects, supply has typically grown at a faster pace than demand in some markets, including Las Vegas, CGP LLC's largest market, and competition has increased significantly. For example, SLS Las Vegas opened in August 2014 on the northern end of the Strip, and the Genting Group has announced plans to develop a casino and hotel called Resorts World Las Vegas, which is expected to open in 2019 on the northern end of the Strip. Also, in response to changing trends, Las Vegas operators have been focused on expanding their non-gaming offerings, including upgrades to hotel rooms, new food and beverage offerings, and new entertainment offerings. MGM's The Park and joint venture with AEG, T-Mobile Arena, located between New York-New York and Monte Carlo, opened in April 2016 and includes retail and dining options and a 20,000 seat indoor arena for sporting events and concerts. In addition, in June 2016, MGM announced that the Monte Carlo Resort and Casino will undergo $450 million in non-gaming renovations focused on room, food and beverage and entertainment enhancements and is expected to re-open in late 2018 as two newly branded hotels. There have also been proposals for other large scale non-gaming development projects in Las Vegas by various other developers. The expansion of existing casino entertainment properties, the increase in the number of properties and the aggressive marketing strategies of many of CGP LLC's competitors have increased competition in many markets in which they operate, and this intense competition is expected to continue. These competitive pressures have and are expected to continue to adversely affect CGP LLC's financial performance. Growth in consumer demand for non-gaming offerings could also negatively impact our gaming revenue.\nIn addition, in the mid-Atlantic region, existing casino resorts provide a number of gaming options for customers, thereby creating significant competition for Horseshoe Baltimore. The casino resorts in the mid-Atlantic region compete with each other on the basis of overall atmosphere, range of amenities, level of service, price, location, entertainment offered and size. Further, MGM National Harbor in Maryland opened in December 2016 and may draw additional customers away from Horseshoe Baltimore. In addition, in June 2016, Maryland Live! announced plans to invest $200 million to construct a new hotel with additional food and beverage and entertainment options adjacent to its casino. If Horseshoe Baltimore is unable to effectively compete with other regional casino resorts or keep customers, this inability may negatively affect Horseshoe Baltimore's, and therefore CGP LLC's, business and operations.\nCGP LLC also competes with legalized gaming from casinos located on Native American tribal lands, primarily those located in California. While the competitive impact on CGP LLC's operations in Las Vegas from the continued growth of Native American gaming establishments in California remains uncertain, the proliferation of gaming in California and other areas located in the same regions as CGP LLC's properties could have an adverse effect on CGP LLC's results of operations.\nIn addition, certain states have legalized, and others may legalize, casino gaming in specific areas, including metropolitan areas from which we traditionally attract customers. A number of states have permitted or are considering permitting gaming, on Native American reservations and through expansion of state lotteries.\nThe current global trend toward liberalization of gaming restrictions and resulting proliferation of gaming venues could result in a decrease in the number of visitors to our Las Vegas facilities by attracting customers close to home and away from Las Vegas, which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe success of third parties adjacent to CGP LLC's properties is important to its ability to generate revenue and operate CGP LLC's business and any deterioration to their success could materially adversely affect our revenue and results of operations.\nIn certain cases, CGP LLC does not own the businesses and amenities adjacent to its properties. However, the adjacent third-party businesses and amenities stimulate additional traffic through its complexes. For example, the Grand Bazaar Shops located in front of Bally's Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas. Any decrease in the popularity of, or the number of customers visiting, these adjacent businesses and amenities may lead to a corresponding decrease in the traffic through our complexes, which would negatively affect CGP LLC's business and operating results. Further, if newly opened properties, such as The Cromwell, are not as popular as expected, CGP LLC will not realize the increase in traffic through CGP LLC's properties that it expects as a result of their opening, which would negatively affect its business projections.\nCGP LLC's Casino Properties and Developments Business may be subject to material environmental liability, including as a result of unknown environmental contamination.\nThe Casino Properties and Developments Business is subject to certain federal, state and local environmental laws, regulations and ordinances which govern activities or operations that may have adverse environmental effects, such as emissions to air, discharges to streams and rivers and releases of hazardous substances and pollutants into the environment, as well as handling and disposal from municipal/non-hazardous waste, which also apply to current and previous owners or operators of real estate generally. Federal examples of these laws include the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation Recovery Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and the Oil Pollution Act of 1990. Certain of these environmental laws may impose cleanup responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused particular contamination or release of hazardous substances. Should unknown contamination be discovered on CGP LLC's property, or should a release of hazardous substances occur on CGP LLC's property, CGP LLC could be required to investigate and clean up the contamination and could also be held responsible to a governmental entity or third parties for property damage, personal injury or investigation and cleanup costs incurred in connection with the contamination or release, which may be substantial. Moreover, such contamination may also impair CGP LLC's ability to use the affected property. Such liability could be joint and several in nature, regardless of fault, and could affect CGP LLC even if such property is vacated. The potential for substantial costs and an inability to use the property could adversely affect our business.\nWork stoppages and other labor problems could negatively impact our future profits.\nSome of our employees are represented by labor unions and, accordingly, we are subject to the risk of work stoppages or other labor disruptions from time to time. We have two collective bargaining agreements covering stage production employees in Las Vegas expiring in 2017. We intend to negotiate renewal agreements for these two collective bargaining agreements and are hopeful that we will be able to reach agreements with the union without any work stoppage. Work stoppages and other labor disruptions could have a material adverse impact on our operations. Also, wage and/or benefit increases resulting from new labor agreements may be significant and could also have an adverse impact on our results of operations. From time to time, we have experienced attempts by labor organizations to organize certain of our non-union employees. To the extent that our non-union employees join unions, we could have greater exposure to risks associated with labor problems and could negatively impact our profits.\nCGP LLC's insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all possible losses it could suffer, and, in the future, its insurance costs may increase significantly or it may be unable to obtain the same level of insurance coverage.\nCGP LLC's casino properties may suffer damage to its property caused by a casualty loss (such as fire, natural disasters and acts of war or terrorism) that could severely disrupt its business or subject it to claims by third parties who are injured or harmed. Although CGP LLC maintains insurance (including property, casualty, terrorism and business interruption insurance), that insurance may be inadequate or unavailable to cover all of the risks to which its business and assets may be exposed. Should an uninsured loss or loss in excess of insured limits occur, it could have a significant adverse impact on CGP LLC's operations and revenues.\nCGP LLC renews its insurance policies on an annual basis. If the cost of coverage becomes too high, CGP LLC may need to reduce its policy limits or agree to certain exclusions from its coverage in order to reduce the premiums to an acceptable amount. Among other factors, homeland security concerns, other catastrophic events or any change in the current U.S. statutory requirement that insurance carriers offer coverage for certain acts of terrorism could adversely affect available insurance coverage and result in increased premiums on available coverage (which may cause CGP LLC to elect to reduce its policy limits) and additional exclusions from coverage. Among other potential future adverse changes, in the future CGP LLC may elect to not, or may be unable to, obtain any coverage for losses due to acts of terrorism.\nPlanet Hollywood licenses the Planet Hollywood brand from affiliates of Robert Earl and there can be no assurances that the Planet Hollywood brand would not be negatively impacted by its use outside of our control.\nAffiliates of Robert Earl license certain intellectual property relating to the operation of the Planet Hollywood Resort and Casino to Planet Hollywood. The license includes certain names and trademarks and the right to display certain memorabilia on the Planet Hollywood premises. Planet Hollywood has invested significant time and financing to establish its brand as a Hollywood-themed entertainment and non-gaming destination. The expiration or termination, or modification of the terms of this license may have a materially adverse effect on Planet Hollywood's, and therefore CGP LLC's, business, financial conditions and operating results.\nIn addition, the Planet Hollywood brand is used by affiliates of Robert Earl in Hollywood-themed restaurants, hotels and shops around the United States and internationally. Any negative events associated with the use of the Planet Hollywood brand with these restaurants and shops may be out of CGP LLC's control, and may negatively impact the brand's image for the Planet Hollywood casino, which could harm Planet Hollywood's, therefore CGP LLC's, business and results of operations.\nThe Maryland Joint Venture adds additional risk that may result in a material adverse effect on CGP LLC's business, financial condition and operating results.\nCGP LLC indirectly holds approximately 40.9% interest in the equity interests of Caesars Baltimore Investment Company, LLC (the \"Maryland Joint Venture\"). While CGP LLC can influence the ownership of the Maryland Joint Venture through its equity ownership, CGP LLC relies on the other equity partners for providing certain funding for the Maryland Joint Venture and there can be no assurances that the other equity partners will provide sufficient funding, or any funding at all, if needed. The failure of other equity partners in the Maryland Joint Venture to provide the appropriate level of funding may result in a material adverse effect on CGP LLC's business, financial condition and operating results.\nRisks Related to Our Class A Common Stock\nCaesars Entertainment's call right on our Class A common stock may result in you being forced to sell our Class A common stock at a disadvantageous time and will cause you to own stock of Caesars Entertainment. This call right may not occur at all due to the discretion of Caesars Entertainment or the inability of Caesars Entertainment to meet the conditions required to exercise such right.\nAfter October 21, 2016, Caesars Entertainment has the right, which it may assign to any of its affiliates or to any transferee of all non-voting units of CGP LLC held by Caesars Entertainment, to acquire all or a portion of the voting units of CGP LLC (or, at our option, shares of CAC's Class A common stock) not otherwise owned by Caesars Entertainment at such time. As a result, you may be forced to sell your shares of CAC's Class A common stock on little notice and at a value that may cause you to realize a loss. The exercise of this right by Caesars Entertainment will result in you receiving consideration entirely or partly in the form of stock of Caesars Entertainment, which may be a tax-free reorganization for U.S. federal income tax purposes in certain circumstances. If the exchange is not a tax-free reorganization, you may recognize gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes on such exchange depending on the amount of cash and the value of the stock of Caesars Entertainment you receive in such exchange and the adjusted tax basis of your shares of CAC's Class A common stock. There can be no assurances that the stock of Caesars Entertainment will maintain its value from the time of Caesars Entertainment's exercise of the call right or be part of an active trading market. As a consequence, you may be forced to dispose of the stock of Caesars Entertainment at a great loss.\nIn addition, Caesars Entertainment may exercise the call right in its sole discretion, subject to meeting certain conditions, or Caesars Entertainment may decide to not exercise the call right for any reason whatsoever. Moreover, if Caesars Entertainment does not meet certain liquidity requirements, debt leverage ratio and other requirements, it will be unable to exercise the call right. The uncertainty as to the timing of the exercise of the call right, if at all, by Caesars Entertainment may adversely affect the trading value of our stock.\nCGP LLC is required to be liquidated on April 21, 2022, which may result in you receiving less than the full value of your Class A common stock.\nFollowing October 21, 2018 and until April 21, 2022, our Board will have the right to cause a liquidation of CGP LLC, including the sale or winding up of CGP LLC or other monetization of all of its assets. On April 21, 2022 (unless otherwise agreed by Caesars Entertainment and CAC), if our Board has not previously exercised its liquidation right, CGP LLC shall, and our Board shall cause CGP LLC to, effect a liquidation. Because the liquidation will occur on a set schedule, it is possible that regulations or market factors at the time of liquidation may impede the ability to liquidate the assets of CGP LLC. If CGP LLC is unable to liquidate portions of its assets, proceeds from the liquidation will be negatively impacted. Moreover, the forced liquidation does not preserve the flexibility to maximize the value of CGP LLC's assets in a sale by waiting for an advantageous time. In addition, CAC's allocable portion of the gain (if any) on the liquidation of the assets of CGP LLC will generally be subject to U.S. federal income tax at the regular corporate rate. As a result, you may receive less than the full value of your Class A common stock should liquidation occur on April 21, 2022.\nAn active trading market for our Class A common stock may not develop.\nPrior to our listing on the NASDAQ Global Select market on November 19, 2013, there had not been a public market for our Class A common stock. We cannot predict the extent to which investor interest in us will lead to the development of an active trading market or how liquid that market might become. The Sponsors own approximately 65.0% of our Class A common stock and while the shares are eligible for resale, currently such shares are not available for the public market. As a result, our shares may be less liquid than the shares of other newly public companies or other public companies generally and there may be imbalances between supply and demand for our shares. As a result, our share price may experience significant volatility and may not necessarily reflect the value of our expected performance. If an active trading market does not develop, you may have difficulty selling any of our common stock that you buy. Consequently, you may not be able to sell our Class A common stock at prices equal to or greater than the price you paid.\nFuture sales or the possibility of future sales of a substantial amount of our Class A common stock may depress the price of shares of our Class A common stock.\nFuture sales or the availability for sale of substantial amounts of our Class A common stock in the public market could adversely affect the prevailing market price of our Class A common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through future sales of equity securities.\nAll of the outstanding shares of our Class A common stock are eligible for resale under Rule 144 or Rule 701 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"), subject to volume limitations, applicable holding period requirements and the lock-up agreements or other contractual restrictions related to certain of our stockholders.\nWe cannot predict the size of future issuances of our Class A common stock or other securities or the effect, if any, that future issuances and sales of our Class A common stock or other securities, including future sales by Caesars Entertainment, will have on the market price of our Class A common stock. Sales of substantial amounts of Class A common stock (including shares of Class A common stock issued in connection with an acquisition), or the perception that such sales could occur, may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our Class A common stock.\nThe price and trading volume of our Class A common stock may fluctuate significantly, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nThe market price of our Class A common stock may be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations. In addition, the trading volume of our Class A common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. Volatility in the market price of our Class A common stock may prevent you from being able to sell your shares at or above the price you paid for your shares of Class A common stock. The market price for our Class A common stock could fluctuate significantly for various reasons, including:\n\u2022\nour operating and financial performance and prospects;\n\u2022\nnews and events regarding CEOC's bankruptcy and negotiations with its creditors;\n\u2022\nthe outcome of litigation against CEC and its affiliates;\n\u2022\nour quarterly or annual earnings or those of other companies in our industry;\n\u2022\nconditions that impact demand for the products and services of CGP LLC's businesses;\n\u2022\nthe public's reaction to our press releases, other public announcements and filings with the SEC;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts who track our Class A common stock;\n\u2022\nmarket and industry perception of our success, or lack thereof, in pursuing our growth strategy;\n\u2022\nstrategic actions by us or our competitors, such as acquisitions or restructurings;\n\u2022\nchanges in government and environmental regulation, including gaming taxes;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting standards, policies, guidance, interpretations or principles;\n\u2022\narrival and departure of key personnel;\n\u2022\nthe small percentage of our shares that are publicly traded;\n\u2022\nchanges in our capital structure;\n\u2022\nincreases in market interests rates that would decrease the value of CGP LLC's fixed-rate securities;\n\u2022\nchanges in the stock price of, or a restructuring of, Caesars Entertainment;\n\u2022\nsales of Class A common stock by us or affiliates of the Sponsors;\n\u2022\nthe expiration of contractual lock-up agreements; and\n\u2022\nchanges in general market, economic and political conditions in the United States and global economies or financial markets, including those resulting from natural disasters, terrorist attacks, acts of war and responses to such events.\nIn addition, in recent years, the stock market has experienced significant price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant impact on the market price of securities issued by many companies, including companies in the gaming, lodging, hospitality and entertainment industries. The changes frequently appear to occur without regard to the operating performance of the affected companies. Hence, the price of our Class A common stock could fluctuate based upon factors that have little or nothing to do with us, and these fluctuations could materially reduce our share price.\nCGP LLC may incur impairments to goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, or long-lived assets which could negatively affect our future profits.\nWe review CGP LLC's goodwill, intangible assets and long-lived assets on an annual basis and during interim reporting periods in accordance with the authoritative guidance. Significant negative trends, reduced estimates of future cash flows, disruptions to our business, slower growth rates or lack of growth have resulted in write-downs and impairment charges in the past and, if one or more of such events occurs in the future, additional impairment charges may be required in future periods. If CGP LLC is required to record additional impairment charges, this could have a material adverse impact on its consolidated results of operations.\nHamlet Holdings controls us and their interests may conflict with or differ from your interests as a stockholder.\nHamlet Holdings beneficially owns approximately 65.0% of our Class A common stock. Hamlet Holdings has the power to control our Board. Moreover, Hamlet Holdings has the ability to vote on any transaction that requires the approval of our stockholders, including the approval of significant corporate transactions such as mergers and the sale of substantially all of our assets. In addition, Hamlet Holdings, the members of which are comprised of individuals affiliated with the Sponsors, as of the date hereof beneficially owned a majority of Caesars Entertainment's common stock through an irrevocable proxy providing Hamlet Holdings with sole voting and sole dispositive power over those shares of stock that are held by funds affiliated with and controlled by the Sponsors and their co-investors, which gives them power to elect all of Caesars Entertainment's directors. As a result, even though an independent committee of the board of directors of Caesars Entertainment may make decisions with regard to development opportunities for CGP LLC, Hamlet Holdings is in a position to exert a significant influence over both of CAC and Caesars Entertainment and the direction of their business and operations.\nThe interests of Hamlet Holdings and the Sponsors could conflict with or differ from the interests of holders of our Class A common stock. Affiliates of the Sponsors are in the business of making or advising on investments in companies they hold, and may from time to time in the future acquire interests in or provide advice to businesses that directly or indirectly compete with certain portions of our business or are suppliers or customers of ours or may pursue acquisitions that may be complementary to our business, in which case and, as a result, those acquisition opportunities may not be available to us.\nThe concentration of ownership held by Hamlet Holdings could delay, defer or prevent a change of control of us or impede a merger, takeover or other business combination which another stockholder may otherwise view favorably. In addition, a sale of a substantial number of shares of stock in the future by Hamlet Holdings could cause our stock price to decline. So long\nas Hamlet Holdings continues to beneficially own a significant amount of the outstanding shares of our Class A common stock, Hamlet Holdings will continue to be able to exert strong influence over our decisions.\nOur stockholders are subject to extensive governmental regulation and if a stockholder is found unsuitable by the gaming authority, that stockholder would not be able to beneficially own our Class A common stock directly or indirectly and we will have the right to redeem the Class A common stock of such disqualified holder.\nIn many jurisdictions, gaming laws can require any of our stockholders to file an application, be investigated and qualify or have his, her or its suitability determined by gaming authorities. Gaming authorities have very broad discretion in determining whether an applicant should be deemed suitable. Subject to certain administrative proceeding requirements, the gaming regulators have the authority to deny any application or limit, condition, restrict, revoke or suspend any license, registration, finding of suitability or approval, or fine any person licensed, registered or found suitable or approved, for any cause deemed reasonable by the gaming authorities. For additional information on the criteria used in making determinations regarding suitability, see \"Gaming Regulation Overview\" in Exhibit 99.2 of the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2015.\nFor example, under Nevada gaming laws, each person who acquires, directly or indirectly, beneficial ownership of any voting security, or beneficial or record ownership of any non-voting security or any debt security, in a public corporation which is registered with the Nevada Gaming Commission, or the Gaming Commission, may be required to be found suitable if the Gaming Commission has reason to believe that his or her acquisition of that ownership, or his or her continued ownership in general, would be inconsistent with the declared public policy of Nevada, in the sole discretion of the Gaming Commission. Any person required by the Gaming Commission to be found suitable shall apply for a finding of suitability within 30 days after the Gaming Commission's request that he or she should do so and, together with his or her application for suitability, deposit with the GCB a sum of money which, in the sole discretion of the GCB, will be adequate to pay the anticipated costs and charges incurred in the investigation and processing of that application for suitability, and deposit such additional sums as are required by the GCB to pay final costs and charges.\nFurthermore, any person required by a gaming authority to be found suitable, who is found unsuitable by the gaming authority, may not hold directly or indirectly the beneficial ownership of any voting security or the beneficial or record ownership of any non-voting security or any debt security of any public corporation which is registered with the gaming authority beyond the time prescribed by the gaming authority. Such a finding could result in an owner of our securities being required to dispose of their securities at prices less than the price paid for such securities. A violation of the foregoing may constitute a criminal offense. A finding of unsuitability by a particular gaming authority impacts that person's ability to associate or affiliate with gaming licensees in that particular jurisdiction and could impact the person's ability to associate or affiliate with gaming licensees in other jurisdictions. The Certificate of Incorporation contains provisions establishing the right to redeem our Class A common stock held by disqualified holders if such holder is determined by any gaming regulatory agency to be unsuitable.\nMany jurisdictions also require any person who acquires beneficial ownership of more than a certain percentage of voting securities of a gaming company and, in some jurisdictions, non-voting securities, typically 5%, to report the acquisition to gaming authorities, and gaming authorities may require such holders to apply for qualification or a finding of suitability, subject to limited exceptions for \"institutional investors\" that hold a company's voting securities for investment purposes only. Under Maryland gaming laws, we may not sell or otherwise transfer more than 5% of the legal or beneficial interest in Horseshoe Baltimore without the approval of the Maryland Lottery and Gaming Control Commission, or the Maryland Commission, after the Maryland Commission determines that the transferee is qualified or grants the transferee an institutional investor waiver. Some jurisdictions may also limit the number of gaming licenses in which a person may hold an ownership or a controlling interest and in Maryland an individual or business entity may not own an interest in more than one video lottery facility. It is unclear whether and to what extent such prohibitions will apply to online real money gaming operations when and if such operations become legal in U.S. jurisdictions other than Nevada, New Jersey, and Delaware.\nYour percentage ownership in us may be diluted in the future.\nYour percentage ownership in CAC may be diluted in the future because of equity awards that may be granted to our directors, officers, employees and service providers in the future. We may decide to establish equity incentive plans that will provide for the grant of common stock-based equity awards to our directors, officers, employees and service providers. In addition, we may issue equity in order to raise capital or in connection with future acquisitions and strategic investments, which would dilute your percentage ownership.\nPursuant to the terms of the Amended Merger Agreement, it is anticipated that each share of our common stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the effective date of the merger will be converted into, and become exchangeable for, shares of CEC common stock in a ratio to ensure that holders of our common stock receive shares equal to 27% of the outstanding CEC common stock on a fully diluted basis. This will result in pro rata dilution to all holders of CAC common stock immediately prior to the closing of the Amended Merger Agreement.\nBecause we do not anticipate paying dividends on our Class A common stock in the foreseeable future, you should not expect to receive dividends on shares of our Class A common stock.\nWe have no present plans to pay cash dividends to our stockholders and, for the foreseeable future, intend to retain all of our earnings for use in our business. The declaration of any future dividends by us is within the discretion of our Board and will be dependent on our earnings, financial condition and capital requirements, as well as any other factors deemed relevant by our Board.\nWe are a parent company and our primary source of cash is and will be distributions from CGP LLC.\nWe are a parent company with limited business operations of our own. Our main asset is our units in CGP LLC. Accordingly, our primary sources of cash are dividends and distributions with respect to our ownership interests in CGP LLC. CGP LLC might not generate sufficient earnings and cash flow to pay dividends or distributions in the future.\nWe are a \"controlled company\" within the meaning of the NASDAQ Marketplace rules and, as a result, will qualify for, and intend to rely on, exemptions from certain corporate governance requirements.\nHamlet Holdings controls a majority of our voting Class A common stock. As a result, we are a \"controlled company\" within the meaning of the NASDAQ corporate governance standards. Under the NASDAQ Marketplace rules, a company of which more than 50% of the voting power is held by an individual, group or another company is a \"controlled company\" and we have elected not to comply with certain NASDAQ corporate governance requirements, including:\n\u2022\nthe requirement that we have a nominating and corporate governance committee that is composed entirely of independent directors;\n\u2022\nthe requirement that we have a compensation committee that is composed entirely of independent directors; and\n\u2022\nthe requirement for an annual performance evaluation of the nominating and corporate governance and compensation committees.\nAs a result of these exemptions, our nominating and corporate governance and compensation committees do not consist entirely of independent directors, and we are not required to have an annual performance evaluation of the nominating and corporate governance and compensation committees. Accordingly, a holder of our Class A common stock will not have the same protections afforded to stockholders of companies that are subject to all of the NASDAQ corporate governance requirements.\nOur bylaws and certificate of incorporation contain provisions that could discourage another company from acquiring us and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions of our bylaws and our certificate of incorporation may delay or prevent a merger or acquisition that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which you might otherwise receive a premium for your shares. In addition, these provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace or remove our directors. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nestablishing a classified board of directors;\n\u2022\nestablishing limitations on the removal of directors;\n\u2022\npermitting only an affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the Board to fix the number of directors;\n\u2022\nprohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n\u2022\nempowering only the board of directors to fill any vacancy on the board of directors, whether such vacancy occurs as a result of an increase in the number of directors or otherwise;\n\u2022\neliminating the ability of stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders;\n\u2022\nprohibiting stockholders from acting by written consent if the Company ceases to be a \"controlled company\" under the NASDAQ Marketplace rules; and\n\u2022\nestablishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings.\nTogether, these charter and statutory provisions could make the removal of management more difficult and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our common stock. Furthermore, the existence of the foregoing provisions, as well as the significant Class A Common Stock controlled by Hamlet Holdings, could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our Class A Common Stock. They could also deter potential acquirers of our company, thereby reducing the likelihood that you could receive a premium for your Class A Common Stock in an acquisition.\nWe are an \"emerging growth company\" and our possible election to delay adoption of new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies may result in our financial statements not being comparable to those of other public companies. As a result of this and other reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies, our Class A common stock may be less attractive to investors.\nWe are an emerging growth company, as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012 (the \"JOBS Act\"), and we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \"emerging growth companies,\" including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the \"Sarbanes-Oxley Act\"), reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In addition, Section 107 of the JOBS Act provides that an \"emerging growth company\" can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in Section 7(a)(2)(B) of the Securities Act for complying with new or revised accounting standards such that an \"emerging growth company\" can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies.\nWe have elected to delay such adoption of new or revised accounting standards, and as a result, we may not comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for non-emerging growth companies. As a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to the financial statements of other public companies.\nWe may take advantage of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer an \"emerging growth company.\" We will remain an \"emerging growth company\" until the earliest to occur of (i) the last day of the fiscal year during which our total annual gross revenues equal or exceed $1.0 billion, (ii) the last day of the fiscal year following the fifth anniversary of our initial public offering, (iii) the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt or (iv) the date on which we are deemed a \"large accelerated filer\" under Rule 12b-2 of the Exchange Act.\nWe cannot predict if investors will find our Class A common stock less attractive because we will rely on certain of these exemptions. If some investors find our Class A common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our Class A common stock and our stock price may be more volatile.\nAs a result of our becoming a company with publicly traded common stock, our expenses and administrative burden increased and will likely further increase particularly after we are no longer an \"emerging growth company\" as defined in the JOBS Act.\nAs a company with publicly traded common stock, we incur legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a company without a publicly traded equity security. In addition, our administrative staff is required to perform additional tasks. For example, we need to create or revise the roles and duties of our Board committees and retain a transfer agent. We are also required to hold an annual meeting for our stockholders, which will require us to expend resources to prepare, print and mail a proxy statement relating to the annual meeting.\nIn addition, changing laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and related regulations implemented by the SEC and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (\"Dodd-Frank\"), which amended the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, among other federal laws, are creating uncertainty for public companies, increasing legal and financial compliance costs and making some activities more time consuming. Dodd-Frank, signed into law on July 21, 2010, effects comprehensive changes to the regulation of financial services in the United States and will subject us to additional federal regulation. We cannot predict with any certainty the requirements of the regulations ultimately adopted or how Dodd-Frank and such regulations will impact the cost of compliance for a company with publicly traded common stock. We are currently evaluating and monitoring developments with respect to Dodd-Frank and other new and proposed rules and cannot predict or estimate the amount of the additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. We intend to invest resources to comply with evolving laws, regulations and standards, and this investment may result in increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management's time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. If our efforts to comply with new laws, regulations and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities related to practice, regulatory authorities may initiate legal proceedings against us and our business may be harmed. We also expect that being a company with publicly traded common stock, these new rules and regulations will make it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage. These factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified members of our Board, particularly to serve on our audit committee, and qualified executive officers.\nAs discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, as an \"emerging growth company\" as defined in the JOBS Act, we may take advantage of certain temporary exemptions from various reporting requirements, including, but not limited to, not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. When these exemptions cease to apply, we expect to incur additional expenses and devote increased management effort toward ensuring compliance with them. We cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur as a result of becoming a public company or the timing of such costs.\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENT PURSUANT TO THE PRIVATE\nSECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995\nThis Form 10-K contains or may contain \"forward-looking statements\" intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify these statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or current facts. You should not place undue reliance on such statements because they are subject to numerous uncertainties and factors relating to our operations and business environment, all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control. Forward-looking statements include information concerning our possible or assumed future results of operations, including descriptions of our business strategy. These statements contain words such as \"may,\" \"will,\" \"project,\" \"might,\" \"expect,\" \"believe,\" \"anticipate,\" \"intend,\" \"could,\" \"would,\" \"estimate,\" \"continue,\" or \"pursue,\" or the negative of these words or other words or expressions of similar meaning that may identify forward-looking statements and are found at various places throughout this Form 10-K. These forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those relating to future actions, new projects, strategies, future performance, the outcome of contingencies such as legal proceedings, and future financial results, wherever they occur in this Form 10-K, are based on our current expectations about future events and are estimates reflecting the best judgment of CAC and CGP LLC's management and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the forward-looking statements.\nInvestors are cautioned that forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or results and involve risks and uncertainties that cannot be predicted or quantified, and, consequently, the actual performance of CAC and CGP LLC may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements.

CAC and CGP LLC disclaim any obligation to update the forward-looking statements. You are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date stated or, if no date is stated, as of the date of this Form 10-K.", "PERMNO": 14304, "SIC": 6799, "TIC": "CACQ"}
