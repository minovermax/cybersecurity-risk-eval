{"cik": "924515", "company": "GUIDED THERAPEUTICS INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-04-07", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to the other information in this annual report on Form 10-K, the following risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating us.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nAlthough we will be required to raise additional funds in 2021, there is no assurance that such funds can be raised on terms that we would find acceptable, on a timely basis, or at all.\nAdditional debt or equity financing will be required for us to continue as a going concern. We may seek to obtain additional funds for the financing of our cervical cancer detection business through additional debt or equity financings and/or new collaborative arrangements. Management believes that additional financing, if obtainable, will be sufficient to support planned operations only for a limited period. Management has implemented operating actions to reduce cash requirements. Any required additional funding may not be available on terms attractive to us, on a timely basis, or at all. If we cannot obtain additional funds or achieve profitability, we may not be able to continue as a going concern.\nBecause we must obtain additional funds through financing transactions or through new collaborative arrangements in order to grow the revenues of our cervical cancer detection product line, there exists substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Therefore, it will be necessary to raise additional funds. There can be no assurance that we will be able to raise these additional funds. If we do not secure additional funding when needed, we will be unable to conduct all of our product development efforts as planned, which may cause us to alter our business plan in relation to the development of our products. Even if we obtain additional funding, we will need to achieve profitability thereafter.\nOur independent registered public accountants\u2019 report on our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020, indicated that there was substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern because we had suffered recurring losses from operations and had an accumulated deficit of $140.0 million at December 31, 2020 summarized as follows:\nOur management has implemented reductions in operating expenditures and reductions in some development activities. We have determined to make cervical cancer detection the focus of our business. We are managing the development of our other programs only when funds are made available to us via grants or contracts with government entities or strategic partners. However, there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement or continue these plans.\nIf we cannot obtain additional funds when needed, we will not be able to implement our business plan.\nWe require substantial additional capital to develop our products, including completing product testing and clinical trials, obtaining all required regulatory approvals and clearances, beginning and scaling up manufacturing, and marketing our products. We have historically financed our operations though the public and private sale of debt and equity, funding from collaborative arrangements, and grants. Any failure to achieve adequate funding in a timely fashion would delay our development programs and could lead to abandonment of our business plan. To the extent we cannot obtain additional funding, our ability to continue to manufacture and sell our current products, or develop and introduce new products to market, will be limited. Further, financing our operations through the public or private sale of debt or equity may involve restrictive covenants or other provisions that could limit how we conduct our business or finance our operations. Financing our operations through collaborative arrangements generally means that the obligations of the collaborative partner to fund our expenditures are largely discretionary and depend on a number of factors, including our ability to meet specified milestones in the development and testing of the relevant product. We may not be able to obtain an acceptable collaboration partner, and even if we do, we may not be able to meet these milestones, or the collaborative partner may not continue to fund our expenditures.\nWe do not have a long operating history, especially in the cancer detection field, which makes it difficult to evaluate our business.\nAlthough we have been in existence since 1992, we have only recently begun to commercialize our cervical cancer detection technology. Because limited historical information is available on our revenue trends and manufacturing costs, it is difficult to evaluate our business. Our prospects must be considered in light of the substantial risks, expenses, uncertainties and difficulties encountered by entrants into the medical device industry, which is characterized by increasing intense competition and a high failure rate.\nWe have a history of losses, and we expect losses to continue.\nWe have never been profitable and we have had operating losses since our inception. We expect our operating losses to continue as we continue to expend substantial resources to complete commercialization of our products, obtain regulatory clearances or approvals; build our marketing, sales, manufacturing and finance capabilities, and conduct further research and development. The further development and commercialization of our products will require substantial development, regulatory, sales and marketing, manufacturing and other expenditures. We have only generated limited revenues from product sales. Our accumulated deficit was approximately $140.0 million at December 31, 2020.\nWe file federal taxes that may be subject to audit and adjustments from time to time.\nAlthough we have been experiencing recurring losses, we are obligated to file tax returns for compliance with IRS regulations and that of applicable state jurisdictions. We have filed our 2019 federal and state corporate tax returns. At December 31, 2020 and 2019, we have approximately $71.4 and $77.5 million of net operating losses, respectively. This net operating loss will be eligible to be carried forward for tax purposes at federal and applicable states level, but the use of such net operating losses may be subject to restrictions under applicable tax law. A full valuation allowance has been recorded related to the deferred tax assets generated from the net operating losses.\nWe are currently delinquent with some of our federal payroll and unemployment taxes and applicable state payroll and unemployment tax filings\nIn prior years we have been delinquent in filing our payroll and unemployment taxes. We have established payment plans with the IRS and the State of Georgia. We have been able to abate some of the penalties associated with the late filings. We will attempt to file on time and to make payments to federal state agencies on time, but we cannot guarantee that we will have adequate funds or the personnel necessary to make these payments and filings.\nWe have received Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans and must retain PPP loan documentation\nAccording to the rules of the SBA, the Company is required to retain PPP Loan documentation for six years after the date the loan is forgiven or repaid in full, and permit authorized representatives of the SBA, including representatives of its Office of Inspector General, to access such files upon request. Should the SBA conduct such a review and reject all or some of the Company\u2019s judgments pertaining to satisfying PPP Loan eligibility or forgiveness conditions, the Company may be required to adjust previously reported amounts and disclosures in the financial statements.\nOur ability to sell our products is controlled by government regulations, and we may not be able to obtain any necessary clearances or approvals.\nThe design, manufacturing, labeling, distribution and marketing of medical device products are subject to extensive and rigorous government regulation in most of the markets in which we sell, or plan to sell, our products, which can be expensive and uncertain and can cause lengthy delays before we can begin selling our products in those markets.\nIn foreign countries, including European countries, we are subject to government regulation, which could delay or prevent our ability to sell our products in those jurisdictions.\nIn order for us to market our products in Europe and some other international jurisdictions, we and our distributors and agents must obtain required regulatory registrations or approvals. We must also comply with extensive regulations regarding safety, efficacy and quality in those jurisdictions. We may not be able to obtain the required regulatory registrations or approvals, or we may be required to incur significant costs in obtaining or maintaining any regulatory registrations or approvals we receive. Delays in obtaining any registrations or approvals required for marketing our products, failure to receive these registrations or approvals, or future loss of previously obtained registrations or approvals would limit our ability to sell our products internationally. For example, international regulatory bodies have adopted various regulations governing product standards, packaging requirements, labeling requirements, import restrictions, tariff regulations, duties and tax requirements. These regulations vary from country to country. In 2020, our contract manufacturer, Newmars Medical Technology, based in Budapest Hungary, successfully underwent and passed an inspection and re-filing for ISO 13485:2016 and the obtained the CE Mark for LuViva, which is an international symbol of quality and compliance with applicable European medical device directives. The new ISO and CE Mark mean that LuViva can continue to be sold in the European Union. Failure to maintain ISO 13485:2016 certification or CE mark certification or other international regulatory approvals would prevent us from selling in some countries in the European Union.\nIn the United States, we are subject to regulation by the U.S. FDA, which could prevent us from selling our products domestically.\nIn order for us to market our products in the United States, we must obtain clearance or approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or U.S. FDA. We cannot be sure that:\n\u25cf\nwe, or any collaborative partner, will make timely filings with the U.S. FDA;\n\u25cf\nthe U.S. FDA will act favorably or quickly on these submissions;\n\u25cf\nwe will not be required to submit additional information or perform additional clinical studies; or\n\u25cf\nwe will not face other significant difficulties and costs necessary to obtain U.S. FDA clearance or approval.\nIt can take several years from initial filing of a PMA application and require the submission of extensive supporting data and clinical information. The U.S. FDA may impose strict labeling or other requirements as a condition of its clearance or approval, any of which could limit our ability to market our products domestically. Further, if we wish to modify a product after U.S. FDA approval of a PMA application, including changes in indications or other modifications that could affect safety and efficacy, additional clearances or approvals will be required from the U.S. FDA. Any request by the U.S. FDA for additional data, or any requirement by the U.S. FDA that we conduct additional clinical studies, could result in a significant delay in bringing our products to market domestically and require substantial additional research and other expenditures. Similarly, any labeling or other conditions or restrictions imposed by the U.S. FDA could hinder our ability to effectively market our products domestically. Further, there may be new U.S. FDA policies or changes in U.S. FDA policies that could be adverse to us.\nEven if we obtain clearance or approval to sell our products, we are subject to ongoing requirements and inspections that could lead to the restriction, suspension or revocation of our clearance.\nWe, as well as any potential collaborative partners, will be required to adhere to applicable regulations in the markets in which we operate and sell our products, regarding good manufacturing practice, which include testing, control, and documentation requirements. Ongoing compliance with good manufacturing practice and other applicable regulatory requirements will be strictly enforced applicable regulatory agencies. Failure to comply with these regulatory requirements could result in, among other things, warning letters, fines, injunctions, civil penalties, recall or seizure of products, total or partial suspension of production, failure to obtain premarket clearance or premarket approval for devices, withdrawal of approvals previously obtained, and criminal prosecution. The restriction, suspension or revocation of regulatory approvals or any other failure to comply with regulatory requirements would limit our ability to operate and could increase our costs.\nWe depend on a limited number of distributors and any reduction, delay or cancellation of an order from these distributors or the loss of any of these distributors could cause our revenue to decline.\nEach year we have had one or a few distributors that have accounted for substantially all of our limited revenues. As a result, the termination of a purchase order with any one of these distributors may result in the loss of substantially all of our revenues. We are constantly working to develop new relationships with existing or new distributors, but despite these efforts we may not be successful at generating new orders to maintain similar revenues as current purchase orders are filled. In addition, since a significant portion of our revenues is derived from a relatively few distributors, any financial difficulties experienced by any one of these distributors, or any delay in receiving payments from any one of these distributors, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nTo successfully market and sell our products internationally, we must address many issues with which we have limited experience.\nAll of our sales of LuViva to date have been to distributors outside of the United States. We expect that substantially all of our business will continue to come from sales in foreign markets, through increased penetration in countries where we currently sell LuViva, combined with expansion into new international markets. However, international sales are subject to a number of risks, including:\n\u25cf difficulties in staffing and managing international operations;\n\u25cf difficulties in penetrating markets in which our competitors\u2019 products may be more established;\n\u25cf reduced or no protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;\n\u25cf export restrictions, trade regulations and foreign tax laws;\n\u25cf fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates;\n\u25cf foreign certification and regulatory clearance or approval requirements;\n\u25cf difficulties in developing effective marketing campaigns for unfamiliar, foreign countries;\n\u25cf customs clearance and shipping delays;\n\u25cf political and economic instability; and\n\u25cf preference for locally produced products.\nIf one or more of these risks were realized, it could require us to dedicate significant resources to remedy the situation, and even if we are able to find a solution, our revenues may still decline and expenses increase.\nTo market and sell LuViva internationally, we depend on distributors and they may not be successful.\nWe currently depend almost exclusively on third-party distributors to sell and service LuViva internationally and to train our international distributors, and if these distributors terminate their relationships with us or under-perform, we may be unable to maintain or increase our level of international revenue. We will also need to engage additional international distributors to grow our business and expand the territories in which we sell LuViva. Distributors may not commit the necessary resources to market, sell and service LuViva to the level of our expectations. If current or future distributors do not perform adequately, or if we are unable to engage distributors in particular geographic areas, our revenue from international operations will be adversely affected.\nThe coronavirus outbreak could adversely impact our business.\nIn December 2019, it was first reported that there had been an outbreak of a novel strain of coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, in China. As the coronavirus continues to spread outside of China, including throughout the United States, we may experience disruptions that could severely impact our business and regulatory filings, including:\n\u25cf\nimpact to the financial markets;\n\u25cf\ndisruption in our ability to sell our product in foreign markets;\n\u25cf\ndisruption on our ability to source materials;\n\u25cf\ndisruption in our ability to manufacture our devices and disposables;\n\u25cf\ndelays or difficulties in completing our regulatory work;\n\u25cf\nFDA has reduced the number of staff working on non-Covid 19 related products;\n\u25cf\nlimitations on our employee resources ability to work, including because of sickness of employees or their families or the desire of employees to avoid contact with large groups of people; and\n\u25cf\nadditional repercussions on our ability to operate our business.\nThe global outbreak of coronavirus continues to rapidly evolve. The extent to which the coronavirus impacts our results will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, including new information which may emerge concerning the severity of the coronavirus, the ultimate geographic spread of the coronavirus, the duration of the outbreak, travel restrictions imposed by countries we conduct our business, business closures or business disruption in the world, a reduction in time spent out of home and the actions taken throughout the world, including in our markets, to contain the coronavirus or treat its impact. The future impact of the outbreak is highly uncertain and cannot be predicted, and we cannot provide any assurance that the outbreak will not have a material adverse impact on our operations or future results or filings with regulatory health authorities. The extent of the impact to us, if any, will depend on future developments, including actions taken to contain the coronavirus.\nRisks Related to Our Intellectual Property\nOur success largely depends on our ability to maintain and protect the proprietary information on which we base our products.\nOur success depends in large part upon our ability to maintain and protect the proprietary nature of our technology through the patent process, as well as our ability to license from other\u2019s patents and patent applications necessary to develop our products. If any of our patents are successfully challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or our right or ability to manufacture our products was to be limited, our ability to continue to manufacture and market our products could be adversely affected. In addition to patents, we rely on trade secrets and proprietary know-how, which we seek to protect, in part, through confidentiality and proprietary information agreements. The other parties to these agreements may breach these provisions, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. Additionally, our trade secrets could otherwise become known to or be independently developed by competitors.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we have been issued, or have rights to, 10 U.S. patents (including those under license). In addition, we have filed for, or have rights to, two U.S. patents (including those under license) that are still pending. We also have three granted patents that apply to our interstitial fluid analysis system as well as seven international patents that apply to our noninvasive technologies. There are additional international patents and pending applications. One or more of the patents we hold directly or license from third parties, including those for our cervical cancer detection products, may be successfully challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or we may otherwise be unable to rely on these patents. These risks are also present for the process we use or will use for manufacturing our products. In addition, our competitors, many of whom have substantial resources and have made substantial investments in competing technologies, may apply for and obtain patents that prevent, limit or interfere with our ability to make, use and sell our products, either in the United States or in international markets.\nThe medical device industry has been characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights. In addition, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, may institute interference proceedings. The defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits, USPTO proceedings and related legal and administrative proceedings are both costly and time consuming. Moreover, we may need to litigate to enforce our patents, to protect our trade secrets or know-how, or to determine the enforceability, scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others. Any litigation or interference proceedings involving us may require us to incur substantial legal and other fees and expenses and may require some of our employees to devote all or a substantial portion of their time to the proceedings. An adverse determination in the proceedings could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties, require us to seek licenses from third parties or prevent us from selling our products in some or all markets. We may not be able to reach a satisfactory settlement of any dispute by licensing necessary patents or other intellectual property. Even if we reached a settlement, the settlement process may be expensive and time consuming, and the terms of the settlement may require us to pay substantial royalties. An adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding or the failure to obtain a necessary license could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products.\nWe may be unable to commercialize our products if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights, and we may be liable for significant costs and damages if we face a claim of intellectual property infringement by a third party.\nOur near and long-term prospects depend in part on our ability to obtain and maintain patents, protect trade secrets and operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others. In the absence of patent and trade secret protection, competitors may adversely affect our business by independently developing and marketing substantially equivalent or superior products and technology, possibly at lower prices. We could also incur substantial costs in litigation and suffer diversion of attention of technical and management personnel if we are required to defend ourselves in intellectual property infringement suits brought by third parties, with or without merit, or if we are required to initiate litigation against others to protect or assert our intellectual property rights. Moreover, any such litigation may not be resolved in our favor.\nAlthough we and our licensors have filed various patent applications covering the uses of our product candidates, patents may not be issued from the patent applications already filed or from applications that we might file in the future. Moreover, the patent position of companies in the pharmaceutical industry generally involves complex legal and factual questions and has been the subject of much litigation. Any patents we own or license, now or in the future, may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. To date, no consistent policy has been developed in the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (the \u201cPTO\u201d) regarding the breadth of claims allowed in biotechnology patents.\nIn addition, because patent applications in the U.S. are maintained in secrecy until patent applications publish or patents issue, and because publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries, we cannot be certain that we and our licensors are the first creators of inventions covered by any licensed patent applications or patents or that we or they are the first to file. The PTO may commence interference proceedings involving patents or patent applications, in which the question of first inventorship is contested. Accordingly, the patents owned or licensed to us may not be valid or may not afford us protection against competitors with similar technology, and the patent applications licensed to us may not result in the issuance of patents.\nIt is also possible that our owned and licensed technologies may infringe on patents or other rights owned by others, and licenses to which may not be available to us. We may be unable to obtain a license under such patent on terms favorable to us, if at all. We may have to alter our products or processes, pay licensing fees or cease activities altogether because of patent rights of third parties.\nIn addition to the products for which we have patents or have filed patent applications, we rely upon unpatented proprietary technology and may not be able to meaningfully protect our rights with regard to that unpatented proprietary technology. Furthermore, to the extent that consultants, key employees or other third parties apply technological information developed by them or by others to any of our proposed projects, disputes may arise as to the proprietary rights to this information, which may not be resolved in our favor.\nWe may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents, which could be expensive and time consuming.\nThe pharmaceutical industry has been characterized by extensive litigation regarding patents and other intellectual property rights, and companies have employed intellectual property litigation to gain a competitive advantage. We may become subject to infringement claims or litigation arising out of patents and pending applications of our competitors, or additional interference proceedings declared by the PTO to determine the priority of inventions. The defense and prosecution of intellectual property suits, PTO proceedings, and related legal and administrative proceedings are costly and time-consuming to pursue, and their outcome is uncertain. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our issued patents, to protect our trade secrets and know-how, or to determine the enforceability, scope, and validity of the proprietary rights of others. An adverse determination in litigation or interference proceedings to which we may become a party could subject us to significant liabilities, require us to obtain licenses from third parties, or restrict or prevent us from selling our products in certain markets. Although patent and intellectual property disputes might be settled through licensing or similar arrangements, the costs associated with such arrangements may be substantial and could include our paying large fixed payments and ongoing royalties. Furthermore, the necessary licenses may not be available on satisfactory terms or at all.\nCompetitors may infringe our patents, and we may file infringement claims to counter infringement or unauthorized use. This can be expensive, particularly for a company of our size, and time-consuming. In addition, in an infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent of ours is not valid or is unenforceable or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do not cover its technology. An adverse determination of any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly.\nAlso, a third party may assert that our patents are invalid and/or unenforceable. There are no unresolved communications, allegations, complaints or threats of litigation related to the possibility that our patents are invalid or unenforceable. Any litigation or claims against us, whether or not merited, may result in substantial costs, place a significant strain on our financial resources, divert the attention of management and harm our reputation. An adverse decision in litigation could result in inadequate protection for our product candidates and/or reduce the value of any license agreements we have with third parties.\nInterference proceedings brought before the PTO may be necessary to determine priority of invention with respect to our patents or patent applications. During an interference proceeding, it may be determined that we do not have priority of invention for one or more aspects in our patents or patent applications and could result in the invalidation in part or whole of a patent or could put a patent application at risk of not issuing. Even if successful, an interference proceeding may result in substantial costs and distraction to our management.\nFurthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation or interference proceedings, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure. In addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments. If investors perceive these results to be negative, the price of our common stock could be adversely affected.\nIf we infringe the rights of third parties, we could be prevented from selling products, forced to pay damages, and defend against litigation.\nIf our products, methods, processes and other technologies infringe the proprietary rights of other parties, we could incur substantial costs and we may have to: obtain licenses, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, if at all; abandon an infringing product candidate; redesign our products or processes to avoid infringement; stop using the subject matter claimed in the patents held by others; pay damages; and/or defend litigation or administrative proceedings which may be costly whether we win or lose, and which could result in a substantial diversion of our financial and management resources.\nRisks Related to Our Sales Strategy\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient sales revenues to sustain our growth and strategy plans.\nOur cervical cancer diagnostic activities have been financed to date through a combination of government grants, strategic partners and direct investment. Growing revenues for this product are the main focus of our business. In order to effectively market the cervical cancer detection product, additional capital will be needed.\nAdditional product lines involve the modification of the cervical cancer detection technology for use in other cancers. These product lines are only in the earliest stages of research and development and are currently not projected to reach market for several years. Our goal is to receive enough funding from government grants and contracts, as well as payments from strategic partners, to fund development of these product lines without diverting funds or other necessary resources from the cervical cancer program.\nBecause our products, which use different technology or apply technology in different ways than other medical devices, are or will be new to the market, we may not be successful in launching our products and our operations and growth would be adversely affected.\nOur products are based on new methods of cancer detection. If our products do not achieve significant market acceptance, our sales will be limited and our financial condition may suffer. Physicians and individuals may not recommend or use our products unless they determine that these products are an attractive alternative to current tests that have a long history of safe and effective use. To date, our products have been used by only a limited number of people, and few independent studies regarding our products have been published. The lack of independent studies limits the ability of doctors or consumers to compare our products to conventional products.\nIf we are unable to compete effectively in the highly competitive medical device industry, our future growth and operating results will suffer.\nThe medical device industry in general and the markets in which we expect to offer products in particular, are intensely competitive. Many of our competitors have substantially greater financial, research, technical, manufacturing, marketing and distribution resources than we do and have greater name recognition and lengthier operating histories in the health care industry. We may not be able to effectively compete against these and other competitors. A number of competitors are currently marketing traditional laboratory-based tests for cervical cancer screening and diagnosis. These tests are widely accepted in the health care industry and have a long history of accurate and effective use. Further, if our products are not available at competitive prices, health care administrators who are subject to increasing pressures to reduce costs may not elect to purchase them. Also, a number of companies have announced that they are developing, or have introduced, products that permit non-invasive and less invasive cancer detection. Accordingly, competition in this area is expected to increase.\nFurthermore, our competitors may succeed in developing, either before or after the development and commercialization of our products, devices and technologies that permit more efficient, less expensive non-invasive and less invasive cancer detection. It is also possible that one or more pharmaceutical or other health care companies will develop therapeutic drugs, treatments or other products that will substantially reduce the prevalence of cancers or otherwise render our products obsolete.\nWe have limited manufacturing experience, which could limit our growth.\nWe do not have manufacturing experience that would enable us to make products in the volumes that would be necessary for us to achieve significant commercial sales, and we rely upon our suppliers. In addition, we may not be able to establish and maintain reliable, efficient, full scale manufacturing at commercially reasonable costs in a timely fashion. Difficulties we encounter in manufacturing scale-up, or our failure to implement and maintain our manufacturing facilities in accordance with good manufacturing practice regulations, international quality standards or other regulatory requirements, could result in a delay or termination of production. In the past, we have had substantial difficulties in establishing and maintaining manufacturing for our products and those difficulties impacted our ability to increase sales. Companies often encounter difficulties in scaling up production, including problems involving production yield, quality control and assurance, and shortages of qualified personnel.\nSince we rely on sole source suppliers for several of the components used in our products, any failure of those suppliers to perform would hurt our operations.\nSeveral of the components used in our products or planned products, are available from only one supplier, and substitutes for these components could not be obtained easily or would require substantial modifications to our products. Any significant problem experienced by one of our sole source suppliers may result in a delay or interruption in the supply of components to us until that supplier cures the problem or an alternative source of the component is located and qualified. Any delay or interruption would likely lead to a delay or interruption in our manufacturing operations. For our products that require premarket approval, the inclusion of substitute components could require us to qualify the new supplier with the appropriate government regulatory authorities. Alternatively, for our products that qualify for premarket notification, the substitute components must meet our product specifications.\nBecause we operate in an industry with significant product liability risk, and we have not specifically insured against this risk, we may be subject to substantial claims against our products.\nThe development, manufacture and sale of medical products entail significant risks of product liability claims. We currently have no product liability insurance coverage beyond that provided by our general liability insurance. Accordingly, we may not be adequately protected from any liabilities, including any adverse judgments or settlements, we might incur in connection with the development, clinical testing, manufacture and sale of our products. A successful product liability claim, or series of claims brought against us that result in an adverse judgment against or settlement by us in excess of any insurance coverage could seriously harm our financial condition or reputation. In addition, product liability insurance is expensive and may not be available to us on acceptable terms, if at all.\nThe availability of third party reimbursement for our products is uncertain, which may limit consumer use and the market for our products.\nIn the United States and elsewhere, sales of medical products are dependent, in part, on the ability of consumers of these products to obtain reimbursement for all or a portion of their cost from third-party payors, such as government and private insurance plans. Any inability of patients, hospitals, physicians and other users of our products to obtain sufficient reimbursement from third-party payors for our products, or adverse changes in relevant governmental policies or the policies of private third-party payors regarding reimbursement for these products, could limit our ability to sell our products on a competitive basis. We are unable to predict what changes will be made in the reimbursement methods used by third-party health care payors. Moreover, third-party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medical products and services, and some health care providers are gradually adopting a managed care system in which the providers contract to provide comprehensive health care services for a fixed cost per person. Patients, hospitals and physicians may not be able to justify the use of our products by the attendant cost savings and clinical benefits that we believe will be derived from the use of our products, and therefore may not be able to obtain third-party reimbursement.\nReimbursement and health care payment systems in international markets vary significantly by country and include both government-sponsored health care and private insurance. We may not be able to obtain approvals for reimbursement from these international third-party payors in a timely manner, if at all. Any failure to receive international reimbursement approvals could have an adverse effect on market acceptance of our products in the international markets in which approvals are sought.\nWe have a substantial amount of indebtedness, which may adversely affect our cash flow and our ability to operate our business.\nOur outstanding indebtedness, which is considered notes payable, accounts payable and accrued liabilities, was $12.2 million at December 31, 2020.\nThe terms of our indebtedness could have negative consequences to us, such as:\n\u25cf\nwe may be unable to obtain additional financing to fund working capital, operating losses, capital expenditures or acquisitions on terms acceptable to us, or at all;\n\u25cf\nthe amount of our interest expense may increase if we are unable to make payments when due;\n\u25cf\nour assets might be subject to foreclosure if we default on our secured debt (see \u201c-We have outstanding debt that is collateralized by a general security interest in all of our assets, including our intellectual property. If we were to fail to repay the debt when due, the holders would have the right to foreclose on these assets.\u201d);\n\u25cf\nour vendors or employees may, and some have, instituted proceedings to collect on amounts owed them;\n\u25cf\nwe have to use a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to repay our indebtedness, including ordinary course accounts payable and accrued payroll liabilities, which reduces the amount of money we have for future operations, working capital, inventory, expansion, or general corporate or other business activities; and\n\u25cf\nwe may be unable to refinance our indebtedness on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nOur ability to meet our debt obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by financial, business, economic, regulatory and other factors. We will be unable to control many of these factors, such as economic conditions. We cannot be certain that our earnings will be sufficient to allow us to pay the principal and interest on our debt and meet any other obligations. If we do not have enough money to service our debt, we may be required, but unable, to refinance all or part of our existing debt, sell assets, borrow money or raise equity on terms acceptable to us, if at all.\nWe have outstanding debt that is collateralized by a general security interest in all of our assets, including our intellectual property. If we were to fail to repay the debt when due, the holders would have the right to foreclose on these assets.\nAt April 5, 2021, we had notes outstanding that are collateralized by a security interest in our current and future inventory and accounts receivable. We also had a note outstanding that is collateralized by a security interest in all of our assets, including our intellectual property. When the debt is repaid, the holders\u2019 security interests on our assets will be extinguished. However, if an event of default occurs under the notes prior to their repayment, the holders may exercise their rights to foreclose on these secured assets for the payment of these obligations. Under \u201ccross-default\u201d provisions in each of the notes, an event of default under one note is automatically an event of default under the other notes. Any such default and resulting foreclosure would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to restrictive covenants under the terms of our outstanding secured debt. If we were to default under the terms of these covenants, the holders would have the right to foreclose on the assets that secure the debt.\nThe instruments governing our outstanding secured debt contain restrictive covenants. For example, our senior secured convertible note prohibits us from incurring additional indebtedness for borrowed money, repurchasing any outstanding shares of our common stock, or paying any dividends on our capital stock, in each case without the note holder's prior written consent, If we were to breach any of these covenants, the holder could declare an event of default on the note, and exercise its rights to foreclose on the assets securing the note.\nOur success depends on our ability to attract and retain scientific, technical, managerial and finance personnel.\nOur ability to operate successfully and manage our future growth depends in significant part upon the continued service of key scientific, technical, managerial and finance personnel, as well as our ability to attract and retain additional highly qualified personnel in these fields. We may not be able to attract and retain key employees when necessary, which would limit our operations and growth. In addition, if we are able to successfully develop and commercialize our products, we will need to hire additional scientific, technical, marketing, managerial and finance personnel. We face intense competition for qualified personnel in these areas, many of whom are often subject to competing employment offers.\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation that authorize the issuance of additional shares of preferred stock may make it more difficult for a third party to effect a change in control.\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes our board of directors to issue up to 5.0 million shares of preferred stock. Our undesignated shares of preferred stock may be issued in one or more series, the terms of which may be determined by the board without further stockholder action. These terms may include, among other terms, voting rights, including the right to vote as a series on particular matters, preferences as to liquidation and dividends, repurchase rights, conversion rights, redemption rights and sinking fund provisions. The issuance of any preferred stock could diminish the rights of holders of our common stock, and therefore could reduce the value of our common stock. In addition, specific rights granted to future holders of preferred stock could be used to restrict our ability to merge with or sell assets to a third party. The ability of our board to issue preferred stock could make it more difficult, delay, discourage, prevent or make it more costly to acquire or effect a change in control, which in turn could prevent our stockholders from recognizing a gain in the event that a favorable offer is extended and could materially and negatively affect the market price of our common stock.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOn March 29, 2019, a 1:800 reverse stock split of all of our issued and outstanding common stock was implemented. There are risks associated with a reverse stock split.\nOn March 29, 2019, a 1:800 reverse stock split of all of our issued and outstanding common stock was implemented. As a result of the reverse stock split, every 800 shares of issued and outstanding common stock were converted into 1 share of common stock. All fractional shares created by the reverse stock split were rounded to the nearest whole share. The number of authorized shares of common stock did not change.\nThere are certain risks associated with the reverse stock split, including the following:\n\u25cf\nWe have additional authorized shares of common stock that the board could issue in future without stockholder approval, and such additional shares could be issued, among other purposes, in financing transactions or to resist or frustrate a third-party transaction that is favored by a majority of the independent stockholders. This could have an anti-takeover effect, in that additional shares could be issued, within the limits imposed by applicable law, in one or more transactions that could make a change in control or takeover of us more difficult.\n\u25cf\nThere can be no assurance that the reverse stock split will achieve the benefits that we hope it will achieve. The total market capitalization of our common stock after the reverse stock split may be lower than the total market capitalization before the reverse stock split.\nThe reverse stock split may decrease the liquidity of the shares of our common stock.\nThe liquidity of the shares of our common stock may be affected adversely by the reverse stock split given the reduced number of shares that were outstanding immediately following the reverse stock split, especially if the market price of our common stock does not increase as a result of the reverse stock split. In addition, the reverse stock split may have increased the number of stockholders who own odd lots of our common stock, creating the potential for such stockholders to experience an increase in the cost of selling their shares and greater difficulty effecting such sales.\nFollowing the reverse stock split, the resulting market price of our common stock may not attract new investors, including institutional investors, and may not satisfy the investing requirements of those investors. Consequently, the trading liquidity of our common stock may not improve.\nAlthough we believe that a higher market price of our common stock may help generate greater or broader investor interest, there can be no assurance that the reverse stock split will result in a share price that will attract new investors, including institutional investors. In addition, there can be no assurance that the market price of our common stock will satisfy the investing requirements of those investors. As a result, the trading liquidity of our common stock may not necessarily improve.\nThe number of shares of our common stock issuable upon the conversion of our outstanding convertible debt and preferred stock or exercise of outstanding warrants and options is substantial.\nAs of April 5, 2021, our outstanding convertible debt was convertible into an aggregate of 19,500,000 shares of our common stock, and the outstanding shares of our Series C, Series C1, Series C2, Series D, Series E, and Series F preferred stock were convertible into an aggregate of 39,510,000 shares of common stock. Also, as of that date we had warrants outstanding that were exercisable for an aggregate of 28,520,275 shares, contractual obligations to issue 2,132 shares, and outstanding options to purchase 1,800,029 shares. The shares of common stock issuable upon conversion or exercise of these securities would have constituted approximately 97.0% of the total number of shares of common stock then issued and outstanding.\nFurther, under the terms of our convertible debt and preferred stock, as well as certain of our outstanding warrants, the conversion price or exercise price, as the case may be, could be adjusted downward, causing substantial dilution. See \u201c-Adjustments to the conversion price for our convertible debt and preferred stock, and the exercise price for certain of our warrants, will dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders.\u201d\nAdjustments to the conversion price of our convertible debt and preferred stock, and the exercise price for certain of our warrants, will dilute the ownership interests of our existing stockholders.\nUnder the terms of a portion of our convertible debt, the conversion price fluctuates with the market price of our common stock. Additionally, under the terms of our Series C preferred stock, any dividends we choose to pay in shares of our common stock will be calculated based on the then-current market price of our common stock. Accordingly, if the market price of our common stock decreases, the number of shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of the convertible debt or upon payment of dividends on our outstanding Series C preferred stock will increase, and may result in the issuance of a significant number of additional shares of our common stock.\nUnder the terms of our preferred stock and certain of our convertible notes and outstanding warrants, the conversion price or exercise price will be lowered if we issue common stock at a per share price below the then-conversion price or then-exercise price for those securities. Reductions in the conversion price or exercise price would result in the issuance of a significant number of additional shares of our common stock upon conversion or exercise, which would result in dilution in the value of the shares of our outstanding common stock and the voting power represented thereby.\nOur stock is thinly traded, so you may be unable to sell at or near ask prices or at all.\nThe shares of our common stock are only quoted in the OTCQB marketplace. Shares of our common stock are thinly traded, meaning that the number of persons interested in purchasing our common shares at or near ask prices at any given time may be relatively small or non-existent. This situation is attributable to a number of factors, including:\n\u25cf\nwe are a small company that is relatively unknown to stock analysts, stock brokers, institutional investors and others in the investment community that generate or influence sales volume; and\n\u25cf\nstock analysts, stock brokers and institutional investors may be risk-averse and be reluctant to follow a company such as ours that faces substantial doubt about its ability to continue as a going concern or to purchase or recommend the purchase of our shares until such time as we became more viable.\nAs a consequence, our stock price may not reflect an actual or perceived value. Also, there may be periods of several days or more when trading activity in our shares is minimal or non-existent, as compared to a seasoned issuer that has a large and steady volume of trading activity that will generally support continuous sales without an adverse effect on share price. A broader or more active public trading market for our common shares may not develop or if developed, may not be sustained. Due to these conditions, you may not be able to sell your shares at or near ask prices or at all if you need money or otherwise desire to liquidate your shares.\nTrading in our common stock is subject to special sales practices and may be difficult to sell.\nOur common stock is subject to the Securities and Exchange Commission\u2019s \u201cpenny stock\u201d rule, which imposes special sales practice requirements upon broker-dealers who sell such securities to persons other than established distributors or accredited investors. Penny stocks are generally defined to be an equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share. For transactions covered by the rule, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchaser and receive the purchaser\u2019s written agreement to the transaction prior to the sale. Consequently, the rule may affect the ability of broker-dealers to sell our securities and also may affect the ability of our stockholders to sell their securities in any market that might develop.\nStockholders should be aware that, according to Securities and Exchange Commission, the market for penny stocks has suffered from patterns of fraud and abuse. Such patterns include:\n\u25cf\ncontrol of the market for the security by one or a few broker-dealers that are often related to the promoter or issuer;\n\u25cf\nmanipulation of prices through prearranged matching of purchases and sales and false and misleading press releases;\n\u25cf\n\u201cboiler room\u201d practices involving high-pressure sales tactics and unrealistic price projections by inexperienced sales persons;\n\u25cf\nexcessive and undisclosed bid-ask differentials and markups by selling broker-dealers; and\n\u25cf\nthe wholesale dumping of the same securities by promoters and broker-dealers after prices have been manipulated to a desired level, along with the resulting inevitable collapse of those prices and with consequent investor losses.\nOur management is aware of the abuses that have occurred historically in the penny stock market. Although we do not expect to be in a position to dictate the behavior of the market or of broker-dealers who participate in the market, management will strive within the confines of practical limitations to prevent the described patterns from being established with respect to our common stock.\nOur need to raise additional capital in the near future or to use our equity securities for payments could have a dilutive effect on your investment.\nIn order to continue operations, we will need to raise additional capital. We may attempt to raise capital through the public or private sale of our common stock or securities convertible into or exercisable for our common stock. In addition, from time to time we have issued our common stock or warrants in lieu of cash payments. If we sell additional shares of our common stock or other equity securities or issue such securities in respect of other claims or indebtedness, such sales or issuances will further dilute the percentage of our equity that you own. Depending upon the price per share of securities that we sell or issue in the future, if any, your interest in us could be further diluted by any adjustments to the number of shares and the applicable exercise price required pursuant to the terms of the agreements under which we previously issued convertible securities.\nFORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS\nStatements in this report, which express \u201cbelief,\u201d \u201canticipation\u201d or \u201cexpectation,\u201d as well as other statements that are not historical facts, are forward-looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, or Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or Exchange Act.
