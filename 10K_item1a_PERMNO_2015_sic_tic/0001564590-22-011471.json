{"cik": "1693577", "company": "MainStreet Bancshares, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-23", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThis section highlights the material risks that the Company currently faces. Any of the risks described below could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nPandemic Risks\nPandemic risks, such as the one we are currently experiencing due to COVID-19, can have an impact on every risk outlined in the paragraphs below. We have learned that pandemic risks can, in-and-of-themselves, cause serious national and even global financial and economic distress. The results of that financial distress and the associated health concerns can and will impact businesses as ongoing concerns, the health and well-being of a population, and the financial capabilities of consumers, businesses and government entities. Pandemic risks can and will impact our business and financial results.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has created, and may continue to create, significant disruption of the global economy and financial markets. Governments, businesses, and the public are taking actions to contain the spread of COVID-19 and to mitigate its effects, including quarantines, travel bans, \u201cstay at home\u201d orders, cancellation of events and travel, closures of businesses and schools, fiscal stimulus, and legislation intended to provide monetary aid and other relief. While the scope, duration, and full effect of COVID-19 continue to evolve and are not fully known, the pandemic and related efforts to contain it have disrupted global economic activity, adversely affected the functioning of financial markets, impacted interest rates, increased economic and market uncertainty, and disrupted trade and supply chains.\nCredit and Lending Risks\nOur business, like that of most banking organizations, is highly susceptible to credit risk.\nAs a lender, the Bank is exposed to the risk that customers will be unable to repay their loans according to terms of the loan agreements and that the collateral securing payment of the loans (if any) may not be sufficient to assure repayment. Credit losses could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nWe have significant exposure to risks associated with commercial and residential real estate.\nA substantial portion of our loan portfolio consists of commercial and residential real estate-related loans, including construction and residential and commercial mortgage loans. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $173.1 million of owner-occupied and $361.1million of investment commercial real estate loans outstanding, which represented approximately 12.7% and 26.6%, respectively, of our loan portfolio as of December 31, 2021. As of that same date, we had approximately $337.2 million of construction real estate loans and $300.4 million of residential real estate loans, which represent 24.8% and 22.1% respectively.\nThe adverse consequences from real estate-related credit risks tend to be cyclical and are often driven by local and national economic developments that are not controllable or entirely foreseeable by us or our borrowers. As a result:\n\u2022\nwe have a greater risk of loan defaults and losses in the event of economic weaknesses associated with commercial and residential real estate in our market area and nationally, which may have a negative effect on the ability of our borrowers to timely repay their loans; and\n\u2022\nloan concentrations and the associated risks related to commercial and residential real estate may pose additional regulatory credit risk concerns, including interest rate risk due to maturity considerations, liquidity risk due to funding considerations and risks to earnings and capital.\nSince we engage in lending secured by real estate and may be forced to foreclose on the collateral property and own the underlying real estate, we may be subject to the increased costs and risks associated with the ownership of real property, which could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real property. During the ordinary course of business, we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans, in which event we become exposed to the risks inherent in the ownership of real estate. The amount that we, as a mortgagee, may realize after a default is dependent upon factors outside of our control, including:\n\u2022\ngeneral or local economic conditions;\n\u2022\nenvironmental clean-up liabilities;\n\u2022\nneighbourhood values;\n\u2022\ninterest rates;\n\u2022\nreal estate tax rates;\n\u2022\noperating expenses of the foreclosed properties;\n\u2022\nsupply of and demand for rental units or properties;\n\u2022\nability to obtain and maintain adequate occupancy of the properties;\n\u2022\nzoning laws;\n\u2022\ngovernmental rules, regulations and fiscal policies; and\n\u2022\nextreme weather conditions or other natural or man-made disasters.\nCertain expenditures associated with the ownership of real estate, principally real estate taxes and maintenance costs, may also adversely affect our operating expenses.\nCommercial and industrial loans may expose us to greater financial and credit risk than other loans.\nCommercial and industrial loans generally carry larger loan balances and can involve a greater degree of financial and credit risk than other loans, including less collateral at liquidation. Any significant failure to pay on time by our customers would hurt our earnings. The increased financial and credit risks associated with these types of loans result from several factors, including the concentration of principal in a limited number of loans and borrowers, the size of loan balances, the effects of general economic conditions on income-producing properties and the increased difficulty of evaluating and monitoring these types of loans. In addition, when underwriting a commercial or industrial loan, we may take a security interest in commercial real estate, and, in some instances upon a default by the borrower, we may foreclose on and take title to the property, which may lead to additional risks for us under applicable environmental laws.\nThe small-to-midsized businesses that we lend to may have fewer resources to weather adverse business developments, which may impair a borrower\u2019s ability to repay a loan, and such impairment could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe focus our business development and marketing strategy primarily on small-to-midsized businesses. These businesses frequently have smaller market shares than their competition, may be more vulnerable to economic downturns, often need substantial additional capital to expand or compete and may experience substantial volatility in operating results, any of which may impair a borrower\u2019s ability to repay a loan. In addition, the success of a small-to-midsized business often depends on the management skills, talents and efforts of one or two people or a small group of people, and the death, disability or resignation of one or more of these people could have an adverse impact on the business and its ability to repay its loan. If general economic conditions negatively impact the markets in which we operate and small-to-midsized businesses are adversely affected or our borrowers are otherwise harmed by adverse business developments, this, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe borrowing needs of our customers may increase, especially during a challenging economic environment, which could result in increased borrowing against our contractual obligations to extend credit.\nA commitment to extend credit is a formal agreement to lend funds to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established under the agreement. The actual borrowing needs of our customers under these credit commitments have historically been lower than the contractual amount of the commitments. A significant portion of these commitments expire without being drawn upon. Because of the credit profile of our customers, we typically have a substantial amount of total unfunded credit commitments, which is not reflected on our balance sheet. As of December 31, 2021 we had $304.3 million in unfunded credit commitments to our customers. Actual borrowing needs of our customers may exceed our expectations, especially during a challenging economic environment when our customers\u2019 companies may be more dependent on our credit commitments due to the lack of available credit elsewhere, the increasing costs of credit, or the limited availability of financings from venture firms. This could adversely affect our liquidity, which could impair our ability to fund operations and meet obligations as they become due and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual future losses.\nWe maintain an allowance for loan losses to cover estimable and observable loan losses inherent in our portfolio. Every loan we make carries a certain risk of non-repayment, and we make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio including the creditworthiness of our borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of loans. Through a periodic review of the loan portfolio, management determines the amount of the allowance for loan losses by considering general market conditions, credit quality of the loan portfolio, the collateral supporting the loans and performance of customers relative to their financial obligations with us. The amount of future losses is susceptible to changes in economic, operating and other conditions, including changes in interest rates, which may be beyond our control, and these losses may exceed current estimates. We cannot fully predict the amount or timing of losses or whether the loss allowance will be adequate in the future. If our assumptions prove to be incorrect, our allowance for loan losses may not\nbe sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan portfolio, resulting in additions to the allowance. Excessive loan losses could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may be required to increase our provisions for loan losses and to charge off loans in the future, which increases and charges could materially adversely affect us.\nThere is no precise method of predicting the timing of loan losses. We can give no assurance that our allowance for loan losses is or will be sufficient to absorb actual loan losses. We maintain an allowance for loan losses, which is a reserve established through a provision for loan losses charged to expense, that represents management\u2019s estimable and observable losses within the existing portfolio of loans. The level of the allowance reflects management\u2019s evaluation of, among other factors, the status of specific impaired loans, trends in historical loss experience, delinquency trends, credit concentrations and economic conditions within our market area. The determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and judgment and requires us to make significant estimates of current credit risks and future trends, all of which may undergo subsequent material changes. Changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers, new information regarding existing loans, identification of additional problem loans and other factors, both within and outside of our control, may require us to increase our allowance for loan losses. Increases in nonperforming loans have a significant impact on our allowance for loan losses.\nIn addition, bank regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require us to increase the provision for loan losses or to recognize further loan charge-offs, based on judgments that differ from those of management. If loan charge-offs in future periods exceed our allowance for loan losses, we will need to record additional provisions to increase our allowance for loan losses. Furthermore, growth in our loan portfolio would generally lead to an increase in the provision for loan losses. Generally, increases in our allowance for loan losses will result in a decrease in net income and shareholders\u2019 equity, and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Material additions to our allowance could also materially decrease our net income.\nThe implementation of the Current Expected Credit Loss accounting standard could require the Company to increase its allowance for credit losses.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, \u201cFinancial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments,\u201d which replaces the incurred loss model with an expected loss model, which is referred to as the current expected credit loss model, or \u201cCECL.\u201d This standard requires earlier recognition of expected credit losses on loans and certain other instruments, compared to the incurred loss model. Many of the loss estimation techniques applied today will still be permitted, although the inputs to those techniques will change to reflect the full amount of expected credit losses. In addition, the ASU amends the accounting for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities and purchased financial assets with credit deterioration.\nThe revised methodology required by ASU 2016-13, which will be effective for the Company in the fiscal year beginning after December 15, 2022, represents a significant change from existing GAAP and may result in material changes to the Company\u2019s accounting for financial instruments. For most debt securities, the transition approach requires a cumulative-effect adjustment to the statement of financial position as of the beginning of the first reporting period the guidance is effective. For other-than-temporarily impaired debt securities, the guidance will be applied prospectively. The Company will record a one-time adjustment to its credit loss allowance, as of the beginning of the first quarter of 2023, equal to the difference between the amounts of its credit loss allowance under the incurred loss methodology and under CECL. The Company cannot yet determine the magnitude of any such one-time cumulative adjustment or of the overall impact of the new standard on its financial condition or results of operations. In anticipation of the implementation of CECL, the Company is working with a third party to compile data and develop an estimate using historical and qualitative data based on the requirements of ASU 2016-13.\nA significant portion of our loan portfolio is unseasoned.\nSince December 31, 2016, our loan portfolio has increased approximately 191.6%, from $464 million at December 31, 2016 to $1.4 billion at December 31, 2021. While we believe our underwriting standards are designed to manage normal lending risks, it is difficult to assess the future performance of our loan portfolio due to the recent origination of many of our loans. As a result, it is difficult to determine whether these loans will become non-performing or delinquent, or whether we will hold non-performing or delinquent loans that may adversely affect our future performance.\nWe extend credit to a variety of customers based on internally established standards and judgment. We manage credit risk through a program of underwriting standards, the review of certain credit decisions and an on-going process of assessment of the quality of the credit already extended. Our credit standards and ongoing process of credit assessment might not protect us from significant credit losses.\nWe take credit risk by virtue of making loans, extending loan commitments and letters of credit and, to a lesser degree, purchasing non-governmental securities. Our exposure to credit risk is managed through the use of consistent underwriting standards, and we avoid highly leveraged transactions as well as excessive industry and other concentrations. Our credit administration function employs risk management techniques to ensure that loans adhere to corporate policy and problem loans are promptly identified. While these procedures are designed to provide us with the information needed to implement policy adjustments where necessary, and to take proactive corrective actions, there can be no assurance that such measures will be effective in avoiding undue credit risk.\nWe are subject to environmental liability risk associated with our lending activities.\nIn the course of our business, we may purchase real estate, or we may foreclose on and take title to real estate. Although we exercise prudent due diligence when making loans, we could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties. We may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage, personal injury, investigation and clean-up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination or may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances or chemical releases at a property. The costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial. In addition, if we are the owner or former owner of a contaminated site, we may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property. Any significant environmental liabilities could cause an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nInterest Rate Risks\nChanges in interest rates may negatively affect our earnings, income and financial condition as well as the value of our assets.\nOur earnings and cash flows depend substantially upon our net interest income. Net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interest-earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and interest expense paid on interest-bearing liabilities, such as deposits and borrowed funds. Interest rates are sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control, including general economic conditions, competition and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the policies of the Federal Reserve.\nIn an attempt to help the overall economy, the Federal Reserve has kept interest rates low through its targeted Fed Funds rate. During 2020, the Federal Reserve decreased the targeted Fed Funds rate to 0 - 25 basis points. The Federal Reserve has indicated that further changes would be subject to economic conditions. As the Federal Reserve increases and decreases the targeted Fed Funds rate, overall interest rates will likely be impacted.\nChanges in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, not only could influence the interest we receive on loans and investment securities and the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings, but such changes could also affect: (1) our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits; (2) the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities, including our securities portfolio; and (3) the average duration of our interest-earning assets. Interest-earning assets may be more responsive to changes in interest rates than interest-bearing liabilities, or vice versa (repricing risk), individual interest rates or rate indices underlying various interest-earning assets and interest-bearing liabilities may not change in the same degree over a given time period (basis risk), and interest rate relationships may change across the spectrum of interest-earning asset and interest-bearing liability maturities (yield curve risk), including a prolonged flat or inverted yield curve environment. Any substantial, unexpected, prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business may be adversely affected by the transition from the London InterBank Offered Rate (LIBOR) as a reference rate..\nThe London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) is used extensively in the United States and globally as a reference rate for various commercial and financial contracts, including adjustable rate mortgages, corporate debt, interest rate swaps and other derivatives. LIBOR is set based on interest rate information reported by certain banks, which may stop reporting such information after 2021. In 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit LIBOR rates after 2021. On November 30, 2020, to facilitate an orderly LIBOR transition, the United States financial institution regulatory agencies jointly announced that entering into new contracts using LIBOR as a reference rate after December 31, 2021, would create a safety and soundness risk. On March 5, 2021, the FCA announced that all LIBOR settings will either cease to be provided by any administrator or no longer be representative immediately after December 31, 2021, in the case of 1-week and 2-month LIBOR, and immediately after June 30, 2023, in the case of the remaining LIBOR settings.\nIn the United States, while there is no consensus on what rate or rates will become the accepted alternatives to LIBOR, a group of market participants convened by the Federal Reserve, the Alternative Reference Rate Committee (ARRC), has selected the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as its recommended alternative to LIBOR. SOFR is different from LIBOR in that it is a backward-looking secured rate rather than a forward-looking unsecured rate. These differences could lead to a greater disconnect between our costs to raise funds for SOFR as compared to LIBOR. For cash products and loans, ARRC has also recommended Term SOFR, which is a forward-looking rate based on SOFR futures and may in part reduce differences between SOFR and LIBOR. There are operational issues that may create a delay in the transition to SOFR or other substitute indices, leading to uncertainty across the industry.\nUntil replacement rates are established and all agreements have been addressed, we will continue to have a number of loans, derivative contracts, and other financial instruments with attributes that are directly or indirectly dependent on LIBOR.\nLiquidity Risk\nLiquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and jeopardize our financial condition.\nLiquidity is essential to our business. An inability to raise funds through deposits, borrowings, the sale of loans and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity. Our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities, or on terms that are acceptable to us, could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or the economy in general. Factors that could detrimentally affect our access to liquidity sources include, among other things, a decrease in the level of our business activity as a result of a downturn in the markets in which our loans are concentrated and an adverse regulatory action against us. Our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us, such as a disruption in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry.\nAmong other sources of funds, we rely heavily on deposits for funds to make loans and provide for our other liquidity needs. However, our loan demand has historically exceeded the rate at which we have been able to build core deposits for which there is substantial competition from a variety of different competitors, so we have relied on interest-sensitive deposits, including wholesale deposits, as sources of funds. Those deposits may not be as stable as other types of deposits and, in the future, depositors may not renew those deposits when they mature, or we may have to pay a higher rate of interest to attract or retain them or to replace them with other deposits or with funds from other sources. Not being able to attract deposits, or to retain or replace them as they mature, would adversely affect our liquidity. Paying higher deposit rates to attract, retain or replace those deposits could have a negative effect on our interest margin and operating results.\nOperational Risks\nNew lines of business, products, product enhancements or services may subject us to additional risks.\nFrom time to time, we implement new lines of business, or offer new products and product enhancements as well as new services within our existing lines of business and we will continue to do so in the future. There are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts, particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed. In implementing, developing or marketing new lines of business, products, product enhancements or services, we may invest significant time and resources, although we may not assign the appropriate level of resources or expertise necessary to make these new lines of business, products, product enhancements or services successful or to realize their expected benefits. Further, initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business, products, product enhancements or services may not be achieved, and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible. External factors, such as compliance with regulations, competitive alternatives and shifting market preferences, may also impact the ultimate implementation of a new line of business or offerings of new products, product enhancements or services. Furthermore, any new line of business, product, product enhancement or service could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of our system of internal controls. Failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business or offerings of new products, product enhancements or services could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn 2016, we added a new funding source by way of facilitating payment services. We are continuing to identify and solicit new customers in need of these specialized services. The primary reasons for expanding into payment services are to secure an additional source of low-cost deposits and to capture additional fee income. A bank\u2019s risks when dealing with a processor account are similar to risks from other activities in which customers conduct transactions through the bank on behalf of the customers\u2019 clients. It is necessary for a bank to implement an adequate processor approval, monitoring and auditing program that extends beyond credit risk management and is conducted on an ongoing basis. When a bank is not able to identify and understand the nature and source of transactions processed through accounts, the bank\u2019s risks and the likelihood of suspicious activity can increase. Without these precautions, a bank could be vulnerable to processing illicit or sanctioned transactions.\nWe face risks related to our operational, technological and organizational infrastructure.\nOur ability to grow and compete is dependent on the Bank\u2019s ability to build or acquire the necessary operational and technological infrastructure and to manage the cost of that infrastructure as we expand. In our case, operational risk can manifest itself in many ways, such as errors related to failed or inadequate processes, faulty or disabled computer systems, fraud by employees or outside persons and exposure to external events. As discussed below, we are dependent on our operational infrastructure to help manage these risks. In addition, we are heavily dependent on the strength and capability of our technology systems that the Bank uses both to interface with customers and to manage internal financial and other systems. Our ability to develop and deliver new products that meet the needs of our existing customers and attract new ones depends on the functionality of our technology systems. Additionally, our ability to run our business in compliance with applicable laws and regulations is dependent on these infrastructures.\nWe continuously monitor our operational and technological capabilities and make modifications and improvements as circumstances warrant. In some instances, the Bank may build and maintain these capabilities itself. We outsource many of these functions to third parties. These third parties may experience errors or disruptions that could adversely impact the Bank and over which it may have limited control. We also face risk from the integration of new infrastructure platforms and/or new third-party providers of such platforms into the Bank\u2019s existing businesses.\nMany of our larger competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements. As a result, they may be able to offer additional or superior technologies compared to those that we will be able to provide, which could put us at a competitive\ndisadvantage. Accordingly, we may lose customers seeking new technology-driven products and services to the extent we are unable to compete effectively.\nA failure in our operational systems or infrastructure, or those of third parties, could impair our liquidity, disrupt our business, result in the unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, damage our reputation and cause financial losses.\nOur business is dependent on our ability to process and monitor, on a daily basis, a number of transactions. These transactions, as well as the information technology services we provide to clients, often must adhere to client-specific guidelines, as well as legal and regulatory standards. Developing and maintaining our operational systems and infrastructure is challenging, particularly as a result of rapidly evolving legal and regulatory requirements and technological shifts. Our financial, accounting, data processing or other operating systems and facilities may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond the Bank\u2019s control, such as a spike in transaction volume, cyber-attack or other unforeseen catastrophic events, which may adversely affect our ability to process these transactions or provide services.\nIn addition, our operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information on our computer systems and networks. Although we take protective measures to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our and our clients\u2019 information across all geographic and product lines, and endeavor to modify these protective measures as circumstances warrant, the nature of the threats continues to evolve. As a result, our computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, loss or destruction of data (including confidential client information), account takeovers, unavailability of service, computer viruses or other malicious code, cyber-attacks and other events that could have an adverse security impact. Despite the defensive measures we take to manage our internal technological and operational infrastructure, these threats may originate externally from third parties such as foreign governments, organized crime and other hackers, and outsource or infrastructure-support providers and application developers, or may originate internally from within our organization. Given the increasingly high volume of our transactions, certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they can be discovered and rectified.\nWe also face the risk of operational disruption, failure, termination or capacity constraints of any of the third parties that facilitate our business activities, including exchanges, clearing agents, clearing houses or other financial intermediaries. Such parties could also be the source of an attack on, or breach of, our operational systems, data or infrastructure. In addition, as interconnectivity with our clients grows, we increasingly face the risk of operational failure with respect to our clients\u2019 systems.\nWe rely on vendors to support our operations. We also rely on vendors to provide part of our services we deliver to customers. While we have a vendor management program policy in place and believe we have selected our vendors appropriately, we cannot directly control their employees or their operating environments. A breach or failure of a chosen vendor could have a material impact on our operating environment.\nOur services and technology solutions rely on the internet more and more. Computers connected to the internet are vulnerable to many types of threats by cyber criminals. Although none of these types of attacks have had a material impact on our business to date, we anticipate that the efforts to attack our systems, and those of our customers and vendors, will grow in complexity and volume. As such, we have developed an incident response plan to coordinate the efforts following the identification of an attack.\nFailure to maintain a secure computing environment, stay up to date on security vulnerabilities or deploy adequate technologies to protect against attacks, may subject our information and systems to security breaches that could compromise confidential information and damage our reputation and business. We rely on industry-standard encryption and authentication security systems to provide the security required to protect our data. Periodically our systems are subjected to scans, exploitations and audits by a qualified independent third party to evaluate the effectiveness of our security controls and system configurations.\nCyber criminals may attempt to trick employees, customers or vendors through phishing schemes or other methods to disclose sensitive information. Employees receive annual security training and are periodically assessed through simulated attack tools to assist with behavior shaping and coaching against social engineering threats.\nIf one or more of these events occurs, it could potentially jeopardize the confidential, proprietary and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, the Bank\u2019s computer systems and networks, or otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our, as well as our clients\u2019 or other third parties\u2019 operations, which could result in damage to our reputation, substantial costs, regulatory penalties and/or client dissatisfaction or loss.\nPotential costs of a cyber incident may include, but would not be limited to, remediation costs, increased protection costs, lost revenue from the unauthorized use of proprietary information or the loss of current and/or future customers, and litigation.\nWe maintain an insurance policy through the Bank\u2019s blanket bond at the maximum of currently available limits. However, we cannot assure you that this policy would be sufficient to cover all financial losses, damages, penalties, including lost revenues, should the Bank experience any one or more of our or a third party\u2019s systems failing or experiencing attack.\nWe rely on third parties to provide key components of our business infrastructure, and a failure of these parties to perform for any reason could disrupt our operations.\nThird parties provide key components of our business infrastructure such as data processing, internet connections, network access, core application processing, statement production and account analysis. Our business depends on the successful and uninterrupted functioning of our information technology and telecommunications systems and third-party servicers. The failure of these systems, or the termination of a third-party software license or service agreement on which any of these systems is based, could interrupt our operations. Because our information technology and telecommunications systems interface with and depend on third-party systems, we could experience service denials if demand for such services exceeds capacity or such third-party systems fail or experience interruptions. Replacing vendors or addressing other issues with our third-party service providers could entail significant delay and expense. If we are unable to efficiently replace ineffective service providers, or if we experience a significant, sustained or repeated system failure or service denial, it could compromise our ability to operate effectively, damage our reputation, result in a loss of customer business, and subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny and possible financial liability, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nReputational risk and social factors may impact our results.\nOur ability to originate and maintain accounts is highly dependent upon consumer and other external perceptions of our business practices and/or our financial health. Adverse perceptions could damage our reputation in both the customer and funding markets, leading to difficulties in generating and maintaining accounts as well as in financing them. Adverse developments with respect to the consumer or other external perceptions regarding the practices of our competitors, or our industry as a whole, may also adversely impact our reputation. In addition, adverse reputational impacts on third parties with whom we have important relationships may also adversely impact our reputation. Adverse impacts on our reputation, or the reputation of our industry, may also result in greater regulatory and/or legislative scrutiny, which may lead to laws or regulations that may change or constrain the manner in which the Bank engages with its customers and the products the Bank offers. Adverse reputational impacts or events may also increase our litigation risk. We carefully monitor internal and external developments for areas of potential reputational risk and have established governance structures to assist in evaluating such risks in our business practices and decisions.\nWe could be subject to losses, regulatory action or reputational harm due to fraudulent and negligent acts on the part of loan applicants, our employees and vendors.\nIn deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with clients and counterparties, and the terms of any such transaction, we may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of clients and counterparties, including financial statements, property appraisals, title information, employment and income documentation, account information and other financial information. We may also rely on representations of clients and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and, with respect to financial statements, on reports of independent auditors. Any such misrepresentation or incorrect or incomplete information, whether fraudulent or inadvertent, may not be detected prior to funding. In addition, one or more of our employees or vendors could cause a significant operational breakdown or failure, either as a result of human error or where an individual purposefully sabotages or fraudulently manipulates our loan documentation, operations or systems. Whether a misrepresentation is made by the applicant or another third party, we generally bear the risk of loss associated with the misrepresentation. A loan subject to a material misrepresentation is typically unsellable or subject to repurchase if it is sold prior to detection of the misrepresentation. The sources of the misrepresentations may also be difficult to locate, and we may be unable to recover any of the monetary losses we may suffer as a result of the misrepresentations. Any of these developments could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to claims and litigation pertaining to intellectual property.\nBanking and other financial services companies, such as ours, rely on technology companies to provide information technology products and services necessary to support their day-to-day operations. Technology companies frequently enter into litigation based on allegations of patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights. In addition, patent holding companies seek to monetize patents they have purchased or otherwise obtained. Competitors of our vendors, or other individuals or companies, may from time to time claim to hold intellectual property sold to us by our vendors. Such claims may increase in the future as the financial services sector becomes more reliant on information technology vendors. The plaintiffs in these actions frequently seek injunctions and substantial damages.\nRegardless of the scope or validity of such patents or other intellectual property rights, or the merits of any claims by potential or actual litigants, we may have to engage in protracted litigation. Such litigation is often expensive, time-consuming, disruptive to our operations and distracting to management. If we are found to infringe one or more patents or other intellectual property rights, we may be required to pay substantial damages or royalties to a third party. In certain cases, we may consider entering into licensing agreements for disputed intellectual property, although no assurance can be given that such licenses can be obtained on acceptable terms or that litigation will not occur. These licenses may also significantly increase our operating expenses. If legal matters related to intellectual property claims were resolved against us or settled, we could be required to make payments in amounts that could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe decreased soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.\nOur ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty or other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, have led in the past to market-wide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. Many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client. In addition, our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral that we hold cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices insufficient to recover the full amount of the loan. We cannot assure you that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nStrategic Risks\nStrong competition within our market area could reduce our profits and slow growth.\nWe face competition in making loans, attracting deposits and hiring and retaining experienced employees. Price competition for loans and deposits may result in our charging lower interest rates on loans and paying higher interest rates on deposits, thereby reducing our net interest income. Price competition also may limit our ability to originate loans. Competition makes it more difficult and costly to attract and retain qualified employees.\nOur financial performance will be negatively affected if we are unable to execute our growth strategy.\nOur stated growth strategy is to grow organically and supplement that growth with select acquisitions, if available. Our success depends primarily on generating loans and deposits of acceptable risk and expense. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in continuing our organic, or internal, growth strategy. Our ability to identify appropriate markets for expansion, recruit and retain qualified personnel, and fund growth at reasonable cost, depends upon prevailing economic conditions, maintenance of sufficient capital, competitive factors, changes in banking laws, and other factors.\nWe cannot be certain as to our ability to manage increased levels of assets and liabilities without increased expenses and higher levels of nonperforming assets. We may be required to make additional investments in equipment and personnel to manage higher asset levels and loan balances, which may adversely affect earnings, shareholder returns, and our efficiency ratio. Increases in operating expenses or nonperforming assets may decrease our earnings and the value of the Company\u2019s capital stock.\nWe may face increasing deposit-pricing pressures, which may, among other things, reduce our profitability.\nDeposit pricing pressures may result from competition as well as changes to the interest rate environment. Current economic conditions have intensified competition for deposits. The competition has had an impact on interest rates paid to attract deposits as well as fees charged on deposit products. In addition to the competitive pressures from other depository institutions, we face heightened competition from non-depository financial products such as securities and other alternative investments.\nFurthermore, technology and other market changes have made it more convenient for bank customers to transfer funds for investing purposes. Bank customers also have greater access to deposit vehicles that facilitate spreading deposit balances among different depository institutions to maximize FDIC insurance coverage. In addition to competitive forces, we also are at risk from market forces as they affect interest rates. It is not uncommon when interest rates transition from a low interest rate environment to a rising rate environment, for deposit and other funding costs to rise in advance of yields on earning assets. In order to keep deposits required for funding purposes, it may be necessary to raise deposit rates without commensurate increases in asset pricing in the short term.\nHistorically low interest rates may adversely affect our net interest income and profitability.\nIn recent years it has been the policy of the Federal Reserve to maintain interest rates at historically low levels through its targeted federal funds rate and the purchase of mortgage-backed securities. As a result, market rates on the loans we have originated and the yields on securities we have purchased have been at historically low levels. As discussed above, rates are fluctuating, and due to a number of factors including changes in monetary policies of the Federal Reserve, will likely continue to fluctuate.\nExternal and Market-Related Risks\nChanges in general business, economic and political conditions, especially in Northern Virginia, could adversely affect our earnings.\nOur success depends, to a certain extent, upon economic and political conditions, local and national, as well as governmental monetary policies. Conditions such as inflation, recession, unemployment, changes in interest rates, money supply and other factors beyond our control may adversely affect our asset quality, deposit levels and loan demand and, therefore our earnings. In addition, there are continuing ocncerns\nrelated to, among other things, the level of U.S. government debt and fiscal actions that may be taken to address that debt, a potential resurgence of economic and political tensions with China or an escalation of tensions between Russia and Ukraine, all of which may have a destabilizing effect on financial markets and economic activity. Economic pressure on consumers, businesses and overall economic uncertainty may result in changes in spending, borrowing, and saving habits. These economic conditions and other negative developments in the domestic or international credit markets and economies may significantly affect the markets in which we do business. Because we have a significant amount of real estate loans, decreases in real estate values could adversely affect the value of property used as collateral and our ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure. Adverse changes in the economy may also have a negative effect on the ability of our borrowers to make timely repayments of their loans, which would have an adverse impact on our earnings. If during a period of reduced real estate values we are required to liquidate the collateral securing a loan to satisfy the debt or to increase our allowance for loan losses, it could materially reduce our profitability and adversely affect our financial condition. The substantial majority of our loans are to individuals and businesses in the Northern Virginia and Washington D.C metropolitan area. Consequently, significant declines in the economy in the Northern Virginia and Washington D.C. metropolitan area could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, the emergence of widespread health emergencies or pandemics, such as coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d), could lead to quarantines, business shutdowns, increases in unemployment, labor shortages, disruptions to supply chains, and overall economic instability. Events such as these may become more common in the future and could cause significant damage such as disrupt power and communication services, impact the stability of our facilities and result in additional expenses, impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans, reduce the value of collateral securing the repayment of our loans, which could result in the loss of revenue. While we have established and regularly test disaster recovery procedures, the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition.\nIf we do not adjust to rapid changes in the financial services industry, our financial performance may suffer.\nWe face substantial competition for customer relationships, as well as other sources of funding in the communities it serves. Competing providers include other banks, savings institutions and trust companies, insurance companies, mortgage banking operations, credit unions, finance companies, title companies, money market funds and other financial and nonfinancial companies which may offer products functionally equivalent to those offered by the Bank. Many competing providers have greater financial resources than we do and offer services within and outside the market areas we serve. In addition to this challenge of attracting and retaining customers for traditional banking services, our competitors include securities dealers, brokers, mortgage bankers, investment advisors and finance and insurance companies who seek to offer one-stop financial services to their customers that may include services that financial institutions have not been able or allowed to offer to their customers in the past. The increasingly competitive environment is primarily a result of changes in regulation, changes in technology and product delivery systems and the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial service providers. If we are unable to adjust both to increased competition for traditional banking services and changing customer needs and preferences, our financial performance and your investment in our capital stock could be adversely affected.\nAdditional required capital may not be available.\nWe are required by federal regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations. In addition, we may elect to raise additional capital to support our business or to finance acquisitions, if any, or we may otherwise elect or be required to raise additional capital. Our ability to raise additional capital, if needed, will depend on conditions in the capital markets, economic conditions and a number of other factors, many of which are outside of our control, and on our financial performance. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that we can raise additional capital if needed or on terms acceptable to us. If we cannot raise additional capital when needed, it may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nCompliance and Regulatory Risks\nWe operate in a highly regulated environment, and we may be adversely affected by changes in laws and regulations.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve, our primary federal regulator, the Virginia Bureau of Financial Institutions, our chartering authority and the FDIC, as insurer of our deposits. Such regulation and supervision govern the activities in which we and the Bank may engage, and are intended primarily for the protection of the insurance fund and the depositors and borrowers of the Bank rather than for holders of our common stock. Various consumers and compliance laws also affect our operations.\nRegulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on our operations, the classification of our assets and determination of the level of our allowance for loan losses. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, legislation or supervisory action, may have a material impact on our operations. The earnings of the Bank, and therefore the earnings of the Company, are affected by changes in federal and state legislation and actions of various regulatory authorities.\nThe Bank has become subject to more stringent regulatory capital requirements.\nThe Bank is subject to the comprehensive, consolidated supervision and regulation of the FRB and the Bureau of Financial Institutions, including risk-based and leverage capital requirements. The Bank must maintain certain risk-based and leverage capital ratios as required by our banking regulators, which can change depending on general economic conditions and on the Bank\u2019s particular condition, risk profile and growth plans. If at any time we fail to meet minimum regulatory capital standards or other regulatory requirements, our financial condition would be materially and adversely affected.\nIn addition, the capital requirements implemented by the federal banking regulators under Basel III could, among other things, result in lower returns on invested capital, adversely affect our ability to pay dividends or repurchase shares, require the raising of additional capital, and result in regulatory actions if we were to be unable to comply with such requirements. Compliance with current or new capital requirements may limit operations that require the intensive use of capital and could adversely affect our ability to expand or maintain present business levels. Additional information, including the Bank\u2019s compliance with applicable capital requirements at December 31, 2021, is provided in Item 7 Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act may have an unanticipated impact on our business.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cAct\u201d), enacted in 2017, contains the most extensive amendments to the Internal Revenue Code in over 30 years. The primary change for the Company was the Act\u2019s reduction of the federal corporate tax rate from a maximum of 35% to a flat 21%. Among other sweeping changes for individual taxpayers, the Act doubles the standard deduction for individuals, limits the deductibility of state and local income, property and sales taxes by individuals to $10,000 per year, eliminates the deductibility of interest on home equity loans, and eliminates the deductibility of interest on new home mortgages in excess of $750,000 (down from $1.0 million previously). The Act also eliminates loss carrybacks and limits the deductibility of loss carryforwards to 80% of current-year taxable income. The Act allows 100% expensing for all non-real property capital expenditures for five years but limits the deductibility of net interest expense (interest expense minus interest income) to 30% of taxable income for businesses with average annual gross receipts of more than $25 million.\nWhile we expect to benefit from the lower federal tax rate in the future, the lower tax rate reduced the value of existing other deferred tax assets, which we were required to revalue during the 2017 fiscal year. Lower tax rates will also reduce the attractiveness of certain tax-advantaged bank investments such as municipal bonds and bank-owned life insurance. Various other provisions of the Act could have unanticipated effects on the business of the Bank. By reducing the tax advantages of home ownership through its limits on the deductibility of mortgage interest and property taxes and the elimination of the deductibility of interest on certain home equity loans, the Act could affect demand for housing and residential mortgages in the future. The value of the properties securing loans in our loan portfolio may be adversely impacted as a result of the changing economics of home ownership, as such an impact could require an increase in our provision for loan losses, which would reduce our profitability and could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The higher standard deduction could also affect mortgage financing by reducing the number of taxpayers who itemize deductions and therefore benefit from these deductions. Furthermore, the lower corporate tax rates and new limits on the deductibility of net interest expense may reduce demand for loans from larger business borrowers and increase competition for lending to smaller business borrowers.\nRisks Associated with Our Common Stock\nThe market price for the Company\u2019s common stock price may be volatile.\nThe market price of our common stock may be highly volatile, which may make it difficult for you to resell your shares at the volume, prices and times desired. There are many factors that may impact the market price and trading volume of our common stock, including, without limitation:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results, financial condition or asset quality;\n\u2022\noperating results that vary from the expectations of management, securities analysts and investors;\n\u2022\nchanges in expectations as to our future financial performance;\n\u2022\noperating and stock price performance of companies that investors deem comparable to us;\n\u2022\nfuture issuances of our common stock or other securities;\n\u2022\nchanges in general economic or business conditions;\n\u2022\nchanges in the credit, mortgage and housing markets, the markets for securities relating to mortgages or housing, and developments with respect to financial institutions generally;\n\u2022\nproposed or adopted changes in laws, regulations or policies affecting us;\n\u2022\nsignificant acquisitions or business combinations, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by or involving our competitors or us; and\n\u2022\nother economic, competitive, governmental, regulatory and technological factors affecting our operations, pricing, products and services.\nThere is not an active or consistent trading market in our common stock, and we cannot assure you that a more active or consistent trading market in the common stock will develop. As a result, relatively small trades could have a significant impact on the price of our common stock.\nOur common stock is subordinate to our existing and future preferred stock and to our subordinated notes.\nThe Company has outstanding preferred stock that is senior to the common stock and could adversely affect the ability of the Company to declare or pay dividends or distributions of common stock. In addition, the terms of the Company\u2019s outstanding fixed-to-floating rate subordinated notes prohibit it from declaring or paying any dividends, or purchasing, acquiring, or making a liquidation payment with respect to, its capital stock, during an event of default under the subordinated note purchase agreement. Furthermore, if the Company experiences a material deterioration in its financial condition, liquidity, capital, results of operations or risk profile, the Company\u2019s regulators may not permit it to make future payments on its preferred stock, thereby preventing the payment of dividends on the common stock.\nWe are an emerging growth company, and any decision on our part to comply only with certain reduced reporting and disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies could make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an emerging growth company, and, for as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company, we may choose to take advantage of exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies but not to emerging growth companies, including, but not limited to, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements, and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. As an emerging growth company, we also will not be subject to Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, which would require that our independent auditors review and attest as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. In this Form 10-K, we have elected to take advantage of the reduced disclosure requirements relating to executive compensation, and in the future we may take advantage of any or all of these exemptions for so long as we remain an emerging growth company. In addition to the relief described above, the JOBS Act permits us an extended transition period for complying with new or revised accounting standards affecting public companies. We have elected not to take advantage of this extended transition period, which means that the financial statements included in this Form 10-K, as well as any financial statements that we file in the future, will be subject to all new or revised accounting standards generally applicable to public companies.\nWe will cease to be an emerging growth company upon the earliest of: (i)the first fiscal year after our annual gross revenues are $1.07 billion or more; (i)the date on which we have, during the previous three-year period, issued more than $1.0 billion in non-convertible debt securities; or (i)the end of any fiscal year in which the market value of our common stock held by non-affiliates exceeded $700 million as of the end of the second quarter of that fiscal year, or five years after completing our initial public offering. Investors may find our common stock less attractive if we choose to rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result of any choices to reduce future disclosure, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and the price of our common stock may be more volatile.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe will depend on our management team to implement our business strategy and execute successful operations, and we could be harmed by the loss of their services.\nWe are dependent upon the services of the members of our senior management team who direct our strategy and operations. Members of our senior management team, as well as commercial lending specialists who possess expertise in our markets and key business relationships, could be difficult to replace. The loss of these persons, or our inability to hire additional qualified personnel, could impact our ability to implement our business strategy and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and our ability to compete in our markets.\nWe may not be able to attract and retain skilled people.\nOur success depends, in large part, on our ability to attract and retain key people. Competition for the best people in most activities in which we engage can be intense, and we may not be able to retain or hire the people we want or need. In order to attract and retain qualified employees, we must compensate our employees at market levels. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain qualified employees, or do so at rates necessary to maintain our competitive position, our performance, including our competitive position, could suffer, and, in turn, adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The number of experienced banking professionals in our markets may not be the same as in certain other markets.\nWe may be subject to increased litigation which could result in legal liability and damage to our reputation.\nWe may be named from time to time as a defendant in litigation relating to its business and activities. Litigation may include claims for substantial compensatory or punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of damages. We are also involved from time to time in other reviews, investigations and proceedings (both formal and informal) by governmental and self- regulatory agencies regarding its business. These matters also could result in adverse judgments, settlements, fines, penalties, injunctions or other relief.\nIn addition, in recent years, a number of judicial decisions have upheld the right of borrowers to sue lending institutions on the basis of various evolving legal theories, collectively termed \u201clender liability.\u201d Generally, lender liability is founded on the premise that a lender has either violated a duty, whether implied or contractual, of good faith and fair dealing owed to the borrower or has assumed a degree of control over the borrower resulting in the creation of a fiduciary duty owed to the borrower or its other creditors or shareholders.\nSubstantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against the Company could materially adversely affect its business, financial condition or results of operations, or cause significant harm to our reputation.\nOur reported financial results depend on management\u2019s selection of accounting methods and certain assumptions and estimates.\nOur accounting policies and assumptions are fundamental to the Company\u2019s reported financial condition and results of operations. Management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting policies and methods so that they comply with generally accepted accounting principles and reflect management\u2019s judgment of the most appropriate manner to report our financial condition and results. In some cases, management must select the accounting policy or method to apply from two or more alternatives, any of which may be reasonable under the circumstances, yet may result in the Company\u2019s reporting materially different results than would have been reported under an alternative method.\nThe obligations associated with being a public company require significant resources and management attention.\nAs a public company, we face increased legal, accounting, administrative and other costs and expenses that we have not previously incurred, particularly after we are no longer an emerging growth company. We are subject to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act, which requires that we file annual, quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition and proxy and other information statements, and the applicable rules and regulations implemented by the SEC, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Act, the PCAOB and the Nasdaq Stock Market, each of which imposes additional reporting and other obligations on public companies.\nAs a public company, we are required to:\n\u2022\nprepare and distribute periodic reports, proxy statements and other shareholder communications in compliance with the federal securities laws and rules;\n\u2022\nexpand the roles and duties of our board of directors and committees thereof;\n\u2022\ninstitute more comprehensive financial reporting and disclosure compliance procedures;\n\u2022\ninvolve and retain to a greater degree outside counsel and accountants in the activities listed above;\n\u2022\nenhance our investor relations function;\n\u2022\nestablish new internal policies, including those relating to trading in our securities and disclosure controls and procedures;\n\u2022\nretain additional personnel;\n\u2022\ncomply with Nasdaq Stock Market listing standards; and\n\u2022\ncomply with applicable requirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.\nWe expect these rules and regulations and changes in laws, regulations and standards relating to corporate governance and public disclosure, which have created uncertainty for public companies, to increase legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time consuming and costly. These laws, regulations and standards are subject to varying interpretations, in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and, as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies. This could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. Our investment in compliance with existing and evolving regulatory requirements will result in increased administrative expenses and a diversion of management\u2019s time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. These increased costs could require us to divert a significant amount of money that we could otherwise use to expand our business and achieve our strategic objectives.", "PERMNO": 18560, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "MNSB"}
