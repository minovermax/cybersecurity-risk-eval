{"cik": "1682325", "company": "GTY Technology Holdings Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-18", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nRISK FACTORS\nAn investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk. You should consider carefully all of the risks described below, together with the other information contained in this Transition Report, before making a decision to invest in our securities. If any of the following events occur, our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected. In that event, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Relating to New GTY\u2019s Business and Industries\nSoftware- & Technology-Related/Internet-Focused Risk Factors\nCyber-attacks and security vulnerabilities can disrupt New GTY\u2019s business and harm their competitive position.\nThreats to IT security can take a variety of forms. Individuals and groups of hackers, and sophisticated organizations including state-sponsored organizations, may take steps that pose threats to New GTY\u2019s clients\u2019 IT. They may develop and deploy malicious software to attack New GTY\u2019s products and services and gain access to New GTY\u2019s networks and data centers, or act in a coordinated manner to launch distributed denial of service or other coordinated attacks. Cyber threats are constantly evolving, thereby increasing the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them. Cyber threats can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across New GTY\u2019s internal networks and systems and those of their partners and clients. Breaches of New GTY\u2019s network or data security could disrupt the security of New GTY\u2019s internal systems and business applications, impair New GTY\u2019s ability to provide services to New GTY\u2019s clients and protect the privacy of New GTY\u2019s data, result in product development delays, compromise confidential or technical business information harming New GTY\u2019s competitive position, result in theft or misuse of their intellectual property or other assets, require us to allocate more resources to improve technologies, or otherwise adversely affect their business. New GTY\u2019s business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace with these evolving threats.\nDisclosure of personally identifiable information and/or other sensitive client data could result in liability and harm New GTY\u2019s reputation.\nNew GTY stores and processes increasingly large amounts of personally identifiable and other confidential information of New GTY\u2019s clients. The continued occurrence of high-profile data breaches provides evidence of an external environment increasingly hostile to information security. Despite New GTY\u2019s efforts to improve security controls, it is possible that their security controls over personal data, their training of employees on data security, and other practices that New GTY follow may not prevent the improper disclosure of client data that New GTY stores and manages. Disclosure of personally identifiable information and/or other sensitive client data could result in liability and harm New GTY\u2019s reputation.\nData privacy is an evolving area of the law and New GTY\u2019s business may become subject to new and expanding regulations. Application of these new and changing laws to New GTY\u2019s business may increase risks and compliance costs.\nHosting services for some of New GTY\u2019s products and services are dependent upon the uninterrupted operation of data centers.\nA material portion of New GTY\u2019s business is provided through software hosting services. These hosting services depend on the uninterrupted operation of data centers and the ability to protect computer equipment and information stored in these data centers against damage that may be caused by natural disaster, fire, power loss, telecommunications or Internet failure, acts of terrorism, unauthorized intrusion, computer viruses, and other similar damaging events. If any of New GTY\u2019s data centers were to become inoperable for an extended period, New GTY might be unable to fulfill their contractual commitments. Although New GTY takes what they believe to be reasonable precautions against such occurrences, it can give no assurance that damaging events such as these will not result in a prolonged interruption of New GTY\u2019s services, which could result in client dissatisfaction, loss of revenue, and damage to New GTY\u2019s business.\nNew GTY run the risk of errors or defects with new products or enhancements to existing products.\nNew GTY\u2019s software products and services are complex and may contain errors or defects, especially when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released. New GTY cannot assure you that material defects and errors will not be found in the future. Any such defects could result in a loss of revenues, negative publicity or delay market acceptance. New GTY\u2019s license and subscription agreements typically contain provisions designed to limit New GTY\u2019s exposure to potential liability. However, it is possible New GTY may not always successfully negotiate such provisions in their client contracts or the limitation of liability provisions may not be effective due to existing or future federal, state, or local laws, ordinances, or judicial decisions. New GTY cannot assure you that a successful claim could not be made or would not have a material adverse effect on their future operating results.\nNew GTY must timely respond to technological changes to be competitive.\nThe market for New GTY\u2019s products is characterized by technological change, evolving industry standards in software technology, changes in client requirements, and frequent new product and service introductions and enhancements. The introduction of products and services embodying new technologies and the emergence of new industry standards can render existing products obsolete and unmarketable. As a result, New GTY\u2019s future success will depend, in part, upon New GTY\u2019s ability to enhance existing products and develop and introduce new products and services that keep pace with technological developments, satisfy increasingly sophisticated client requirements, and achieve market acceptance. New GTY cannot assure you that they will successfully identify new product and service opportunities and develop and bring new products and services to market in a timely and cost-effective manner. The products, capabilities, or technologies developed by others could also render New GTY\u2019s products or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive. New GTY\u2019s business may be adversely affected if they are unable to develop or acquire new software products or services or develop enhancements to existing products on a timely and cost-effective basis, or if such new products or services or enhancements do not achieve market acceptance.\nNew GTY may be unable to protect their proprietary rights.\nMany of New GTY\u2019s product and service offerings incorporate proprietary information, trade secrets, know-how, and other intellectual property rights. New GTY rely on a combination of contracts, copyrights, and trade secret laws to establish and protect their proprietary rights in their technology. New GTY cannot be certain that they have taken all appropriate steps to deter misappropriation of their intellectual property. There has also been significant litigation recently involving intellectual property rights. New GTY may be a party to such litigation in the future to protect their proprietary information, trade secrets, know-how, and other intellectual property rights. New GTY cannot assure you that third-parties will not assert infringement or misappropriation claims against one or more of the products or services with respect to current or future products or services. Any claims or litigation, with or without merit, could be time-consuming, costly, and a diversion to management. Any such claims and litigation could also cause product delivery delays, service interruptions or require us to enter into royalty or licensing arrangements. Such royalty or licensing arrangements, if required, may not be available on terms acceptable to us, if at all. Therefore, litigation to defend and enforce New GTY\u2019s intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on New GTY\u2019s business, regardless of the final outcome of such litigation.\nClients may elect to terminate New GTY\u2019s maintenance contracts and manage operations internally.\nIt is possible that New GTY\u2019s clients may elect to not renew maintenance contracts for New GTY\u2019s software, trying instead to maintain and operate the software themselves using their perpetual license rights (excluding software applications provided on a hosted or cloud basis). This could adversely affect New GTY\u2019s revenues and profits. Additionally, they may inadvertently allow New GTY\u2019s intellectual property or other information to fall into the hands of third-parties, including their competitors, which could adversely affect their business.\nMaterial portions of New GTY\u2019s business require the Internet infrastructure to be further developed or adequately maintained.\nPart of New GTY\u2019s future success depends on the use of the Internet as a means to access public information and perform transactions electronically. This in part requires the further development and maintenance of the Internet infrastructure. Among other things, this further development and maintenance will require a reliable network backbone with the necessary speed, data capacity, security, and timely development of complementary products for providing reliable Internet access and services. If this infrastructure fails to be further developed or be adequately maintained, New GTY\u2019s business would be harmed because users may not be able to access New GTY\u2019s government portals.\nSecurity breaches or unauthorized access to payment information, including credit/debit card data, and/or personal information that New GTY, or their service providers, store, process, use or transmit for their business may harm their reputation, cause service disruptions and adversely affect New GTY\u2019s business and results of operations.\nA significant challenge to electronic commerce is the secure transmission of payment information and/or personal information over information technology networks and systems which process, transmit and store electronic information, and manage or support a variety of business processes. The collection, maintenance, use, disclosure, and disposal of payment information and personal information by New GTY\u2019s business is regulated at state and federal levels, and cybersecurity legislation, executive orders and reporting requirements continue to evolve and become more complex. Because New GTY either directly or indirectly through service providers (i) provide the electronic transmission of sensitive and personal information released from and filed with various government entities and (ii) perform online payment and electronic check processing services, New GTY faces the risk of a security breach, whether through system attacks, hacking events, acts of vandalism or theft, malware, viruses, human errors, catastrophes or other unforeseen events that could lead to significant disruptions or compromises of information technology networks and systems or the unauthorized release or use of payment information or personal information. Additionally, vulnerabilities in the security of New GTY\u2019s own internal systems or those of New GTY\u2019s service providers could compromise the confidentiality of, or result in unauthorized access to, personal information of New GTY\u2019s employees.\nNew GTY rely on encryption and authentication technology purchased or licensed from third parties to provide the security and authentication tools to effectively secure transmission of confidential information, including user credit/debit card information and banking data. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography, threats that evolve ahead of tools designed to counter them, or other developments may result in the breach or compromise of technology used by them to protect transaction data. Data breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues, such as so-called \u201csocial engineering.\u201d\nDespite the various security measures that New GTY have in place to protect payment and personal information from unauthorized disclosure and to comply with applicable laws and regulations, their information technology networks and systems and those of their third-party vendors and service providers cannot be made completely secure against security incidents. Even the most well protected information, networks, systems, and facilities remain vulnerable to security breaches or disruptions, because (i) the techniques used in such attempts are constantly evolving and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases are designed not to be detected and, in fact, may not be detected for an extended period and (ii) the security methodologies, protocols, systems and procedures used for protection are implemented by humans at each level, and human errors may occur. Accordingly, New GTY may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate security barriers or other preventative measures, or if such measures are implemented, and even if appropriate training is conducted in support of such measures, human errors may still occur. It is impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk. A party, whether internal or external, who is able to circumvent New GTY\u2019s security measures, or those of their service providers, could misappropriate information, including, but not limited to payment information and personal information, or cause interruptions or direct damage to their partners or their users.\nUnder payment card rules and New GTY\u2019s contracts with their credit card processors, if there is a breach of payment card information that New GTY stores, processes, or transmits, they could be subject to fines. New GTY could also be liable to partners for costs of investigation, notification, remediation and credit monitoring and for any damages to users under applicable laws or their partner contracts.\nIn addition, any noncompliance with privacy laws or a security breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized access, use or disclosure of payment information or personal information, or other significant disruption involving New GTY\u2019s information technology networks and systems, or those of their service providers (whether or not caused by a breach of their contractual obligations or their negligence), may lead to negative publicity, impair New GTY\u2019s ability to conduct their business, subject us to private litigation and government investigations and enforcement actions and cause us to incur potentially significant liability, damages or remediation costs. It may also cause the governments with whom New GTY contracts to lose confidence in us, any of which may cause the termination or modification of their government contracts and impair their ability to win future contracts. Actual or anticipated attacks and risks affecting us, New GTY\u2019s service providers\u2019 or New GTY\u2019s government partners\u2019 environment may cause us to incur increasing costs, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, to train employees, and to engage third-party security experts and consultants. New GTY\u2019s insurance coverage may be insufficient to cover or protect against the costs, liabilities, and other adverse effects arising from a security breach or system disruption. If New GTY fail to reasonably maintain the security of confidential information, they may also suffer significant reputational and financial losses and New GTY\u2019s results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, and liquidity may be adversely affected.\nNew GTY may be unable to integrate new technologies and industry standards effectively, which may adversely affect their business and results of operations.\nNew GTY\u2019s future success will depend on their ability to enhance and improve the responsiveness, functionality, and features of their services in accordance with industry standards and to address the increasingly sophisticated technological needs of their customers on a cost-effective and timely basis. New GTY\u2019s ability to remain competitive will depend, in part, on New GTY\u2019s ability to:\n\u00b7 Enhance and improve the responsiveness, functionality, and other features of the government services they offer;\n\u00b7 Continue to develop their technical expertise;\n\u00b7 Develop and introduce new services, applications, and technology to meet changing customer needs and preferences; and\n\u00b7 Influence and respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes in a timely and cost-effective manner.\nNew GTY cannot ensure that they will be successful in responding to the above technological and industry challenges in a timely and cost-effective manner. If they are unable to integrate new technologies and industry standards effectively, New GTY\u2019s business could be harmed.\nPublic Sector-Related Risk Factors\nSelling products and services into the public sector poses unique challenges.\nNew GTY derive substantially all of their revenues from sales of software and services to state, county, and city governments, other municipal agencies, and other public entities. New GTY expect that sales to public sector clients will continue to account for substantially all of their revenues in the future. New GTY face many risks and challenges associated with contracting with governmental entities, including\n\u00b7 Resource limitations caused by budgetary constraints, which may provide for a termination of executed contracts due to a lack of future funding;\n\u00b7 Long and complex sales cycles;\n\u00b7 Contract payments at times being subject to achieving implementation milestones, and New GTY may have differences with clients as to whether milestones have been achieved;\n\u00b7 Political resistance to the concept of contracting with third-parties to provide IT solutions;\n\u00b7 Legislative changes affecting a local government\u2019s authority to contract with third-parties;\n\u00b7 Varying bid procedures and internal processes for bid acceptance; and\n\u00b7 Various other political factors, including changes in governmental administrations and personnel.\nEach of these risks is outside New GTY\u2019s control. If New GTY fail to adequately adapt to these risks and uncertainties, their financial performance could be adversely affected.\nA prolonged economic slowdown could harm New GTY\u2019s operations.\nA prolonged economic slowdown or recession could reduce demand for New GTY\u2019s software products and services. Local and state governments may face financial pressures that could in turn affect New GTY\u2019s growth rate and profitability in the future. There is no assurance that local and state spending levels will be unaffected by declining or stagnant general economic conditions, and if budget shortfalls occur, they may negatively impact local and state IT spending and could adversely affect New GTY\u2019s business.\nThe open bidding process creates uncertainty in predicting future contract awards.\nMany governmental agencies purchase products and services through an open bidding process. Generally, a governmental entity will publish an established list of requirements requesting potential vendors to propose solutions for the established requirements. To respond successfully to these requests for proposals, New GTY must accurately estimate their cost structure for servicing a proposed contract, the time required to establish operations for the proposed client, and the likely terms of any other third-party proposals submitted. New GTY cannot guarantee that they will win any bids in the future through the request for proposal process, or that any winning bids will ultimately result in contracts on favorable terms. New GTY\u2019s failure to secure contracts through the open bidding process, or to secure such contracts on favorable terms, may adversely affect their revenue and gross margins.\nNew GTY will face significant competition from other vendors and potential new entrants into their markets.\nNew GTY will face competition from a variety of software vendors that offer products and services similar to those offered by us, as well as from companies offering to develop custom software. New GTY expects to compete based on a number of factors, including\n\u00b7 The breadth, depth, and quality of their product and service offerings;\n\u00b7 The ability to modify their offerings to accommodate particular clients\u2019 needs;\n\u00b7 Technological innovation; and\n\u00b7 Name recognition, reputation and references.\nNew GTY believe the market is highly fragmented with a large number of competitors that vary in size, product platform, and product scope. New GTY\u2019s competitors will include consulting firms, publicly held companies that focus on selected segments of the public sector market, and a significant number of smaller, privately held companies. Certain competitors have greater technical, marketing, and financial resources than New GTY does. New GTY cannot assure you that such competitors will not develop products or offer services that are superior to New GTY\u2019s products or services or that achieve greater market acceptance.\nNew GTY will also compete with internal, centralized IT departments of governmental entities, which requires us to persuade the end-user to stop the internal service and outsource to us. In addition, New GTY\u2019s clients and prospective clients could elect to provide information management services internally through new or existing departments, which could reduce the market for New GTY\u2019s services.\nNew GTY could face additional competition as other established and emerging companies enter the public sector software application market and new products and technologies are introduced. Increased competition could result in pricing pressure, fewer client orders, reduced gross margins, and loss of market share. Current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third-parties, thereby increasing the ability of their products to address the needs of New GTY\u2019s prospective clients. It is possible that new competitors or alliances may emerge and rapidly gain significant market share. New GTY cannot assure you that they will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors, and the failure to do so would have a material adverse effect upon New GTY\u2019s business.\nIf New GTY is unable to meet the unique challenges involved in contracting with governments and government agencies, New GTY\u2019s business may be harmed.\nNew GTY\u2019s revenues are generated principally from contracts with state governments and government agencies within a state, and to a lesser extent with federal government agencies, to provide digital government services on behalf of those government entities to complete transactions and distribute public information digitally. New GTY face many risks uniquely associated with government contracting, including:\n\u00b7 Regulations that govern the fees they collect for many of their services, limiting their control over the level of transaction-based fees they are permitted to retain;\n\u00b7 The potential need for governments to draft and adopt specific legislation before they can circulate a request for proposal (\u201cRFP\u201d) to which they can respond or before they can otherwise award a contract or provide a new digital service;\n\u00b7 Unexpected changes in legislation that increase their costs or result in a temporary or permanent suspension of their services;\n\u00b7 The potential need for changes to legislation authorizing government\u2019s contracting with third parties to receive or distribute public information;\n\u00b7 Long and complex sales cycles that vary significantly according to each government entity\u2019s policies and procedures;\n\u00b7 Political resistance to the concept of government agencies contracting with third parties to receive or distribute public information, which has been offered traditionally only by the government agencies and often without charge;\n\u00b7 Changes in government administrations that could impact existing RFPs, rebids, renewals or extensions; and\n\u00b7 Government budget deficits and appropriation approval processes and periods, either of which could cause governments to curtail spending on services, including time and materials-based fees for application development or fixed fees for portal management.\nNew GTY\u2019s ability to grow revenues may be limited by the number of governments and government agencies that choose to provide digital government solutions such as those offered by us and by the finite number of governments with which New GTY may contract for their digital government solutions.\nNew GTY\u2019s revenues are generated principally from contracts with state governments and government agencies within a state to provide digital government solutions on behalf of those government entities to complete transactions and distribute public information digitally. The growth in New GTY\u2019s revenues largely will depend on government entities adopting solutions such as those offered by us. New GTY cannot ensure that government entities will choose to provide digital government services or continue to provide digital government services at current levels, or that they will provide such services with private assistance or by adopting solutions such as those offered by us. The failure to secure contracts with certain government agencies could result in revenue levels insufficient to support New GTY\u2019s operations on a self-sustained, profitable basis.\nNew GTY are subject to independent audits as requested by New GTY\u2019s government customers. Deficiencies in New GTY\u2019s performance under a government contract could result in contract termination, reputational damage, or financial penalties.\nEach government entity with which New GTY contract for outsourced portal services may have the authority to require an independent audit of their performance and financial management of contracted operations. The scope of audits could include inspections of income statements, balance sheets, fee structures, collections practices, service levels, security practices, and New GTY\u2019s compliance with contract provisions and applicable laws, regulations, and standards. The expansion of New GTY\u2019s operations into new markets and services may further expose us to requirements and potential liabilities under additional statutes and rules that have previously not been relevant to their business. New GTY cannot ensure that a future audit will not find any material performance deficiencies that would result in an adjustment to their revenues and result in financial penalties. Moreover, any consequent negative publicity could harm their reputation among other governments with which they would like to contract. These factors could harm New GTY\u2019s business, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition.\nRisk Factors Relating to Public Companies, Generally\nFluctuations in quarterly revenue could adversely impact New GTY\u2019s operating results and stock price.\nNew GTY\u2019s revenues and operating results are difficult to predict and may fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter for a variety of reasons, including:\n\u00b7 Prospective clients\u2019 contracting decisions are often made in the last few weeks of a quarter;\n\u00b7 The size of license transactions can vary significantly;\n\u00b7 Clients may unexpectedly postpone or cancel procurement processes due to changes in strategic priorities, project objectives, budget, or personnel;\n\u00b7 Client purchasing processes vary significantly and a client\u2019s internal approval, expenditure authorization, and contract negotiation processes can be difficult and time consuming to complete, even after selection of a vendor;\n\u00b7 The number, timing, and significance of software product enhancements and new software product announcements by their competitors may affect purchase decisions;\n\u00b7 New GTY may have to defer revenues under their revenue recognition policies; and\n\u00b7 Clients may elect subscription-based arrangements, which result in lower software license revenues in the initial year as compared to traditional, on-premise software license arrangements, but generate higher overall subscription-based revenues over the term of the contract.\nIn each fiscal quarter, New GTY\u2019s expense levels, operating costs, and hiring plans are based to some extent on projections of future revenues and are relatively fixed. If New GTY\u2019s actual revenues fall below expectations, they could experience a reduction in operating results. Also, if actual revenues or earnings for any given quarter fall below expectations, it may lead to a decline in New GTY\u2019s stock price.\nIncreases in service revenue as a percentage of total revenues could decrease overall margins.\nNew GTY realizes lower margins on software and appraisal service revenues than on license revenue. The majority of New GTY\u2019s contracts include both software licenses and software services. Therefore, an increase in the percentage of software service and appraisal service revenue compared to license revenue could have a detrimental impact on New GTY\u2019s overall gross margins and could adversely affect operating results.\nNew GTY\u2019s stock price may be volatile.\nThe market price of New GTY\u2019s common stock may be volatile. Examples of factors that may significantly impact New GTY\u2019s stock price include:\n\u00b7 Actual or anticipated fluctuations in their operating results;\n\u00b7 Announcements of technological innovations, new products, or new contracts by their competitors;\n\u00b7 Developments with respect to patents, copyrights, or other proprietary rights;\n\u00b7 Conditions and trends in the software and other technology industries;\n\u00b7 Adoption of new accounting standards affecting the software industry;\n\u00b7 Changes in financial estimates by securities analysts; and\n\u00b7 General market conditions and other factors.\nIn addition, the stock market has from time to time experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices of technology company stocks and may in the future adversely affect the market price of New GTY\u2019s stock. Sometimes, securities class action litigation is filed following periods of volatility in the market price of a particular company\u2019s securities. New GTY cannot assure you that similar litigation will not occur in the future with respect to us. Such litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources, which could have a material adverse effect upon New GTY\u2019s financial performance.\nNew GTY\u2019s financial outlook may not be realized.\nFrom time to time, in press releases and otherwise, New GTY may publish forecasts or other forward-looking statements regarding New GTY\u2019s results, including estimated revenues or earnings. Any forecast of New GTY\u2019s future performance reflects various assumptions. These assumptions are subject to significant uncertainties, and as a matter of course, any number of them may prove to be incorrect. Further, the achievement of any forecast depends on numerous risks and other factors (including those described in this discussion), many of which are beyond New GTY\u2019s control. As a result, New GTY cannot be certain that their performance will be consistent with any management forecasts or that the variation from such forecasts will not be material and adverse. Current and potential stockholders are cautioned not to base their entire analysis of New GTY\u2019s business and prospects upon isolated predictions, but instead are encouraged to utilize their entire publicly available mix of historical and forward-looking information, as well as other available information regarding us, their products and services, and the software industry when evaluating their prospective results of operations.\nCompliance with changing regulation of corporate governance, public disclosure and other regulatory requirements or industry standards may result in additional expenses.\nChanging laws, regulations, and standards relating to corporate governance, public disclosure and other regulatory requirements or industry standards, including the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, new SEC regulations and the Nasdaq Stock Market rules create uncertainty for public companies such as New GTYs\u2019. These laws, regulations, and standards are subject to varying interpretations in many cases due to their lack of specificity, and as a result, their application in practice may evolve over time as new guidance is provided by regulatory and governing bodies, which could result in continuing uncertainty regarding compliance matters and higher costs necessitated by ongoing revisions to disclosure and governance practices. New GTY is committed to maintaining adequate and appropriate standards of corporate governance and public disclosure. As a result, New GTY\u2019s efforts to comply with evolving laws, regulations, and standards have resulted in, and certain regulations could continue to result in, increased general and administrative expenses and a diversion of management time and attention from revenue-generating activities to compliance activities. Further, because of increasing regulation, New GTY\u2019s board members and executive officers could face an increased risk of personal liability in connection with the performance of their duties. As a result, New GTY may have difficulty attracting and retaining qualified board members and executive officers, which could harm their business. If New GTY\u2019s efforts to comply with new or changed laws, regulations, and standards differ from the activities intended by regulatory or governing bodies due to ambiguities in the laws themselves or related to practice, New GTY\u2019s reputation may be harmed.\nNew GTY\u2019s quarterly results of operations may be volatile and difficult to predict. If New GTY\u2019s quarterly results of operations, future growth, profitability or dividends fail to meet the expectations of public market analysts or investors, the market price of their common stock may decrease significantly.\nNew GTY\u2019s future revenues and results of operations may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors, many of which are outside of New GTY\u2019s control, and any of which may harm New GTY\u2019s business. These factors include:\n\u00b7 the commencement, completion, or termination of contracts during any quarter;\n\u00b7 the introduction of new services by their competitors;\n\u00b7 technical difficulties or system downtime affecting the operation of their services;\n\u00b7 the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to the expansion of their business operations and infrastructure;\n\u00b7 unexpected changes in federal, state and local legislation that increase New GTY\u2019s costs and/or result in a temporary or permanent decrease in New GTY\u2019s revenues;\n\u00b7 any federal government shutdown, such as the shutdown which commenced in December 2018, each of which impacts the ability of their customers to purchase New GTY\u2019s products and services;\n\u00b7 the seasonal use of some of their services, particularly the accessing of motor vehicle driver history records;\n\u00b7 changes in economic conditions;\n\u00b7 the result of negative cash flows due to capital investments; and\n\u00b7 significant charges related to acquisitions.\nDue to the factors noted above and the other factors described in these Risk Factors, New GTY\u2019s financial performance in a quarter may be lower than New GTY anticipates and if they are unable to reduce spending in that quarter, their results of operations for that quarter may be harmed. One should not rely on quarter-to-quarter comparisons of New GTY\u2019s results of operations as an indication of future performance. It is possible that in some future periods New GTY\u2019s results of operations may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors. If this occurs, the price of New GTY\u2019s common stock may decline. In addition, if they fail to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability, dividends or other market expectations, the price of New GTY\u2019s common stock may decline.\nBefore the business combination, the management of each of the newly acquired companies (collectively, the \u201cAcquirees\u201d) and their independent registered public accounting firms have identified internal control deficiencies, which such managements and independent registered public accounting firms believe constitutes material weaknesses. If New GTY fails to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting in the future, New GTY\u2019s ability to timely and accurately report New GTY\u2019s financial results could be adversely affected.\nEach Acquiree was previously a private company and therefore not required to comply with the rules of the SEC implementing Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Therefore, the Acquirees were not required to make a formal assessment of the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting. New GTY is required to comply with the SEC\u2019s rules implementing Sections 302 and 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which require management to certify financial and other information in quarterly and annual reports and provide an annual management report on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting.\nAlthough the Acquirees have not made assessments of the effectiveness of their internal control over financial reporting and did not engage their independent registered public accounting firms to conduct audits of their internal control over financial reporting, in connection with the audits of the Acquirees\u2019 financial statements, each Acquiree\u2019s management and independent registered public accounting firm identified one or more material weaknesses relating to such Acquiree\u2019s internal control over financial reporting under standards established by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, or PCAOB. The PCAOB defines a material weakness as a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company\u2019s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. A deficiency in internal control exists when the design or operation of a control does not allow management or employees, in the normal course of performing their assigned functions, to prevent or detect misstatements on a timely basis. A significant deficiency is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting that is less severe than a material weakness, yet important enough to merit attention by those responsible for oversight of a company\u2019s financial reporting.\nThe material weaknesses identified by the Acquirees and their independent registered public accounting firms included: (i) deficiencies in Bonfire\u2019s period end financial statement close process, (ii) each of CityBase\u2019s, eCivis\u2019s, Open Counter\u2019s and Sherpa\u2019s limited segregation of duties with regard to financial reporting activities such as payroll entry and processing due to the size of their respective accounting departments and (iii) deficiencies in Questica\u2019s period end financial statement close process resulting from, among other things, the preparation of financial statements for the proxy statement/prospectus with a different fiscal year end than its historical fiscal year end.\nNew GTY is evaluating what resources may be required to remediate the material weaknesses described above, which could result in additional costs. There is no assurance that any measures New GTY may take in the future will be sufficient to remediate the material weaknesses described above or to avoid potential future material weaknesses. If management fails to establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures, New GTY may not be able to produce timely and accurate financial statements and meet its SEC reporting obligations, which could result in sanctions by Nasdaq or the SEC. This could result in a loss of investor confidence and could lead to a decline in New GTY\u2019s stock price.", "PERMNO": 16464, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "GTYH"}
