{"cik": "1641991", "company": "SPX FLOW, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-18", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should consider the risks described below and elsewhere in our documents filed with the SEC before investing in any of our securities. We may amend, supplement or add to the risk factors described below from time to time in future reports filed with the SEC.\nDifficulties presented by international economic, political, legal, accounting and business factors could negatively affect our business.\nIn 2019, approximately 64% of our revenues were generated outside the United States, and approximately 25% of our revenues were generated from sales into emerging markets. We manage businesses with manufacturing facilities worldwide. Our reliance on non-U.S. revenues and non-U.S. manufacturing bases exposes us to a number of risks, including:\n\u2022Significant competition could come from local or long-term participants in non-U.S. markets who may have significantly greater market knowledge and substantially greater resources than we do;\n\u2022Local customers may have a preference for locally-produced products;\n\u2022Credit risk or financial condition of local customers and distributors could affect our ability to market our products or collect receivables;\n\u2022Regulatory or political systems or barriers may make it difficult or impossible to enter or remain in new markets. In addition, these barriers may impact our existing businesses, including making it more difficult for them to grow;\n\u2022Local political, economic and social conditions, including the possibility of hyperinflationary conditions, political instability, nationalization of private enterprises, or unexpected changes relating to currency could adversely impact our operations;\n\u2022Customs and tariffs may make it difficult or impossible for us to move our products or assets across borders in a cost-effective manner;\n\u2022Complications related to shipping, including delays due to weather, labor action, or customs, may impact our profit margins or lead to lost business;\n\u2022Government embargoes or foreign trade restrictions such as anti-dumping duties, as well as the imposition of trade sanctions by the United States or the European Union against a class of products imported from or sold and exported to, or the loss of \u201cnormal trade relations\u201d status with, countries in which we conduct business, could significantly increase our cost of products imported into the United States or Europe or reduce our sales and harm our business;\n\u2022Environmental and other laws and regulations could increase our costs or limit our ability to run our business;\n\u2022Our ability to obtain supplies from foreign vendors and ship products internationally may be impaired during times of crisis or otherwise;\n\u2022Local, regional or worldwide hostilities could impact our operations; and\n\u2022Distance, language and cultural differences may make it more difficult to manage our business and employees and to effectively market our products and services.\nAny of the above factors or other factors affecting social and economic activity in emerging markets or affecting the movement of people and products into and from these countries to our major markets, including North America and Europe, could have a significant negative effect on our operations.\nOur global operations could be negatively impacted by the economic and political instability caused by the exit of the United Kingdom (\u201cU.K.\u201d) from the European Union (\u201cE.U.\u201d).\nOn January 31, 2020, the U.K. separated from the E.U. (\u201cBrexit\u201d), culminating a process first approved by U.K. voters in a referendum held on June 23, 2016. Brexit has created instability and volatility in the global markets and could adversely affect European or worldwide economic or market conditions. Although it is unknown what the terms of exit will be, which are subject to negotiation during a transition period, they may impair the ability of our operations in the E.U. to transact business in the future in the U.K., and similarly the ability of our U.K. operations to transact business in the future in the E.U. Specifically, it is possible that there will be greater restrictions on imports and exports between the U.K. and E.U. countries and increased regulatory complexities. These changes may adversely affect our operations and financial results. In addition, Brexit could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations as the U.K. determines which E.U. laws to replace or replicate. Further, among other things, Brexit could reduce capital spending in the U.K. and the E.U., which could result in decreased demand for our products. Any of these effects of Brexit, and others we cannot anticipate, could adversely affect our business, business opportunities, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nMany of the markets in which we operate are cyclical or are subject to industry events, and our results have been and could be affected as a result.\nMany of the markets in which we operate are subject to general economic cycles or industry events. Certain of our markets, including food and beverage, chemical, mining, and petrochemical, particularly chemical companies and general industrial companies, are to varying degrees cyclical and have experienced, and may continue to experience, periodic downturns. Cyclical changes and specific industry events could also affect sales of products in our other businesses. Downturns in the business cycles of our different operations may occur at the same time, which could exacerbate any adverse effects on our business. See \u201cMD&A-Results of Reportable Segments.\u201d\nContract timing on large construction projects, including food and beverage systems, may cause significant fluctuations in revenues and profits from period to period.\nIn addition, certain of our businesses have seasonal fluctuations. Historically, some of our key businesses tend to be stronger in the second half of the year.\nOur business depends on capital investment and maintenance expenditures by our customers.\nDemand for most of our products and services depends on the level of new capital investment and planned maintenance expenditures by our customers. The level of capital expenditures by our customers fluctuates based on planned expansions, new builds and repairs, general economic conditions, availability of credit, and expectations of future market behavior. Any of these factors, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our customers and, in turn, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur customers could be impacted by commodity availability and price fluctuations.\nA number of factors outside our control, including fluctuating commodity prices, impact the demand for our products. Increased commodity prices may increase our customers' cost of doing business, thus causing them to delay or cancel large capital projects.\nOn the other hand, declining commodity prices may cause mines and other customers to delay or cancel projects relating to the production of such commodities. Also, oversupply could cause manufacturers to cut back on expenditures. Reduced demand for our products and services could result in the delay or cancellation of existing orders or lead to excess manufacturing capacity, which unfavorably impacts our absorption of fixed manufacturing costs. This reduced demand may also erode average selling prices in the relevant market.\nOur future restructuring activities could result in additional costs and operational difficulties which may affect our business.\nWe face risks relating to our efforts to reduce global costs, including those that are designed to reduce headcount and consolidate our manufacturing footprint. Consequently, charges to earnings as a result of these activities can vary significantly from period to period and, as a result, we may experience fluctuations in our reported cash flows, results of operations or earnings per share due to the timing of any restructuring actions. We risk the loss of valuable employees, operational difficulties, product quality, higher than expected restructuring costs, and difficulties arising from negotiations with work councils and other labor groups. We also risk disruption to our customer relationships if we are unable to meet our commitments to them. Further, these actions may take longer than anticipated, prove more costly than expected and distract management from other activities. Finally, we may not fully realize the expected benefits of these activities.\nThe price and availability of raw materials may adversely affect our business.\nWe are exposed to a variety of risks relating to the price and availability of raw materials. In recent years, we have faced volatility in the prices of many of our key raw materials, including petroleum-based products, steel and copper. Increases in the prices of raw materials, including as the result of the imposition or increase of tariffs, or shortages or allocations of materials may have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows, as we may not be able to pass cost increases on to our customers, or our sales may be reduced. We are subject to long-term supplier contracts that may increase our exposure to pricing fluctuations.\nCredit and counterparty risks could harm our business.\nThe financial condition of our customers could affect our ability to market our products or collect receivables. In addition, financial difficulties faced by our customers may lead to cancellation or delay of orders.\nOur customers may suffer financial difficulties that make them unable to pay for a project when completed or as payment milestones become due, or they may decide not to pay us, either as a matter of corporate decision-making or in response to changes in local laws and regulations. We cannot assure you that expenses or losses for uncollectible amounts will not have a material adverse effect on our revenues, earnings and cash flows.\nFailure to protect or unauthorized use of our intellectual property may harm our business.\nDespite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties or competitors may copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology. The steps we have taken may not prevent unauthorized use of our technology or knowledge, particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as in the United States. Costs incurred to defend our rights may be material.\nIf we are unable to protect our information systems against data corruption, cyber-based attacks or network security breaches, our operations could be disrupted.\nWe are increasingly dependent on information technology (\u201cIT\u201d) networks and systems, including the Internet, to process, transmit and store electronic information. In particular, we depend on such IT infrastructure for electronic communications among our locations around the world and between our personnel and suppliers and customers, and we rely on the systems and services of a variety of vendors to meet our data processing and communication needs. Despite our implementation of security measures, cybersecurity threats, such as malicious software, phishing attacks, computer viruses and attempts to gain unauthorized access, cannot be completely mitigated. Security breaches of our, our customers' and our vendors' IT infrastructure can create system disruptions, shutdowns or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information,\nincluding our intellectual property, trade secrets, customer information, other confidential business information or other information subject to data privacy laws. If we are unable to prevent, detect or adequately respond to such breaches, our operations could be disrupted, our competitiveness could be adversely affected or we may suffer financial damage or loss because of lost or misappropriated information or regulatory penalties. Such incidents also could require significant management attention and resources and result in increased costs. In addition, we must comply with increasingly complex regulatory standards enacted to protect business and personal information in the U.S. and elsewhere. For example, the E.U. adopted the General Data Protection Regulation (the \u201cGDPR\u201d), which became effective in 2018. The GDPR imposes additional obligations on companies regarding the handling of personal data and provides certain individual privacy rights to persons whose data is stored. Compliance with proposed and recently enacted laws, including GDPR, can be costly and any failure to comply with these regulatory standards could subject us to legal, financial and reputational risks.\nCurrency conversion risk could have a material impact on our reported results of business operations.\nOur non-U.S. operating results are translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. The strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies in which we conduct business could result in unfavorable translation effects as the results of transactions in foreign countries are translated into U.S. dollars. Increased strength of the U.S. dollar will increase the effective price of our products sold in U.S. dollars into other countries, which may have a material adverse effect on sales or require us to lower our prices, and also decrease our reported revenues or margins related to sales conducted in foreign currencies to the extent we are unable or determine not to increase local currency prices. Likewise, decreased strength of the U.S. dollar could have a material adverse effect stemming from the cost of materials and products purchased overseas.\nFailure to comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act or other applicable anti-bribery laws could have an adverse effect on our business.\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Recent years have seen a substantial increase in anti-bribery law enforcement activity with more frequent and aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by both the Department of Justice and the SEC, increased enforcement activity by non-U.S. regulators and increases in criminal and civil proceedings brought against companies and individuals. Our policies mandate compliance with anti-bribery laws. However, we operate in certain countries that are recognized as having governmental and commercial corruption. Our internal control policies and procedures may not always protect us from reckless or criminal acts committed by our employees or third-party intermediaries. Violations of these anti-bribery laws may result in criminal or civil sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nChanges in tax laws and regulations or other factors could cause our income tax rate to increase, potentially reducing our earnings and adversely affecting our cash flows.\nAs a global manufacturing company, we are subject to taxation in various jurisdictions around the world. In preparing our financial statements, we calculate our effective income tax rate based on current tax laws and regulations and the estimated taxable income within each of these jurisdictions. Our future effective income tax rate, however, may be higher due to numerous factors, including changes in tax laws or regulations. Additionally, our effective tax rate could be adversely affected if there is a change in international operations, our global footprint and how our operations are managed and conducted. An effective income tax rate significantly higher than our expectations could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and liquidity.\nWe seek to optimize our tax footprint across all operations in U.S. and non-U.S. jurisdictions alike. These benefits are contingent upon existing tax laws and regulations in the U.S. and in the countries in which our international operations are located. Future changes in domestic or international tax laws and regulations could adversely affect our ability to continue to realize these tax benefits.\nCost overruns, delays, penalties or liquidated damages could negatively impact our results, particularly with respect to long-term fixed-price contracts.\nSubstantially all our revenues are recorded and earned under fixed-price arrangements. A portion of our revenues and earnings is generated through long-term contracts. We recognize revenues for the majority of these long-term contracts over time (2019 and 2018) or using the percentage-of-completion method of accounting (2017) whereby revenues and expenses, and thereby profit, in a given period are determined based on our estimates as to the project status and the costs\nremaining to complete a particular project. During 2019, 2018 and 2017, approximately 22.8%, 25.3% and 15.8%, respectively, of our total revenues were recognized over time (2019 and 2018) or under the percentage-of-completion method (2017).\nEstimates of total revenues and cost at completion are subject to many variables, including the length of time to complete a contract. In addition, contract delays may negatively impact these estimates and our revenues and earnings results for affected periods.\nTo the extent that we underestimate the remaining cost or time to complete a project, we may overstate the revenues and profit in a particular period. Further, certain of these contracts provide for penalties or liquidated damages for failure to timely perform our obligations under the contract, or require that we, at our expense, correct and remedy to the satisfaction of the other party certain defects. Because substantially all of our long-term contracts are at a fixed price, we face the risk that cost overruns, delays, penalties or liquidated damages may exceed, erode or eliminate our expected profit margin, or cause us to record a loss on our projects.\nThe loss of key personnel and an inability to attract and retain qualified employees could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nWe are dependent on the continued services of our leadership team. The loss of these personnel without adequate replacement could have a material adverse effect on our operations. Additionally, we need qualified managers and skilled employees with technical and manufacturing industry experience in many locations in order to operate our business successfully. From time to time, there may be a shortage of skilled labor, which may make it more difficult and expensive for us to attract and retain qualified employees. If we were unable to attract and retain sufficient numbers of qualified individuals or our costs to do so were to increase significantly, our operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe operate in highly competitive markets. Our failure to compete effectively could harm our business.\nWe sell our products in highly competitive markets, which could result in pressure on our profit margins and limit our ability to maintain or increase the market share of our products. We compete on a number of fronts, including on the basis of product offerings, technical capabilities, quality, service and pricing. We have a number of competitors with substantial technological and financial resources, brand recognition and established relationships with global service providers. Some of our competitors have low cost structures, support from local governments, or both. In addition, new competitors may enter the markets in which we participate. Competitors may be able to offer lower prices, additional products or services or a more attractive mix of products or services, or services or incentives that we cannot or will not match. These competitors may be in a stronger position to respond quickly to new or emerging technologies and may be able to undertake more extensive marketing campaigns, and make more attractive offers to potential customers, employees and strategic partners. In addition, competitive environments in slow-growth markets, to which some of our businesses have exposure, have been inherently more influenced by pricing and domestic and global economic conditions. To remain competitive, we must invest in manufacturing, marketing, customer service and support and our distribution networks. We cannot assure you that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make the investment required to maintain or increase our market share or that our investments will be successful. If we do not compete successfully, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be materially adversely affected.\nOur strategy to outsource various elements of the products and services we sell subjects us to the business risks of our suppliers and subcontractors, which could have a material adverse impact on our operations.\nIn areas where we depend on third-party suppliers and subcontractors for outsourced products, components or services, we are subject to the risk of customer dissatisfaction with the quality or performance of the products or services we sell due to supplier or subcontractor failure. In addition, business difficulties experienced by a third-party supplier or subcontractor can lead to the interruption of our ability to obtain outsourced products or services and ultimately our inability to supply products or services to our customers. Third-party supplier and subcontractor business interruptions can include, but are not limited to, work stoppages, collective labor negotiations and other labor disputes. Current or future economic conditions could also impact the ability of suppliers and subcontractors to access credit and, thus, impair their ability to provide us quality products or services in a timely manner, or at all.\nWe are subject to laws, regulations and potential liability relating to claims, complaints and proceedings, including those relating to environmental and other matters.\nWe are subject to various laws, ordinances, regulations and other requirements of government authorities in the United States and other nations. With respect to acquisitions, divestitures and continuing operations, we may acquire or retain liabilities of which we are not aware, or which are of a different character or magnitude than expected. Additionally, changes in laws, ordinances, regulations or other governmental policies may significantly increase our expenses and liabilities.\nWe are subject to domestic and international environmental protection laws and regulations with respect to our business operations and are operating in compliance with, or taking action aimed at ensuring compliance with, these laws and regulations. We cannot assure you that our compliance obligations with environmental protection laws and regulations, individually or in the aggregate, will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nNumerous claims, complaints and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business, including those relating to litigation matters (e.g., class actions, derivative lawsuits and contracts, intellectual property and competitive claims), environmental matters, and risk management matters (e.g., product and general liability, automobile, and workers' compensation claims), have been filed or are pending against us and certain of our subsidiaries. From time to time, we face actions by governmental authorities, both in and outside the United States. Additionally, we may become subject to significant claims of which we are currently unaware or the claims of which we are aware may result in our incurring a significantly greater liability than we anticipate. Our insurance may be insufficient or unavailable (e.g., because of insurer insolvency, a significant adverse change in claim experience, or insurance coverage is not available in applicable insured periods) to protect us against potential loss exposures.\nWe devote significant time and expense to defend against the various claims, complaints and proceedings brought against us, and we cannot assure you that the expenses or distractions from operating our businesses arising from these defenses will not increase materially, or that any of our current or future claims or other matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nSee \u201cMD&A-Critical Accounting Policies and Use of Estimates-Contingent Liabilities\u201d and Note 16 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nIf the fair value of any of our reporting units is insufficient to recover the carrying value of the goodwill and other intangibles of the respective reporting unit, a material non-cash charge to earnings could result.\nAt December 31, 2019, we had goodwill and other intangible assets, net, of $753.2. We conduct annual impairment testing to determine if we will be able to recover all or a portion of the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles. In addition, we review goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment more frequently if impairment indicators arise. If the fair value is insufficient to recover the carrying value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangibles, we may be required to record a material non-cash charge to earnings.\nThe fair values of our reporting units generally are based on discounted cash flow projections that are believed to be reasonable under current and forecasted circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the recoverability of carrying values of the reported net assets of our reporting units. Other considerations are also incorporated, including comparable price multiples. The financial results of many of our businesses closely follow changes in the industries and end markets that they serve. We consider estimates and judgments that affect future cash flow projections, including principal methods of competition such as volume, price, service, product performance and technical innovations and estimates associated with cost reduction initiatives, capacity utilization, and assumptions for inflation and foreign currency changes. We monitor impairment indicators across all of our businesses. Significant changes in market conditions and estimates or judgments used to determine expected future cash flows that indicate a reduction in carrying value may give rise to impairments in the period that the change becomes known.\nWe are subject to potential labor disputes, extreme weather conditions and natural and other disasters, which may adversely impact our operations and cause us to incur incremental costs.\nWe have various collective labor arrangements covering certain non-U.S. employee groups. We are subject to potential work stoppages and other potential labor disputes. Further, we may be subject to work stoppages, which are beyond our control, at our suppliers or customers. In addition, extreme weather conditions in the areas in which our manufacturing facilities, service centers, distribution centers, suppliers and/or customers are located could adversely affect our operating\nresults and financial condition. Moreover, natural disasters such as the hurricanes that damaged our U.S. facilities in 2017 and 2018, whether occurring in the U.S. or elsewhere, and the related consequences such as energy shortages and public health issues, could disrupt our operations, the operations of our suppliers and customers, or result in economic instability. Other global or local events, such as terrorist attacks, political insurgencies, electrical grid disruptions and outages, and pandemics (including further spread of the coronavirus that recently surfaced in Wuhan, China) could also disrupt our operations, the operations of our suppliers and customers, or result in economic instability.\nOur technology is important to our success, and failure to develop new products may result in a significant competitive disadvantage.\nWe believe the development of our intellectual property rights is critical to the success of our business. In order to maintain our market positions and margins, we need to continually develop and introduce high quality, technologically advanced and cost-effective products on a timely basis, in many cases in multiple jurisdictions around the world. The failure to do so could result in a significant competitive disadvantage.\nOur current and planned products may contain defects or errors that are detected only after delivery to customers. If that occurs, our reputation may be harmed and we may face additional costs.\nWe cannot assure you that our product development, manufacturing and integration testing will be adequate to detect all defects, errors, failures and quality issues that could impact customer satisfaction or result in claims against us with regard to our products. As a result, we may have, and from time to time have had, to replace certain components and/or provide remediation in response to the discovery of defects in products that are shipped. The occurrence of any defects, errors, failures or quality issues could result in cancellation of orders, product returns, diversion of our resources, legal actions by our customers or our customers' end users and other losses to us or to any of our customers or end users, and could also result in the loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products and loss of sales, which would harm our business and adversely affect our revenues and profitability.\nIncreases in the number of shares of our outstanding common stock could adversely affect our common stock price or dilute our earnings per share.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of common stock into the public market, or the perception that these sales could occur, could have a material adverse effect on our stock price. As of December 31, 2019, we had the ability to issue up to an additional 2.7 shares as restricted stock shares, restricted stock units, or stock options under our SPX FLOW Stock Compensation Plan. Additionally, we may issue a significant number of additional shares, in connection with acquisitions or otherwise. We also may issue a significant number of additional shares through other mechanisms. Additional shares granted and/or issued would have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share.\nProvisions in our corporate documents and Delaware law may delay or prevent a change in control of our company, and accordingly, we may not consummate a transaction that our shareholders consider favorable.\nProvisions of our Certificate of Incorporation and By-laws may inhibit changes in control of our company not approved by our Board. These provisions include, for example: a prohibition on shareholder action by written consent; a requirement that special shareholder meetings be called only by our Chairman, President or Board; advance notice requirements for shareholder proposals and nominations; and the authority of our Board to issue, without shareholder approval, preferred stock with terms determined in its discretion. In addition, we are afforded the protections of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which could have similar effects. In general, Section 203 prohibits us from engaging in a \u201cbusiness combination\u201d with an \u201cinterested shareholder\u201d (each as defined in Section 203) for at least three years after the time the person became an interested shareholder unless certain conditions are met. These protective provisions could result in our not consummating a transaction that our shareholders consider favorable or discourage entities from attempting to acquire us, potentially at a significant premium to our then-existing stock price.\nOur indebtedness may affect our business and may restrict our operating flexibility.\nAt December 31, 2019, we had $714.5 in total indebtedness. On that same date, we had $494.9 of borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities, after giving effect to $5.1 reserved for outstanding letters of credit. In addition, at December 31, 2019, we had $69.6 of available issuance capacity under our foreign credit instrument facilities after giving effect to $80.4 reserved for outstanding bank guarantees. At December 31, 2019, our cash and equivalents balance was $299.2. See \u201cMD&A-Liquidity and Financial Condition - Borrowings and Availability\u201d and Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion. We may incur additional indebtedness in the future, including indebtedness\nincurred to finance, or assumed in connection with, acquisitions. We may renegotiate or refinance our senior credit facilities, senior notes or other debt facilities, or enter into additional agreements that have different or more stringent terms. The level of our indebtedness could:\n\u2022Impact our ability to obtain new, or refinance existing, indebtedness on favorable terms or at all;\n\u2022Limit our ability to obtain, or obtain on favorable terms, additional debt financing for working capital, capital expenditures or acquisitions;\n\u2022Limit our flexibility in reacting to competitive and other changes in the industry and economic conditions;\n\u2022Limit our ability to pay dividends on our common stock;\n\u2022Coupled with a substantial decrease in net operating cash flows due to economic developments or adverse developments in our business, make it difficult to meet debt service requirements; and\n\u2022Expose us to interest rate fluctuations to the extent existing borrowings are, and any new borrowings may be, at variable rates of interest, which could result in higher interest expense and interest payments in the event of increases in interest rates.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of principal or pay interest on, or to refinance, our indebtedness and to satisfy our other debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance, which may be affected by general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, business and other factors beyond our control. In addition, we cannot assure you that future borrowings or equity financing will be available for the payment or refinancing of our indebtedness. If we are unable to service our indebtedness, whether in the ordinary course of business or upon an acceleration of such indebtedness, we may pursue one or more alternative strategies, such as restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness, selling assets, reducing or delaying capital expenditures, revising implementation of or delaying strategic plans or seeking additional equity capital. Any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price. In addition, we cannot assure that we would be able to take any of these actions, that these actions would enable us to continue to satisfy our capital requirements, or that these actions would be permitted under the terms of our various debt agreements.\nNumerous banks in many countries are syndicate members in our credit facility. Failure of one or more of our larger lenders, or several of our smaller lenders, could significantly reduce availability of our credit, which could harm our liquidity.\nWe may not be able to finance future needs or adapt our business plan to react to changes in economic or business conditions because of restrictions placed on us by our senior credit facilities and any existing or future instruments governing our other indebtedness.\nOur senior credit facilities, the indentures governing our senior notes and agreements governing our other indebtedness contain, or future or revised instruments may contain, various restrictions and covenants that limit our ability to make distributions or other payments to our investors and creditors unless certain financial tests or other criteria are satisfied. We also must comply with certain specified financial ratios and tests. Our subsidiaries may also be subject to restrictions on their ability to make distributions to us. In addition, our senior credit facilities, indentures governing our senior notes and agreements governing our other indebtedness contain or may contain additional affirmative and negative covenants. Material existing restrictions are described more fully in the \u201cMD&A-Liquidity and Financial Condition-Borrowings and Availability\u201d and Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements. Each of these restrictions could affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities, such as acquisitions.\nIf we do not comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in our senior credit facilities, indentures governing our senior notes and agreements governing our other indebtedness, we could default under those agreements, and the debt, together with accrued interest, could be declared due and payable. If we default under our senior credit facilities, the lenders could cause all our outstanding debt obligations under our senior credit facilities to become due and payable or require us to repay the indebtedness under these facilities. If our debt is accelerated, we may not be able to repay or refinance our debt. In addition, any default under our senior credit facilities, indentures governing our senior notes or agreements governing our other indebtedness could lead to an acceleration of debt under other debt instruments that contain cross-acceleration or cross-default provisions. If the indebtedness under our senior credit facilities is accelerated, we may not have sufficient assets to repay amounts due under our senior credit facilities, senior notes or other debt securities then outstanding. Our ability to comply with these provisions of our senior credit facilities, indentures governing our senior notes and\nagreements governing our other indebtedness will be affected by changes in the economic or business conditions or other events beyond our control. Complying with our covenants may also cause us to take actions that are not favorable to us and may make it more difficult for us to successfully execute our business strategy and compete, including against companies that are not subject to such restrictions.\nDispositions or liabilities retained in connection with dispositions could negatively affect us.\nOur dispositions involve a number of risks and present financial, managerial and operational challenges, including diversion of management attention from running our core businesses, increased expense associated with the dispositions, potential disputes with the customers or suppliers of the disposed businesses, potential disputes with the acquirers of the disposed businesses and a potential dilutive effect on our earnings per share. In addition, we have agreed to retain certain liabilities in connection with the disposition of the Disposal Group.\nIf dispositions are not completed in a timely manner, there may be a negative effect on our cash flows and/or our ability to execute our strategy. In addition, we may not realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of our dispositions. See \u201cBusiness,\u201d \u201cMD&A-Results of Discontinued Operations,\u201d and Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements for the status of our divestitures.\nRisks Related to our spin-off from SPX Corporation in 2015\nThe Company was wholly-owned by SPX Corporation (the \u201cformer Parent\u201d) until September 26, 2015, at which time the former Parent distributed 100% of our outstanding common stock to its shareholders through a tax-free spin-off transaction (the \u201cSpin-Off\u201d).\nIn connection with our Spin-Off, our former Parent agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities and we agreed to indemnify our former Parent for certain liabilities. If we are required to act on these indemnities to our former Parent, we may need to divert cash to meet those obligations and our financial results could be negatively impacted. The indemnity from our former Parent may not be sufficient to insure us against the full amount of liabilities for which we will be allocated responsibility, and our former Parent may not be able to satisfy its indemnification obligations in the future.\nPursuant to the Separation and Distribution Agreement, the Employee Matters Agreement and the Tax Matters Agreement between us and our former Parent entered into in connection with the Spin-Off, it has agreed to indemnify us for certain liabilities, and we have agreed to indemnify our former Parent for certain liabilities, in each case for uncapped amounts. Such indemnities may be significant and could negatively impact our business, particularly our indemnity to our former Parent regarding the intended tax-free treatment of the Spin-Off. Third parties could also seek to hold us responsible for any of the liabilities that our former Parent has agreed to retain. Further, the indemnity from our former Parent may not be sufficient to protect us against the full amount of such liabilities, and our former Parent may not be able to fully satisfy its indemnification obligations. Moreover, even if we ultimately succeed in recovering from our former Parent any amounts for which we are held liable, we may be temporarily required to bear these losses ourselves. Each of these risks could negatively affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe Spin-Off may expose us to potential liabilities arising out of state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws and legal dividend requirements.\nThe Spin-Off is subject to review under various state and federal fraudulent conveyance laws. Fraudulent conveyance laws generally provide that an entity engages in a constructive fraudulent conveyance when (1) the entity transfers assets and does not receive fair consideration or reasonably equivalent value in return, and (2) the entity (a) is insolvent at the time of the transfer or is rendered insolvent by the transfer, (b) has unreasonably small capital with which to carry on its business, or (c) intends to incur or believes it will incur debts beyond its ability to repay its debts as they mature. An unpaid creditor or an entity acting on behalf of a creditor (including, without limitation, a trustee or debtor-in-possession in a bankruptcy by us or our former Parent or any of our respective subsidiaries) may bring a lawsuit alleging that the Spin-Off or any of the related transactions constituted a constructive fraudulent conveyance. If a court accepts these allegations, it could impose a number of remedies, including, without limitation, voiding our claims against our former Parent, requiring our shareholders to return to our former Parent some or all of the shares of our common stock issued in the Spin-Off, or providing our former Parent with a claim for monetary damages against us in an amount equal to the difference between the consideration received by our former Parent and the fair market value of our company at the time of the Spin-Off.\nThe measure of insolvency for purposes of the fraudulent conveyance laws will vary depending on which jurisdiction's law is applied. Generally, an entity would be considered insolvent if (1) the present fair saleable value of its\nassets is less than the amount of its liabilities (including contingent liabilities); (2) the present fair saleable value of its assets is less than its probable liabilities on its debts as such debts become absolute and matured; (3) it cannot pay its debts and other liabilities (including contingent liabilities and other commitments) as they mature; or (4) it has unreasonably small capital for the business in which it is engaged. We cannot assure you what standard a court would apply to determine insolvency or that a court would determine that we, our former Parent or any of our respective subsidiaries were solvent at the time of or after giving effect to the Spin-Off.\nThe distribution of our common stock is also subject to review under state corporate distribution statutes. Under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the \u201cDGCL\u201d), a corporation may only pay dividends to its shareholders either (1) out of its surplus (net assets minus capital) or (2) if there is no such surplus, out of its net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and/or the preceding fiscal year.\nAlthough we believe that we and our former Parent were each solvent at the time of the Spin-Off (including immediately after the distribution of shares of SPX FLOW common stock), that we are able to repay our debts as they mature and have sufficient capital to carry on our businesses, and that the distribution was made entirely out of surplus in accordance with Section 170 of the DGCL, we cannot assure you that a court would reach the same conclusions in determining whether our former Parent or we were insolvent at the time of, or after giving effect to, the Spin-Off, or whether lawful funds were available for the separation and the distribution to our former Parent's shareholders.\nA court could require that we assume responsibility for obligations allocated to our former Parent under the Separation and Distribution Agreement.\nUnder the Separation and Distribution Agreement with our former Parent, both we and our former Parent are responsible for the debts, liabilities and other obligations related to the business or businesses which it owns and operates. Although we do not expect to be liable for any obligations that are not allocated to us under the Separation and Distribution Agreement, a court could disregard the allocation agreed to between the parties, and require that we assume responsibility for obligations allocated to our former Parent (including, for example, environmental liabilities), particularly if our former Parent were to refuse or were unable to pay or perform the allocated obligations.\nWe are subject to continuing contingent tax liabilities of our former Parent.\nUnder the Internal Revenue Code and U.S. Treasury Regulations, each corporation that was a member of our former Parent's consolidated group for U.S. federal income tax purposes during any taxable period (or portion thereof) ending on or before the effective time of the Spin-Off is jointly and severally liable for the entire U.S. federal income tax liability of our former Parent's consolidated group for that taxable period subsequent to the year ended December 31, 2013. Our Tax Matters Agreement with our former Parent generally allocates economic responsibility for taxes of our former Parent's consolidated group to our former Parent. However, if our former Parent is unable to pay any such taxes, we could be liable for the entire amount of such taxes, which would include taxes arising out of the Spin-Off if our former Parent were to take an action (over which we may have no control) that causes the Spin-Off to be taxable to our former Parent.", "PERMNO": 15647, "SIC": 3561, "TIC": "FLOW"}
