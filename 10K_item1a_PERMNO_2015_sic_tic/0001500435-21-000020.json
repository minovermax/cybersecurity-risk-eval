{"cik": "1500435", "company": "GoPro, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-12", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nYou should carefully consider the risks described below and all other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K before making an investment decision. The risk factors below do not identify all risks that we face; our operations could also be affected by factors that are not presently known to us or that we currently consider to be immaterial to our operations. In that event, the trading price of our shares may decline, and you may lose part or all of your investment.\nRisks related to our business and industry\nWe may not be able to achieve revenue growth or profitability in the future, and if revenue growth or profitability is achieved, we may not be able to sustain it.\nOur historical results should not be considered as indicative of our future performance. For example, our annual revenue showed moderate growth from 2018 to 2019 from $1.148 billion to $1.195 billion, respectively. Our 2020 annual revenue of $891.9 million was negatively impacted by COVID-19. In future periods, we could experience\ndeclines in revenue, or revenue could remain flat or grow more slowly than we expect, which could have a material negative effect on our future operating results.\nIn addition, we incurred operating losses of $36.8 million, $2.3 million and $94.0 million for the full year 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. Lower levels of revenue or higher levels of operating expense in future periods may result in additional losses or limited profitability. Since the fourth quarter of 2016, we implemented four company-wide restructurings of our business resulting in a reduction in our global workforce and the elimination of certain open positions, consolidation of certain leased office facilities, as well as the elimination of several high-cost initiatives, including the closure of our aerial products business, in order to focus our resources on cameras and accessories, and software and subscription services. We may not realize further or sustain cost savings from these previous actions. We may continue to incur significant losses in the future for a number of reasons, including other risks described in this 2020 Annual Report, and we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown factors.\nOur goal to grow revenue and be profitable is dependent upon our ability to grow our direct-to-consumer business. If we do not effectively grow our direct-to-consumer business while simultaneously reducing our reliance on our other sales channels, our business, financial condition, results of operations and path to profitability could be harmed.\nOur ability to grow revenue and become profitable is dependent upon our ability to successfully implement certain strategic go to market initiatives. For example, some of our key strategic initiatives is to expand our direct-to-consumer presence through GoPro.com, expand our software and subscription services, and continue to work with key retail partners and distributors globally.\nWe depend upon effective sales channels, including our direct-to-consumer business through GoPro.com, to reach the consumers who are the ultimate purchasers of our products. We have converted portions of our distributors\u2019 business into direct sales, and believe growing sales directly to our consumers will allow us to provide a best in class experience for online purchases. As we continue to convert distribution to direct sales, we might not be successful in that transition. Additionally, any reduction in sales or decreases in revenue by our current distributors and retailers or loss of key distributors or retailers could adversely affect our revenue, operating results and financial condition.\nWe depend on retailers to provide adequate and attractive space for our products and point of purchase displays in their stores and acquiesce to our policies. We further depend on our retailers to employ, educate and motivate their sales personnel to effectively sell our products. Based on our strategic initiative to increase our direct-to- consumer sales through GoPro.com, our retailers may decide not to adequately display our products, choose to reduce the space for our products and POP displays in their stores, or choose not to carry some or all of our products or promote competitors\u2019 products over ours and as a result, our sales could decrease and impact our plan to become more profitable.\nWe may not be able to transition away from some distributor agreements as quickly as we would like as a result of contractual, regulatory or other restrictions and may encounter difficulties in the transition to a more focused direct-to-consumer model. Further, our distributors build inventory in anticipation of future sales, and if such sales do not occur as rapidly as they anticipate, our distributors may decrease the size of their future product orders.\nWe are also subject to the risks of our distributors and large retail customers encountering financial difficulties, which could impede their effectiveness and also expose us to financial risk if they are unable to pay for the products they purchase from us and we may not be able to collect our receivables, which would materially and adversely affect our profitability and cash flows from operations. This could cause our cash collections to decrease and bad debt expense to increase. While we may resort to alternative methods to pursue claims or collect receivables, these methods are expensive and time consuming, and successful collection is not guaranteed.\nThe COVID-19 outbreak has had a material impact on the United States and global economies and could have a material adverse impact on our employees, suppliers, customers and end consumers, which could adversely and materially impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, COVID-19, a pandemic and public health emergency of international concern. Many federal, state and local governments, and private entities have mandated various restrictions, including travel restrictions, restrictions on public gatherings, stay at home orders and advisories, and quarantining of people who may have been exposed to the virus. At this point, we cannot reasonably estimate the duration and severity of this pandemic, including multiple waves of increased infections or variants of the coronavirus, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nAs result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we accelerated a shift in our sales channel strategy to focus more on direct-to-consumer sales through GoPro.com, and implemented a restructuring plan in April 2020 to realign our workforce to areas of growth combined with certain cost saving measures. This restructuring plan aims to reduce future operating expenses, including a reduction of our global workforce by approximately 20% and the consolidation of certain leased office facilities. Execution of this restructuring plan may not achieve the results and savings we anticipate and our temporary cost saving measures may negatively affect employee morale and our future recruiting efforts.\nWe may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers and business partners. The extent of the impact will depend on the global severity of and actions taken to contain the outbreak, which are highly uncertain and unpredictable. A prolonged disruption or any further unforeseen delay in our operations or within any of our business activities could result in increased costs and reduced revenue.\nThe pandemic may adversely affect our customers, our employees and our employee productivity. It may also impact the ability of our contract manufacturers, vendors and suppliers to operate and fulfill their contractual obligations, and result in an increase in costs, tariffs, delays or disruptions in performance. These supply chain effects, the direct effect of the virus and the disruption on our employees and operations, may negatively impact both our ability to meet customer demand and our revenue and profit margins.\nWe might experience changes in consumer demand, particularly if GoPro product owners are restricted from participating in travel, adventure and sports activities that are often the subject of their use of our products and services and, as a result of the impacts on consumer discretionary spending resulting from the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the global economy. Both the health and economic aspects of the COVID-19 virus are highly fluid, and the future course of each is uncertain and subject to change.\nIf our sales fall below our forecasts, especially during the holiday season, our overall financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nSeasonal consumer shopping patterns significantly affect our business. We have traditionally experienced greater revenue in the fourth quarter of each year due to demand related to the holiday season, and in some years, including 2019, greater demand associated with the launch of new products heading into the holiday season. Fourth quarter revenue comprised 40%, 44% and 33% of our 2020, 2019 and 2018 revenue, respectively. Given the strong seasonal nature of our sales, appropriate forecasting is critical to our operations. We anticipate that this seasonal impact is likely to continue and any shortfalls in expected fourth quarter revenue due to macroeconomic conditions, any impact on consumer spending due to COVID-19 product release patterns, a decline in the effectiveness of our promotional activities, product mix, charges incurred against new products to support promotional activities, pricing pressures, supply chain disruptions, or for any other reason, including the fact that some retail locations may not be open for consumers due to COVID-19 restrictions, could cause our annual results of operations to suffer significantly. For example, due to a late stage production delay, our launch timing shifted for our HERO8 Black camera from Q3 2019 to Q4 2019 resulting in a material shift of revenue between Q3 2019 to Q4 2019. This product delay shortened the timeframe for holiday season sales and resulted in overall lower 2019 financial performance compared to our expectations.\nIn addition, we typically experience lower revenue in the first half of the year. For example, revenue of $253.6 million for the first half of 2020 decreased by $405.9 million, or 62%, compared to revenue of $659.5 million in the\nlast half of 2019. First half revenue comprised 28%, 45% and 42% of our annual 2020, 2019 and 2018 revenue, respectively.\nIn contrast, a substantial portion of our expenses are personnel-related and include salaries, stock-based compensation, benefits and incentive-based compensation plan expenses, which are not seasonal in nature. Furthermore, our customers may adjust their purchasing habits as a result of external events such as tariff avoidance or tariff impact that could result in a lower predictability of revenue. Accordingly, in the event of revenue shortfalls, we are generally unable to mitigate a negative impact on operating margins in the short term.\nIf the e-commerce technology systems that give our consumers the ability to shop with us online do not function effectively, our operating results, as well as our ability to grow our direct-to-consumer business and improve profitability, could be materially adversely affected.\nOur sales through GoPro.com represent an increasing percentage of our revenue and we are focused on continuing to accelerate the growth of our e-commerce sales. Revenue from GoPro.com represented 33% of revenue in the fourth quarter of 2020.\nAny failure to provide effective, reliable, user-friendly e-commerce platforms that offer a wide assortment of merchandise with rapid delivery options and that continually meet the changing expectations of online shoppers in many jurisdictions could place us at a competitive disadvantage, result in the loss of e-commerce and other sales, harm our reputation with consumers, have a material adverse impact on the growth of our e-commerce business globally and could have a material adverse impact on our business and results of operations.\nAny system interruptions or delays to our e-commerce business could cause potential consumers to fail to purchase our products, and could harm our reputation and brand. The operation of our direct-to-consumer e-commerce business through GoPro.com depends on our ability to maintain an efficient and uninterrupted operation of online order-taking and fulfillment operations. Our e-commerce operations subject us to certain risks that could have an adverse effect on our operating results, including risks related to the technology systems that operate GoPro.com and related support systems, such as system failures, viruses, cyberattacks, computer hackers and similar disruptions, including disruptions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, or the technology systems ability to accurately aggregate our total subscribers from different systems and the related revenue. If we or our designated third-party contractors and service providers are unable to maintain and upgrade GoPro.com, or if we encounter system interruptions or delays, our operating results could be adversely affected. We also sell in local currency on GoPro.com and we are subject to fluctuations in currency.\nOur future growth depends in part on further penetrating our total addressable market, and we may not be successful in doing so.\nHistorically, the majority of our growth has been fueled by the adoption of our products by people looking to self-capture images of themselves participating in exciting physical activities. We believe that our future growth depends on continuing to reach and expand our core community of users, followers and fans, and then utilizing that energized community as brand ambassadors to an extended community.\nWe believe that in order to expand our market, we must provide both innovative and easy-to-use products, as well as intuitive and easy-to-use software tools and services that enable effortless editing and sharing of content, with the smartphone central to the GoPro experience. While we believe our software and subscription products will increase our total addressable market, we may not be able to acquire and retain subscribers and cannot be certain that these efforts will be successful, and as a result, we may not be able to increase our total addressable market. We may not be able to expand our market through this strategy on a timely basis, or at all, and we may not be successful in providing tools that our users adopt or believe are easy to use.\nIf we are not successful in broadening our user base to reach more of our core customers with integrated solutions, our future revenue growth will be negatively affected, and we may not recognize benefits from our investments in the various components of our storytelling solutions, and the marketing, sales and advertising costs associated with promoting these solutions. Additionally, we may not obtain the expected acquisition and retention benefits and our business may be adversely affected.\nOur growth also depends on expanding the market with new capture perspectives with our 360-degree camera, MAX, which is a resource-intensive initiative in a highly competitive market, and by adding versatility to our\nproducts with expansion mods for HERO8 Black and HERO9 Black. While we are investing resources, including software development, sales and marketing, to reach these expanded and new consumer markets, we cannot be assured that we will be successful in doing so, including having adequate inventory to meet consumer demand. If we are not successful in penetrating additional markets, we might not be able to grow our revenue and we may not recognize benefits from our investment in new areas. For example, we made significant investments in the aerial market, but decided in the first quarter of 2018 to close our aerial business in light of difficult market and regulatory conditions, and margin challenges.\nTo remain competitive and stimulate consumer demand, we must effectively manage product introductions, product transitions, product pricing and marketing.\nWe believe that we must continually develop and introduce new products, enhance our existing products, and effectively stimulate consumer demand for new and upgraded products and services to maintain or increase our revenue. The markets for our products and services are characterized by intense competition, evolving distribution models, disruptive technology developments, short product life cycles, customer price sensitivity and frequent product introductions.\nThe success of new product introductions depends on a number of factors including, but not limited to, timely and successful research and development, pricing, market and consumer acceptance, the ability to successfully identify and originate product trends, effective forecasting and management of product demand, purchase commitments and inventory levels, availability of products in appropriate quantities to meet anticipated demand, ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of components for our new products from third-party suppliers, management of any changes in major component suppliers, management of manufacturing and supply costs, management of risks associated with new product production ramp-up issues, and the risk that new products may have quality issues or other defects or bugs in the early stages of introduction including testing of new parts and features. Additionally, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we may not be able to accurately forecast consumer demand and inventory requirements and appropriately manage inventory to meet demand. With respect to management and supply costs, we may be impacted by heightened demand for specialty memory, components and batteries that are not supported by our manufacturing partners. Such supply shortages may affect our ability to manage appropriate supply levels of our products and pricing pressures may negatively affect our gross margins.\nIn addition, the introduction or announcement of new products or product enhancements may shorten the life cycle of our existing products or reduce demand for our current products, thereby offsetting any benefits of successful product introductions and potentially lead to challenges in managing inventory of existing products. For example, in 2017, the introduction of the HERO6 Black camera at $499, while keeping the price point of the HERO5 Black camera at $399, negatively affected consumer demand for HERO5 Black, and we ultimately reduced the price of HERO5 Black to increase channel sell through rates. The HERO5 Black price adjustment had a cascading effect that resulted in price reductions for HERO5 Session and ultimately HERO6 Black cameras. Reduced product margins resulting from lower price point products may decrease the number of retailers willing to offer and promote our product lineup. Failure to manage and complete product transitions effectively or in a timely manner could harm our brand and lead to, among other things, lower revenue, excess prior generation product inventory or a deficit of new product inventory and reduced profitability. For example, as a result of reducing the price of our HERO5 Black cameras in December 2017 and HERO6 Black cameras in January 2018, we incurred price protection and marketing development funds charges which resulted in a reduction in our revenue, gross margins and operating profits.\nAdditionally, our brand and product marketing efforts are critical to stimulating consumer demand. We market our products globally through a range of advertising and promotional programs and campaigns, including social media. If we do not successfully market our products or plan the right promotions for the right products at the right time, the lack of success or increased costs of promotional programs could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe depend on sales of our cameras, mounts and accessories for substantially all of our revenue, and any decrease in the sales or change in sales mix of these products could harm our business.\nWe expect to derive the majority of our revenue from sales of cameras, mounts and accessories for the foreseeable future. A decline in the price or unit demand for these products, whether due to a strategic shift in sales channel strategy and macroeconomic conditions, including variable tariff rates, competition or otherwise, or our inability to increase sales of higher price point products, would harm our business and operating results more seriously than it would if we derived significant revenue from a variety of product lines and services. In particular, a decline in the price or unit demand of our HERO camera line or MAX camera, or our inability to increase sales of these products, could materially harm our business and operating results. Further, any delays or issues with our new product launches could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, due to a late stage production delay, we shifted the launch of the GoPro HERO8 Black camera from Q3 2019 to Q4 2019 resulting in a material shift of revenue from Q3 2019 to Q4 2019. This product delay shortened the timeframe for holiday season sales and resulted in overall lower 2019 financial performance compared to our expectations.\nOur research and development efforts are complex and require us to incur substantial expenses to support the development of our next generation cameras, editing applications and other products and services. Our research and development expenses were $131.6 million, $142.9 million and $167.3 million for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We expect that our research and development expenses will continue to be substantial in 2021 as we develop innovative technologies. Unanticipated problems in developing products could also divert substantial resources, which may impair our ability to develop new products and enhancements of existing products, and could further increase our costs. We may not be able to achieve an acceptable return, if any, on our research and development efforts, and our business may be adversely affected. As we continually seek to enhance our products, we will incur additional costs to incorporate new or revised features. We might not be able to, or determine that it is not in our interests to, raise prices to compensate for any additional costs.\nWhile we have developed and released products and services to add to our offerings, we may not be successful in achieving future revenue growth driven by newly released products and services. For example, we promoted our GoPro subscription in connection with our HERO camera lineup and MAX camera, to allow consumers to auto upload content to the cloud and make edits within the GoPro app editing solution. If all the components of the storytelling solutions do not work together seamlessly or our users do not adopt them, they may not drive camera sales and our operating results could be adversely affected. In addition, we have been and will continue to expend resources to further innovate and deliver editing and sharing software solutions. If the software does not function as expected or users do not adopt our solution, sales of our cameras and GoPro subscriptions may be negatively affected. We cannot be assured that our investments in the development of software-related products and services will result in either increased revenue or profit. Changes in product mix may harm our financial results. If there is a shift in consumer demand from our higher-priced to lower-priced cameras without a corresponding increase in units sold, our revenues and gross profit could decrease and losses could result.\nWe rely on third-party suppliers, some of which are sole-source suppliers, to provide components for our products which may lead to supply shortages, long lead times for components, and supply changes, any of which could disrupt our supply chain and may increase our costs.\nOur ability to meet customer demand depends, in part, on our ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of components for our products. All of the components that go into the manufacturing of our cameras and accessories are sourced from third-party suppliers.\nSome of the key components used to manufacture our products come from a limited or single source of supply, or by a supplier that could potentially become a competitor. Our contract manufacturers generally purchase these components on our behalf from approved suppliers. We are subject to the risk of shortages and long lead times in the supply of these components and the risk that our suppliers discontinue or modify components used in our products. In addition, the lead times associated with certain components are lengthy and preclude rapid changes in quantities and delivery schedules and could increase as a result of COVID-19. We have in the past experienced and may in the future experience component shortages, and the availability of these components may be unpredictable, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIf we lose access to components from a particular supplier or experience a significant disruption in the supply of products and components from a current supplier, we may be unable to locate alternative suppliers of comparable quality at an acceptable price, or at all, and our business could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, if we experience a significant increase in demand for our products, our suppliers might not have the capacity or elect not to meet our needs as they allocate components to other customers. Developing suitable alternate sources of supply for these components may be time-consuming, difficult and costly, and we may not be able to source these components on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all, which may adversely affect our ability to meet our development requirements or to fill our orders in a timely or cost-effective manner.\nOur reliance on single source, or a small number of suppliers involves a number of additional risks, including risks related to supplier capacity constraints, price increases, timely delivery, component quality, failure of a key supplier to remain in business and adjust to market conditions, delays in, or the inability to execute on, a supplier roadmap for components and technologies, and natural disasters, fire, acts of terrorism, pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic, or other catastrophic events.\nIn particular, for our camera designs, we incorporate system on chips, sensors, lens, batteries and memory solutions that critically impact the performance of our products. These components have unique performance profiles, and, as a result, it is not commercially practical to support multiple sources for these components for our products. For example, we incorporate the GP1 system on chip from Socionext, Inc. in MAX as well as our HERO9, HERO8 and HERO7 Black cameras and rely on Socionext as the primary supplier of our system on chips. Developing next generation system on chips is a resource intensive process requiring increased investment to meet development schedules, which may impact future product schedules and overall margin expectations. If other suppliers of systems on chips become more advanced in performance or more competitive in cost, we may be placed at a disadvantage and not be able to continue improving our product performance as quickly or as competitively as planned or be able to achieve the product margins needed to be successful. We do not currently have alternative suppliers for several key components. In addition, our products also require passive components such as resistors and multi-layer ceramic capacitors, which may experience supply shortages and lengthening lead-times within the consumer electronics industry and may impact our supply chain. In the event that any of our key suppliers are unable to supply the components that we need to produce our products to meet anticipated customer demand, our business would be materially and adversely affected.\nWe operate in a highly competitive market and the size and resources of some of our competitors may allow them to compete more effectively than we can. New entrants also enter the digital imaging market category from time-to-time. These market factors could result in a loss of our market share and a decrease in our revenue and profitability.\nThe digital imaging market is highly competitive. Further, competition has intensified in digital imaging as new market entrants and existing competitors have introduced new products and more competitive offerings into our markets. Increased competition, tariffs, and changing consumer preferences may result in pricing pressures, reduced profit margins and may impede our ability to continue to increase the sales of our products or cause us to lose market share, any of which could substantially harm our business and results of operations.\nWe compete against established, well-known camera manufacturers such as Canon Inc. and Nikon Corporation, as well as large, diversified electronics companies such as Samsung Electronics Co. and Sony Corporation, and specialty companies such as Garmin Ltd., the Ricoh Company, Ltd., Shenzhen Arashi Vision Co., Ltd. and SZ DJI Technology Co., Ltd. Many of our competitors have substantial market share, diversified product lines, well-established supply and distribution systems, strong worldwide brand recognition and greater financial, marketing, research and development and other resources than we do. Additionally, many of our existing and potential competitors enjoy substantial competitive advantages, such as longer operating histories; the capacity to leverage their sales efforts and marketing expenditures across a broader portfolio of products; broader distribution and established relationships with channel partners or vertically integrated business units; access to larger established customer bases; greater resources to make acquisitions; larger intellectual property portfolios; and the ability to bundle competitive offerings with other products and services. Further, new companies may emerge and offer competitive products directly in our category. We are aware that certain companies have developed cameras designed and packaged to appear similar to our products, which may confuse consumers or distract consumers from purchasing GoPro products.\nMoreover, smartphones and tablets with photo and video functionality have significantly displaced the market for traditional cameras, and the makers of those devices also have mobile and other content editing applications and storage for content captured with those devices. We continue to focus on the value proposition of the GoPro mobile application by introducing new features and benefits that we believe will enable customers to edit and share their content easily. Our software applications and GoPro subscription may not be as compelling as those offered by other companies, such as Apple, Adobe or Google, although the GoPro application supports content from other platforms including content from iOS and Android. Manufacturers of smartphones and tablets, such as Apple, Google and Samsung may continue to design their products for use in a range of conditions, including challenging physical environments and waterproof capabilities, or develop products with features similar to ours.\nOur gross margins can vary significantly depending on multiple factors, which can result in unanticipated fluctuations in our operating results.\nOur gross margins can vary due to consumer demand, competition, product pricing, product lifecycle, product mix, new product introductions, commodity, supply chain and logistics costs, currency exchange rates, trade policy and tariffs, and the complexity and functionality of new product innovations and other factors. For example, our gross margin was 35.3%, 34.6% and 31.5% for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. In particular, if we are not able to introduce new products in a timely manner at the product cost we expect, or if consumer demand for our products is less than we anticipate, or if there are product pricing, marketing and other initiatives by our competitors to which we need to react or that are initiated by us to drive sales that lower our margins, then our overall gross margin will be less than we project. For example, due to a late stage production delay, we shifted the launch of the GoPro HERO8 Black camera from Q3 2019 to Q4 2019, resulting in a material shift of revenue from Q3 2019 to Q4 2019 and a corresponding impact on our gross margin.\nAs we innovate with new products, we may have lower gross margins that do not deliver a sufficient return on investment. In addition, depending on competition or consumer preferences, we may face higher up-front investments in development to compete or market our products, and increased inventory write-offs. If we are unable to offset these potentially lower margins by enhancing the margins in our product categories, our profitability may be adversely affected.\nThe impact of these factors on gross margins can create unanticipated fluctuations in our operating results, which may cause volatility in the price of our shares.\nWe depend on key personnel to operate and grow our business. If we are unable to attract, engage and retain qualified personnel, our ability to develop, transform and successfully grow and operate our business could be harmed.\nWe believe that our future success is highly dependent on the contributions of our CEO and our executive officers, as well as our ability to attract and retain highly skilled and experienced research and development, and other personnel in the United States and abroad. All of our employees, including our executive officers, are free to terminate their employment relationship with us at any time, and their knowledge of our business and industry may be difficult to replace.\nSince the fourth quarter of 2016, we implemented four global reductions-in-force and restructuring actions to reduce our operating expenses. These changes, and any future changes, in our operations and management team could be disruptive to our operations. Our restructuring actions and any future restructuring actions could have an adverse effect on our business as a result of decreases in employee morale and the failure to meet operational targets due to the loss of employees. If key employees leave, we may not be able to fully integrate new personnel or replicate the prior working relationships, and our operations could suffer as a result.\nQualified individuals are in high demand, and we may incur significant costs to attract and retain them. While we utilize competitive salary, bonus and long-term incentive packages to recruit new employees, many of the companies with which we compete for experienced personnel also have greater resources than we do. Competition for qualified personnel is particularly intense in the San Francisco Bay Area, where our headquarters are located. We have from time to time experienced, and we expect to continue to experience, difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees with appropriate qualifications. In addition, job candidates and existing employees often consider the value of the equity awards they receive in connection with their employment. Fluctuations in the price of our Class A common stock may make it more difficult or costly to use equity\ncompensation to motivate, incentivize and retain our employees. For example, during 2020, our closing stock price ranged from a high of $8.86 in the fourth quarter to a low of $2.01 in the first quarter. If we are unable to attract and retain highly skilled personnel, we may not be able to achieve our strategic objectives, and our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.\nChanges to trade agreements, trade policies, tariffs and import/export regulations may have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nThe United States and other countries in which our products are produced or sold internationally have imposed and may impose additional quotas, duties, tariffs, or other restrictions or regulations, or may adversely adjust prevailing quota, duty, tariff levels, or export or other licensing requirements. Countries impose, modify and remove tariffs and other trade restrictions in response to a diverse array of factors, including global and national economic and political conditions, which make it impossible for us to predict future developments regarding tariffs and other trade restrictions. Trade restrictions, including tariffs, quotas, embargoes, safeguards and customs restrictions, could increase the cost or reduce the supply of products, including components and materials, available to us or may require us to modify our supply chain organization or other current business practices, any of which could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are dependent on international trade agreements and regulations. If the United States were to withdraw from or materially modify certain international trade agreements, our business and operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe do not have internal manufacturing capabilities and rely on several contract manufacturers, including component vendors, located in China and in other countries to manufacture our products. Our contract manufacturer locations expose us to risks associated with doing business globally, including risks related to changes in tariffs or other export and import restrictions, and increased security costs. Additionally, the current United States administration continues to signal that it may continue to alter global trade agreements and terms. For example, the United States imposed additional tariffs on imports from China and continues to potentially impose other restrictions on exports from China to the United States. The Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) recently identified certain Chinese imported goods for additional tariffs to address China\u2019s trade policies and practices. Any announcement by the USTR to impose tariffs on GoPro cameras could have a material adverse effect on our United States bound production, business and results of our United States operations. If these duties are imposed on our cameras, we may be required to raise our prices, which may result in the loss of customers and harm our business and results of operations, or we may choose to pay for these tariffs without raising prices which may negatively impact our results of operations and profitability. Sales of our products in China are material to our business and represent a significant portion of our revenue. This revenue stream from China is at risk in the event China imposes retaliatory tariffs impacting in-bound sales of our products or imposes any other export restrictions on our products.\nWe continue to monitor manufacturing capabilities outside of China and may choose to pursue those capabilities to mitigate risks of additional tariffs, duties or other restrictions on our products and may decide to transition more manufacturing outside of China.\nWe face substantial risks related to inventory, purchase commitments and long-lived assets, and we could incur material charges related to these items that adversely affect our operating results.\nTo ensure adequate inventory supply and meet the demands of our retailers and distributors, we must forecast inventory needs and place orders with our contract manufacturers and component suppliers based on our estimates of future demand for particular products as well as accurately track the level of product inventory in the channel to ensure we are not in an over or under supply situation. To the extent we discontinue the manufacturing and sales of any products or services, we must manage the inventory liquidation, supplier commitments and customer expectations. For example, in 2018, we exited the aerial business, but still had inventory of our Karma drone, which we sold throughout 2018.\nNo assurance can be given that we will not incur additional charges in future periods related to our inventory management or that we will not underestimate or overestimate forecasted sales in a future period. Our ability to accurately forecast demand for our products is affected by many factors, including product introductions by us and our competitors, channel inventory levels, unanticipated changes in general market demand, macroeconomic\nconditions and consumer confidence. If we do not accurately forecast customer demand for our products, we may in future periods be unable to meet consumer, retailer or distributor demand for our products, or may be required to incur higher costs to secure the necessary production capacity and components, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nIf we fail to manage our operating expenses effectively, our financial performance may suffer.\nOur success will depend in part upon our ability to manage our operating expenses, including but not limited to our cash management, effectively. We incurred significant operating losses in 2020 and 2019 and, as of December 31, 2020, we had an accumulated deficit of $650.5 million. Beginning in the fourth quarter of 2016 through the second quarter of 2020, we implemented four global reductions-in-force and other restructuring actions to reduce our operating expenses. Although we plan to seek to operate efficiently and to manage our costs effectively, we may not realize the cost savings expected from these actions.\nWe will need to continue to improve our operational, financial and management controls, reporting processes and procedures, and financial and business information systems. We are also investing in areas we believe will grow revenue and our operating expenses might increase as a result of these investments. If we are unable to operate efficiently and manage our costs, we may continue to incur significant losses in the future and may not be able to maintain or achieve profitability.\nIn the future, in response to unfavorable market conditions or consumer demand, we may again need to strategically realign our resources, adjust our product line and/or enact price reductions in order to stimulate demand, and implement additional restructurings and workforce reductions. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2017 and first quarter of 2018, we reduced the pricing on our entire camera product line to increase consumer demand, closed our aerial products business due to unfavorable market conditions, and implemented a workforce reduction. Any such actions may result in the recording of charges including inventory-related write-offs, or other restructuring costs. Additionally, our estimates with respect to the useful life or ultimate recoverability of our assets, including purchased intangible assets and tooling, could also change and result in impairment charges.\nSecurity and data protection breaches and cyberattacks could disrupt our products, services, internal operations, or information technology systems, and any such disruption could reduce our expected revenue, increase our expenses, damage our reputation, and cause our stock price to decline significantly.\nOur products, services and operating systems may contain unknown security vulnerabilities. For example, the firmware and software that are installed on our products may be susceptible to hacking or misuse. In addition, we offer a comprehensive online cloud management service through our GoPro subscription, which can be paired with our cameras. If malicious actors compromise the GoPro subscription, or if customer confidential information stored in the subscription is accessed without authorization, our business will be harmed.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we electronically maintain sensitive data, including intellectual property, our proprietary business information and that of our customers and suppliers, and some personally identifiable information of our customers and employees in our facilities and on our networks. Through the GoPro subscription, users may store video and image files, including any telemetry or metadata that the user has chosen to associate with those files in the cloud. In our e-commerce services, we process, store and transmit consumer data. We also collect user data through certain marketing activities. For all of the foregoing internal and customer or consumer facing data and content collection, we collect and store that information in our or our third-party providers\u2019 electronic systems. These systems may be targets of attacks, such as viruses, malware or phishing attempts by cyber criminals or other wrongdoers seeking to steal our users\u2019 content or data, or our customer\u2019s information for financial gain or to harm our business operations or reputation.\nAny security breach, unauthorized access or usage, virus or similar breach or disruption of our systems, including web hosting services, billing and payment processing, or software could result in the loss of confidential information, costly investigations, remediation efforts and costly notification to affected consumers. If such content were accessed by unauthorized third parties or deleted inadvertently by us or third parties, our brand and reputation could be adversely affected. Cyberattacks could also adversely affect our operating results, consume internal resources and result in litigation or potential liability for us and otherwise harm our business. Further, we are subject to general consumer regulations and laws, as well as regulations and laws specifically related to\nsecurity and privacy of consumer data or content. In the event of an incident affecting the security of consumer data or content, regulators may open an investigation or pursue fines or penalties for non-compliance with these laws, or private plaintiffs may sue us, resulting in additional costs and reputational harm to our business.\nInterruptions with the cloud-based systems that we use in our operations, provided by an affiliate of Amazon.com, Inc. (Amazon), may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe host the GoPro app, the GoPro subscription, GoPro Awards, our website account sign up and login and firmware upgrades for our cameras using Amazon Web Services (AWS) data centers, a provider of cloud infrastructure services, and may in the future use other third-party cloud-based systems in our operations. Accordingly, our operations depend on protecting the virtual cloud infrastructure hosted in AWS by maintaining its configuration, architecture, features, and interconnection specifications, as well as the information stored in these virtual data centers and which third-party internet service providers transmit. Any incident affecting their infrastructure that may be caused by human error, fire, flood, severe storm, earthquake, or other natural disasters, cyberattacks, terrorist or other attacks, and other similar events beyond our control could negatively affect the GoPro subscription service. A prolonged AWS service disruption affecting our GoPro subscription for any of the foregoing reasons would negatively impact our ability to serve our consumers and could damage our reputation with current and potential consumers, expose us to liability, cause us to lose consumers, or otherwise harm our business. We may also incur significant costs for using alternative equipment or taking other actions in preparation for, or in reaction to, events that damage the AWS services we use. Further, if we were to make updates to the GoPro subscription that were not compatible with the configuration, architecture, features, and interconnection specifications of the third-party platform, our service could be disrupted.\nIn the event that our AWS service agreements are terminated, or there is a lapse of service, elimination of AWS services or features that we use, interruption of internet service provider connectivity, or damage to such facilities, we could experience interruptions in access to the GoPro subscription as well as significant delays and additional expense in arranging or creating new facilities and services and/or re-architecting our solutions for deployment on a different cloud infrastructure service provider, which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAny significant cybersecurity incidents or disruption of our information systems, and our reliance on Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) technologies from third parties, could adversely affect our business operations and financial results.\nWe are increasingly dependent on information systems to process transactions, manage our supply chain and inventory, ship goods on a timely basis, maintain cost-efficient operations, complete timely and accurate financial reporting, operate GoPro.com and respond to customer inquiries.\nOur information systems and those of third parties we use in our operations are vulnerable to cybersecurity risk, including cyberattacks such as distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, computer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins that damage operating systems, and similar disruptions. Additionally, these systems periodically experience directed attacks intended to lead to interruptions and delays in our operations as well as loss, misuse or theft of data. The increase in remote working due to the COVID-19 pandemic may also result in heightened risks related to consumer privacy, network security and fraud. We have implemented physical, technical and administrative safeguards to protect our systems. To date, unauthorized users have not had a material effect on our systems; however, there can be no assurance that attacks will not be successful in the future. In addition, our information systems must be constantly updated, patched and upgraded to protect against known vulnerabilities and optimize performance. Material disruptions or slowdown of our systems, including a disruption or slowdown could occur if we are unable to successfully update, patch and upgrade our systems.\nSystem disruptions, failures and slowdowns, whether caused by cyberattacks, update failures or other causes, could affect our financial systems and operations. This could cause delays in our supply chain or cause information, including data related to customer orders, to be lost or delayed which could result in delays in the delivery of merchandise to our stores and customers or lost sales, especially if the disruption or slowdown occurred during our seasonally strong fourth quarter. Any of these events could reduce demand for our products, impair our ability to complete sales through our e-commerce channels and cause our revenue to decline. If\nchanges in technology cause our information systems to become obsolete, or if our information systems are inadequate to handle our growth, we could lose customers or our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nThe information systems used by our third-party service providers are vulnerable to these risks as well. In particular, we are heavily reliant on SaaS enterprise resource planning systems to conduct our order and inventory management, e-commerce and financial transactions and reporting. In addition, we utilize third-party cloud computing services in connection with our business operations. Problems faced by us or our third-party hosting/cloud computing providers, or content delivery network providers, including technological or business-related disruptions, as well as cybersecurity threats, could adversely affect our business and operating results, our ability to accurately report our financial results, as well as the experience of our consumers, which in turn could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nAs we expand our operations, we expect to utilize additional systems and service providers that may also be essential to managing our business. Our ability to manage our business would suffer if one or more of our providers suffer an interruption in their business, or experience delays, disruptions or quality control problems in their operations, or we have to change or add systems and services. While we conduct reasonable diligence on our service providers, we may not always be able to control the quality of the systems and services we receive from these providers, which could impair our ability to maintain appropriate internal control over financial reporting and complete timely and accurate financial reporting, and may affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nOur international business operations account for a significant portion of our revenue and operating expenses and are subject to challenges and risks.\nRevenue from outside the United States comprised 52%, 64% and 65% of our revenue in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, and we expect international revenue to continue to be significant in the future. Further, we currently have foreign operations in Australia, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Netherlands, Philippines, Romania, United Kingdom and a number of other countries in Europe and Asia. Operating in foreign countries requires significant resources and considerable management attention, and we may enter new geographic markets where we have limited or no experience in marketing, selling, and deploying our products. International expansion has required and will continue to require us to invest significant funds and other resources and we cannot be assured our efforts will be successful. International sales and operations may be subject to risks such as:\n\u2022difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022burdens of complying with a wide variety of laws and regulations, including environmental, packaging and labeling;\n\u2022adverse tax effects and foreign exchange controls making it difficult to repatriate earnings and cash;\n\u2022changes to the taxation of undistributed foreign earnings;\n\u2022the effect of foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates, including any fluctuations caused by uncertainties relating to Brexit or the strengthening of the U.S. dollar;\n\u2022political, economic instability, or social unrest in a specific country or region in which we operate, including, for example, the effects of Brexit, which could have an adverse impact on our operations in that location;\n\u2022organized crime activity;\n\u2022terrorist activities, acts of war, natural disasters, and pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022quarantines or other disruptions to our operations resulting from pandemics or other widespread public health problems;\n\u2022trade restrictions;\n\u2022differing employment practices and laws and labor disruptions;\n\u2022the imposition of government controls;\n\u2022lesser degrees of intellectual property protection;\n\u2022tariffs and customs duties and the classifications of our goods by applicable governmental bodies;\n\u2022a legal system subject to undue influence or corruption; and\n\u2022a business culture in which illegal sales practices may be prevalent.\nThe occurrence of any of these risks could negatively affect our international business and consequently our business, operating results and financial condition.\nA small number of retailers and distributors account for a substantial portion of our revenue, and if our relationships with any of these retailers or distributors were to be terminated or the level of business with them significantly reduced, our business could be harmed.\nOur ten largest third-party customers, measured by the revenue we derive from them, accounted for 44%, 42% and 48% of our revenue in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. One retailer accounted for 10%, 11% and 13% of our revenue for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The loss of a small number of our large customers, or the reduction in business with one or more of our large customers, could have a significant adverse effect on our operating results. In addition, we may choose to temporarily or permanently stop shipping product to customers who do not follow the policies and guidelines in our sales agreements, which could have a material negative effect on our revenues and operating results. Our sales agreements with these large customers do not require them to purchase any meaningful amount of our products annually and we grant limited rights to return product to some of these large customers.\nIf we encounter problems with our distribution system, our ability to deliver our products to the market and to meet customer expectations could be harmed.\nWe rely on third-party distribution facilities and logistics operators for substantially all of our product distribution to distributors and directly to retailers. Our distribution facilities include computer controlled and automated equipment, which means their operations may be vulnerable to computer viruses or other security risks, the proper operation of software and hardware, electronic or power interruptions or other system failures. Further, because substantially all of our products are distributed from only a few locations and by a small number of companies, our operations could be interrupted by labor difficulties, extreme or severe weather conditions, pandemics, such as the continued spread of COVID-19, terrorism, political unrest, cyber-attacks, floods, fires or other natural disasters or events beyond our control near our distribution centers, or port shutdowns or other transportation-related interruptions, including security breaches along our distribution routes. Additionally, we use one primary supplier for the third-party distribution and if this supplier were to experience financial difficulties, cyber-attacks, or other types of interruption it could adversely affect our business.\nOur success depends on our ability to maintain the value and reputation of our brand.\nOur success depends on the value and reputation of our brand, including our primary trademarks \u201cGOPRO,\u201d \u201cHERO,\u201d and the GoPro logos. The GoPro brand is integral to the growth of our business and expansion into new markets. Maintaining, promoting and positioning our brand will largely depend on the success of our marketing and merchandising efforts, our ability to provide consistent, high quality products and services, and our consumers\u2019 satisfaction with the technical support and software updates we provide. Failure to grow and maintain our brand or negative publicity related to our products, our consumers\u2019 user-generated content, the athletes we sponsor, the celebrities we are associated with, or the labor policies of any of our suppliers or manufacturers could adversely affect our brand, business and operating results. Maintaining and enhancing our brand also requires substantial financial investments, although there is no guarantee that these investments will increase sales of our products or positively affect our operating results\nWe may be subject to warranty claims that could result in significant direct or indirect costs, or we could experience greater returns from retailers than expected, which could harm our business and operating results.\nWe generally provide a 12-month warranty on all of our cameras, except in the European Union, or EU, where we provide a two-year warranty on all of our cameras. For certain mounts and accessories, where permitted, we provide a lifetime warranty. The occurrence of any material defects in our products could make us liable for\ndamages and warranty claims in excess of our current reserves. In addition, we could incur significant costs to correct any defects, warranty claims or other problems, including costs related to product recalls. Any negative publicity related to the perceived quality and safety of our products could affect our brand image, decrease retailer, distributor and consumer confidence and demand, and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition. Also, while our warranty is limited to repairs and returns, warranty claims may result in litigation, the occurrence of which could adversely affect our business and operating results. Based on our historical experience with our camera products, we have an established methodology for estimating warranty liabilities with respect to cameras and accessories.\nWe offer the GoPro subscription, which has a camera replacement benefit as part of the monthly or yearly subscription, which is available in the United States and internationally. Accidental damage coverage, extended warranties and other camera replacement benefits are regulated in the United States on a state level and are treated differently by each state. Additionally, outside the United States, regulations for camera replacement benefits vary from country to country. Changes in interpretation of the insurance regulations or other laws and regulations concerning extended warranties, accidental damage coverage or camera replacement benefits on a federal, state, local or international level may cause us to incur costs or have additional regulatory requirements to meet in the future in order to continue to offer the GoPro subscription in compliance with any similar laws adopted in other jurisdictions. Our failure to comply with past, present and future similar laws could result in reduced sales of our products, reputational damage, penalties and other sanctions, which could harm our business and financial condition.\nConsumers may be injured while engaging in activities with our products, and we may be exposed to claims, or regulations could be imposed, which could adversely affect our brand, operating results and financial condition.\nConsumers use our cameras, drones and their associated mounts and accessories to self-capture their participation in a wide variety of physical activities, including extreme sports, which in many cases carry the risk of significant injury or death. Consumers may also use our drones for a wide range of flight activity, including aerial data collection, videography and photography. We may be subject to claims that users have been injured or harmed by or while using our products, including false claims or erroneous reports relating to safety, security or privacy issues, or that personal property has been damaged as a result of use of our drone. Although we maintain insurance to help protect us from the risk of such claims, such insurance may not be sufficient or may not apply to all situations. Similarly, proprietors of establishments at which consumers engage in challenging physical activities could seek to ban the use of our products in their facilities to limit their own liability. In addition, if lawmakers or governmental agencies were to determine that the use of our products increased the risk of injury or harm to all or a subset of our users or should otherwise be restricted to protect consumers, they may pass laws or adopt regulations that limit the use of our products or increase our liability associated with the use of our products. Any of these events could adversely affect our brand, operating results and financial condition.\nIf we encounter issues with our manufacturers or suppliers, our business, brand, and results of operations could be harmed and we could lose sales.\nWe do not have internal manufacturing capabilities and rely on several contract manufacturers, located primarily in China to manufacture our products. We cannot be certain that we will not experience operational difficulties with our manufacturers, including reductions in the availability of production capacity, errors in complying with product specifications, insufficient quality control, failures to meet production deadlines, increases in manufacturing costs and increased lead times. We also rely on a number of supply chain partners to whom we outsource activities related to inventory warehousing, order fulfillment, distribution and other direct sales logistics. Our supply chain partners are located in China, Czech Republic, Hong Kong, Mexico, Netherlands, Singapore and a number of other countries in Europe and the Asia Pacific region. Our manufacturers and supply chain partners may experience disruptions in their operations due to equipment breakdowns, adding lines in a different country, labor strikes or shortages, transportation security vulnerabilities, natural disasters, component or material shortages, cyber-attacks, cost increases or other similar problems. Further, in order to minimize their inventory risk, our manufacturers might not order components from third-party suppliers with adequate lead time, thereby affecting our ability to meet our demand forecast. Therefore, if we fail to manage our relationship with our manufacturers\nand supply chain partners effectively, or if they experience operational difficulties, our ability to ship products to our retailers and distributors could be impaired and our competitive position and reputation could be harmed.\nIn the event that we receive shipments of products that fail to comply with our technical specifications or that fail to conform to our quality control standards, and we are not able to obtain replacement products in a timely manner, we risk revenue losses from the inability to sell those products, increased administrative and shipping costs, and lower profitability. Additionally, if defects are not discovered until after consumers purchase our products, they could lose confidence in the technical attributes of our products and our business could be harmed.\nWe do not control our contract manufacturers or suppliers, including their labor, environmental or other practices. Environmental regulations or changes in the supply, demand or available sources of natural resources may affect the availability and cost of goods and services necessary to run our business. We require our contract manufacturers and suppliers to comply with our formal supplier code of conduct and relevant standards and have ongoing audit programs in place to assess our suppliers\u2019 compliance with our requirements. We periodically conduct audits of our contract manufacturers\u2019 and suppliers\u2019 compliance with our code of conduct, applicable laws and good industry practices. However, these audits may not be frequent or thorough enough to detect non-compliance. Deliberate violations of labor, environmental or other laws by our contract manufacturers or suppliers, or a failure of these parties to follow ethical business practices, could lead to negative publicity and harm our reputation or brand.\nWe may grow our business in part through acquisitions, joint ventures, investments and partnerships, which could require significant management attention, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value and adversely affect our operating results.\nWe have completed several acquisitions and may evaluate additional acquisitions of, or strategic investments in, other companies, products or technologies that we believe are complementary to our business. We also may enter into relationships with other businesses in order to expand the distribution of our product offerings, which could involve joint ventures, strategic alliances and partnerships. Negotiating these transactions can be time-consuming, difficult and expensive, and our ability to close these transactions may be subject to third-party or government approvals, which are beyond our control. Consequently, we can make no assurance that these transactions, once undertaken and announced, will close.\nIf we do complete acquisitions, we may not ultimately strengthen our competitive position or achieve our goals, and any acquisitions we complete could be viewed negatively by users or investors. In addition, if we encounter difficulties assimilating or integrating the businesses, technologies, products, personnel, or operations of acquired companies, particularly if the key personnel of the acquired business choose not to work for us, or we have difficulty retaining the customers of any acquired business, the revenue and operating results of the combined company could be adversely affected. Acquisitions may disrupt our ongoing operations, divert management from their primary responsibilities, subject us to additional liabilities, increase our expenses and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows. In addition, our original estimates and assumptions used in assessing any transaction may be inaccurate, including estimates of accounting charges. We have recorded significant goodwill and intangible assets in connection with our acquisitions, and in the future, if our acquisitions do not yield expected revenue, we may be required to take material impairment charges that could adversely affect our results of operations.\nWe may have to pay cash, incur debt or issue equity securities to enter into any such acquisition, joint venture, strategic alliances or partnership, which could affect our financial condition or the value of our capital stock. . Furthermore, acquisitions may require large one-time charges and can result in increased debt or contingent liabilities, adverse tax consequences, additional stock-based compensation expense and the recording and subsequent amortization or impairments of amounts related to certain purchased intangible assets, any of which could negatively affect our future results of operations. We cannot assure investors that the anticipated benefits of any acquisition or investment will be realized.\nFailure to obtain new, and maintain existing, high-quality event, venue, athlete and celebrity sponsorships could harm our business.\nEstablishing relationships with high profile sporting and entertainment events, venues, sports leagues and sports associations, athletes and celebrity personalities to evaluate, promote and establish product credibility with\nconsumers, including entering into sponsorship and licensing agreements, has and will continue to be a key element of our marketing strategy. However, as competition in our markets has increased, the costs of obtaining and retaining event, venue, athlete and celebrity sponsorships and licensing agreements have increased. Additionally, we may be forced to sign longer term sponsorships in order to retain relationships. If we are unable to maintain our current associations with our event, venue, athlete and celebrity partners, or to do so at a reasonable cost, we could lose the benefits of these relationships, and we may be required to modify and substantially increase our marketing investments. In addition, actions taken by endorsers of our products that harm their reputations could also harm our brand image with consumers. The failure to correctly identify high impact events and venues or build partnerships with those who develop and promote those events and venues, promising athletes or other appealing personalities to use and endorse our products, or poor performance by our endorsers, could adversely affect our brand and result in decreased sales of our products.\nCatastrophic events or political instability could disrupt and cause harm to our business.\nOur headquarters are located in the San Francisco Bay Area of California, an area susceptible to earthquakes. A major earthquake or other natural disaster, fire, threat of fire, act of terrorism, public health issues or other catastrophic event in California or elsewhere that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business operations or information technology systems could severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations and, as a result, our future operating results could be harmed. Our key manufacturing, supply and distribution partners have global operations including China, Hong Kong, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Singapore, Taiwan and the United States. Political instability, public health issues or other catastrophic events in any of those countries could adversely affect our business in the future, our financial condition and operating results.\nRisks related to our intellectual property and technology licenses\nOur intellectual property and proprietary rights may not adequately protect our products and services, and our business may suffer if it is alleged or determined that our technology, products, or another aspect of our business infringes third-party intellectual property or if third parties infringe our rights.\nWe own patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, and other intellectual property (collectively \u201cintellectual property\u201d) related to aspects of our products, software, services and designs. Our commercial success may depend in part on our ability to obtain, maintain and protect these rights in the United States and abroad.\nWe regularly file patent applications to protect innovations arising from our research, development and design as we deem appropriate. We may fail to apply for patents on important products, services, technologies or designs in a timely fashion, or at all. We may not have sufficient intellectual property rights in all countries where unauthorized third-party copying or use of our proprietary technology occurs and the scope of our intellectual property might be more limited in certain countries. Our existing and future patents may not be sufficient to protect our products, services, technologies or designs and/or may not prevent others from developing competing products, services, technologies or designs. We cannot predict the validity and enforceability of our patents and other intellectual property with certainty.\nWe have registered, and applied to register, certain of our trademarks in several jurisdictions worldwide. In some of those jurisdictions, third-party filings exist for the same, similar or otherwise related products or services, which could block the registration of our marks. Even if we are able to register our marks, competitors may adopt or file similar marks to ours, seek to cancel our trademark registrations, register domain names that mimic or incorporate our marks, or otherwise infringe upon or harm our trademark rights. Although we police our trademark rights carefully, there can be no assurance that we are aware of all third-party uses or that we will prevail in enforcing our rights in all such instances. Any of these negative outcomes could affect the strength, value and effectiveness of our brand, as well as our ability to market our products. We have also registered domain names for websites, or URLs, that we use in our business, such as GoPro.com, as well as social media handles. If we are unable to protect our domain names or social media handles, our brand, business, and operating results could be adversely affected. Domain names or social media handles similar to ours have already been registered in the United States and elsewhere, and we may not be able to prevent third parties from acquiring and using domain names or social media handles that infringe, are similar to, or otherwise decrease the value of, our trademarks. In addition, we\nmight not be able to, or may choose not to, acquire or maintain trademark registrations, domain names, social media handles or other related rights in certain jurisdictions.\nLitigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights. Initiating infringement proceedings against third parties can be expensive, take significant time, and divert management\u2019s attention from other business concerns. We may not prevail in litigation to enforce our intellectual property against unauthorized use.\nThird parties, including competitors and non-practicing entities, have brought intellectual property infringement claims against us, including the matter described in Note 9 Commitments, contingencies and guarantees to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. We expect to continue to receive such intellectual property claims in the future. While we will defend ourselves vigorously against any such existing and future legal proceedings, we may not prevail against all such allegations. We may seek licenses from third parties where appropriate, but they could refuse to grant us a license or demand commercially unreasonable terms. Further, an adverse ruling in an intellectual property infringement proceeding could force us to suspend or permanently cease the production or sale of products/services, face a temporary or permanent injunction, redesign our products/services, rebrand our products/services, pay significant settlement costs, pay third-party license fees or damage awards or give up some of our intellectual property. The occurrence of any of these events may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results or cash flows.\nIf we are unable to maintain or acquire rights to include intellectual property owned by others in the content distributed by us, our marketing, sales or future business strategy could be affected or we could be subject to lawsuits relating to our use of this content.\nThe distribution of GoPro content helps to market our brand and our products. If we cannot continue to acquire rights to distribute user-generated content or acquire rights to use and distribute music, athlete and celebrity names and likenesses or other content for our original productions or third-party entertainment distribution channels or for our software products, our marketing efforts could be diminished, our sales could be harmed and our future content strategy could be adversely affected. In addition, third-party content providers or owners may allege that we have violated their intellectual property rights. If we are unable to obtain sufficient rights, successfully defend our use of or otherwise alter our business practices on a timely basis in response to claims of infringement, misappropriation, misuse or other violation of third-party intellectual property rights, our business may be adversely affected. As a user and distributor of content, we face potential liability for rights of publicity and privacy, as well as copyright, or trademark infringement or other claims based on the nature and content of materials that we distribute. If we are found to violate such third-party rights, then our business may suffer.\nWe use open source software in our platform that may subject our technology to general release or require us to re-engineer our solutions, which may cause harm to our business.\nWe use open source software in connection with our services. From time to time, companies that incorporate open source software into their products have faced claims challenging the ownership of open source software and/or compliance with open source license terms. Therefore, we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software or noncompliance with open source licensing terms. Some open source software licenses require users who distribute or make available open source software as part of their software to publicly disclose all or part of the source code to such software or make available any derivative works of the open source code on unfavorable terms or at no cost. While we monitor our use of open source software and try to ensure that none is used in a manner that would require us to disclose the source code or that would otherwise breach the terms of an open source agreement, such use could nevertheless occur and we may be required to release our proprietary source code, pay damages for breach of contract, re-engineer our applications, discontinue sales in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis or take other remedial action that may divert resources away from our development efforts, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results.\nRisks related to regulatory compliance\nWe are subject to governmental regulation and other legal obligations, particularly related to privacy, data protection and information security, and our actual or perceived failure to comply with such obligations could adversely affect our business and operating results.\nPersonal privacy, data protection and information security are significant issues in the United States and the other jurisdictions where we offer our products and services. The regulatory framework for privacy and security issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future. Our handling of data is subject to a variety of laws and regulations, including regulation by various government agencies, including the United States Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and various state, local and foreign bodies and agencies.\nThe United States federal and various state and foreign governments have adopted or proposed limitations on the collection, distribution, use and storage of personal information of individuals, including end-customers and employees. In the United States, the FTC and many state attorneys general are applying federal and state consumer protection laws to the online collection, use, processing, storage, deletion and dissemination of data. Additionally, many foreign countries and governmental bodies, including in Australia, the European Union, India, Japan and numerous other jurisdictions in which we operate or conduct our business, have laws and regulations concerning the collection, use, processing, storage and deletion of personal information obtained from their residents or by businesses operating within their jurisdiction. These laws and regulations often are more restrictive than those in the United States. Such laws and regulations may require companies to implement new privacy and security policies, permit individuals to access, correct and delete personal information stored or maintained by such companies, inform individuals of security breaches that affect their personal information, and, in some cases, obtain individuals\u2019 consent to collect and/or use personal information for certain purposes.\nWe also expect that there will continue to be new proposed laws, regulations and industry standards concerning privacy, data protection and information security in the United States, the European Union and other jurisdictions, and we cannot yet determine the impact of such future laws, regulations and standards may have on our business. We expect that existing laws, regulations and standards may be interpreted differently in the future. For example, in November 2020, the California ballot initiative known as the Consumer Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) was passed. CPRA will come into effect in January 2023 (except for the CPRA\u2019s right of access which will come into effect in January 2022), and will supersede the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) which went into effect in January 2020. When it goes into effect, CPRA will provide for a new privacy enforcement authority, additional data privacy rights for consumers in California and new operational requirements for companies doing business in California. Compliance with the new obligations imposed by the CPRA depends in part on how particular regulators interpret and apply them. If we fail to comply with the CCPA or CPRA or if regulators assert that we have failed to comply with the CCPA or CPRA, we may be subject to certain fines or other penalties. Also, there remains significant uncertainty surrounding the regulatory framework for the future of personal data transfers from the European Union to the United States with regulations such as the recently adopted General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which imposes more stringent EU data protection requirements, provides an enforcement authority, and imposes large penalties for noncompliance. Compliance with the new obligations imposed by the GDPR depends in part on how particular regulators interpret and apply them. If we fail to comply with the GDPR or if regulators assert that we have failed to comply with the GDPR, we may be subject to fines of up to 4% of our worldwide annual revenue. Future laws, regulations, standards and other obligations, including the adoption of the GDPR, CCPA and CPRA, as well as changes in the interpretation of existing laws, regulations, standards and other obligations could impair our ability to collect, use or disclose information relating to individuals, which could decrease demand for our products, require us to restrict our business operations, increase our costs and impair our ability to maintain and grow our customer base and increase our revenue.\nAlthough we are working to comply with those federal, state and foreign laws and regulations, industry standards, contractual obligations and other legal obligations that apply to us, those laws, regulations, standards and obligations are evolving and may be modified, interpreted and applied in an inconsistent manner from one jurisdiction to another, and may conflict with one another, other requirements or legal obligations, our practices or the features of our products. As such, we cannot assure ongoing compliance with all such laws or regulations, industry standards, contractual obligations and other legal obligations. Any failure or perceived failure by us to\ncomply with federal, state or foreign laws or regulations, industry standards, contractual obligations or other legal obligations, or any actual or suspected security incident, whether or not resulting in unauthorized access to, or acquisition, release or transfer of personal information or other data, may result in governmental enforcement actions and prosecutions, private litigation, fines and penalties or adverse publicity and could cause our customers to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business. Any inability to adequately address privacy and security concerns, even if unfounded, or comply with applicable laws, regulations, policies, industry standards, contractual obligations or other legal obligations could result in additional cost and liability to us, damage our reputation, inhibit sales, and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe could be adversely affected by violations of the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the United Kingdom Bribery Act or similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions in which we operate.\nThe global nature of our business and the significance of our international revenue create various domestic and local regulatory challenges and subject us to risks associated with our international operations. The United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, the United Kingdom Bribery Act 2010, or the U.K. Bribery Act, and similar anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit United States based companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to non-United States officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business, directing business to another, or securing an advantage. In addition, United States public companies are required to maintain records that accurately and fairly represent their transactions and have an adequate system of internal accounting controls. Under the FCPA, United States companies may be held liable for the corrupt actions taken by directors, officers, employees, agents, or other strategic or local partners or representatives. As such, if we or our intermediaries fail to comply with the requirements of the FCPA or similar legislation, governmental authorities in the United States and elsewhere could seek to impose substantial civil and/or criminal fines and penalties which could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, operating results and financial condition.\nWe operate in areas of the world that experience corruption by government officials to some degree and, in certain circumstances, compliance with anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws may conflict with local customs and practices. Our global operations require us to import and export to and from several countries, which geographically expands our compliance obligations. In addition, changes in such laws could result in increased regulatory requirements and compliance costs which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We cannot be assured that our employees or other agents will not engage in prohibited conduct and render us responsible under the FCPA or the U.K. Bribery Act. While we have compliance programs, they may not be effective to prevent violations from occurring and employees may engage in prohibited conduct nonetheless. If we are found to be in violation of the FCPA, the U.K. Bribery Act or other anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws (either due to acts or inadvertence of our employees, or due to the acts or inadvertence of others), we could suffer criminal or civil penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIf we fail to comply with environmental regulations and conflict minerals disclosures, our business, financial condition, operating results and reputation could be adversely affected.\nWe are subject to various federal, state, local and international environmental laws and regulations including laws regulating the manufacture, import, use, discharge and disposal of hazardous materials, labeling and notice requirements relating to potential consumer exposure to certain chemicals, and laws relating to the collection of and recycling of electrical and electronic equipment and their packaging.\nWe are also subject to the SEC\u2019s conflict minerals rule which requires disclosure by public companies of the origin, source and chain of custody of specified minerals, known as conflict minerals, that are necessary to the functionality or production of products manufactured or contracted to be manufactured. We have and will continue to incur costs associated with complying with the rule, such as costs related to sourcing of certain minerals (or derivatives thereof), the determination of the origin, source and chain of custody of the minerals used in our products, the adoption of conflict minerals-related governance policies, processes and controls, and possible changes to products or sources of supply as a result of such activities. Within our supply chain, we may not be able to sufficiently verify the origins of the relevant minerals used in our products through the data collection and due diligence procedures that we implement, which may harm our reputation.\nAlthough we have policies and procedures in place requiring our contract manufacturers and major component suppliers to comply with applicable federal, state, local and international requirements, we cannot confirm that our manufacturers and suppliers consistently comply with these requirements. In addition, if there are changes to these or other laws (or their interpretation) or if new similar laws are passed in other jurisdictions, we may be required to re-engineer our products to use components compatible with these regulations. This re-engineering and component substitution could result in additional costs to us or disrupt our operations or logistics.\nChanges in interpretation of any federal, state, local or international regulation may cause us to incur costs or have additional regulatory requirements to meet in the future in order to comply, or with any similar laws adopted in other jurisdictions. Our failure to comply with past, present and future similar laws could result in reduced sales of our products, substantial product inventory write-offs, reputational damage, penalties and other sanctions, which could harm our business and financial condition. We also expect that our products will be affected by new environmental laws and regulations on an ongoing basis. To date, our expenditures for environmental compliance have not had a material effect on our results of operations or cash flows and, although we cannot predict the future effect of such laws or regulations, they will likely result in additional costs and may increase penalties associated with violations or require us to change the content of our products or how they are manufactured, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nWe are subject to governmental export and import controls and economic sanctions laws that could subject us to liability and impair our ability to compete in international markets.\nThe United States and various foreign governments have imposed controls, export license requirements and restrictions on the import or export of some technologies. Our products are subject to United States export controls, and exports of our products must be made in compliance with various economic and trade sanctions laws. Furthermore, United States export control laws and economic sanctions prohibit the provision of products and services to countries, governments and persons targeted by United States sanctions. Even though we take precautions to prevent our products from being provided to targets of United States sanctions, our products, including our firmware updates, could be provided to those targets or provided by our customers. Any such provision could have negative consequences, including government investigations, penalties and reputational harm. Our failure to obtain required import or export approval for our products could harm our international and domestic sales and adversely affect our revenue.\nWe could be subject to future enforcement action with respect to compliance with governmental export and import controls and economic sanctions laws that result in penalties, costs, and restrictions on export privileges that could have a material effect on our business and operating results.\nRisks related to our need for additional capital\nWe may not be able to secure additional financing on favorable terms, or at all, to meet our future capital needs.\nIn the future, we may require additional capital to respond to business opportunities, challenges, acquisitions or unforeseen circumstances and may determine to engage in equity or debt financings or enter into credit facilities for other reasons. We may not be able to timely secure additional financing on favorable terms, or at all. For example, our current credit facility contains restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, and any debt financing obtained by us in the future could involve further restrictive covenants, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. Further, even if we are able to obtain additional financing, we may be required to use such proceeds to repay a portion of our debt. If we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt or other equity-linked securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing under our credit facility, or alternative sources, when we require it, our ability to grow or support our business and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited. In the event additional financing is required from outside sources, we may not be able to raise it on terms acceptable to us or at all.\nRisks related to ownership of our Class A common stock\nOur stock price has been and will likely continue to be volatile.\nSince shares of our Class A common stock were sold in our IPO in July 2014 at a price of $24.00 per share, our closing stock price has ranged from $2.01 to $93.85 per share through December 31, 2020. Our stock price may fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors, such as quarterly operating results; changes in our financial projections provided to the public or our failure to meet those projections; the public\u2019s reaction to our press releases, other public announcements and filings with the SEC; significant transactions, or new features, products or services offered by us or our competitors; changes in our business lines and product lineup; changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts; media coverage of our business and financial performance; the operating and stock price performance of, or other developments involving, other companies that investors may deem comparable to us; trends in our industry; any significant change in our management; sales and purchases of any Class A common stock issued upon conversion of our convertible senior notes or in connection with the prepaid forward contract entered into in connection with our 2022 convertible senior notes, and general economic conditions. These factors, as well as the volatility of our Class A common stock, could also affect the price of our convertible senior notes.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and the market prices for companies in our industry, have experienced volatility that often has been unrelated to operating performance. These broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our stock, regardless of our operating performance. Price volatility over a given period may cause the average price at which we repurchase our own stock to exceed the stock\u2019s price at a given point in time. Volatility in our stock price also affects the value of our equity compensation, which affects our ability to recruit and retain employees. In addition, some companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation. We have been subject to past shareholder class action lawsuits as well as derivative lawsuits and may continue to be a target for such litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and liability and divert our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could harm our business. See Note 9 Commitments, contingencies and guarantees, to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for a discussion on legal proceedings.\nIf we fail to meet expectations related to future growth, profitability, or other market expectations, our stock price may decline significantly, which could have a material adverse effect on investor confidence and employee retention. A sustained decline in our stock price and market capitalization could lead to impairment charges.\nThe dual class structure of our common stock has the effect of concentrating voting control with our CEO and we cannot predict the effect our dual class structure may have on our stock price or our business.\nOur Class B common stock has 10 votes per share, and our Class A common stock has one vote per share. Stockholders who hold shares of Class B common stock hold approximately 70.2% of the voting power of our outstanding capital stock as of December 31, 2020 with Mr. Woodman, our Chairman and CEO, holding approximately 70.1% of the outstanding voting power. Mr. Woodman is able to control all matters submitted to our stockholders, including the election of directors, amendments of our organizational documents and any merger, consolidation, sale of all or substantially all of our assets or other major corporate transaction. This concentrated control could delay, defer, or prevent a change of control, merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets that our other stockholders support, or conversely this concentrated control could result in the consummation of such a transaction that our other stockholders do not support. This concentrated control could also discourage a potential investor from acquiring our Class A common stock due to the limited voting power of such stock relative to the Class B common stock and might harm the trading price of our Class A common stock.\nIn addition, we cannot predict whether our dual class structure, combined with the concentrated control by Mr. Woodman, will result in a lower or more volatile market price of our Class A common stock or in adverse publicity or other adverse consequences. For example, certain index providers have announced restrictions on including companies with multiple-class share structures in certain of their indexes. In July 2017, FTSE Russell announced that it plans to require new constituents of its indexes to have greater than 5% of the company\u2019s voting rights in the hands of public stockholders, and S&P Dow Jones announced that it will no longer admit companies with multiple-class share structures to certain of its indexes. Because of our dual class structure, we may be excluded\nfrom these indexes and we cannot assure you that other stock indexes will not take similar actions. Given the sustained flow of investment funds into passive strategies that seek to track certain indexes, exclusion from stock indexes would likely preclude investment by many of these funds and could make our Class A common stock less attractive to other investors. As a result, the market price of our Class A common stock could be adversely affected.\nIf securities analysts do not publish research or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our Class A common stock depends in part on the research and reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade our stock or publish inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business, our stock price would likely decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our stock could decrease, which might cause our stock price and trading volume to decline.\nDelaware law and provisions in our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could make a merger, tender offer or proxy contest difficult, thereby depressing the trading price of our Class A common stock.\nOur status as a Delaware corporation and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder, even if a change in control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that may make the acquisition of our company more difficult without the approval of our board of directors, or otherwise adversely affect the rights of the holders of our Class A and Class B common stock, including the following:\n\u2022our board of directors is not currently classified, but at such time as all shares of our Class B common stock have been converted into shares of our Class A common stock, our board of directors will be classified into three classes of directors with staggered three-year terms;\n\u2022so long as any shares of our Class B common stock are outstanding, special meetings of our stockholders may be called by the holders of 10% of the outstanding voting power of all then outstanding shares of stock, a majority of our board of directors, the chairman of our board of directors or our chief executive officer;\n\u2022when no shares of our Class B common stock are outstanding, only the chairman of our board of directors, our chief executive officer or a majority of our board of directors will be authorized to call a special meeting of stockholders;\n\u2022our stockholders may only take action at a meeting of stockholders and not by written consent;\n\u2022vacancies on our board of directors may be filled only by our board of directors and not by stockholders;\n\u2022directors may be removed from office with or without cause so long as our board of directors is not classified, and thereafter directors may be removed from office only for cause;\n\u2022our restated certificate of incorporation provides for a dual class common stock structure in which holders of our Class B common stock have the ability to control the outcome of matters requiring stockholder approval, even if they own significantly less than a majority of the outstanding shares of our Class A and Class B common stock, including the election of directors and significant corporate transactions, such as a merger or other sale of our company or its assets;\n\u2022our restated certificate of incorporation authorizes undesignated preferred stock, the terms of which may be established, and shares of which may be issued, by our board of directors without stockholder approval and which may contain voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to those of our Class A and Class B common stock; and\n\u2022advance notice procedures apply for stockholders to nominate candidates for election as directors or to bring matters before an annual meeting of stockholders.\nRisks related to our convertible senior notes\nWe have indebtedness in the form of convertible senior notes.\nIn November 2020, we completed an offering of $143.8 million aggregate principal amount of 1.25% convertible senior notes due 2025 (2025 Notes). As a result of the 2025 Notes, we incurred an additional $143.8 million principal amount of indebtedness, the principal amount of which we may be required to pay at maturity in 2025.\nIn April 2017, we completed an offering of $175.0 million aggregate principal amount of 3.50% convertible senior notes due 2022 (2022 Notes, together with the 2025 Notes, the Notes). As a result of this 2022 Notes offering, we incurred $175.0 million principal amount of indebtedness. We repurchased $50.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2022 Notes in November 2020, and may be required to repay the remaining principal amount of $125.0 million at maturity in 2022.\nHolders of the Notes will have the right to require us to repurchase their Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change at a purchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes to be purchased, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In addition, the indentures for the Notes provides that we are required to repay amounts due under such indenture in the event that there is an event of default for the Notes that results in the principal, premium, if any, and interest, if any, becoming due prior to Maturity Date for the Notes. There can be no assurance that we will be able to repay our indebtedness when due, or that we will be able to refinance our indebtedness, all or in part, on acceptable terms. In addition, our indebtedness could, among other things:\n\u2022heighten our vulnerability to adverse general economic conditions and heightened competitive pressures;\n\u2022require us to dedicate a larger portion of our cash flow from operations to interest payments, limiting the availability of cash for other purposes;\n\u2022limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and industry; and\n\u2022impair our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, general corporate purposes or other purposes.\nIn addition, our ability to purchase the Notes or repay prior to maturity any accelerated amounts under the Notes upon an event of default or pay cash upon conversions of the Notes may be limited by law, by regulatory authority or by agreements governing our indebtedness outstanding at the time, including our credit facility. Our credit facility restricts our ability to repurchase the Notes for cash or repay prior to maturity any accelerated amounts under the Notes upon an event of default or pay cash upon conversion of the Notes to the extent that on the date of such repurchase, repayment or conversion, as the case may be, after giving pro forma effect to such payment, our remaining borrowing capacity pursuant to such credit facility falls below (i) to the extent that our fixed charge coverage ratio is at least to 1.0, the greater of (A) $37.5 million and (B) 15% of the lesser of the aggregate commitments under such credit facility and the aggregate borrowing base then in effect or (ii) to the extent that our fixed charge coverage ratio is less than 1.0 to 1.0, the greater of (A) $50.0 million and (B) 20% of the lesser of the aggregate commitments under such credit facility and the aggregate borrowing base then in effect.\nAny of our future indebtedness may contain similar restrictions. Our failure to repurchase the Notes at a time when the repurchase is required by the indentures (whether upon a fundamental change or otherwise under the indentures) or pay cash payable on future conversions of the Notes as required by the indentures would constitute a default under the indentures. A default under the indentures or the fundamental change itself could also lead to a default under agreements governing our existing or future indebtedness, including our credit facility. If the repayment of the related indebtedness were to be accelerated after any applicable notice or grace periods, we may not have sufficient funds to repay the indebtedness, repurchase the Notes or make cash payments upon conversions thereof.\nOur credit facility imposes restrictions on us that may adversely affect our ability to operate our business.\nOur credit facility contains restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. In addition, our credit facility contains, and the agreements governing the Notes will contain, a cross-default provision whereby a default under one agreement would likely result in cross defaults under agreements covering other borrowings. For example, the occurrence of a default\nwith respect to any indebtedness or any failure to repay debt when due in an amount in excess of $25 million would cause a cross default under the indenture governing the 2022 Notes, as well as under our credit facility. The occurrence of a default under any of these borrowing arrangements would permit the holders of the Notes or the lenders under our credit facility to declare all amounts outstanding under those borrowing arrangements to be immediately due and payable. If the Note holders or the trustee under the indentures governing the Notes or the lenders under our credit facility accelerate the repayment of borrowings, we cannot assure you that we will have sufficient assets to repay those borrowings.\nConversion of the Notes will, to the extent we deliver shares upon conversion of such Notes, dilute the ownership interest of existing stockholders, including holders who had previously converted their Notes, or may otherwise depress our stock price.\nThe conversion of some or all of the Notes will dilute the ownership interests of existing stockholders to the extent we deliver shares upon conversion of any of the Notes. Any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock. In addition, the existence of the Notes may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the Notes could be used to satisfy short positions, or anticipated conversion of the Notes into shares of our common stock could depress our stock price.\nThe conditional conversion feature of the Notes, if triggered, may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nIn the event the conditional conversion feature of the Notes is triggered, holders of the Notes will be entitled to convert the Notes at any time during specified periods at their option. If one or more holders elect to convert their Notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligation by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than cash in lieu of any fractional share), we would be required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligation through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders of the Notes do not elect to convert their Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nThe accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as the Notes, may have a material effect on our reported financial results.\nUnder GAAP, an entity must separately account for the debt component and the embedded conversion option of convertible debt instruments that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion, such as the Notes we are offering, in a manner that reflects the issuer\u2019s economic interest cost. The effect of the accounting treatment for such instruments is that the value of such embedded conversion option would be treated as original issue discount for purposes of accounting for the debt component of the Notes, and that original issue discount is amortized into interest expense over the term of the Notes using an effective yield method. As a result, we will be required to record a greater amount of non-cash interest expense because of the amortization of the original issue discount to the Notes\u2019 face amount over the term of the Notes and because of the amortization of the debt issuance costs.\nAccordingly, we will report lower net income (or greater net loss) in our financial results because of the recognition of both the current period\u2019s amortization of the debt discount and the Notes\u2019 coupon interest, which could adversely affect our reported or future financial results, the trading price of our common stock and the trading price of the Notes.\nIn addition, convertible debt instruments (such as the Notes) that may be settled entirely or partly in cash are currently accounted for utilizing the if-converted method, the effect of which is that conversion will not be assumed for purposes of computing diluted income (loss) per share if the effect would be antidilutive. Under the if-converted method, for diluted income (loss) per share purposes, convertible debt is antidilutive whenever its interest, net of tax and nondiscretionary adjustments, per common share obtainable on conversion exceeds basic income (loss) per share. Dilutive securities that are issued during a period and dilutive convertible securities for which conversion options lapse, or for which related debt is extinguished during a period, will be included in the denominator of diluted income (loss) per share for the period that they were outstanding. Likewise, dilutive convertible securities converted during a period will be included in the denominator for the period prior to actual\nconversion. Moreover, interest charges applicable to the convertible debt will be added back to the numerator. We cannot be sure that the accounting standards in the future will continue to permit the use of the if-converted method. If we are unable to use the if-converted method in accounting for the shares issuable upon conversion of the Notes, then our diluted income (loss) per share would be adversely affected.\nIn addition, if the conditional conversion feature of the Notes is triggered, even if holders do not elect to convert their Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principal of the Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nThe prepaid forward may affect the value of the 2022 Notes and our common stock and may result in unexpected market activity in the 2022 Notes and/or our common stock.\nIn connection with the issuance of the 2022 Notes, we entered into a prepaid forward with a forward counterparty. The prepaid forward is intended to facilitate privately negotiated derivative transactions by which investors in the 2022 Notes will be able to hedge their investment. In connection with establishing its initial hedge of the prepaid forward, the forward counterparty (or its affiliate) entered into or expects to enter into one or more derivative transactions with respect to our Class A common stock with purchasers of the 2022 Notes concurrently with or after the offering of the 2022 Notes. The prepaid forward is intended to reduce the dilution to our stockholders from the issuance of our Class A common stock (if any) upon conversion of the 2022 Notes and to allow certain investors to establish short positions that generally correspond to commercially reasonable initial hedges of their investment in the 2022 Notes. In addition, the forward counterparty (or its affiliate) may modify its hedge position by entering into or unwinding one or more derivative transactions with respect to our Class A common stock and/or purchasing or selling our Class A common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions at any time, including following the offering of the 2022 Notes and immediately prior to or shortly after April 15, 2022, the Maturity Date of the 2022 Notes (and are likely to unwind their derivative transactions and/or purchase or sell our Class A common stock in connection with any conversion or repurchase of the 2022 Notes, in connection with the purchase or sale of Notes by certain investors and/or in the event that sufficient borrow of our Class A common stock becomes available). These activities could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our Class A common stock or the Notes.\nThe prepaid forward initially facilitated privately negotiated derivative transactions relating to our Class A common stock, including derivative transactions by which investors in the 2022 Notes established short positions relating to our Class A common stock to hedge their investments in the 2022 Notes concurrently with, or shortly after, the placement of the 2022 Notes. Neither we nor the forward counterparty control how such investors may use such derivative transactions. In addition, such investors may enter into other transactions in connection with such derivative transactions, including the purchase or sale of our Class A common stock, at any time. As a result, the existence of the prepaid forward, such derivative transactions, and any related market activity could cause more sales of our Class A common stock over the term of the prepaid forward than there would have otherwise been had we not entered into the prepaid forward. Such sales could potentially affect the market price of our Class A common stock and/or the 2022 Notes.\nThe Capped Call transactions may affect the value of the 2025 Notes and our Class A Common Stock.\nIn connection with the pricing of the 2025 Notes, we entered into privately negotiated capped call transactions, or Capped Calls, with one or more financial institutions. The Capped Calls are expected generally to reduce the potential economic dilution to holders of our Class A common stock upon any conversion of the 2025 Notes, with such reduction and/or offset subject to a cap.\nIn connection with establishing their initial hedge of the Capped Call, the capped call counterparties have advised the Company that they and/or their respective affiliates expect to purchase shares of Class A common stock and/or enter into various derivative transactions with respect to the Class A common stock concurrently with, or shortly after, the pricing of the 2025 Notes.\nIn addition, the capped call counterparties and/or their respective affiliates may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our Class A common stock and/or purchasing or selling our Class A common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the 2025 Notes (and are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of the 2025 Notes\nor following an repurchase of the 2025 Notes by the Company on any fundamental change repurchase date or otherwise). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our Class A common stock or the 2025 Notes.\nThe potential effect, if any, of these transactions and activities on the trading price of our Class A common stock or the 2025 Notes will depend in part on market conditions. Any of these activities could adversely affect the trading price of our Class A common stock or the 2025 Notes.\nThe fundamental change repurchase feature of the Notes may delay or prevent an otherwise beneficial attempt to take over our company.\nThe terms of the Notes require us to repurchase the Notes in the event of a fundamental change. A takeover of our company would trigger an option of the holders of the Notes to require us to repurchase the Notes. In addition, if a make-whole fundamental change occurs prior to the Maturity Date of the Notes, we will in some cases be required to increase the conversion rate for a holder that elects to convert its Notes in connection with such make-whole fundamental change. Furthermore, the indentures for the Notes prohibits us from engaging in certain mergers or acquisitions unless, among other things, the surviving entity assumes our obligations under the Notes. These and other provisions of the indentures may have the effect of delaying or preventing a takeover of our company.\nWe are subject to counterparty risk with respect to the prepaid forward and Capped Calls.\nWe will be subject to the risk that the forward counterparty and capped call counterparties might default under the prepaid forward and Capped Calls, respectively. Our exposure to the credit risk of the forward counterparty and capped call counterparties will not be secured by any collateral. Global economic conditions have in the recent past resulted in, and may again result in, the actual or perceived failure or financial difficulties of many financial institutions. If the forward counterparty or capped call counterparties becomes subject to insolvency proceedings, we will become an unsecured creditor in those proceedings, with a claim equal to our exposure at that time under our transactions with the forward counterparty and/or capped call counterparties. Our exposure will depend on many factors, but, generally, an increase in our exposure will be correlated to an increase in the market price of our Class A common stock. In addition, upon a default by the forward counterparty and/or capped call counterparties, we may suffer more dilution than we currently anticipate with respect to our Class A common stock. We can provide no assurances as to the financial stability or viability of the forward counterparty to the prepaid forward or the capped call counterparties to the Capped Calls.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nAn economic downturn or economic uncertainty in our key United States and international markets, as well as fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect consumer discretionary spending and demand for our products.\nFactors affecting the level of consumer spending include general market conditions, macroeconomic conditions, tax rates, fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and interest rates, and other factors such as consumer confidence, the availability and cost of consumer credit, levels of unemployment and a reduction in consumer spending or disposable income resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of whether the United States government provides economic stimulus that may affect us more significantly than companies in other industries and companies with more diversified products. Additionally, the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Brexit) has created economic and political uncertainty, including volatility in global financial markets and the value of foreign currencies. The impact of Brexit depends on the terms of the United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union and such impact may not be fully realized for several years. The majority of our sales occur in U.S. dollars and an increase in the value of the dollar against the Euro and other currencies could increase the real cost to consumers of our products in those markets outside the United States. For example, in countries where we sell in local currency, we are subject to exchange rate fluctuations that create inherent risks for us and may cause us to adjust pricing which may make our products more or less favorable to the consumer. If global economic conditions are volatile or if economic conditions deteriorate, consumers may delay or reduce purchases of our products resulting in consumer demand for our products that may not reach our sales targets. Strengthening of the U.S. dollar and/or weakness in the economies of Euro zone countries could adversely impact sales of our products in the European region, which would have a material negative impact on\nour future operating results. Our sensitivity to economic cycles and any related fluctuation in consumer demand could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur effective tax rate and the intended tax benefits of our corporate structure and intercompany arrangements depend on the application of the tax laws of various jurisdictions and on how we operate our business.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and various jurisdictions outside the United States. Our effective tax rate could fluctuate due to changes in the mix of earnings and losses in countries with differing statutory tax rates. For example, our effective tax rates could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in countries where we have lower statutory rates and higher than anticipated in countries where we have higher statutory rates. Our tax expense could also be affected by changes in non-deductible expenses, changes in excess tax benefits related to exercises and vesting of stock-based expense, and the applicability of withholding taxes.\nDue to economic and political conditions, tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change. Our future effective tax rate could be unfavorably affected by changes in the tax rates in jurisdictions where our income is earned, by changes in, or our interpretation, of tax rules and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we do business, by unanticipated decreases in the amounts of jurisdictional earnings, or by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities. The United States, the European Commission, countries in the European Union, Australia, and other countries where we do business have been considering changes in relevant tax, accounting and other laws, regulations and interpretations, including changes to tax laws applicable to corporate multinationals. These potential changes could adversely affect our effective tax rates or result in additional tax expense and other costs to us.\nIn addition, we are subject to the examination of our income tax returns by the United States Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other domestic and foreign tax authorities. These tax examinations are expected to focus on our intercompany transfer pricing practices as well as other matters. We regularly assess the likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and other taxes and have reserved for adjustments that may result from the current examinations. We cannot provide assurance that the final determination of any of these examinations will not have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial position.\nIf we are unable to maintain effective internal control in the future, we may not be able to produce timely and accurate financial statements, which could adversely affect our investors\u2019 confidence and our stock price.\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to evaluate and determine the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, and to include a management report assessing the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We expect that the requirements of these rules and regulations will continue to place significant demands on our financial and operational resources, as well as IT systems.\nWhile we have determined that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2020, we must continue to monitor and assess our internal control over financial reporting. Our control environment may not be sufficient to remediate or prevent future material weaknesses or significant deficiencies from occurring. A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance that the control system\u2019s objectives will be met. Due to the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to error or fraud will not occur or that all control issues and all instances of fraud will be detected.\nIf we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, investors may lose confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports and the market price of our Class A common stock could be negatively affected, and we could become subject to investigations by the stock exchange on which our securities are listed, the SEC or other regulatory authorities.\nOur reported financial results may be negatively impacted by the changes in the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States.\nGenerally accepted accounting principles in the United States are subject to interpretation by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), the SEC and various bodies formed to promulgate and interpret appropriate accounting principles. A change in these principles or interpretations could have a significant effect on our reported financial results, and may even affect the reporting of transactions completed before the announcement or effectiveness of a change. Other companies in our industry may apply these accounting principles differently than we do, which may affect the comparability of our consolidated financial statements.\nIf our estimates or judgments relating to our critical accounting policies and estimates prove to be incorrect, our operating results could be adversely affected.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, as provided in this 2020 Annual Report in the section titled Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets, liabilities and equity, and the amount of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Our operating results may be adversely affected if our assumptions change or if actual circumstances differ from those in our assumptions, which could cause our operating results to fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors, resulting in a decline in our stock price. Significant estimates and assumptions made by management include those related to revenue recognition (including sales incentives, sales returns and implied post contract support), inventory valuation, product warranty liabilities, the valuation, impairment and useful lives of long-lived assets (property and equipment, operating lease right-of-use assets, intangible assets and goodwill), the fair value of our convertible senior notes, and income taxes.", "PERMNO": 14694, "SIC": 3861, "TIC": "GPRO"}
