{"cik": "1348324", "company": "LDR HOLDING CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-02-20", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have incurred losses in the past and may not be able to achieve or sustain profitability in the future.\nWe have incurred significant losses in most fiscal years since inception. We incurred net losses of $11.0 million, $27.9 million and $9.7 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. As a result of ongoing losses, we had an accumulated deficit of $94.7 million at December 31, 2014. We expect to continue to incur significant product development, clinical and regulatory, sales and marketing and other expenses. Additionally, we expect that our general and administrative expense will increase due to the additional operational and reporting costs associated with being a public company. We will need to generate significant additional revenue to achieve and maintain profitability, and even if we achieve profitability, we cannot be sure that we will remain profitable for any substantial period of time. Our failure to achieve or maintain profitability could negatively impact the value of our common stock.\nOur VerteBRIDGE and Mobi platform products represent highly concentrated product offerings that may limit our ability to grow our revenue and compete effectively against other companies, and our business would be adversely affected in the event we are unable to sell one or more of our products.\nWe offer novel and proprietary surgical technologies for use in both the fusion and non-fusion spine implant markets. Our VerteBRIDGE fusion platform and Mobi non-fusion platform products are designed for both cervical and lumbar applications. Our VerteBRIDGE and Mobi platform products address only a portion of the types of products used in spine implant surgeries. We do not offer surgeons a full range of products to meet all of their needs in spine implant surgeries and the requirement to obtain clearances, CE mark and register products vary by country. For example, our product offering does not include a portfolio of osteobiologic solutions, minimally invasive posterior instrumentation or posterior cervical instrumentation. Our competitors\u2019 products are often used in the same surgery as our products, and this may limit our ability to compete effectively against our competitors, limiting our revenue growth.\nIn addition, a substantial amount of our revenue is generated by just a few products. For example, in 2014, 89% of our revenue came from our VerteBRIDGE and Mobi platform products, most of which came from products incorporating our VerteBRIDGE plating technology. These categories of products are dominated by ROI-A and Avenue L, in the lumbar product portfolio, and ROI-C and Mobi-C, in the cervical product portfolio. In the event we are unable to market and sell these devices or any future device that represents a substantial amount of our revenue, our results of operations and financial condition will be materially adversely affected.\nTo be commercially successful, we must convince spine surgeons that our VerteBRIDGE and Mobi platform products are attractive alternatives to our competitors\u2019 products.\nSpine surgeons play a significant role in determining the course of treatment and, ultimately, the type of product that will be used to treat a patient, so we rely on effectively marketing to them. Acceptance of our products depends on educating spine surgeons as to the distinctive characteristics, perceived clinical benefits, safety and cost-effectiveness of our products as compared to our competitors\u2019 products and on training spine surgeons in the proper application of our products. If we are not successful in convincing spine surgeons of the merits of our products or educating them on the use of our products, they may not use our products and we will be unable to increase our sales and sustain growth or reach profitability. Our exclusive technology products represented approximately 89%, 83% and 80% of our sales for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. As a result, continued market acceptance of those products is critical to our continued success. If the volume of sales of these products declines, our business, financial position and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\nFurthermore, we believe spine surgeons will not widely adopt our products unless they determine, based on experience, clinical data and published peer-reviewed journal articles, that our products and the techniques to implant them provide benefits or are attractive alternatives to our competitors\u2019 products. Surgeons may be hesitant to change their medical treatment practices for the following reasons, among others:\n\u2022\nlack of experience with our products;\n\u2022\nexisting relationships with competitors and distributors that sell their products;\n\u2022\nlack or perceived lack of evidence supporting additional patient benefits;\n\u2022\nperceived liability risks generally associated with the use of new products and procedures;\n\u2022\nless favorable coverage and reimbursement amount compared to other products and techniques; and\n\u2022\nthe time commitment that may be required for training.\nIn addition, we believe recommendations and support of our products by influential spine surgeons are essential for market acceptance and adoption. If we do not receive support from such surgeons or long-term data does not show the benefits of using our products, surgeons may not use our products. In such circumstances, we may not achieve expected sales and may be unable to achieve profitability.\nWe received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for our Mobi-C device in August 2013 and have limited experience selling it in the United States.\nOur future growth is significantly dependent on the success of Mobi-C, our cervical disc replacement device, in the U.S. market. While we have been selling Mobi-C internationally since 2004, we did not obtain approval for Mobi-C from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, until August 2013. As a result, we have limited history selling Mobi-C in the United States upon which you can evaluate its prospects. We cannot assure you that Mobi-C in the U.S. market will be successful, and our future growth may be limited.\nEven if we are successful with Mobi-C in the U.S. market, its commercial success depends on surgeon acceptance and third-party payor coverage and reimbursement.\nThe current standard of care for the treatment of cervical disc disease is anterior cervical discectomy and fusion, or ACDF. The market for cervical disc replacements in the United States is still developing. While we believe that this market will grow in the near future as a result of the introduction of a new generation of advanced cervical disc replacements and broader coverage by commercial payors, there can be no assurance that surgeons will widely adopt cervical disc replacement as an alternative to ACDF, and even if they do, that they will elect to use Mobi-C and not a product, or combination of products, offered by one of our competitors.\nThe success of Mobi-C depends significantly on the availability and level of government and third-party payor reimbursement for procedures using our Mobi-C device. Many payors, including Medicare contractors, state Medicaid programs and private insurers may not reimburse for use of cervical disc replacement devices, including our Mobi-C device. While we believe there is a trend for broader coverage of cervical disc replacement devices in the United States, we cannot assure you that this coverage will continue to improve or that payors will not cease reimbursing for cervical disc replacement devices altogether. Additionally, even where reimbursement for cervical disc replacement devices exists, it is typically limited to treatment of cervical disc disease in one vertebral level, or one-level disease. Furthermore, surgeons may be reimbursed at a lower amount for performing a procedure using a cervical disc replacement device than traditional ACDF. In addition to its approval for treatment of one-level disease, Mobi-C is the first cervical disc replacement device approved to treat cervical disc disease in two adjacent vertebral levels, or two-level disease. As a result, we will need to work with payors to obtain coverage for the use of Mobi-C to treat two-level cervical disc disease. Payors may, however, conclude that Mobi-C for the treatment of two-level disease should still be considered investigational, may defer coverage pending additional long-term data or may deny coverage based on a combination of these or other factors. Furthermore, even if government and third-party payors elect to reimburse for Mobi-C for the treatment of two-level cervical disc disease, it is possible that these payors may also elect to reimburse for our competitors\u2019 cervical disc replacement devices when used to treat two-level cervical disc disease, even without our competitors\u2019 products having FDA approval for such treatment. If the trend towards reimbursement of procedures involving cervical disc replacement devices does not continue, slows or stops altogether, our ability to market and sell Mobi-C would be significantly limited and our business and operations would suffer. Additionally, if we establish reimbursement for Mobi-C for treatment of two-level cervical disc disease, and our competitors\u2019 products receive the same treatment without FDA approval for such treatment, our competitive advantage in the United States would be limited and that would significantly limit our ability to grow our business.\nIf coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors for our products significantly declines, surgeons, hospitals and other healthcare providers may be reluctant to use our products and our sales may decline.\nIn the United States, surgeons, hospitals and other healthcare providers who purchase medical devices like our products generally rely on third-party payors, principally federal Medicare, state Medicaid and private health insurance plans, to pay for all or a portion of the costs and fees associated with the spinal surgery and the products utilized in the procedure, including the cost of our products. Our customers\u2019 access to adequate coverage and reimbursement for the procedures performed using our products by government and third-party payors is central to the acceptance of our current and future products. We may be unable to sell our products on a profitable basis if government and third-party payors deny coverage or reduce their current levels of reimbursement. To contain costs of new technologies, governmental healthcare programs and third-party payors are increasingly scrutinizing new and even existing treatments by requiring extensive evidence of favorable clinical outcomes. Surgeons, hospitals and other healthcare providers may not purchase our products if they do not receive satisfactory reimbursement from these third-party payors for the cost of the procedures using our products. Payors continue to review their coverage policies carefully for existing and new therapies and can, without notice, deny coverage for treatments that include the use of our products. If we are not successful in reversing existing non-coverage policies, if other third-party payors issue similar policies or if we are not able to be reimbursed at appropriate levels, this could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nFor example, in August of 2013, Aetna Inc., a large private insurance provider, issued a policy bulletin that classified PEEK interbody cervical cages such as ROI-C as experimental and investigational. Such a change may impact whether Aetna will continue to cover procedures utilizing such cages, and it may encourage other private insurance providers to evaluate their own coverage of PEEK interbody cervical cages.\nIn addition, some healthcare providers in the United States have adopted or are considering a managed care system in which the providers contract to provide comprehensive healthcare for a fixed cost per person. Healthcare providers may attempt to control costs by authorizing fewer surgical procedures or by requiring the use of the least expensive implant available. Additionally, as a result of reform of the U.S. healthcare system, changes in reimbursement policies or healthcare cost containment initiatives may limit or restrict coverage and reimbursement for our products and cause our revenue to decline.\nOutside of the United States, reimbursement systems vary significantly by country. Many foreign markets have government-managed healthcare systems that govern reimbursement for spine implants and procedures. Additionally, some foreign\nreimbursement systems provide for limited payments in a given period and therefore result in extended payment periods. If adequate levels of reimbursement from third-party payors outside of the United States are not obtained, international sales of our products may decline.\nIf we are unable to maintain and expand our network of direct sales representatives, independent sales agencies and international distributors, we may not be able to generate anticipated sales.\nWe first began operations in 2000 and have operated in the United States since 2005. We have limited experience marketing and selling our Mobi-C cervical disc replacement device, for which we received FDA approval in August 2013, and we have limited experience marketing that device in the United States. As of December 31, 2014, our sales organization consists of regional sales managers that lead direct sales representatives and over 200 independent sales agencies. For the year ending December 31, 2014, the vast majority of our U.S. sales were from independent sales agencies. Outside of the United States, we sell through direct sales representatives and distributors that are often managed by our direct sales managers located in our foreign offices. We had sales in over 25 countries in 2014 and over 50 international distributors. Our operating results are directly dependent upon the sales and marketing efforts of not only our employees, but also our independent sales agencies and distributors. We expect our direct sales representatives, independent sales agencies and distributors to develop long-lasting relationships with the surgeons they serve. If our direct sales representatives, independent sales agencies or distributors fail to adequately promote, market and sell our products, our sales could significantly decrease.\nWe face significant challenges and risks in managing our geographically dispersed distribution network and retaining the individuals who make up that network. If any of our direct sales representatives were to leave us, or if any of our independent sales agencies or distributors were to cease to do business with us, our sales could be adversely affected. Some of our independent sales agencies and distributors account for a significant portion of our sales volume, and if any such independent sales agencies or distributors were to cease to distribute our products, our sales could be adversely affected. In such a situation, we may need to seek alternative independent sales agencies or distributors or increase our reliance on our direct sales representatives, which we may be unable to do in a timely and efficient manner, if at all. While a majority of our independent sales agencies and distributors have contractual exclusivity, that contractual exclusivity is often limited to one or more of our products. Where some level of exclusivity exists, these independent sales agencies and distributors are permitted to offer a competitor\u2019s products that do not compete directly with our products. Our competitors may require that these sales agents and distributors cease doing business with us. In addition, we may not be able to rely on our independent sales agencies or distributors to distribute new products that we introduce that compete with products of our competitors that they also represent. If a direct sales representative, independent sales agency or distributor were to depart and be retained exclusively by one of our competitors, we may be unable to prevent them from helping competitors solicit business from our existing customers, which could further adversely affect our sales. Because of the intense competition for their services, we may be unable to recruit or retain additional qualified independent sales agencies or distributors or to hire additional direct sales representatives to work with us. We may not be able to enter into agreements with them on favorable or commercially reasonable terms, if at all. Failure to hire or retain qualified direct sales representatives or independent sales agencies or distributors would prevent us from expanding our business and generating sales.\nAs we launch new products and increase our marketing efforts with respect to existing products, we will need to expand the reach of our marketing and sales networks. Our future success will depend largely on our ability to continue to hire, train, retain and motivate skilled sales managers, direct sales representatives and independent sales agencies and distributors with significant technical knowledge in various areas, such as spinal care practices, spine injuries and disease and spinal health. New hires require training and take time to achieve full productivity. If we fail to train new hires adequately, or if we experience high turnover in our sales force in the future, we cannot be certain that new hires will become as productive as may be necessary to maintain or increase our sales.\nIf we are unable to expand our sales and marketing capabilities domestically and internationally, we may not be able to effectively commercialize our products, which would adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe operate in a very competitive business environment and if we are unable to compete successfully against our existing or potential competitors, our sales and operating results may be negatively affected and we may not grow.\nThe spine industry is intensely competitive, subject to rapid change and highly sensitive to the introduction of new products or other market activities of industry participants. Our ability to compete successfully will depend on our ability to develop future products that reach the market in a timely manner, are well adopted by surgeon customers and receive adequate coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors. Because of the size of the potential market, we anticipate that companies will dedicate significant resources to developing products competitive to ours.\nWe have numerous competitors in the spine market, which include Medtronic Spine and Biologics, DePuy Synthes Spine (a division of Johnson & Johnson), Globus Medical, Nuvasive and Stryker, which together represent a significant portion of the spine market. We also compete with many smaller spine market participants such as Alphatec Spine, Biomet Spine, Integra,\nOrthofix International and Zimmer. At any time, these or other industry participants may develop alternative treatments, products or procedures for the treatment of spine disorders that compete directly or indirectly with our products. They may also develop and patent processes or products earlier than we can or obtain regulatory clearance, approvals or CE Certificates of Conformity for competing products more rapidly than we can, which could impair our ability to develop and commercialize similar processes or products. If alternative treatments are, or are perceived to be, superior to our spine surgery products, sales of our products could be negatively affected and our results of operations could suffer.\nMany of our larger competitors are either publicly traded or divisions or subsidiaries of publicly traded companies. These competitors enjoy several competitive advantages over us, including:\n\u2022\ngreater financial, human and other resources for product research and development, sales and marketing and litigation;\n\u2022\nsignificantly greater name recognition;\n\u2022\nestablished relationships with spine surgeons, hospitals and other healthcare providers;\n\u2022\nlarge and established sales and marketing and distribution networks;\n\u2022\nproducts supported by long-term clinical data;\n\u2022\ngreater experience in obtaining and maintaining regulatory clearances, approvals or CE Certificates of Conformity for products and product enhancements;\n\u2022\nmore expansive portfolios of intellectual property rights; and\n\u2022\nbroader product portfolios affording them greater ability to cross-sell their products or to incentivize hospitals or surgeons to use their products.\nThe spine industry is becoming increasingly crowded with new participants. Many of these new competitors specialize in a specific product or focus on a particular market segment, making it more difficult for us to increase our overall market position. The frequent introduction by competitors of products that are, or claim to be, superior to our products, or that are alternatives to our existing or planned products may also create market confusion that may make it difficult to differentiate the benefits of our products over competing products. In addition, the entry of multiple new products and competitors may lead some of our competitors to employ pricing strategies that could adversely affect the pricing of our products and pricing in the spine market generally.\nAs a result, without the timely introduction of new products and enhancements, our products may become obsolete over time. If we are unable to develop innovative new products, maintain competitive pricing and offer products that spine surgeons perceive to be as reliable as those of our competitors, our sales or margins could decrease, thereby harming our business.\nOur reliance on third-party suppliers, including limited source and single source suppliers, for our implants and instruments could harm our ability to meet demand for our products in a timely and cost effective manner.\nWe rely on third-party suppliers, almost all of which are located in Europe, to manufacture and supply our implants and instruments. We currently rely on a number of limited or single source suppliers, such as Greatbatch, which supplies Mobi-C cervical disc replacement devices for the U.S. market, In\u2019Tech Medical, which supplies a majority of our surgical instrumentation, and CF Plastiques, which is one of our interbody device suppliers. We generally do not have long-term contracts with our suppliers, and, as a result, our suppliers generally are not required to provide us with any guaranteed minimum production levels. As a result, there can be no assurances that we will be able to obtain sufficient quantities of key components or products in the future, which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFor us to be successful, our suppliers must be able to provide us with products and components in substantial quantities, in compliance with regulatory requirements, in accordance with agreed upon specifications, at acceptable costs and on a timely basis. Reliance on third-party manufacturers entails risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured products ourselves, including reliance on the third party for regulatory compliance and quality assurance, the possibility that products will not be delivered on a timely basis, the possibility of increases in pricing for our products, the possibility of breach of the manufacturing agreement by the third party and the possibility of termination or non-renewal of the agreement by the third party.\nIn addition, our reliance on third-party suppliers involves a number of risks, including, among other things:\n\u2022\nsuppliers may fail to comply with regulatory requirements or make errors in manufacturing components that could negatively affect the efficacy or safety of our products or cause delays in shipments of our products;\n\u2022\nwe or our suppliers may not be able to respond to unanticipated changes in customer orders, and if orders do not match forecasts, we or our suppliers may have excess or inadequate inventory of materials and components;\n\u2022\nwe may be subject to price fluctuations due to a lack of long-term supply arrangements for key components;\n\u2022\nwe may experience delays in delivery by our suppliers due to changes in demand from us or their other customers;\n\u2022\nwe or our suppliers may lose access to critical services and components, resulting in an interruption in the manufacture, assembly and shipment of our systems;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in demand for products that our suppliers manufacture for others may affect their ability or willingness to deliver components to us in a timely manner;\n\u2022\nwe may be required to obtain regulatory approvals related to any change in our supply chain;\n\u2022\nour suppliers may wish to discontinue supplying components or services to us for risk management reasons;\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to find new or alternative components or reconfigure our system and manufacturing processes in a timely manner if the necessary components become unavailable; and\n\u2022\nour suppliers may encounter financial or other hardships unrelated to our demand for components, which could inhibit their ability to fulfill our orders and meet our requirements.\nIf any of these risks materialize, it could significantly increase our costs and impact our ability to meet demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business. If we are unable to satisfy commercial demand for our products in a timely manner, our ability to generate revenue would be impaired, market acceptance of our products could be adversely affected and customers may instead purchase or use our competitors\u2019 products. In addition, we could be forced to secure new or alternative components through a replacement supplier. Securing a replacement supplier could be difficult, especially for complex components that are manufactured in accordance with our custom specifications.\nThere are a limited number of suppliers and third-party manufacturers that operate under the FDA\u2019s current Good Manufacturing Practices, maintain certifications from the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), that are recognized as harmonized standards in the EEA, and that have the necessary expertise and capacity to manufacture our products. As a result, it may be difficult for us to locate manufacturers for our anticipated future needs, and our anticipated growth could strain the ability of our current suppliers to deliver products, materials and components to us. If we are unable to arrange for third-party manufacturing of our products, or to do so on commercially reasonable terms, we may not be able to complete development of, market and sell our new products.\nThe introduction of new or alternative components may require design changes to our system that are subject to FDA and other regulatory clearances, approvals or new CE Certificates of Conformity. We may also be required to assess the new manufacturer\u2019s compliance with all applicable regulations and guidelines, which could further impede our ability to manufacture our products in a timely manner. As a result, we could incur increased production costs, experience delays in deliveries of our products, suffer damage to our reputation and experience an adverse effect on our business and financial results.\nWe may in the future elect to manufacture certain new products developed or certain existing products without the assistance of third parties. However, in order to make that election, we will need to invest substantial additional funds and recruit qualified personnel in order to operate our development manufacturing facility on a commercial basis. There can be no assurance that we will successfully manufacture our own products and if we are not able to make or obtain adequate supplies of our products, it will be more difficult for us to launch new products and compete effectively.\nPricing pressure from hospital customers and our competitors may impact our ability to sell our products at prices necessary to support our current business strategies.\nThe spine market has attracted numerous new companies and technologies, and encouraged more established companies to intensify competitive pricing pressure. As a result of this increased competition, we believe there will be increased pricing pressure in the future. Because the hospital and other healthcare provider customers that purchase our products typically bill various third-party payors to cover all or a portion of the costs and fees associated with the procedures in which our products are used, including the cost of the purchase of our products, changes in the amount such payors are willing to reimburse our customers for procedures using our products could create pricing pressure for us. If competitive forces drive down the prices we are able to charge for our products, our profit margins will shrink, which will adversely affect our ability to invest in and grow our business.\nMuch of the pricing competition relates to traditional fusion products, such as pedicle screws, cervical plates and traditional cages. We may not be successful in convincing third-party payors of the superiority of our innovative products as compared to traditional products, and reimbursement for these products may be significantly impacted. Additionally, as more competitors introduce innovative fusion products, we may face additional pricing pressure for our products that will impact our future results.\nMoreover, many hospital customers, through the contracting process, limit the number of spine manufacturers that may sell to their institution. As we have a limited number of products to sell, hospitals may choose to contract with our competitors who have a broader range of products that may be used in a wider variety of spine procedures, regardless of the differentiated attributes of our products or local surgeon preference for our products. In addition, our competitors may actively position their\nbroader product portfolios against us during the hospital contracting process. Limitations on the number of hospitals to which we can sell may significantly restrict our ability to grow.\nWe obtain some of our products through private-label distribution agreements that subject us to minimum performance requirements and other criteria. Our failure to satisfy those criteria could cause us to lose those rights of distribution.\nWe have entered into private-label distribution agreements with manufacturers of Spinetune and C-Plate. These manufacturers brand their products according to our specifications, and we may have exclusive rights in certain fields of use and territories to sell these products subject to minimum purchase or other performance criteria. Though these agreements do not individually or in the aggregate represent a material portion of our business, if we do not meet these performance criteria, or if we fail to renew these agreements, we may lose exclusivity in a field of use or territory or cease to have any rights to these products, which could have an adverse effect on our sales and our business. Furthermore, some of these manufacturers are smaller, undercapitalized companies that may not have sufficient resources to continue operations or to continue to supply us sufficient product without additional access to capital.\nIf our private label manufacturers fail to provide us with sufficient supply of their products, or if their supply fails to meet appropriate quality requirements, our business could suffer.\nOur private-label manufacturers are sole source suppliers of the products we purchase from them. We may not be able to locate or establish additional or replacement manufacturers of these products in a timely manner. Moreover, these private-label manufacturers typically own the intellectual property associated with their products, and even if we could find a replacement manufacturer for the product, we may not have sufficient rights to enable the replacement party to manufacture the product. While we have entered into agreements with our private-label manufacturers to provide us sufficient quantities of products, we cannot assure you that they will do so, or that any products they do provide us will not contain defects in quality. Our private-label manufacturing agreements have expiration terms and the manufacturers may not choose to renew them. The agreements also include provisions allowing for termination under certain circumstances such as either party\u2019s uncured material breach, either party\u2019s insolvency or failure to make minimum purchases.\nWe also rely on these private-label manufacturers to comply with the regulations and requirements of the FDA, the competent authorities or notified bodies of the EEA countries, or foreign regulatory authorities and their failure to comply with strictly enforced regulatory requirements could expose us to regulatory action including warning letters, product recalls, termination of distribution, product seizures or civil and criminal penalties. Any quality control problems that we experience with respect to products manufactured by our private-label manufacturers, any inability by us to provide our customers with sufficient supply of products or any investigations or enforcement actions by the FDA, the competent authorities or notified bodies of the EEA countries or other foreign regulatory authorities could adversely affect our reputation or commercialization of our products and adversely and materially affect our business and operating results.\nIf we do not successfully implement our business strategy, our business and results of operations will be adversely affected.\nWe formed our business strategy based on assumptions about the spine market that might prove wrong. We believe that various demographics and industry-specific trends, including the aging of the general population, increasingly active lifestyles, our products, and increasing acceptance of cervical disc replacements, will help drive growth in the spine market and our business, but these demographics and trends are uncertain. Actual demand for our products could differ materially from projected demand if our assumptions regarding these factors prove to be incorrect or do not materialize, or if alternative treatments to those offered by our products gain widespread acceptance.\nWe may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy. To implement our business strategy, we need to, among other things, establish our Mobi-C cervical disc replacement device as a standard of care for cervical disc replacement, leverage our VerteBRIDGE fusion platform to further penetrate the global spine fusion market, expand the size and productivity of our U.S. and international sales organization and expand our technology portfolio. Our strategy of focusing exclusively on the spine market may limit our ability to grow. In addition, we are seeking to increase our sales and, in order to do so, will need to commercialize additional products and expand the number of our direct sales representatives, independent sales agencies and international distributors in new and existing territories, all of which could result in our becoming subject to additional or different foreign and domestic regulatory requirements with which we may not be able to comply. Moreover, even if we successfully implement our business strategy, our operating results may not improve or may decline. We may decide to alter or discontinue aspects of our business strategy and may adopt different strategies due to business or competitive factors not currently foreseen, such as new medical technologies that would make our products obsolete. Any failure to implement our business strategy may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe proliferation of physician-owned distributorships could harm our ability to sell our products to physicians who own or are affiliated with those distributorships.\nPhysician-owned distributorships, or PODs, are medical device distributors that are owned, directly or indirectly, by physicians. These physicians derive revenue from selling or arranging for the sale of medical devices for use in procedures they perform on their own patients at hospitals or ambulatory surgical centers, or ASCs, that agree to purchase from or through the POD, or that otherwise furnish ordering physicians with income that is based directly or indirectly on those orders of medical devices.\nThese companies and the physicians who own, or partially own, them have significant market knowledge and access to the surgeons who use our products and the hospitals that purchase our products, and growth in this area may reduce our ability to compete effectively for business from surgeons who own such distributorships. On March 26, 2013, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General issued a special fraud alert on PODs and stated that it views PODs as inherently suspect under the Federal Anti-Kickback Statute and is concerned about the proliferation of PODs. Nonetheless, the number of PODs in the spine industry may continue to grow as economic pressures increase throughout the industry, hospitals, insurers and physicians search for ways to reduce costs, and, in the case of the physicians, search for ways to increase their incomes.\nIf we are unable to train surgeons on the safe and appropriate use of our products, we may be unable to achieve our expected growth.\nAn important part of our sales process includes the ability to train surgeons on the safe and appropriate use of our products. If we become unable to attract potential new surgeon customers to our training programs, or if we are unable to attract existing customers to training programs for future products, we may be unable to achieve our expected growth.\nThere is a learning process involved for spine surgeons to become proficient in the use of our products. It is critical to the success of our commercialization efforts to train a sufficient number of spine surgeons and to provide them with adequate instruction in the use of our products via trade shows and leads generated by our sales force. This training process may take longer than expected and may therefore affect our ability to increase sales. Following completion of training, we rely on the trained surgeons to advocate the benefits of our products in the broader marketplace. Convincing surgeons to dedicate the time and energy necessary for adequate training is challenging, and we cannot assure you we will be successful in these efforts. If surgeons are not properly trained, they may misuse or ineffectively use our products. This may also result in unsatisfactory patient outcomes, patient injury, negative publicity or lawsuits against us, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nAlthough we believe our training methods for surgeons are conducted in compliance with FDA and other applicable regulations developed both nationally and in third countries, if the FDA or other competent authority determines that our training constitutes promotion of an unapproved use or promotion of an intended purpose not covered by the current CE mark affixed to our product or FDA approved labeling, they could request that we modify our training or subject us to regulatory enforcement actions, including the issuance of a warning letter, injunction, seizure, civil fine and criminal penalty.\nWe have a limited operating history and may face difficulties encountered by early stage companies in new and rapidly evolving markets.\nWe began operations in 2000. Accordingly, we have a limited operating history upon which to base an evaluation of our business and prospects. In assessing our prospects, you must consider the risks and difficulties frequently encountered by early stage companies in new and rapidly evolving markets, particularly companies engaged in the development and sales of medical devices. These risks include our ability to:\n\u2022\nmanage rapidly changing and expanding operations;\n\u2022\nestablish and increase awareness of our brand and strengthen customer loyalty;\n\u2022\ngrow our direct sales force and increase the number of our independent sales agents and distributors to expand sales of our products in the United States and in targeted international markets;\n\u2022\nimplement and successfully execute our business and marketing strategy;\n\u2022\nrespond effectively to competitive pressures and developments;\n\u2022\ncontinue to develop and enhance our products and products in development;\n\u2022\nobtain regulatory clearance, approval or CE Certificate of Conformity to commercialize new products and enhance our existing products;\n\u2022\nexpand our presence and commence operations in international markets;\n\u2022\nperform clinical research and trials on our existing products and current and future product candidates; and\n\u2022\nattract, retain and motivate qualified personnel.\nWe can also be negatively affected by general economic conditions. Because of our limited operating history, we may not have insight into trends that could emerge and negatively affect our business.\nAs a result of these or other risks, our business strategy might not be successful.\nOur business could suffer if we lose the services of key members of our senior management, key advisors or personnel.\nWe are dependent upon the continued services of key members of our executive management and a limited number of key advisors and personnel. In particular, we are highly dependent on the skills and leadership of our executive management team. The loss of any one of these individuals could disrupt our operations or our strategic plans. Additionally, our future success will depend on, among other things, our ability to continue to hire and retain the necessary qualified scientific, technical, sales, marketing and managerial personnel, for whom we compete with numerous other companies, academic institutions and organizations. The loss of members of our management team, key advisors or personnel, or our inability to attract or retain other qualified personnel or advisors, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe safety and efficacy of some of our products is not yet supported by long-term clinical data, which could limit sales, and our products might therefore prove to be less safe or effective than initially thought.\nOur VerteBRIDGE platform products that we market in the United States either have received premarket clearance under Section 510(k) of the FDCA, or are exempt from premarket review. The FDA\u2019s 510(k) clearance process requires us to show that our proposed product is \u201csubstantially equivalent\u201d to another 510(k)-cleared product. This process is shorter and typically requires the submission of less supporting documentation than other FDA approval processes and does not always require long-term clinical studies. In the EEA, manufacturers of medical devices are required by the Medical Devices Directive to collect post-marketing clinical data in relation to their CE marked medical devices. Post-market surveillance includes the conduct of post-market clinical follow-up studies permitting manufacturers to gather information concerning quality, safety or performance of medical devices after they have been placed on the market in the EU. All information collected as part of the post-market surveillance process must be reviewed, investigated and analyzed on a regular basis in order to determine whether trending conclusions can be made concerning the safety or performance of the medical device and decisions must be taken in relation to the continued marketing of medical devices currently on the market. We expect to incur ongoing costs to comply with these post-market clinical obligations in France and other EEA markets for so long as we continue to market and sell products in those markets. We anticipate that these costs will be immaterial going forward. Except for Mobi-C, we lack the breadth of published long-term clinical data supporting the safety and efficacy of our cervical technology products or our lumbar technology products and the benefits they offer that might have been generated in connection with other approval processes. For these reasons, spine surgeons may be slow to adopt our products, we may not have comparative data that our competitors have or are generating, and we may be subject to greater regulatory and product liability risks. Further, future patient studies or clinical experience, including those that we are starting in France, may indicate that treatment with our products does not improve patient outcomes. Such results would slow the adoption of our products by spine surgeons, would significantly reduce our ability to achieve expected sales and could prevent us from achieving and maintaining profitability. Moreover, if future results and experience indicate that our products cause unexpected or serious complications or other unforeseen negative effects, we could be subject to mandatory product recalls, suspension or withdrawal of FDA or other government\u2019s clearance or approval, CE Certificates of Conformity, significant legal liability or harm to our business reputation.\nIf we do not enhance our product offerings through our research and development efforts, we may be unable to compete effectively.\nIn order to increase our market share in the spine market, we must enhance and broaden our product offerings in response to changing customer demands and competitive pressures and technologies. We might not be able to successfully develop, obtain regulatory approval, clearance or CE Certificates of Conformity to market new products, and our future products might not be accepted by the surgeons or the third-party payors who reimburse for many of the procedures performed with our products. The success of any new product offering or enhancement to an existing product will depend on numerous factors, including our ability to:\n\u2022\nproperly identify and anticipate surgeon and patient needs;\n\u2022\ndevelop and introduce new products or product enhancements in a timely manner;\n\u2022\nadequately protect our intellectual property and avoid infringing upon the intellectual property rights of third parties;\n\u2022\ndemonstrate the safety and efficacy of new products through the conduct of clinical investigations or the collection of existing relevant clinical data; and\n\u2022\nobtain the necessary regulatory clearances, approvals or CE Certificates of Conformity for new products or product enhancements.\nIf we do not develop and obtain regulatory clearance, approval or CE Certificates of Conformity for new products or product enhancements in time to meet market demand, or if there is insufficient demand for these products or enhancements, our results of operations will suffer. Our research and development efforts may require a substantial investment of time and resources before we are adequately able to determine the commercial viability of a new product, technology, material or other innovation. In addition, even if we are able to develop enhancements or new generations of our products successfully, these enhancements or new generations of products may not produce sales in excess of the costs of development and they may be quickly rendered obsolete by changing customer preferences or the introduction by our competitors of products embodying new technologies or features.\nIf we fail to manage our anticipated growth properly, our business could suffer.\nOur growth has placed, and, if it continues, will continue to place, a significant strain on our management and our operational and financial resources and systems. Failure to manage our growth effectively could cause us to over-invest or under-invest in infrastructure, and result in losses or weaknesses in our infrastructure, which could materially adversely affect us. Additionally, our anticipated growth will increase the demands placed on our suppliers, resulting in an increased need for us to monitor our suppliers carefully for quality assurance. Any failure by us to manage our growth effectively could have an adverse effect on our ability to achieve our development and commercialization goals.\nWe may seek to grow our business through acquisitions of or investments in new or complementary businesses, products or technologies, and the failure to manage any acquisitions or investments, or the failure to integrate them with our existing business, could have a material adverse effect on us.\nFrom time to time we expect to consider opportunities to acquire or make investments in other technologies, products and businesses that may enhance our capabilities, complement our current products or expand the breadth of our markets or customer base. Potential and completed acquisitions and strategic investments involve numerous risks, including:\n\u2022\nproblems assimilating the purchased technologies, products or business operations;\n\u2022\nissues maintaining uniform standards, procedures, controls and policies;\n\u2022\nunanticipated costs associated with acquisitions;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management\u2019s attention from our core business;\n\u2022\nadverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers;\n\u2022\nrisks associated with entering new markets in which we have limited or no experience;\n\u2022\npotential loss of key employees of acquired businesses; and\n\u2022\nincreased legal and accounting compliance costs.\nWe have no current commitments with respect to any acquisition or investment, and we have limited experience acquiring technology. We do not know if we will be able to identify suitable acquisitions, complete any such acquisitions on favorable terms or at all, successfully integrate any acquired business, product or technology into our business or retain any key personnel, suppliers or international distributors. Our ability to grow through acquisitions successfully depends upon our ability to identify, negotiate, complete and integrate suitable target businesses and to obtain any necessary financing. These efforts could be expensive and time-consuming, and may disrupt our ongoing business and prevent management from focusing on our operations. If we are unable to integrate any acquired businesses, products or technologies effectively, our business, results of operations and financial condition will be materially adversely affected.\nWe are required to maintain high levels of inventory, which could consume a significant amount of our resources and reduce our cash flows.\nAs a result of the need to maintain substantial levels of inventory, we are subject to the risk of inventory obsolescence. Many of our products come in sets that feature components in a variety of sizes allowing the implant or device to be customized to the patient\u2019s needs. In order to market our products effectively, we often must maintain and provide surgeons and hospitals with implant sets, back-up products and products of different sizes. For each surgery, fewer than all of the components of the set are used, and therefore certain portions of the set may expire before they can be used or be considered excess inventory since they are not likely to be used. In the event that a substantial portion of our inventory becomes obsolete, it could have a material adverse effect on our earnings and cash flows due to the resulting costs associated with the inventory impairment charges and costs required to replace such inventory.\nWe provide instrument sets for each surgery performed using our products, which could consume a significant amount of our resources and reduce our cash flows.\nWe provide instrument sets for each surgery performed using our products. As a result, we are required to maintain significant levels of instrument sets. The amount of this investment is driven by the number of surgeons or hospitals using our products, and as the number of different surgeons and hospitals that use our products increases, the number of instrument sets required to meet this demand will increase. Because we do not have the sales volume of some larger companies, we may not be able to utilize our instrument sets as often and our return on assets may be lower when compared to such companies. In addition, as we introduce new products, new instrument sets may be required, with a significant initial investment required to accommodate the launch of the product.\nConsolidation in the healthcare industry could lead to demands for price concessions or to the exclusion of some suppliers from certain of our markets, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nBecause healthcare costs have risen significantly over the past decade, numerous initiatives and reforms initiated by legislators, regulators and third-party payors to curb these costs have resulted in a consolidation trend in the healthcare industry to aggregate purchasing power. As the healthcare industry consolidates, competition to provide products and services to industry participants has become and will continue to become more intense. This in turn has resulted and will likely continue to result in greater pricing pressures and the exclusion of certain suppliers from important market segments as group purchasing organizations, independent delivery networks and large single accounts continue to use their market power to consolidate purchasing decisions for hospitals. We expect that market demand, government regulation, third-party coverage and reimbursement policies and societal pressures will continue to change the worldwide healthcare industry, resulting in further business consolidations and alliances among our customers, which may reduce competition, exert further downward pressure on the prices of our products and may adversely impact our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nOur sales volumes and our operating results may fluctuate over the course of the year.\nOur business is generally not seasonal in nature. However, our sales may be influenced by summer vacation and winter holiday periods, during which we have experienced fewer spine surgeries taking place. We have experienced and continue to experience meaningful variability in our sales and gross profit among quarters, as well as within each quarter, as a result of a number of factors, including, among other things:\n\u2022\nthe number of products sold in the quarter;\n\u2022\nthe number of surgical procedures performed during the quarter;\n\u2022\nthe demand for, and pricing of our products and the products of our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe timing of or failure to obtain regulatory clearances, approvals or CE Certificates of Conformity for products;\n\u2022\ncosts, benefits, and timing of new product introductions;\n\u2022\nincreased competition;\n\u2022\nthe availability and cost of components and materials;\n\u2022\nthe number of selling days in the quarter;\n\u2022\nfluctuation and foreign currency exchange rates; and\n\u2022\nimpairment and other special charges.\nIf we experience material weaknesses in the future or otherwise fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls in the future, we may not be able to accurately report our financial condition or results of operations which may adversely affect investor confidence in us and, as a result, the value of our common stock.\nAs a public company, we are required, under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, to furnish a report by management on, among other things, the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. The results of this assessment need to be included in our annual report and we are required to disclose any material weaknesses identified by our management in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company\u2019s annual and interim financial statements will not be prevented, or detected and corrected, on a timely basis.\nWe devoted significant resources to compiling the system and processing documentation necessary to perform the evaluation needed to comply with Section 404 for the year ended December 31, 2014. In future years, we may need to devote more resources to Section 404 compliance, and we may not be able to complete our annual evaluations, testing and any required remediations in a timely fashion. During the evaluation and testing process, if we identify one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, we will be unable to assert that our internal controls are effective. Lack of effective\ncontrols could severely inhibit our ability to accurately report our financial condition or results of operations. We cannot assure you that there will not be material weaknesses and/or significant deficiencies in our internal controls in the future.\nIf we are unable to conclude that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which would likely cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nAdditionally, when we cease to be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d under the federal securities laws, our auditors will be required to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls. If we are unable to confirm that our internal control over financial reporting is effective, or if our auditors are unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls, we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports, which would cause the price of our common stock to decline.\nWe have incurred and will continue to incur significant additional costs as a result of being a public company, and our management is required to devote substantial time to compliance initiatives.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010, or the Dodd-Frank Act, the Securities and Exchange Commission, or the SEC, and NASDAQ impose various requirements on public companies, including the establishment and maintenance of effective disclosure and financial controls and specific corporate governance practices. These rules and regulations increase our accounting, legal and financial compliance costs and make some activities more time-consuming and costly. In addition, we expect that our management and other personnel will need to divert attention from operational and other business matters to devote substantial time to these public company requirements. In particular, we expect to incur significant expenses and devote substantial management effort toward ensuring compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which will increase when we are no longer an emerging growth company, as defined by the JOBS Act. We will need to hire additional accounting and financial staff with appropriate public company experience and technical accounting knowledge and may need to establish an internal audit function. We cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional costs we may incur as a result of becoming a public company or the timing of such costs.\nThese rules and regulations could make it more expensive for us to maintain directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage. As a result, it may be more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, our board committees, or as executive officers.\nNew laws and regulations, as well as changes to existing laws and regulations affecting public companies, including the provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Dodd-Frank Act and rules adopted by the SEC and NASDAQ, would likely result in increased costs to us as we respond to their requirements, which may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nIf we experience significant disruptions in our information technology systems, our business may be adversely affected.\nWe depend on our information technology systems for the efficient functioning of our business, including accounting, data storage, compliance, purchasing and inventory management. We do not have redundant systems at this time; however, we have begun a process to determine the investment required to provide redundancy on our mission critical enterprise systems. Upon approval of the related projects, we expect them to be implemented within the next three years. While we will attempt to mitigate interruptions, we may experience difficulties in implementing some upgrades which would impact our business operations, or experience difficulties in operating our business during the upgrade, either of which could disrupt our operations, including our ability to timely ship and track product orders, project inventory requirements, manage our supply chain and otherwise adequately service our customers. In the event we experience significant disruptions as a result of the current implementation of our information technology systems, we may not be able to repair our systems in an efficient and timely manner. Accordingly, such events may disrupt or reduce the efficiency of our entire operation and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are increasingly dependent on sophisticated information technology for our infrastructure. Our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain, protect and enhance existing systems. Failure to maintain or protect our information systems and data integrity effectively could have a materially adverse effect on our business. For example, third parties may attempt to hack into systems and may obtain our proprietary information.\nFluctuations in insurance cost and availability could adversely affect our profitability or our risk management profile.\nWe hold a number of insurance policies, including product liability insurance, directors\u2019 and officers\u2019 liability insurance, general liability insurance, property insurance and workers\u2019 compensation insurance. If the costs of maintaining adequate insurance coverage increase significantly in the future, our operating results could be materially adversely affected. Likewise, if any of our current insurance coverage should become unavailable to us or become economically impractical, we would be required to operate our business without indemnity from commercial insurance providers. If we operate our business without\ninsurance, we could be responsible for paying claims or judgments against us that would have otherwise been covered by insurance, which could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nRisks Related to our Legal and Regulatory Environment\nOur medical device products and operations are subject to extensive governmental regulation both in the United States and abroad, and our failure to comply with applicable requirements could cause our business to suffer.\nOur medical device products and operations are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and various other federal, state and foreign governmental authorities, such as the competent authorities of EEA countries. Government regulation of medical devices is meant to assure their safety and effectiveness, and includes regulation of, among other things:\n\u2022\ndesign, development and manufacturing;\n\u2022\ntesting, labeling, content and language of instructions for use and storage;\n\u2022\nclinical trials;\n\u2022\nproduct safety;\n\u2022\nmarketing, sales and distribution;\n\u2022\nregulatory clearances and approvals including premarket clearance and approval;\n\u2022\nconformity assessment procedures;\n\u2022\nproduct traceability and record keeping procedures;\n\u2022\nadvertising and promotion;\n\u2022\nproduct complaints, complaint reporting, recalls and field safety corrective actions;\n\u2022\npost-market surveillance, including reporting of deaths or serious injuries and malfunctions that, if they were to recur, could lead to death or serious injury;\n\u2022\npost-market studies; and\n\u2022\nproduct import and export.\nThe regulations to which we are subject are complex and have tended to become more stringent over time. Regulatory changes could result in restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations, higher than anticipated costs or lower than anticipated sales.\nBefore we can market or sell a new regulated product or a significant modification to an existing product in the United States, we must obtain either clearance under Section 510(k) of the FDCA or an approval of a premarket approval, or PMA, application unless the device is specifically exempt from premarket review. In the 510(k) clearance process, the FDA must determine that a proposed device is \u201csubstantially equivalent\u201d to a device legally on the market, known as a \u201cpredicate\u201d device, with respect to intended use, technology and safety and effectiveness, in order to clear the proposed device for marketing. Clinical data is sometimes required to support substantial equivalence. In the PMA approval process, the FDA must determine that a proposed device is safe and effective for its intended use based, in part, on extensive data, including, but not limited to, technical, pre-clinical, clinical trial, manufacturing and labeling data. The PMA process is typically required for devices for which the 510(k) process cannot be used and that are deemed to pose the greatest risk, such as life-sustaining, life-supporting or implantable devices. Modifications to products that are approved through a PMA application generally need FDA approval. Similarly, some modifications made to products cleared through a 510(k) may require a new 510(k). The FDA\u2019s 510(k) clearance process usually takes from three to 12 months, but may last longer. The process of obtaining a PMA is much more costly and uncertain than the 510(k) clearance process and generally takes from one to three years, or even longer, from the time the application is submitted to the FDA until an approval is obtained.\nIn the United States, other than Mobi-C, our currently commercialized products either have received premarket clearance under Section 510(k) of the FDCA or are exempt from premarket review. If the FDA requires us to go through a lengthier, more rigorous examination for future products or modifications to existing products than we had expected, our product introductions or modifications could be delayed or canceled, which could cause our sales to decline. The FDA may demand that we obtain a PMA prior to marketing certain of our future products. In addition, if the FDA disagrees with our determination that a product we currently market is subject to an exemption from premarket review, the FDA may require us to submit a 510(k) or PMA in order to continue marketing the product. Further, even with respect to those future products where a PMA is not required, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain the 510(k) clearances with respect to those products.\nThe FDA can delay, limit or deny clearance or approval of a device for many reasons, including:\n\u2022\nwe may not be able to demonstrate to the FDA\u2019s satisfaction that our products are safe and effective for their intended uses;\n\u2022\nthe data from our pre-clinical studies and clinical trials may be insufficient to support clearance or approval, where required; and\n\u2022\nthe manufacturing process or facilities we use may not meet applicable requirements.\nIn addition, the FDA may change its clearance and approval policies, adopt additional regulations or revise existing regulations, or take other actions that may prevent or delay approval or clearance of our products under development or impact our ability to modify our currently approved or cleared products on a timely basis. For example, in 2011, the FDA announced a Plan of Action to modernize and improve the FDA\u2019s premarket review of medical devices, and has implemented, and continues to implement, reforms intended to streamline the premarket review process. In addition, as part of the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012, or FDASIA, Congress enacted several reforms entitled the Medical Device Regulatory Improvements and additional miscellaneous provisions which further affect medical device regulation both pre- and post-approval. Any change in the laws or regulations that govern the clearance and approval processes relating to our current and future products could make it more difficult and costly to obtain clearance or approval for new products, or to produce, market and distribute existing products.\nThe FDA could also reclassify some or all of our products that are currently classified as Class II to Class III requiring additional controls, clinical studies and submission of a PMA for us to continue marketing and selling those products. Under new changes instituted by FDASIA, the FDA may now change the classification of a medical device by administrative order instead of by regulation. Although the revised process is simpler, the FDA must still publish a proposed order in the Federal Register, hold a device classification panel meeting and consider comments from affected stakeholders before issuing the reclassification order. We cannot guarantee that the FDA will not reclassify any of our Class II devices into Class III and require us to submit a PMA for FDA review and approval of the safety and effectiveness of our products.\nAny delay in, or failure to receive or maintain, clearance or approval for our products under development could prevent us from generating revenue from these products or achieving profitability. Additionally, the FDA and other regulatory authorities have broad enforcement powers. Regulatory enforcement or inquiries, or other increased scrutiny on us, could dissuade some surgeons from using our products and adversely affect our reputation and the perceived safety and efficacy of our products.\nIn addition, even after we have obtained the proper regulatory clearance or approval to market a product, the FDA has the power to require us to conduct postmarketing studies. For example, as a condition of approval, we are required to conduct a post-approval study of Mobi-C, as well as an enhanced surveillance study. The post-approval study takes the form of continued follow-up for the existing pivotal clinical trial subjects to evaluate overall success rate over a total of seven years. This study is expected to cost approximately $1.4 million in 2015. The enhanced surveillance study is a post-market surveillance system designed primarily to identify any adverse events, device malfunctions or complaints for patients implanted with the device during the first ten years of commercial use in the United States, with an expected cost of approximately $150,000 per year. Failure to conduct required studies in a timely manner could result in the revocation of the 510(k) clearance or PMA approval for the product that is subject to such a requirement and could also result in the recall or withdrawal of the product, which would prevent us from generating sales from that product in the United States.\nIn the EEA, our medical devices must comply with the Essential Requirements laid down in Annex I to the Medical Devices Directive. Compliance with these requirements is a prerequisite to be able to affix the CE mark of conformity to our medical devices, without which they cannot be marketed or sold in the EEA. To demonstrate compliance with the Essential Requirements laid down in Annex I to the Medical Devices Directive we must undergo a conformity assessment procedure, which varies according to the type of medical device and its classification. Except for low risk medical devices (Class I with no measuring function and which are not sterile), where the manufacturer can issue an EC Declaration of Conformity based on a self-assessment of the conformity of its products with the Essential Requirements laid down in Annex I to the Medical Devices Directive, a conformity assessment procedure requires the intervention of a third party organization designated by competent authorities of a EEA country to conduct conformity assessments, or a Notified Body. The Notified Body would typically audit and examine products\u2019 Technical Files and the quality system for the manufacture, design and final inspection of the devices before issuing a CE Certificate of Conformity demonstrating compliance with the relevant Essential Requirements laid down in Annex I to the Medical Devices Directive.\nMedical device manufacturers must carry out a clinical evaluation of their medical devices to demonstrate conformity with the relevant Essential Requirements laid down in Annex I to the Medical Device Directive covering safety and performance. This clinical evaluation is part of the product\u2019s Technical File. A clinical evaluation includes an assessment of whether a medical device\u2019s performance is in accordance with its intended use, that the known and foreseeable risks linked to the use of the device under normal conditions are minimized and acceptable when weighed against the benefits of its intended purpose. The clinical evaluation conducted by the manufacturer must also address any clinical claims, the adequacy of the device labeling and information (particularly claims, contraindications, precautions/warnings) and the suitability of related Instructions for Use. This assessment must be based on clinical data, which can be obtained from (i) clinical studies conducted on the devices being assessed; (ii) scientific literature from similar devices whose equivalence with the assessed device can be demonstrated; or (iii) both clinical studies and scientific literature.\nWith respect to implantable devices or devices classified as Class III in the EEA, the manufacturer must conduct clinical studies to obtain the required clinical data, unless relying on existing clinical data from similar devices can be justified. As part of the conformity assessment process, depending on the type of devices, the Notified Body will review the manufacturer\u2019s clinical evaluation process, assess the clinical evaluation data of a representative sample of the devices\u2019 subcategory or generic group (for Class IIa and IIb devices), or assess all the clinical evaluation data, verify the manufacturer\u2019s assessment of that data and assess the validity of the clinical evaluation report and the conclusions drawn by the manufacturer (for implantable and Class III devices). The conduct of clinical studies to obtain clinical data that might be required as part of the described clinical evaluation process can be expensive and time-consuming.\nEven after we receive a CE Certificate of Conformity enabling us to affix the CE mark on our products and to sell these products in the EEA countries, a Notified Body or a competent authority may require postmarketing studies of our products. In fact, in March of 2010, the French government requested us to start such studies on our products sold in France. Failure to comply with such requests in a timely manner could result in the withdrawal of our CE Certificate of Conformity and the recall or withdrawal of the subject product from the European market, which would prevent us from generating sales for that product in Europe. Moreover, each CE Certificate of Conformity is valid for a maximum of five years, more commonly three years. At the end of each period of validity we are required to apply to the Notified Body for a renewal of the CE Certificates of Conformity. There may be delays in the renewal of the CE Certificates of Conformity or the Notified Body may require modifications to our products or to the related Technical Files before it agrees to issue the new CE Certificates of Conformity.\nOn September 26, 2012, the European Commission adopted a package of legislative proposals designed to replace the existing regulatory framework for medical devices in the EEA. These proposals are intended to strengthen the medical devices rules in the EEA countries. On October 22, 2013, the European Parliament voted in favor of an amended draft of the Regulation. The proposed text is currently being discussed by the Council of the European Union. If and when adopted the proposed new legislation may prevent or delay the CE marking of our products under development or impact our ability to modify our currently CE marked products on a timely basis.\nTo market and sell our products in other countries, we must seek and obtain regulatory approvals, certifications or registrations and comply with the laws and regulations of those countries. These laws and regulations, including the requirements for approvals, certifications or registrations and the time required for regulatory review, vary from country to country. Obtaining and maintaining foreign regulatory approvals, certifications or registrations are expensive, and we cannot be certain that we will receive regulatory approvals, certifications or registrations in any foreign country in which we plan to market our products. If we fail to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals, certifications or registrations in any foreign country in which we plan to market our products, our ability to generate revenue will be harmed.\nFailure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could jeopardize our ability to sell our products and result in enforcement actions such as:\n\u2022\nwarning letters;\n\u2022\nfines;\n\u2022\ninjunctions;\n\u2022\ncivil penalties;\n\u2022\ntermination of distribution;\n\u2022\nrecalls or seizures of products;\n\u2022\ndelays in the introduction of products into the market;\n\u2022\ntotal or partial suspension of production;\n\u2022\nrefusal of the FDA or other regulator to grant future clearances or approvals;\n\u2022\nwithdrawals or suspensions of current clearances or approvals, resulting in prohibitions on sales of our products;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal or suspension of the CE Certificates of Conformity granted by the Notified Body or delay in obtaining these certificates; and/or\n\u2022\nin the most serious cases, criminal penalties.\nAny of these sanctions could result in higher than anticipated costs or lower than anticipated sales and have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThere is no guarantee that the FDA will grant 510(k) clearance or PMA approval of our future products, and failure to obtain necessary clearances or approvals for our future products would adversely affect our ability to grow our business.\nSome of our new products will require FDA clearance of a 510(k) or FDA approval of a PMA. The FDA may not approve or clear these products for the indications that are necessary or desirable for successful commercialization. Indeed, the FDA may refuse our requests for 510(k) clearance or premarket approval of new products.\nThe FDA recently issued guidance documents intended to explain the procedures and criteria the FDA will use in assessing whether a 510(k) submission meets a minimum threshold of acceptability and should be accepted for substantive review. Under the \u201cRefuse to Accept\u201d guidance, the FDA conducts an early review against specific acceptance criteria to inform 510(k) and PMA submitters if the submission is administratively complete, or if not, to identify the missing element(s). Submitters are given the opportunity to provide the FDA with the identified information. If the information is not provided within a defined time, the submission will not be accepted for FDA review. Significant delays in receiving clearance or approval, or the failure to receive clearance or approval for our new products would have an adverse effect on our ability to expand our business.\nModifications to our products may require new 510(k) clearances or premarket approvals, or may require us to cease marketing or recall the modified products until clearances are obtained.\nAny modification to a 510(k)-cleared device that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness, including significant design and manufacturing changes, or that would constitute a major change in its intended use, design or manufacture, requires a new 510(k) clearance or, possibly, approval of a PMA. The FDA requires every manufacturer to make this determination in the first instance, but the FDA may review any manufacturer\u2019s decision. The FDA may not agree with our decisions regarding whether new clearances or approvals are necessary. We have modified some of our 510(k) cleared products, and have determined based on our review of the applicable FDA guidance that in certain instances the changes did not require new 510(k) clearances or PMA approval. If the FDA disagrees with our determination and requires us to seek new 510(k) clearances or PMA approval for modifications to our previously cleared products for which we have concluded that new clearances or approvals are unnecessary, we may be required to cease marketing or distribution of our products or to recall the modified product until we obtain clearance or approval, and we may be subject to significant regulatory fines or penalties.\nFurthermore, potential changes to the 510(k) program may make it more difficult for us to make modifications to our previously cleared products, by either imposing stricter requirements on when a new 510(k) clearance for a modification to a previously cleared product must be submitted, or applying more onerous review criteria to such submissions. In July and December 2011, respectively, the FDA issued draft guidance documents addressing when to submit a new 510(k) clearance due to modifications to 510(k)-cleared products and the criteria for evaluating substantial equivalence. The guidance related to criteria for evaluating substantial equivalence was finalized in July 2014. The July 2011 draft guidance document related to modifications to 510(k)-cleared products was ultimately withdrawn as the result of FDASIA. As a result, the FDA\u2019s original guidance document regarding 510(k) modifications, which dates back to 1997, remains in place. It is uncertain when the FDA will seek to issue new guidance on product modifications. Any efforts to do so could result in a more rigorous review process and make it more difficult to obtain clearance for device modifications.\nIn the EEA, we must inform the Notified Body that carried out the conformity assessment of the medical devices we market or sell in the EEA of any planned substantial changes to our quality system or changes to our devices which could affect compliance with the Essential Requirements laid down in Annex I to the Medical Devices Directive or the devices\u2019 intended purpose. The Notified Body will then assess the changes and verify whether they affect the products\u2019 conformity with the Essential Requirements laid down in Annex I to the Medical Devices Directive or the conditions for the use of the device. If the assessment is favorable, the Notified Body will issue a new CE Certificate of Conformity or an addendum to the existing CE Certificate of Conformity attesting compliance with the Essential Requirements laid down in Annex I to the Medical Devices Directive. If it is not, we may not be able to continue to market and sell the product in the EEA.\nWe may fail to obtain or maintain foreign regulatory approvals to market our products in other countries.\nWe currently market our products internationally and intend to expand our international marketing. International jurisdictions require separate regulatory approvals and compliance with numerous and varying regulatory requirements. For example, outside of the United States and the EEA, we intend to continue to seek regulatory clearance to market our primary products in China, Brazil, Japan, South Korea and other key markets. The approval procedures vary among countries and may involve requirements for additional testing, and the time required to obtain approval may differ from country to country and from that required to obtain clearance or approval in the United States and the necessary CE Certificates of Conformity in the EEA countries.\nClearance or approval in the United States and/or a CE Certificate of Conformity in the EEA countries does not ensure approval or certification by regulatory authorities in other countries or jurisdictions, and approval or certification by one foreign regulatory authority does not ensure approval or certification by regulatory authorities in other foreign countries or by the FDA. The foreign regulatory approval or certification process may include all of the risks associated with obtaining FDA clearance or approval. In addition, some countries only approve or certify a product for a certain period of time, and we are\nrequired to re-approve or re-certify our products in a timely manner prior to the expiration of our prior approval or certification. We may not obtain foreign regulatory approvals on a timely basis, if at all. We may not be able to file for regulatory approvals or certifications and may not receive necessary approvals to commercialize our products in any market. If we fail to receive necessary approvals or certifications to commercialize our products in foreign jurisdictions on a timely basis, or at all, or if we fail to have our products re-approved or re-certified, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nThese and other factors may have a material adverse effect on our international operations or on our business, results of operations and financial condition generally.\nIf we or our suppliers fail to comply with ongoing EEA and FDA or other foreign regulatory authority requirements, or if we experience unanticipated problems with our products, these products could be subject to restrictions or withdrawal from the market.\nAny product for which we obtain clearance or approval, and the manufacturing processes, reporting requirements, post-approval clinical data and promotional activities for such product, will be subject to continued regulatory review, oversight and periodic inspections by the FDA and other domestic and foreign regulatory bodies. In particular, we and our third-party suppliers are required to comply with the FDA\u2019s Quality System Regulation, or QSR. In the EEA countries, compliance with harmonized standards is also recommended as this is interpreted as a presumption of conformity with the relevant Essential Requirements laid down in Annex I to the Medical Devices Directive or the quality system requirements laid down in the other Annexes to the Directive. These FDA regulations and EU standards cover the methods and documentation of the design, testing, production, control, quality assurance, labeling, packaging, sterilization, storage and shipping of our products. Compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is monitored rigorously through periodic inspections by the FDA. Compliance with harmonized standards in the EEA is also subject to regular review through the conduct of inspection by Notified Bodies or other certification bodies. If we, or our manufacturers, fail to adhere to QSR requirements in the United States or other harmonized standards in the EEA, this could delay production of our products and lead to fines, difficulties in obtaining regulatory clearances, CE Certificate of Conformity, recalls, enforcement actions, including injunctive relief or consent decrees, or other consequences, which could, in turn, have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition, the FDA audits compliance with the QSR through periodic announced and unannounced inspections of manufacturing and other facilities. The failure by us or one of our suppliers to comply with applicable statutes and regulations administered by the FDA, or the failure to timely and adequately respond to any adverse inspectional observations or product safety issues, could result in any of the following enforcement actions:\n\u2022\nuntitled letters, warning letters, fines, injunctions, consent decrees and civil penalties;\n\u2022\nunanticipated expenditures to address or defend such actions;\n\u2022\ncustomer notifications or repair, replacement, refunds, recall, detention or seizure of our products;\n\u2022\noperating restrictions or partial suspension or total shutdown of production;\n\u2022\nrefusing or delaying our requests for 510(k) clearance or premarket approval of new products or modified products;\n\u2022\nwithdrawing 510(k) clearances or PMA approvals that have already been granted;\n\u2022\nrefusal to grant export approval for our products; or\n\u2022\ncriminal prosecution.\nAny of these sanctions could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, our key component suppliers may not currently be or may not continue to be in compliance with all applicable regulatory requirements, which could result in our failure to produce our products on a timely basis and in the required quantities, if at all.\nOutside the EEA and the United States our products and operations are also often required to comply with standards set by foreign regulatory bodies, and those standards, types of evaluation and scope of review differ among foreign regulatory bodies. We intend to comply with the standards enforced by such foreign regulatory bodies as needed to commercialize our products. If we fail to comply with any of these standards adequately, a foreign regulatory body may take adverse actions similar to those within the power of a Notified Body or competent authority or the FDA. Any such action may harm our reputation and business, and could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf our products, or malfunction of our products, cause or contribute to a death or a serious injury, we will be subject to medical device reporting regulations, which can result in voluntary corrective actions or agency enforcement actions.\nUnder the FDA medical device reporting regulations, medical device manufacturers are required to report to the FDA information that a device has or may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or has malfunctioned in a way that would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction of the device or one of our similar devices were to recur. All manufacturers placing medical devices in the market in the EEA are legally bound to report any serious or potentially serious incidents involving devices they produce or sell to the competent authority in whose jurisdiction the incident occurred. Were this to happen to us, the relevant competent authority would file an initial report, and there would then be a further inspection or assessment if there were particular issues. Either this would be carried out either by the competent authority or it could require that the Notified Body carry out the inspection or assessment.\nAny such adverse event involving our products could result in future voluntary corrective actions, such as recalls or customer notifications, or agency action, such as inspection or enforcement action. Adverse events involving our products have been reported to us in the past, and we cannot guarantee that they will not occur in the future. Any corrective action, whether voluntary or involuntary, will require the dedication of our time and capital, distract management from operating our business and may harm our reputation and financial results.\nIn the EEA, we must comply with the EU Medical Device Vigilance System. Under this system, incidents must be reported to the relevant authorities of the EEA countries, and manufacturers are required to take Field Safety Corrective Actions, or FSCAs, to reduce a risk of death or serious deterioration in the state of health associated with the use of a medical device that is already placed on the market. An incident is defined as any malfunction or deterioration in the characteristics and/or performance of a device, as well as any inadequacy in the labeling or the instructions for use which, directly or indirectly, might lead to or might have led to the death of a patient or user or of other persons or to a serious deterioration in their state of health. An FSCA may include the recall, modification, exchange, destruction or retrofitting of the device. FSCAs must be communicated by the manufacturer or its European Authorized Representative to its customers and/or to the end users of the device through Field Safety Notices.\nOur products may in the future be subject to product recalls. A recall of our products, either voluntarily or at the direction of the FDA or another governmental authority, or the discovery of serious safety issues with our products, could have a significant adverse impact on us.\nThe FDA and similar foreign governmental authorities have the authority to require the recall of commercialized products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture. In this case, the FDA, the authority to require a recall must be based on an FDA finding that there is reasonable probability that the device would cause serious injury or death. In addition, foreign governmental bodies have the authority to require the recall of our products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture. Manufacturers may, under their own initiative, recall a product if any material deficiency in a device is found. The FDA requires that certain classifications of recalls be reported to the FDA within 10 working days after the recall is initiated. A government-mandated or voluntary recall by us or one of our international distributors could occur as a result of an unacceptable risk to health, component failures, malfunctions, manufacturing errors, design or labeling defects or other deficiencies and issues. Recalls of any of our products would divert managerial and financial resources and have an adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations and financial condition, which could impair our ability to produce our products in a cost-effective and timely manner in order to meet our customers\u2019 demands. We may also be subject to liability claims, be required to bear other costs, or take other actions that may have a negative impact on our future sales and our ability to generate profits. Companies are required to maintain certain records of recalls, even if they are not reportable to the FDA or another third country competent authority. We may initiate voluntary recalls involving our products in the future that we determine do not require notification of the FDA or another third country competent authority. If the FDA, another third country competent authority or our Notified Body disagrees with our determinations, they could require us to report those actions as recalls. A future recall announcement could harm our reputation with customers and negatively affect our sales. In addition, the FDA or another third country competent authority could take enforcement action for failing to report the recalls when they were conducted.\nFurther, under the FDA\u2019s medical device reporting, or MDR, regulations, we are required to report to the FDA any incident in which our product may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or in which our product malfunctioned and, if the malfunction were to recur, would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury. Repeated product malfunctions may result in a voluntary or involuntary product recall, which could divert managerial and financial resources, impair our ability to manufacture our products in a cost-effective and timely manner, and have an adverse effect on our reputation, results of operations and financial condition. We are also required to follow detailed recordkeeping requirements for all firm-initiated medical device corrections and removals, and to report such corrective and removal actions to FDA if they are carried out in response to a risk to health and have not otherwise been reported under the MDR regulations. In addition, in October 2014, the FDA issued guidance intended to assist the FDA and industry in distinguishing medical device recalls from product\nenhancements. Per the guidance, if any change or group of changes to a device addresses a violation of the FDCA, that change would generally constitute a medical device recall and require submission of a recall report to the FDA.\nIf the third parties on which we rely to conduct our clinical trials and to assist us with pre-clinical development do not perform as contractually required or expected, we may not be able to obtain regulatory clearance, approval or a CE Certificate of Conformity for or commercialize our products.\nWe rely on third parties, such as contract research organizations, medical institutions, clinical investigators and contract laboratories to conduct some of our clinical trials and prepare our PMA submissions. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or regulatory obligations or meet expected deadlines, if these third parties need to be replaced, or if the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our clinical protocols or regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our pre-clinical development activities or clinical trials may be extended, delayed, suspended or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval or a CE Certificate of Conformity for, or successfully commercialize, our products on a timely basis, if at all, and our business, operating results and prospects may be adversely affected. Furthermore, our third-party clinical trial investigators may be delayed in conducting our clinical trials for reasons outside of their control.\nThe results of our clinical trials may not support our product candidate claims or may result in the discovery of adverse side effects.\nOur ongoing research and development, pre-clinical testing and clinical trial activities are subject to extensive regulation and review by numerous governmental authorities both in the United States and abroad. We are currently conducting pre-and post-market clinical studies of some of our products to gather information about these products\u2019 safety, efficacy or optimal use. In the future we may conduct clinical trials to support approval of new products. Clinical studies must be conducted in compliance with FDA regulations or the FDA may take enforcement action. The data collected from these clinical studies may ultimately be used to support market clearance for these products. Even if our clinical trials are completed as planned, we cannot be certain that their results will support our product candidate claims or that the FDA or foreign authorities and Notified Bodies will agree with our conclusions regarding them. Success in pre-clinical studies and early clinical trials does not ensure that later clinical trials will be successful, and we cannot be sure that the later trials will replicate the results of prior trials and pre-clinical studies. The clinical trial process may fail to demonstrate that our product candidates are safe and effective for the proposed indicated uses, which could cause us to abandon a product candidate and may delay development of others. Any delay or termination of our clinical trials will delay the filing of our product submissions and, ultimately, our ability to commercialize our product candidates and generate revenues. It is also possible that patients enrolled in clinical trials will experience adverse side effects that are not currently part of the product candidate\u2019s profile.\nWe may be subject to enforcement action if we engage in improper marketing or promotion of our products.\nOur promotional materials and training methods must comply with FDA and other applicable laws and regulations, including the prohibition of the promotion of unapproved, or off-label, use. Surgeons may use our products off-label, as the FDA does not restrict or regulate a surgeon\u2019s choice of treatment within the practice of medicine. However, if the FDA determines that our promotional materials or training constitutes promotion of an off-label use, it could request that we modify our training or promotional materials or subject us to regulatory or enforcement actions, including the issuance of an untitled letter, a warning letter, injunction, seizure, civil fine or criminal penalties. It is also possible that other federal, state or foreign enforcement authorities might take action if they consider our promotional or training materials to constitute promotion of an off-label use, which could result in significant fines or penalties under other statutory authorities, such as laws prohibiting false claims for reimbursement. In that event, our reputation could be damaged and adoption of the products could be impaired. Although our policy is to refrain from statements that could be considered off-label promotion of our products, the FDA or another regulatory agency could disagree and conclude that we have engaged in off-label promotion. In addition, the off-label use of our products may increase the risk of product liability claims. Product liability claims are expensive to defend and could divert our management\u2019s attention, result in substantial damage awards against us, and harm our reputation.\nFurther, the advertising and promotion of our products is subject to EEA Member States laws implementing the Medical Devices Directive, Directive 2006/114/EC concerning misleading and comparative advertising, and Directive 2005/29/EC on unfair commercial practices, as well as other EEA Member State legislation governing the advertising and promotion of medical devices. In addition, we are subject to EU and national Codes of Conduct. These laws and Codes of Conduct may limit or restrict the advertising and promotion of our products to the general public and may impose limitations on our promotional activities with healthcare professionals.\nIf we or our sales representatives fail to comply with U.S. federal and state fraud and abuse laws, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties, which could adversely impact our reputation and business operations.\nThere are numerous U.S. federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including anti-kickback laws and physician self-referral laws. Our relationships with surgeons, hospitals, group purchasing organizations and our international distributors are subject to scrutiny under these laws. Violations of these laws are punishable by criminal and civil sanctions, including significant monetary penalties and, in some instances, imprisonment and exclusion from participation in federal and state healthcare programs, including the Medicare, Medicaid and Veterans Administration health programs.\nHealthcare fraud and abuse regulations are complex, and even minor irregularities can potentially give rise to claims that a statute or prohibition has been violated. The laws that may affect our ability to operate include:\n\u2022\nthe federal Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons from knowingly and willfully soliciting, receiving, offering, or paying remuneration, directly or indirectly, in exchange for or to induce either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, order or recommendation of, any good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid;\n\u2022\nthe federal False Claims Act, which prohibits, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, claims for payment from Medicare, Medicaid or other third-party payors that are false or fraudulent;\n\u2022\nthe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, as amended, which created federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;\n\u2022\nthe Federal Trade Commission Act and similar laws regulating advertisement and consumer protections;\n\u2022\nthe federal Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1997, which prohibits corrupt payments, gifts or transfers of value to foreign officials; and\n\u2022\nforeign and/or U.S. state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws, such as anti-kickback and false claims laws which may apply to items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including commercial insurers.\nFurther, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or, collectively, the PPACA, among other things, amends the intent requirements of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute and the criminal statute governing healthcare fraud. A person or entity can now be found guilty of violating the Anti-Kickback Statute and the federal criminal healthcare fraud statute without actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the PPACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the federal False Claims Act or federal civil money penalties statute. Possible sanctions for violation of laws include monetary fines, civil and criminal penalties, exclusion from Medicare and Medicaid programs and forfeiture of amounts collected in violation of such prohibitions. Moreover, while we do not submit claims and our customers make the ultimate decision on how to submit claims, from time-to-time, we may provide reimbursement guidance to our customers. If a government authority were to conclude that we provided improper advice to our customers and/or encouraged the submission of false claims for reimbursement, we could face action against us by government authorities. Any violations of these laws, or any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could result in a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe have entered into consulting agreements and royalty agreements with surgeons, including some who order and use our products in procedures they perform. While these transactions were structured to comply with all applicable laws, including state and federal anti-kickback laws, to the extent applicable, regulatory agencies may view these transactions as prohibited arrangements that must be restructured, or discontinued, or for which we could be subject to other significant penalties, including debarment. We could be adversely affected if regulatory agencies interpret our financial relationships with spine surgeons who order our products to be in violation of applicable laws. This could subject us to civil and criminal penalties for non-compliance, the cost of which could be substantial.\nBecause of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the statutory exceptions and safe harbors available under the federal Anti-Kickback Statue, it is possible that some of our business activities, including our relationship with surgeons, hospitals, group purchasing organizations and our independent distributors, could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws.\nTo enforce compliance with the federal laws, the U.S. Department of Justice, or DOJ, has recently increased its scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry. Dealing with investigations can be time- and resource-consuming and can divert management\u2019s attention from the business. Additionally, settlements with the DOJ or other law enforcement agencies have forced healthcare providers to agree to additional onerous compliance and reporting requirements as part of a consent\ndecree or corporate integrity agreement. Any such investigation or settlement could increase our costs or otherwise have an adverse effect on our business.\nIn certain cases, federal and state authorities pursue actions for false claims on the basis that manufacturers and distributors are promoting off-label uses of their products. Pursuant to FDA regulations, we can only market our products for cleared or approved uses. Although surgeons are permitted to use medical devices for indications other than those cleared or approved by the FDA, we are prohibited from promoting products for off-label uses. We market our products and provide promotional materials and training programs to surgeons regarding the use of our products. If it is determined that our marketing, promotional materials or training programs constitute promotion of unapproved uses, we could be subject to significant fines in addition to regulatory enforcement actions, including the issuance of a warning letter, injunction, seizure and criminal penalty.\nOn February 8, 2013, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, released its final rule implementing certain provisions of the PPACA that impose new reporting requirements on device manufacturers for payments by them and in some cases their distributors to physicians and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians (commonly known as the Physician Payment Sunshine Act). Failure to submit required information may result in civil monetary penalties of up to an aggregate of $150,000 per year (or up to an aggregate of $1 million per year for \u201cknowing failures\u201d), for all payments, transfers of value or ownership or investment interests that are not timely, accurately and completely reported in an annual submission.\nThe system for reporting is called \u201cOpen Payments\u201d and does apply to medical device manufacturers. 2014 was the first year for reporting under the Open Payments system. Going forward, device manufacturers must submit reports by the 90th day of each calendar year. Due to the difficulty in complying with Physician Payment Sunshine Act and the nature of our U.S. sales force concentrated with independent sales agencies, we cannot assure you that we will successfully report all transfers of value by us and our independent sales agencies, and any failure to comply could result in significant fines and penalties.\nIn addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians. Some states, such as California, Massachusetts and Nevada, mandate implementation of commercial compliance programs, while other states, such as Massachusetts and Vermont, impose restrictions on device manufacturer marketing practices and tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians. A similar trend is observed in foreign jurisdictions such as France. In France, companies working in the health sector are required to publicly disclose direct or indirect benefits granted to, and agreements entered into with, physicians and other healthcare professionals. The shifting commercial compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with different compliance and/or reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions increase the possibility that a healthcare company may run afoul of one or more of the requirements.\nAlthough compliance programs can mitigate the risk of investigation and prosecution for violations of these laws, the risks cannot be entirely eliminated. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business.\nMost of these laws apply to not only the actions taken by us, but also actions taken by our distributors. We have limited knowledge and control over the business practices of our distributors, and we may face regulatory action against us as a result of their actions which could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, the scope and enforcement of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform, especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations. Federal or state regulatory authorities might challenge our current or future activities under these laws. Any such challenge could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition. Any state or federal regulatory review of us, regardless of the outcome, would be costly and time-consuming. Additionally, we cannot predict the impact of any changes in these laws, whether or not retroactive.\nSimilar laws are increasingly being introduced in the individual EEA countries. The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians to induce or encourage the prescription, recommendation, endorsement, purchase, supply, order or use of medical devices is prohibited. The provision of benefits or advantages to physicians is also governed by the national antibribery laws of the EEA countries. One such example is the UK Bribery Act 2010. Payments made to physicians in certain EEA countries must also be publically disclosed. Moreover, agreements with physicians must often be the subject of prior notification and approval by the physician\u2019s employer, his/her competent professional organization, and/or the competent authorities of the EEA countries. These requirements are provided in the national laws, industry codes, or professional codes of conduct applicable in the EEA countries. Failure to comply with these requirements could result in reputational risk, public reprimands, administrative penalties, fines or imprisonment.\nLegislative or regulatory healthcare reforms may make it more difficult and costly for us to obtain regulatory clearance, CE Certificates of Conformity or approval of our products and to produce, market and distribute our products after clearance, CE Certificate of Conformity or approval is obtained.\nRecent political, economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry to fundamental changes. The sales of our products depend in part on the availability of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payors such as government health programs, private health insurers, health maintenance organizations and other healthcare-related organizations. Both the federal and state governments in the United States and foreign governments continue to propose and pass new legislation and regulations designed to contain or reduce the cost of healthcare. Such legislation and regulations may result in decreased reimbursement for medical devices and/or the procedures in which they are used, which may further exacerbate industry-wide pressure to reduce the prices charged for medical devices. This could harm our ability to market our products and generate sales.\nIn addition, FDA regulations and guidance are often revised or reinterpreted by the FDA in ways that may significantly affect our business and our products. Any new regulations or revisions or reinterpretations of existing regulations may impose additional costs or lengthen review times of our products. Delays in receipt of, or failure to receive, regulatory clearances or approvals for our new products would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFederal and state governments in the United States have recently enacted legislation to overhaul the nation\u2019s healthcare system. While the goal of healthcare reform is to expand coverage to more individuals, it also involves increased government price controls, additional regulatory mandates and other measures designed to constrain medical costs. The PPACA significantly impacts the medical device industry. Among other things, the PPACA:\n\u2022\nimposes an annual excise tax of 2.3% on any entity that manufactures or imports medical devices offered for sale in the United States (described in more detail below);\n\u2022\nestablishes a new Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute to oversee and identify priorities in comparative clinical effectiveness research in an effort to coordinate and develop such research;\n\u2022\nimplements payment system reforms including a national pilot program on payment bundling to encourage hospitals, physicians and other providers to improve the coordination, quality and efficiency of certain healthcare services through bundled payment models; and\n\u2022\ncreates an independent payment advisory board that will submit recommendations to reduce Medicare spending if projected Medicare spending exceeds a specified growth rate.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the PPACA was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the President signed into law the Budget Control Act of 2011, which, among other things, created the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to recommend to Congress proposals in spending reductions. The Joint Select Committee did not achieve a targeted deficit reduction of at least $1.2 trillion for the years 2013 through 2021, triggering the legislation\u2019s automatic reduction to several government programs. This includes reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year. On January 2, 2013, President Obama signed into law the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, or the ATRA, which delayed for another two months the budget cuts mandated by these sequestration provisions of the Budget Control Act of 2011. On March 1, 2013, the President signed an executive order implementing sequestration, and on April 1, 2013, the 2% Medicare payment reductions went into effect. The ATRA also, among other things, reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals, imaging centers and cancer treatment centers and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years. We expect that additional state and federal healthcare reform measures will be adopted in the future, any of which could limit the amounts that federal and state governments will pay for healthcare products and services, which could result in reduced demand for our products or additional pricing pressure.\nOn September 26, 2012, the European Commission adopted a package of legislative proposals designed to replace the existing regulatory framework for medical devices in the EEA. These proposals are intended to strengthen extsing medical device rules in the EEA. On 22 October 2013, the European Parliament voted an amended draft of the Regulation. The proposed text is currently being discussed by the Council of the European Union. If and when adopted the proposed new legislation may prevent or delay the CE marking of our products under development or impact our ability to modify our currently CE marked products on a timely basis.\nRisks Related to our Financial Results and Need for Financing\nOur quarterly revenue and operating results are unpredictable and may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter due to factors outside our control, which could adversely affect our business, consolidated financial statements and the trading price of our common stock.\nOur revenue and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year due to a number of factors, many of which are outside of our control and any of which may cause our stock price to fluctuate. Our sales and results of operations will be affected by numerous factors, including:\n\u2022\nour ability to drive increased sales of our cervical technology products and our lumbar technology products;\n\u2022\nour ability to establish and maintain an effective and dedicated sales organization, including independent sales agencies and distributors;\n\u2022\npricing pressure applicable to our products, including adverse third-party coverage and reimbursement outcomes;\n\u2022\nresults of clinical research and trials on our existing products and products in development;\n\u2022\nthe mix of our products sold because profit margins differ amongst our products;\n\u2022\ntiming of new product offerings, acquisitions, licenses or other significant events by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our suppliers to timely provide us with an adequate supply of products;\n\u2022\nthe evolving product offerings of our competitors;\n\u2022\nregulatory approvals and legislative changes affecting the products we may offer or those of our competitors;\n\u2022\ninterruption in the manufacturing or distribution of our products;\n\u2022\nthe effect of competing technological, industry and market developments;\n\u2022\nchanges in our ability to obtain regulatory clearance or approval for our products or to obtain or maintain our CE Certificates of Conformity for our products; and\n\u2022\nour ability to expand the geographic reach of our sales and marketing efforts.\nMany of the products we may seek to develop and introduce in the future will require FDA approval or clearance before commercialization in the United States, and commercialization of such products outside of the United States would likely require additional regulatory approvals, CE Certificates of Conformity and import licenses. As a result, it will be difficult for us to forecast demand for these products with any degree of certainty. In addition, we will be increasing our operating expenses as we expand our commercial capabilities. Accordingly, we may experience significant, unanticipated quarterly losses. If our quarterly or annual operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts, the price of our common stock could decline substantially. Furthermore, any quarterly or annual fluctuations in our operating results may, in turn, cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially. We believe that quarterly comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of our future performance.\nWe might require additional capital to support business growth, and this capital might not be available on terms favorable to us or at all.\nWe intend to continue to make investments to support our business growth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges, including the need to develop new technologies or enhance our existing technologies and platform, upgrade our operating infrastructure and acquire complementary businesses and technologies. Accordingly, we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock. Any debt financing obtained by us in the future would likely be senior to our common stock, would likely cause us to incur interest expenses, and could involve restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may increase our expenses and make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. We may also be required to secure any such debt obligations with some or all of our assets. In addition, we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. It is also possible that we may allocate significant amounts of capital toward solutions or technologies for which market demand is lower than anticipated and, as a result, abandon such efforts. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, or if we expend capital on projects that are not successful, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges could be significantly limited, or we may even have to scale back our operations. Any of these negative developments could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, financial condition and common stock price.\nContinuing worldwide economic instability, including challenges faced by the Eurozone countries, could adversely affect our revenues, financial condition or results of operations.\nSince fiscal year 2008, the global economy has been impacted by the sequential effects of an ongoing global financial crisis. This global financial crisis, including the European sovereign debt crisis, has caused extreme disruption in the financial markets, including severely diminished liquidity and credit availability. Substantially all of our suppliers are located in Europe, and many of our distribution agreements outside of the United States are denominated in Euros. There can be no assurance that there will not be further deterioration in the global economy and in Europe. Our customers and suppliers may experience financial difficulties or be unable to borrow money to fund their operations, which may adversely impact their ability to purchase our products or to pay for our products on a timely basis, if at all. As with our customers and suppliers, these economic conditions make it more difficult for us to accurately forecast and plan our future business activities. In light of the current economic state of many countries outside the United States, we continue to monitor their creditworthiness. Failure to receive payment of all or a significant portion of these receivables could adversely affect our results of operations. Further, there are concerns for the overall stability and suitability of the Euro as a single currency, given the economic and political challenges facing individual Eurozone countries. Continuing deterioration in the creditworthiness of the Eurozone countries, the withdrawal of one or more member countries from the EU, or the failure of the Euro as a common European currency could adversely affect our revenues, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur existing revolving credit facility contains restrictive covenants that may limit our operating flexibility.\nOur existing revolving credit facility contains certain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to transfer or dispose of assets, merge with other companies or consummate certain changes of control, acquire other companies, pay dividends, incur additional indebtedness and liens, experience changes in management and enter into new businesses. We therefore may not be able to engage in any of the foregoing transactions unless we obtain the consent of the lender or terminate the revolving credit facility. There is no guarantee that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow or sales to meet the financial covenants or pay the principal and interest on any such debt. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that future working capital, borrowings or equity financing will be available to repay or refinance any such debt.\nRisks Related to our Intellectual Property and Potential Litigation\nIf we are unable to protect our intellectual property rights, our competitive position could be harmed or we could be required to incur significant expenses to enforce our rights.\nWe rely primarily on patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret laws, know-how and continuing technological innovation, as well as confidentiality and non-disclosure agreements and other methods, to protect our proprietary technologies and know-how. However, these legal means afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or permit us to gain or keep any competitive advantage. As of December 31, 2014, we owned nearly 400 issued patents globally, of which 33 were issued U.S. patents. As of December 31, 2014, we owned over 100 patent applications pending globally, of which 31 were patent applications pending in the United States. Our issued patents expire between 2020 and 2032, subject to payment of required maintenance fees, annuities and other charges. As of December 31, 2014, we also owned 15 U.S. trademark registrations and 62 foreign trademark registrations, as well as 5 pending U.S. trademark registrations and 10 pending foreign trademark registrations.\nWe have applied for patent protection relating to certain existing and proposed products and processes. While we generally apply for patents in those countries where we intend to make, have made, use or sell patented products, we may not accurately predict all of the countries where patent protection will ultimately be desirable. If we fail to timely file a patent application in any such country, we may be precluded from doing so at a later date. Furthermore, we cannot assure you that any of our patent applications will issue as patents. The rights granted to us under our patents, including prospective rights sought in our pending patent applications, may not be meaningful or provide us with any commercial advantage and they could be opposed, contested or circumvented by our competitors or be declared invalid or unenforceable in judicial or administrative proceedings. In addition, our pending patent applications include claims to material aspects of our products and procedures that are not currently protected by issued patents. The process of applying for patent protection itself is time consuming and expensive. The failure of our patents to protect our technology adequately might make it easier for our competitors to offer the same or similar products or technologies. Competitors may be able to design around our patents or develop products that provide outcomes that are comparable to ours without infringing on our intellectual property rights.\nWe have entered into confidentiality agreements and intellectual property assignment agreements with many of our officers, employees, consultants and advisors regarding our intellectual property and proprietary technology. In the event of unauthorized use or disclosure or other breaches of such agreements, we may not be provided with meaningful protection for our intellectual property and proprietary technology.\nDue to differences between foreign and U.S. patent laws, our patented intellectual property rights may not receive the same degree of protection in foreign countries as they would in the United States. Even if patents are granted outside the United States, effective enforcement in those countries may not be available, and the scope of protection may vary significantly from\ncountry to country. We have filed patent applications only in the United States, some countries in Europe and less than a dozen other countries, and we therefore lack any patent protection in all other countries. In countries where we do not have significant patent protection, we may not be able to stop a competitor from marketing products in such countries that are the same as or similar to our products.\nWe rely on our trademarks, trade names and brand names to distinguish our products from the products of our competitors, and have registered or applied to register many of these trademarks. We cannot assure you that our trademark applications will be approved. Third parties may also oppose our trademark applications, or otherwise challenge our use of the trademarks. In the event that our trademarks are successfully challenged, we could be forced to rebrand our products, which could result in loss of brand recognition, and could require us to devote resources to advertising and marketing new brands. Further, we cannot assure you that competitors will not infringe upon our trademarks, or that we will have adequate resources to enforce our trademarks.\nIf a competitor infringes one of our patents, trademarks or other intellectual property rights, enforcing those patents, trademarks and other rights may be difficult, time consuming or unsuccessful. Even if successful, litigation to defend our patents and trademarks against challenges or enforce our intellectual property rights could be expensive and time consuming and could divert management\u2019s attention from managing our business. Litigation to defend our patents and trademarks against challenges or enforce our intellectual property rights could provoke significant retaliatory litigation, which could be costly, result in the diversion of management\u2019s time and efforts, require us to pay damages and other amounts or prevent us from marketing our existing or future products. Moreover, we may not have sufficient resources or desire to defend our patents or trademarks against challenges or to enforce our intellectual property rights.\nThe medical device industry is characterized by patent litigation and we could become subject to litigation that could be costly, result in the diversion of management\u2019s time and efforts, require us to pay damages or prevent us from marketing our existing or future products.\nOur commercial success will depend in part on not infringing the patents or violating the other proprietary rights of others. Significant litigation regarding patent rights occurs in our industry. Our competitors in both the United States and abroad, many of which have substantially greater resources and have made substantial investments in patent portfolios and competing technologies, may have applied for or obtained or may in the future apply for and obtain, patents that will prevent, limit or otherwise interfere with our ability to make, use and sell our products. Generally, we do not conduct independent reviews of patents issued to third parties. In addition, patent applications in the United States and elsewhere can be pending for many years before issuance, so there may be applications of others now pending of which we are unaware that may later result in issued patents that will prevent, limit or otherwise interfere with our ability to make, use or sell our products. The large number of patents, the rapid rate of new patent applications and issuances, the complexities of the technology involved and the uncertainty of litigation increase the risk of business assets and management\u2019s attention being diverted to patent litigation. We have received in the past, and expect to receive in the future, particularly as a public company, communications from various industry participants alleging our infringement of their patents, trade secrets or other intellectual property rights and/or offering licenses to such intellectual property. Any lawsuits resulting from such allegations could subject us to significant liability for damages and invalidate our proprietary rights. Any potential intellectual property litigation also could force us to do one or more of the following:\n\u2022\nstop making, selling or using products or technologies that allegedly infringe the asserted intellectual property;\n\u2022\nlose the opportunity to license our technology to others or to collect royalty payments based upon successful protection and assertion of our intellectual property rights against others;\n\u2022\nincur significant legal expenses;\n\u2022\npay substantial damages or royalties to the party whose intellectual property rights we may be found to be infringing;\n\u2022\npay the attorney fees and costs of litigation to the party whose intellectual property rights we may be found to be infringing;\n\u2022\nredesign those products that contain the allegedly infringing intellectual property, which could be costly, disruptive and/or infeasible; or\n\u2022\nattempt to obtain a license to the relevant intellectual property from third parties, which may not be available on reasonable terms or at all.\nAny litigation or claim against us, even those without merit, may cause us to incur substantial costs, and could place a significant strain on our financial resources, divert the attention of management from our core business and harm our reputation. Further, as the number of participants in the spine industry grows, the possibility of intellectual property infringement claims against us increases. If we are found to infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties, we could be required to pay substantial damages (which may be increased up to three times of awarded damages) and/or substantial royalties and could be prevented from selling our products unless we obtain a license or are able to redesign our products to avoid infringement. Any such license may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all, and there can be no assurance that we\nwould be able to redesign our products in a way that would not infringe the intellectual property rights of others. If we fail to obtain any required licenses or make any necessary changes to our products or technologies, we may have to withdraw existing products from the market or may be unable to commercialize one or more of our products, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, we generally indemnify our customers and international distributors with respect to infringement by our products of the proprietary rights of third parties. Third parties may assert infringement claims against our customers or distributors. These claims may require us to initiate or defend protracted and costly litigation on behalf of our customers or distributors, regardless of the merits of these claims. If any of these claims succeed, we may be forced to pay damages on behalf of our customers or distributors or may be required to obtain licenses for the products they use. If we cannot obtain all necessary licenses on commercially reasonable terms, our customers may be forced to stop using our products.\nWe may be subject to damages resulting from claims that we, our employees, our independent sales agencies or our international distributors have wrongfully used or disclosed alleged trade secrets of our competitors or are in breach of non-competition or non-solicitation agreements with our competitors.\nMany of our employees were previously employed at other medical device companies, including our competitors or potential competitors, in some cases until recently. Many of our independent sales agencies and distributors sell, or in the past have sold, products of our competitors. We may be subject to claims that we, our employees or our independent sales agencies and distributors have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed alleged trade secrets or other proprietary information of these former employers or competitors. In addition, we have been and may in the future be subject to claims that we caused an employee to breach the terms of his or her non-competition or non-solicitation agreement. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims. Even if we are successful in defending against these claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and could be a distraction to management. If our defense to those claims fails, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Any litigation or the threat thereof may adversely affect our ability to hire employees or contract with independent sales representatives. A loss of key personnel or their work product could hamper or prevent our ability to commercialize product candidates, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf product liability lawsuits are brought against us, our business may be harmed, and we may be required to pay damages that exceed our insurance coverage.\nOur business exposes us to potential product liability claims that are inherent in the testing, manufacture and sale of medical devices for spine surgery procedures. Spine surgery involves significant risk of serious complications, including bleeding, nerve injury, paralysis and even death. Furthermore, if spine surgeons are not sufficiently trained in the use of our products, they may misuse or ineffectively use our products, which may result in unsatisfactory patient outcomes or patient injury. We could become the subject of product liability lawsuits alleging that component failures, malfunctions, manufacturing flaws, design defects or inadequate disclosure of product-related risks or product-related information resulted in an unsafe condition or injury to patients.\nWe have had, and continue to have, a small number of product liability claims relating to our products, none of which either individually, or in the aggregate, have resulted, or do we believe will result, in a material negative impact on our business. In the future, we may be subject to additional product liability claims, some of which may have a negative impact on our business.\nRegardless of the merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in:\n\u2022\ndecreased demand for our products;\n\u2022\ninjury to our reputation;\n\u2022\nsignificant litigation costs;\n\u2022\nsubstantial monetary awards to or costly settlements with patients;\n\u2022\nproduct recalls;\n\u2022\nloss of revenue;\n\u2022\nthe inability to commercialize new products or product candidates; and\n\u2022\ndiversion of management attention from pursuing our business strategy and may be costly to defend.\nOur existing product liability insurance coverage may be inadequate to protect us from any liabilities we might incur. If a product liability claim or series of claims is brought against us for uninsured liabilities or in excess of our insurance coverage, our business could suffer. Any product liability claim brought against us, with or without merit, could result in the increase of our product liability insurance rates or the inability to secure coverage in the future. In addition, a recall of some of our products, whether or not the result of a product liability claim, could result in significant costs and loss of customers.\nIn addition, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts or scope to protect us against losses. Any claims against us, regardless of their merit, could severely harm our financial condition, strain our management and other resources and adversely affect or eliminate the prospects for commercialization or sales of a product or product candidate that is the subject of any such claim.\nWe may be subject to various litigation claims and legal proceedings.\nWe, as well as certain of our officers and distributors, may be subject to other claims or lawsuits. These lawsuits may result in significant legal fees and expenses and could divert management\u2019s time and other resources. If the claims contained in these lawsuits are successfully asserted against us, we could be liable for damages and be required to alter or cease certain of our business practices or product lines. Any of these outcomes could cause our business, financial performance and cash position to be negatively impacted.\nRisks Related to Our International Operations\nWe are exposed to risks related to our international operations and failure to manage these risks may adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nWe sell our products globally and have a number of offices around the world. During the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, approximately 22%, 26% and 29% of our revenue, respectively, was attributable to our international customers. As of December 31, 2014, approximately 46% of our employees were located abroad. In addition, substantially all of our manufacturing is conducted in France and a substantial portion of our suppliers are located in Europe. The sale and shipment of our products across international borders, as well as the purchase of components and products from international sources, subjects us to extensive U.S., French and EEA and foreign governmental trade, import and export and customs regulations and laws. Compliance with these regulations and laws is costly and exposes us to penalties for non-compliance. We expect that our international activities will be dynamic over the foreseeable future as we continue to pursue opportunities in international markets. Therefore, we are subject to risks associated with having worldwide operations. These international operations will require significant management attention and financial resources.\nInternational operations are subject to inherent risks and our future results could be adversely affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nrequirements or preferences for domestic products or solutions, which could reduce demand for our products;\n\u2022\ndiffering existing or future regulatory and certification requirements;\n\u2022\nmanagement communication and integration problems related to entering new markets with different languages, cultures and political systems;\n\u2022\ngreater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable and longer collection periods;\n\u2022\ndifficulties in enforcing contracts;\n\u2022\ndifficulties and costs of staffing and managing foreign operations;\n\u2022\nthe uncertainty of protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;\n\u2022\npotentially adverse tax consequences, including regulatory requirements regarding our ability to repatriate profits to the United States;\n\u2022\ntariffs and trade barriers, export regulations and other regulatory and contractual limitations on our ability to sell our solutions in certain foreign markets; and\n\u2022\npolitical and economic instability and terrorism.\nAdditionally, our international operations expose us to risks of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. To date, a significant portion of our international sales have been denominated in Euros. In addition, a substantial portion of our manufacturing costs are also denominated in Euros. As a result, a decline in the value of the Euro against the U.S. dollar could have a material adverse effect on the gross margins and profitability of our international operations if it is not offset by a decline in manufacturing costs as a result of the decline in the Euro. In addition, sales to countries that do not utilize the Euro could decline as the cost of our products to our customers in those countries increases. In addition, because our financial statements are denominated in U.S. dollars, a decline in the Euro would negatively impact our overall revenue as reflected in our financial statements. To date, we have not used risk management techniques to hedge the risks associated with these fluctuations. Even if we were to implement hedging strategies, not every exposure can be hedged and, where hedges are put in place based on expected foreign currency exchange exposure, they are based on forecasts that may vary or that may later prove to have been inaccurate. As a result, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates or our failure to successfully hedge against these fluctuations could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nFailure to comply with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or the FCPA, and similar laws associated with our activities outside the United States could subject us to penalties and other adverse consequences.\nWe are subject to the FCPA and other anti-bribery legislation around the world. The FCPA generally prohibits covered entities and their intermediaries from engaging in bribery or making other prohibited payments, offers or promises to foreign officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or other advantages. In addition, the FCPA imposes recordkeeping and internal controls requirements on publicly traded corporations and their foreign affiliates, which are intended to, among other things, prevent the diversion of corporate funds to the payment of bribes and other improper payments, and to prevent the establishment of \u201coff books\u201d slush funds from which such improper payments can be made. As a substantial portion of our revenue is, and we expect will continue to be, from jurisdictions outside of the United States, we face significant risks if we fail to comply with the FCPA and other laws that prohibit improper payments, offers or promises of payment to foreign governments and their officials and political parties by us and other business entities for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or other advantages. In many foreign countries, particularly in countries with developing economies, some of which represent significant markets for us, it may be a local custom that businesses operating in such countries engage in business practices that are prohibited by the FCPA or other laws and regulations. Although we have implemented a company policy requiring our employees and consultants to comply with the FCPA and similar laws, such policy may not be effective at preventing all potential FCPA or other violations. Although our agreements with our international distributors clearly state our expectations for our distributors\u2019 compliance with U.S. laws, including the FCPA, and provide us with various remedies upon any non-compliance, including the ability to terminate the agreement, we also cannot guarantee our distributors\u2019 compliance with U.S. laws, including the FCPA. Therefore there can be no assurance that none of our employees and agents, or those companies to which we outsource certain of our business operations, have not and will not take actions that violate our policies or applicable laws, for which we may be ultimately held responsible. As a result of our focus on managing our growth, our development of infrastructure designed to identify FCPA matters and monitor compliance is at an early stage. Any violation of the FCPA and related policies could result in severe criminal or civil sanctions, which could have a material and adverse effect on our reputation, business, operating results and financial condition.\nNew regulations related to \u201cconflict minerals\u201d may force us to incur additional expenses, may make our supply chain more complex and may result in damage to our reputation with customers.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act requires the SEC to establish new disclosure and reporting requirements for those companies who use certain minerals and metals mined in the Democratic Republic of Congo and adjoining countries in their products, known as conflict minerals, whether or not these products are manufactured by third parties. The new rule could affect sourcing at competitive prices and availability in sufficient quantities of certain minerals used in the manufacture of our products, including tantalum. The number of suppliers who provide conflict-free minerals may be limited. In addition, there may be material costs associated with complying with the disclosure requirements, such as costs related to determining the source of certain minerals used in our products, as well as costs of possible changes to products, processes or sources of supply as a consequence of such verification activities. Since our supply chain is complex, we may not be able to verify the origins for these minerals used in our products sufficiently through the due diligence procedures that we implement, which may harm our reputation. In addition, we may encounter challenges to satisfy those customers who require that all of the components of our products be certified as conflict-free, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage if we are unable to do so.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur stock price may be volatile, and you may not be able to resell shares of our common stock at or above the price you paid.\nOur stock price may be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, some of which are beyond our control. These factors include those discussed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section of Annual Report on Form 10-K and others such as:\n\u2022\na slowdown in the medical device industry or the general economy;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated quarterly or annual variations in our results of operations or those of our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in accounting principles or changes in interpretations of existing principles, which could affect our financial results;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated changes in our growth rate relative to our competitors;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the values of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of new products or services, significant contracts, commercial relationships, capital commitments or acquisitions;\n\u2022\ncompetition from existing technologies and products or new technologies and products that may emerge;\n\u2022\nthe entry into, modification or termination of agreements with our sales representatives or distributors;\n\u2022\ndevelopments with respect to intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nsales, or the anticipation of sales, of our common stock by us, our insiders or our other stockholders, including upon the expiration of contractual lock-up agreements;\n\u2022\nsales, or the anticipation of sales, by our employees following any purchase of shares pursuant to our equity incentive plans;\n\u2022\nour ability to develop and market new and enhanced products on a timely basis;\n\u2022\nsuccessful adoption of our Mobi-C cervical disc replacement device in the United States and positive and negative coverage and reimbursement policies by insurance companies and other third-party payors;\n\u2022\nour commencement of, or involvement in, litigation;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key management or technical personnel; and\n\u2022\nchanges in laws or governmental regulations applicable to us.\nIn recent years, the stock markets generally have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. Broad market and industry factors may significantly affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nIn addition, in the past, class action litigation has often been instituted against companies whose securities have experienced periods of volatility in market price. Securities litigation brought against us following volatility in our stock price, regardless of the merit or ultimate results of such litigation, could result in substantial costs, which would hurt our financial condition and operating results and divert management\u2019s attention and resources from our business.\nSecurities analysts may not publish favorable research or reports about our business or may publish no information at all, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock will be influenced to some extent by the research and reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us and our business. We do not control these analysts. We may not attract or retain research coverage, and the analysts who publish information about our common stock could have relatively little experience with our company, which could affect their ability to accurately forecast our results and could make it more likely that we fail to meet their estimates. In addition, analysts who cover us could provide inaccurate or unfavorable research or issue an adverse opinion regarding our stock price, and our stock price could decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to publish reports covering us regularly, we could lose visibility in the market, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an \u201cemerging growth company,\u201d as defined in the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act of 2012, or the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions and relief from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies.\u201d In particular, while we are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d (i) we will not be required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404(b) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, (ii) we will be exempt from any rules that may be adopted by the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board requiring mandatory audit firm rotations or a supplement to the auditor\u2019s report on financial statements, (iii) we will be subject to reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and (iv) we will not be required to hold nonbinding advisory votes on executive compensation or stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. In addition, while we are an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d we will not be required to comply with any new financial accounting standard until such standard is generally applicable to private companies.\nAs a result, our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that are not \u201cemerging growth companies\u201d or elect not to avail themselves of this provision. We may remain an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d until as late as December 31, 2018 (the fiscal year-end following the fifth anniversary of the completion of our initial public offering), though we may cease to be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d earlier under certain circumstances, including (i) if the market value of our common stock that is held by nonaffiliates exceeds $700 million as of any June 30, in which case we would cease to be an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d as of the following December 31, or (ii) if our gross revenue exceeds $1 billion in any fiscal year.\nThe exact implications of the JOBS Act are still subject to interpretations and guidance by the SEC and other regulatory agencies, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to take advantage of all of the benefits of the JOBS Act. In addition, investors may find our common stock less attractive if we rely on the exemptions and relief granted by the JOBS Act. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may decline and/or become more volatile.\nIf our executive officers, directors and principal stockholders choose to act together, they will be able to exert significant influence over us and our significant corporate decisions and may act in a manner that advances their best interests and not necessarily those of other stockholders.\nOur executive officers, directors, and beneficial owners of 5% or more of our outstanding common stock and their affiliates beneficially own approximately 31.1% of our outstanding common stock as of December 31, 2014. As a result, these persons, acting together, will have the ability to significantly influence the outcome of all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election and removal of directors and any merger, consolidation, or sale of all or substantially all of our assets, and they may act in a manner that advances their best interests and not necessarily those of other stockholders, by among other things:\n\u2022\ndelaying, deferring or preventing a change in control of us;\n\u2022\nentrenching our management and/or our board of directors;\n\u2022\nimpeding a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us;\n\u2022\ndiscouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us; or\n\u2022\ncausing us to enter into transactions or agreements that are not in the best interests of all stockholders.\nWe do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future, and accordingly, stockholders must rely on stock appreciation for any return on their investment.\nWe do not anticipate declaring any cash dividends to holders of our common stock in the foreseeable future. In addition, our ability to pay cash dividends is currently prohibited by the terms of our existing loan agreement and may be prohibited by future loan agreements. Consequently, investors must rely on sales of their common stock after price appreciation, which may never occur, as the only way to realize any future gains on their investment.\nAnti-takeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company. These provisions could also make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nproviding for a classified board of directors with staggered, three-year terms;\n\u2022\nprohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n\u2022\nproviding that our directors may be removed only for cause;\n\u2022\nauthorizing the board of directors to issue, without stockholder approval, preferred stock with rights senior to those of our common stock;\n\u2022\nauthorizing the board of directors to change the authorized number of directors and to fill board vacancies;\n\u2022\nrequiring the approval of our board of directors and/or the holders of a supermajority of our outstanding shares of capital stock to amend our bylaws and certain provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation;\n\u2022\nrequiring stockholders that seek to present proposals before, or to nominate candidates for election of directors at, a meeting of stockholders to provide advance written notice of such proposals or nominations;\n\u2022\nprohibiting stockholder action by written consent;\n\u2022\nlimiting the liability of, and providing indemnification to, our directors and officers; and\n\u2022\nprohibiting our stockholders from calling a special stockholder meeting.\nWe are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which, subject to some exceptions, prohibits \u201cbusiness combinations\u201d between a Delaware corporation and an \u201cinterested stockholder,\u201d which is generally defined as a stockholder who becomes a beneficial owner of 15% or more of a Delaware corporation\u2019s voting stock, for a three-year period following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder.\nThese and other provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws discourage potential takeover attempts, reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock and result in the market price of our common stock being lower than it would be without these provisions.\nChallenges to our tax structure by tax authorities may adversely affect our financial position.\nWe have and will continue to have subsidiaries organized under the laws of various jurisdictions. Such subsidiaries are and will be subject to the tax laws of such jurisdictions. If the tax authorities of any or all of these jurisdictions were to successfully challenge our tax position with respect to income tax treaties and transfer prices affecting transactions between our subsidiaries or between our subsidiaries and us, we could be subject to increased taxes and possibly penalties, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position.\nEach of our non-U.S. subsidiaries intends to structure its operations with the goal that each such entity would not be subject to U.S. corporate income tax on the basis that it is not engaged in a trade or business in the United States. Nevertheless, there is a risk that the U.S. Internal Revenue Service may successfully assert that one or more of such entities is engaged in a trade or business in the United States, in which case these entities would be subject to U.S. tax at regular corporate rates on income that is effectively connected with the conduct of a U.S. trade or business, plus an additional 30% (or a lower applicable treaty rate, if any) \u201cbranch profits\u201d tax on the dividend equivalent amount, which is generally effectively connected income with certain adjustments, deemed withdrawn from the United States. Any such tax would result in an effective tax rate that is higher than anticipated.", "PERMNO": 14256, "SIC": 3842, "TIC": "LDRH"}
