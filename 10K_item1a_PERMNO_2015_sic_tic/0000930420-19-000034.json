{"cik": "930420", "company": "KFORCE INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-02-22", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nThe U.S. professional staffing industry in which we operate is significantly affected by fluctuations in general economic and employment conditions.\nDemand for staffing services is significantly affected by the general level of economic activity and employment in the U.S. Based upon previous economic cycles that Kforce has experienced, we believe that times of sustained economic recovery generally stimulate demand for additional U.S. temporary workers and, conversely, an economic slowdown results in a contraction in demand for additional U.S. temporary workers. Even without uncertainty and volatility, it is difficult for us to forecast future demand for our services due to the inherent difficulties in forecasting the strength of economic cycles, and the short-term nature of many of our agreements. As economic activity slows, companies may defer projects for which they utilize our services or reduce their use of temporary employees before laying off permanent employees. In addition, an economic downturn could result in a reduction in the temporary staffing penetration rate, an increase in the unemployment rate and a deceleration of growth in the segments in which we and our clients operate. We may also experience more competitive pricing pressures during periods of economic downturn. Any substantial economic downturn in the U.S. or global impact on the U.S. could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nKforce faces significant employment-related legal risk.\nKforce employs people internally and in the workplaces of our clients. An inherent risk of such activity includes possible claims of or relating to discrimination and harassment; wrongful termination; violations of employment rights related to employment screening or privacy issues; misclassification of workers as employees or independent contractors; violations of wage and hour requirements and other labor laws; employment of illegal aliens; criminal activity; torts; breach of contract; failure to protect confidential personal information; intentional criminal misconduct; misuse or misappropriation of client intellectual property; employee benefits; or other claims. In some cases, we are contractually obligated to indemnify our clients against such risks. Such claims may result in negative publicity, injunctive relief, criminal investigations and/or charges, civil litigation, payment by Kforce of defense costs, monetary damages or fines that may be significant, discontinuation of client relationships or other material adverse effects on our business. To reduce our exposure, we maintain policies, procedures and guidelines to promote compliance with laws, rules, regulations and best practices applicable to our business. Even claims without merit could cause us to incur significant expense or reputational harm. We also maintain insurance coverage for professional malpractice liability, fidelity, employment practices liability, and general liability in amounts and with deductibles that we believe are appropriate for our operations. However, our insurance coverage may not cover all potential claims against us, may require us to meet a deductible or may not continue to be available to us at a reasonable cost. In this regard, we face various employment-related risks not covered by insurance, such as wage and hour laws and employment tax responsibility. U.S. courts in recent years have been receiving large numbers of wage and hour class action claims alleging misclassification of overtime-eligible workers and/or failure to pay overtime-eligible workers for all hours worked.\nKforce may be exposed to unforeseeable negative acts by our personnel that could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAn inherent risk of employing people internally and in the workplace of other businesses is that many of these individuals have access to client information systems and confidential information. The risks of such activity include possible acts of errors and omissions; intentional misconduct; release, misuse or misappropriation of client intellectual property, confidential information, personally identifiable information, funds, or other property; cybersecurity breaches affecting our clients and/or us; or other acts. These risks are particularly significant in our government business. Such acts may result in negative publicity or other material adverse effects on our business. In addition, these occurrences may give rise to litigation, which could be time-consuming and expensive. To reduce our exposure, we maintain policies, procedures and insurance coverage for types and amounts we believe are appropriate in light of the aforementioned exposures. There can be no assurance that the corporate policies and practices we have in place to help reduce our exposure to these risks will be effective or that we will not experience losses as a result of these risks. In addition, our insurance coverage may not cover all potential claims against us, may require us to meet a deductible or may not continue to be available to us at a reasonable cost.\nKforce may not be able to recruit and retain qualified consultants and candidates.\nKforce depends upon the abilities of its staff to attract and retain consultants and candidates, particularly technical, professional, and cleared government services individuals, who possess the skills and experience necessary to meet the staffing requirements of our clients. We must continually evaluate and upgrade our methods of attracting qualified consultants and candidates to keep pace with changing client needs and emerging technologies. We expect significant competition for individuals with proven technical or professional skills for the foreseeable future. The supply of available consultants and candidates has been constrained during this economic recovery, especially in our Tech segment. If qualified individuals are not available to us in sufficient numbers and upon economic terms acceptable to us, it could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur failure to keep pace with technological change in our industry will potentially place us at a competitive disadvantage.\nOur future success may depend on our ability to successfully keep pace with technological changes and advances occurring across our industry. Our business is reliant on a variety of systems and technologies, including those that support candidate searching and matching, hiring and tracking, order management, billing, and client data analytics. Our success may depend on our ability to keep pace with rapid technological changes in the development and implementation of these services. If our systems become outdated, or if our investments in technology fail to provide the expected results, then we may be unable to maintain our technological capabilities relative to our competitors and our business could be negatively affected.\nCybersecurity risks and cyber incidents could adversely affect our business and disrupt operations.\nCyberattacks or other breaches of network or information technology used by our associates and consultants, as well as risks associated with compliance on data privacy could adversely affect on our systems, services, operations and financial results. These attacks include, but are not limited to, gaining unauthorized access to digital systems for purposes of misappropriating assets or sensitive information, corrupting data, or causing operational disruption. While we have policies, procedures and systems in place to detect, prevent and deter cyberattacks or other breaches of our networks, techniques used to obtain unauthorized access or cause system interruption change frequently and may not immediately produce signs of intrusion. As a result, we may be unable to anticipate these incidents or techniques, timely discover them, or implement adequate preventative measures. We maintain cyber risk insurance, but this insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our losses from any future breaches of our systems or information. Our information technology may not provide sufficient protection, and as a result we may lose significant information about us, our employees or clients. Other results of these incidents could include, but are not limited to, increased cybersecurity protection costs, litigation, regulatory penalties, monetary damages, and reputational damage adversely affecting client or investor confidence.\nDeclines in business or a loss of our major client accounts could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and financial results.\nPart of our business strategy includes enhancing our service offerings and relationships with large consumers of temporary staffing, which is intended to enable us to profitably grow our revenues with these clients. However, it also creates the potential for concentrating a significant portion of our revenues among our largest clients and exposes us to increased risks arising from decreases in the volume of business from, the pricing of business with, or the possible loss of business with these clients. Organizational changes occurring within those clients, or a deterioration of their financial condition or business prospects, could reduce their need for our services and result in a significant decrease in the revenues we derive from those clients and could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nOur collection, use and retention of personally identifiable information of our associates and consultants create risks that may harm our business.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we collect and retain personal information of our associates and consultants and their dependents including, without limitation, full names, social security numbers, addresses, birth dates, and payroll-related information. We use commercially available information security technologies to protect such information in digital format. We also use security and business controls to limit access to such information and continually monitor our systems for potential breaches. However, as our reliance on technology has increased so have the risks posed to our systems, both internal and those managed by third party service providers. It is possible that the controls in place will not be able to prevent the improper disclosure of personally identifiable information of our associates and consultants in the event of a computer virus, system breach or cyberattack, particularly in light of the increasing sophistication of perpetrators. Employees or third parties (including third parties with substantially greater resources than our own, e.g. foreign governments) may be able to circumvent our security measures and acquire or misuse such information, resulting in privacy breaches, errors in the storage, use or transmission of such information, and an interruption to our operations. Privacy breaches may require notification and other remedies, which can be costly, and which may have other serious adverse consequences for our business, including regulatory penalties and fines, claims for breach of contract, claims for damages, adverse publicity, reduced demand for our services by clients and/or consultants, harm to our reputation, and regulatory oversight by state or federal agencies.\nThe possession and use of personal information and data in conducting our business subjects us to legislative and regulatory burdens. We may be required to incur significant expenses to comply with mandatory privacy and security standards and protocols imposed by law, regulation, industry standards or contractual obligations.\nKforce may be adversely affected by government regulation of the staffing business and of the workplace.\nOur business is subject to regulation and licensing in many states. There can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to obtain all necessary licenses or approvals or that the cost of compliance will not prove to be material. If we fail to comply, such failure could materially adversely affect Kforce\u2019s financial results.\nA large part of our business entails employing individuals on a temporary basis and placing such individuals in clients\u2019 workplaces. Increased government regulation of the workplace or of the employer/employee relationship could have a material adverse effect on Kforce. For example, changes to government regulations, including changes to statutory hourly wage and overtime regulations, could adversely affect the Firm\u2019s results of operations by increasing its costs. Due to the substantial number of state and local jurisdictions in which we operate and the widening disparity among state and local laws, there also is a risk that we may be unaware of, or unable to adequately monitor, actual or proposed changes in, or the interpretation of, the laws or governmental regulations of such states and localities. Any delay in our compliance with changes in such laws or governmental regulations could result in potential fines, penalties, or other sanctions for non-compliance.\nReclassification of our independent contractors by tax or regulatory authorities could materially and adversely affect our business model and could require us to pay significant retroactive wages, taxes and penalties.\nWe utilize individuals to provide services in connection with our business as qualified third-party independent contractors rather than our direct employees. Heightened state and federal scrutiny of independent contractor relationships could adversely affect us given that we utilize independent contractors to perform our services. An adverse determination related to the independent contractor status of these subcontracted personnel could result in a substantial tax or other liabilities to us.\nSignificant increases in wages or payroll-related costs could adversely affect Kforce\u2019s business.\nSignificant increases in wages or the effective rates of any payroll-related costs could have a material adverse effect on Kforce. Kforce is required to pay a number of federal, state, and local payroll and related costs or provide certain benefits such as paid time off, sick leave, unemployment taxes, workers\u2019 compensation and insurance premiums and claims, FICA, and Medicare, among others, related to our employees. Costs could also increase as a result of health care reforms or the possible imposition of additional requirements and restrictions related to the placement of personnel. We may not be able to increase the fees charged to our clients in a timely manner or in a sufficient amount to cover these potential cost increases.\nKforce may be adversely affected by immigration restrictions and reform.\nOur Tech segment utilizes a significant number of foreign nationals employed by us on work visas, primarily under the H-1B visa classification. The H-1B visa classification that enables U.S. employers to hire qualified foreign nationals is subject to legislative and administrative changes, as well as changes in the application of standards and enforcement. Immigration laws and regulations can be significantly affected by political developments and levels of economic activity. Current and future restrictions on the availability of such visas could restrain our ability to employ the skilled professionals we need to meet our clients\u2019 needs, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service (\u201cUSCIS\u201d) continues to closely scrutinize companies seeking to sponsor, renew or transfer H-1B status, including Kforce and Kforce\u2019s subcontractors and has issued internal guidance to its field offices that appears to narrow the eligibility criteria for H-1B status in the context of staffing services. In addition to USCIS restrictions, certain aspects of the H-1B program are also subject to regulation and review by the U.S. Department of Labor and U.S. Department of State, which have recently increased enforcement activities in the program. Vigorous enforcement and/or legislative or executive action relating to immigration could adversely affect our ability to recruit or retain foreign national consultants, and consequently, reduce our supply of skilled consultants and candidates and subject us to fines, penalties and sanctions, or result in increased labor and compliance costs.\nKforce\u2019s success depends upon retaining the services of its management team and key operating employees.\nKforce is highly dependent on its management team and expects that continued success will depend largely upon their efforts, expertise and abilities. The loss of the services of any key executive for any reason could have a material adverse effect on Kforce. To attract and retain executives and other key employees (particularly management, client servicing, and consultant and candidate recruiting employees) in a competitive marketplace, we must provide a competitive compensation package, including cash-based and equity-based compensation. Kforce expends significant resources in the recruiting and training of its employees, as the pool of available applicants for these positions is limited. The loss or any sustained attrition of our key operating employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, including our ability to establish and maintain client, consultant and candidate, professional and technical relationships.\nKforce\u2019s temporary staffing business could be adversely impacted by health care reform.\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, and the rules and regulations thereunder (the \u201cPPACA\u201d), imposes requirements and restrictions, including, but not limited to, guaranteed coverage requirements, prohibitions on some annual and all lifetime limits on amounts paid on behalf of or to our employees, increased restrictions on rescinding coverage, establishment of minimum requirements, the establishment of state insurance exchanges and essential benefit packages, and greater limitations on product pricing. Because the regulations governing the PPACA\u2019s employer mandate are subject to interpretation, it is possible that Kforce may incur liability in the form of penalties, fines, or damages if the health plans we offer are subsequently found not to meet minimum essential coverage, affordability or minimum value standards, or if our method for determining eligibility for coverage is found inadequate or our clients seek indemnification for health care claims resulting from consultants working on client assignments. The cost of any such penalties, fines or damages could have a material adverse effect on Kforce\u2019s financial and operating results.\nNew business initiatives and strategic changes may divert management\u2019s attention from normal business operations, which could adversely affect our performance.\nNew business initiatives and strategic changes in the composition of our business mix can be a diversion to our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns and disruptive to our operations, which could cause our business and results of operations to suffer materially. Acquisitions and new business initiatives could involve significant unanticipated challenges and risks, including the possibility that: they may not advance our business strategy; we may not realize our anticipated return on our investment; we may lose key personnel; we may retain unforeseen liabilities; we may experience difficulty in implementing initiatives or integrating acquired operations; or management's attention may be diverted from our other businesses. These events could cause material harm to our business, operating results, or financial condition.\nKforce maintains debt that exposes us to interest rate risk and contains restrictive covenants that could trigger prepayment of obligations or additional costs.\nWe have a credit facility consisting of a revolving line of credit of up to $300.0 million, subject to certain limitations. Borrowings under the credit facility are secured by substantially all of the tangible and intangible assets of the Firm, excluding the Firm\u2019s corporate headquarters and certain other designated executed collateral.\nAdverse changes in credit markets, including increases in interest rates, could increase our cost of borrowing and/or make it more difficult to refinance our existing indebtedness, if necessary. We have reduced our exposure to rising interest rates by entering into an interest rate hedging arrangement, although this and other arrangements may result in us incurring higher interest expenses than we would have otherwise incurred. If interest rates increase in the absence of such arrangements though, we would need to dedicate more of our cash flow from operations to service our debt.\nKforce is subject to certain affirmative and negative covenants under our credit facility. Our failure to comply with such restrictive covenants could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could result in Kforce being required to repay the outstanding balance before the due date. If this occurs, we may not be able to repay our debt or we may be forced to refinance on terms not acceptable to us, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nKforce depends on the proper functioning of its information systems.\nKforce is dependent on the proper functioning of information systems in operating our business. Critical information systems are used in every aspect of Kforce\u2019s daily operations, most significantly, in the identification and matching of staffing resources to client assignments and in the client billing and consultant or vendor payment functions. Kforce\u2019s information systems may not perform as anticipated and are vulnerable to damage or interruption including natural disasters, fire or casualty theft, technical failures, terrorist acts, cybersecurity breaches, power outages, telecommunications failures, physical or software intrusions, computer viruses, employee errors and similar events. Our corporate headquarters and data center are located in a hurricane-prone area although we have disaster recovery systems for some key information systems, such as billing and payroll, but not for all such key systems. Failure or interruption of our critical information systems may require significant additional capital and management resources to resolve, which could materially adversely affect our business. Additionally, many of our information technology systems and networks are cloud-based or managed by third parties, whose future performance and reliability we cannot control. The risk of a cyberattack or security breach on a third party carries the same risks to Kforce as those associated with our internal systems. We seek to reduce these risks by performing vendor due diligence procedures prior to engaging with any third party vendor who will have access to sensitive data. Additionally, we require audits of the relevant third parties\u2019 information technology processes on an annual basis. However, there can be no assurance that such parties will not experience cybersecurity breaches that could adversely affect our employees, customers and businesses or that our audit or diligence processes will successfully deter or prevent such breach.\nDelays in collecting our trade accounts receivable could adversely affect our business.\nWe generate a significant amount of trade accounts receivable from our clients. Delays in payments owed to us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and cash flows generated by our business. Factors that could cause a delay include business failures, turmoil in the financial and credit markets, sluggish or recessionary U.S. economic conditions, our exposure to clients in high-risk sectors such as the financial services industry, declines in the credit worthiness of our clients, extension in payment terms with our clients and declines in the business of our clients.\nAdverse results in tax audits or interpretations of tax laws could adversely impact our business.\nKforce is subject to periodic federal, state and local tax audits for various tax years. We also need to comply with new, evolving or revised tax laws and regulations. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act enacted in December 2017 continues to require significant interpretation; as additional regulatory guidance is issued and we continue to analyze the application of the new law, we may be required to refine our estimates, which could materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate. Although Kforce attempts to comply with all taxing authority regulations, adverse findings or assessments made by taxing authorities as the result of an audit could have a material adverse effect on Kforce.\nDue to inherent limitations, there can be no assurance that our system of disclosure and internal controls and procedures will be successful in preventing all errors and fraud, or in making all material information known in a timely manner to management.\nOur management, including our CEO and CFO, does not expect that our disclosure controls and internal controls will prevent all errors and fraud. A control system, regardless of how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Because of the inherent limitations in all control systems, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within Kforce have been detected. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people, or by management override of the control.\nThe design of any system of controls is also based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions; over time, a control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. Because of the inherent limitations, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nWe are exposed to intangible asset risk which could result in future impairment.\nWe regularly review our intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. We test goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually. Factors that may be considered a change in circumstances, indicating that the carrying value of the intangible assets may not be recoverable, include: macroeconomic conditions; industry and market considerations; increases in labor or other costs that have a negative effect on earnings and cash flows; negative or declining cash flows or a decline in actual or planned revenue or earnings compared with actual and projected results of relevant prior periods; and other relevant entity-specific events, such as changes in key personnel, strategy, or clients, and sustained decreases in share price. We may be required to record a charge in our financial statements, which could be material, during the period in which we determine an impairment of our acquired intangible assets has occurred, negatively impacting our financial results.\nOur business is dependent upon maintaining our reputation, our relationships and our performance.\nThe reputation and relationships that we have established and currently maintain with our clients are important to maintaining existing business and identifying new business. If our reputation or relationships were damaged, it could materially adversely affect on our operations. In addition, if our performance does not meet our clients\u2019 expectations, our revenues and operating results could be materially harmed.\nAgreements may be terminated by clients and consultants at will and the termination of a significant number of such agreements could adversely affect our revenues.\nOur agreements do not provide for exclusive use of our services, and clients are free to place orders with our competitors. Each consultant\u2019s relationship with us is terminable at will. If clients terminate a significant number of our agreements and we are unable to generate new contracts, or a significant number of our consultants cease performing services for us and we are unable to find suitable replacements, the growth of our business could be adversely affected, and our revenues and results of operations could be harmed.\nKforce\u2019s current market share may decrease as a result of limited barriers to entry for new competitors and discontinuation of clients outsourcing their staffing needs.\nWe face significant competition in the markets we serve, and there are limited barriers to entry for new competitors. The competition among staffing services firms is intense. Kforce competes for potential clients with providers of outsourcing services, systems integrators, computer systems consultants, temporary personnel agencies, search firms, and other providers of staffing services. Some of our competitors possess substantially greater resources than we do. From time to time, we experience significant pressure from our clients to reduce price levels. During these periods, we may face increased competitive pricing pressures and may not be able to recruit the personnel necessary to fulfill our clients\u2019 needs. We also face the risk that certain of our current and prospective clients will decide to provide similar services internally, particularly if regulatory burdens are reduced.\nVendor management services are considered a competitor and increasing use by our clients could affect our relationships.\nIncreasingly, many clients and potential clients are retaining third parties to provide vendor management services. The third party, or vendor management company, is responsible for retaining companies that will provide temporary information technology personnel to the client. This results in Kforce contracting with such third parties and not directly with the end customer. This change can weaken Kforce\u2019s relationship with its clients, which may make it more difficult to maintain and expand our business with existing customers. In addition, the agreements with vendor management companies are frequently structured as subcontracting agreements, with the vendor management company entering into a services agreement directly with the end customer. As a result, in the event of a bankruptcy of a vendor management company, Kforce\u2019s ability to collect its outstanding receivables and continue to provide services could be adversely affected.\nKforce\u2019s stock price may be volatile.\nThe market price of our stock has fluctuated substantially in the past and could fluctuate substantially in the future, based on a variety of factors, including our operating results, changes in general conditions in the economy, the financial markets, the staffing industry, or other developments affecting us, our clients, or our competitors; some of which may be unrelated to our performance.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, especially The NASDAQ Global Select Market (\u201cNASDAQ\u201d) tier, along with market prices for staffing companies, has experienced volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies. These broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our operating results.\nAmong other things, volatility in our stock price could mean that investors will not be able to sell their shares at or above the prices they pay. The volatility also could impair our ability in the future to offer common stock as a source of additional capital or as consideration in the acquisition of other businesses.\nProvisions in Kforce\u2019s articles and bylaws and under Florida law may have certain anti-takeover effects.\nKforce\u2019s articles of incorporation and bylaws and Florida law contain provisions that may have the effect of inhibiting a non-negotiated merger or other business combination. In particular, our articles of incorporation provide for a staggered Board of Directors (\u201cBoard\u201d) and permit the removal of directors only for cause. Additionally, the Board may issue up to 15 million shares of preferred stock, and fix the rights and preferences thereof, without a further vote of the shareholders. In addition, certain of our officers and managers have employment agreements containing certain provisions that call for substantial payments to be made to such employees in certain circumstances after a change in control. Certain of these provisions may discourage a future acquisition of Kforce, including an acquisition in which shareholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares. As a result, shareholders who might desire to participate in such a transaction may not have the opportunity to do so. Moreover, the existence of these provisions could negatively impact the market price of our common stock.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR GOVERNMENT BUSINESS\nOur GS segment is substantially dedicated to contracting with and serving U.S. Federal Government agencies (the \u201cGovernment Business\u201d). In addition, Kforce supplies services to the Federal Government which poses additional risks to those mentioned previously. Federal contractors, including Kforce, face a number of risks, including but not limited to the following:\nOur failure to comply with complex federal procurement laws and regulations could cause us to lose business, incur additional costs and subject us to a variety of penalties, including suspension and debarment from contracting with the Federal Government.\nWe must comply with complex laws and regulations relating to the formation, administration, and performance of Federal Government contracts. These laws and regulations create compliance risk, affect how we do business with our federal agency clients, and may impose added costs on our business. If a government review, audit or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, harm to our reputation, suspension of payments, fines, and suspension or debarment from contracting with Federal Government agencies.\nThe Federal Government also may reform its procurement practices or adopt new contracting rules and regulations, including cost accounting standards, which could be costly to satisfy or impact our ability to obtain new contracts. A failure to comply with all applicable laws and regulations could result in contract termination, price or fee reductions, or suspension or debarment from contracting with Federal Government agencies; each of which could lead to a material reduction in our revenues, cash flows and operating results.\nChanges in the spending policies or budget priorities of the Federal Government including the failure by Congress to approve budgets, raise the U.S. debt ceiling or avoid sequestration on a timely basis for the federal agencies we support could delay, reduce or stop federal spending and cause us to lose revenue or impair our intangible assets.\nChanges in Federal Government fiscal or spending policies could materially adversely affect our Government Business; in particular, our business could be materially adversely affected by decreases in Federal Government spending. In addition, on an annual basis, Congress must approve, and the President must sign the appropriation bills that govern spending by each of the federal agencies we support. If Congress is unable to agree on budget priorities and is unable to appropriate funds or pass the annual budget on a timely basis, or a prolonged government shutdown were to occur (as happened recently), there may be delays, reductions or cessations of funding for our services and solutions. In addition, from time to time it has been necessary for Congress to raise the U.S. debt ceiling in order to allow for borrowing necessary to fund government operations. If that becomes necessary again and Congress fails to raise the debt ceiling on a timely basis, there may be delays, reductions or cessations of funding for our services and solutions. Furthermore, legislatively mandated cuts in federal programs, known as sequestration, could result in delays, reductions or cessation of funding for our services and solutions.\nUnfavorable government audit results could force us to refund previously recognized revenue and could subject us to a variety of penalties and sanctions.\nFederal agencies can audit and review our performance on contracts, pricing practices, cost structure, incurred cost submissions and compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and standards. An audit of our work, including an audit of work performed by companies Kforce has acquired or may acquire, or subcontractors we have hired or may hire, could force us to refund previously recognized revenues.\nIf a government audit uncovers improper or illegal activities, we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines, and suspension or debarment from doing business with Federal Government agencies. In addition, we could suffer serious harm to our reputation if allegations of impropriety were made against us, regardless of the veracity.\nWe are dependent upon the ability of government agencies to administratively manage our contracts.\nAfter we are awarded a contract and the contract is funded by the Federal Government, we are still dependent upon the ability of the relevant agency to administratively manage our contract. We can be adversely impacted by delays in the start-up of already awarded and funded projects, including delays due to shortages of acquisition and contracting personnel within the Federal Government agencies.\nCompetition is intense in the Government Business.\nThere is often intense competition to win federal agency contracts. The competitive bidding process entails substantial costs and management time to prepare bids and proposals for contracts that may not be awarded to us or may be split among competitors. Even when a contract is awarded to us, we may encounter significant expenses, delays, contract modifications or bid protests from competitors. If we are unable to successfully compete for new business or win competitions to maintain existing business, our operations could be materially adversely affected. Many of our competitors are larger and have greater resources, larger client bases and greater brand recognition than we do. Our larger competitors also may be able to provide clients with different or greater capabilities or benefits than we can provide.\nLoss of our General Services Administration (\u201cGSA\u201d) Schedules or other contracting vehicles could impair our ability to win new business.\nGSA Schedules constitute a significant percentage of revenues from our federal agency clients. If we were to lose one or more of these Schedules or other contracting vehicles, we could lose revenues and our operating results could be materially adversely affected. These Schedules or contracts typically have an initial term with multiple options that may be exercised by our government agency clients to extend the contract for successive periods of one or more years. We can provide no assurance that our clients will exercise these options.\nSecurity breaches in sensitive government information systems could result in the loss of our clients and cause negative publicity.\nMany of the systems we develop, install, and maintain involve managing and protecting information used in intelligence, national security, and other sensitive or classified government functions. A security breach in one of these systems could cause serious harm to our business, damage our reputation, and prevent us from being eligible for further work on sensitive or classified systems for Federal Government clients. We could incur losses from such a security breach that could exceed the policy limits under our insurance. Damage to our reputation or limitations on our eligibility for additional work resulting from a security breach in one of our systems could materially reduce our revenues.\nOur employees may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, which could harm our business.\nLike all government contractors, we are exposed to the risk that employee fraud or other misconduct could occur. Misconduct by our employees could include intentional or unintentional failures to comply with Federal Government procurement regulations, engaging in unauthorized activities, seeking reimbursement for improper expenses, or falsifying time records. Employee misconduct could also involve the improper use of our clients\u2019 sensitive or classified information, which could result in regulatory sanctions against us and serious harm to our reputation. It is not always possible to deter employee misconduct, and precautions to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in controlling such risks or losses, which could materially adversely affect our business.\nOur failure to obtain and maintain necessary security clearances may limit our ability to perform classified work for government clients, which could cause us to lose business.\nSome government contracts require us to maintain facility security clearances and require some of our employees to maintain individual security clearances. If our employees lose or are unable to timely obtain security clearances, or we lose a facility clearance, a government agency client may terminate the contract or decide not to renew it upon its expiration.\nWe are the prime contractor on many of our contracts and if our subcontractors fail to appropriately perform their obligations, our performance and our ability to win future contracts could be harmed.\nFor many of our contracts where we are the prime contractor, we involve subcontractors, which we rely on to perform a portion of the services that we must provide to our clients. There is a risk that we may have disputes with our subcontractors, including disputes regarding the quality and timeliness of work performed or client concerns about the subcontractor\u2019s performance. In addition, the contracting parties on which we rely may be affected by changes in the economic environment and constraints on available financing to meet their performance requirements or provide needed supplies on a timely basis. A failure by one or more of those contracting parties to provide the agreed-upon supplies or perform the agreed-upon services on a timely basis may affect our ability to perform our obligations.\nWe are the subcontractor on many of our contracts and if we, or the applicable prime contractors, fail to appropriately perform our and their obligations, our financial condition may be harmed.\nFor many of our contracts, we are a subcontractor; therefore, we rely on the applicable prime contractor to secure contracts when they are put up for bid for a renewal or a new contract. There is a risk that the applicable prime contractor is unable to secure such bids for a number of reasons, including the prime contractor\u2019s quality and timeliness of services, financial condition, and relationships with the Federal Government. In addition, there are risks that we are unable to provide such subcontractor services with the quality and timeliness demanded by the prime contractor or the ultimate end-client. Any failure by the applicable prime contractor to secure contracts or by us to perform adequately could materially adversely affect our business.", "PERMNO": 82212, "SIC": 7363, "TIC": "KFRC"}
