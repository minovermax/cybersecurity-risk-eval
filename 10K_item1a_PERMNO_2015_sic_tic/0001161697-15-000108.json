YOU ARE CAUTIONED THAT SUCH STATEMENTS ARE ONLY PREDICTIONS AND INVOLVE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, AND THAT ACTUAL EVENTS OR RESULTS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY. IN EVALUATING SUCH STATEMENTS, YOU SHOULD SPECIFICALLY CONSIDER THE VARIOUS FACTORS IDENTIFIED IN THIS ANNUAL REPORT, INCLUDING THE MATTERS SET FORTH BELOW, WHICH COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE INDICATED BY SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.\nAN INVESTMENT IN OUR COMMON STOCK INVOLVES A HIGH DEGREE OF RISK. YOU SHOULD CAREFULLY CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING RISK FACTORS BEFORE DECIDING TO INVEST IN OUR COMPANY. IF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING RISKS ACTUALLY OCCUR, OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND PROSPECTS FOR GROWTH WOULD LIKELY SUFFER. AS A RESULT, YOU MAY LOSE ALL OR PART OF YOUR INVESTMENT IN OUR COMPANY.\nWe are a development stage company and may never be able to effectuate our business plan.\nWe were incorporated in the State of Florida on November 22, 2011, to engage in the business of producing, marketing and selling Ultra-Premium Vodka product to retailers. Our management determined to cease our Ultra-Premium Vodka business, and attempt to acquire other assets or business operations that will maximize shareholder value. We intend to seek, investigate and, if such investigation warrants, engage in a business combination with a private entity whose business presents an opportunity for our shareholders. As a development stage company with limited resources we may not be able to successfully effectuate our business plan. There can be no assurance that we will ever achieve any revenues or profitability. The revenue and income potential of our proposed business and operations is unproven as the lack of operating history makes it difficult to evaluate the future prospects of our business.\nWe require financing to acquire businesses and implement our business plan. We cannot assure you that we will be successful in obtaining financing or acquiring businesses, or in operating those acquired businesses in a profitable manner.\nWe expect losses in the future because we have no revenue.\n- 10 -\nAs we have no current revenue, we are expecting losses over the next 12 months because we do not yet have any revenues to offset the expenses associated with our business plan. We cannot guarantee that we will ever be successful in generating revenues in the future. We recognize that if we are unable to generate revenues, we will not be able to earn profits or continue operations. There is no history upon which to base any assumption as to the likelihood that we will prove successful, and we can provide investors with no assurance that we will generate any operating revenues or ever achieve profitable operations.\nIf our business plans are not successful, we may not be able to continue operations as a going concern and our stockholders may lose their entire investment in us.\nSince inception, we have had no revenues and incurred a cumulative net loss of $140,028 through November 30, 2014. This raises substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. We will, in all likelihood, sustain operating expenses without corresponding revenues, at least until the consummation of a business combination. This may result in our incurring a net operating loss that will increase continuously until we can consummate a business combination with a profitable business opportunity. We cannot assure you that we can identify a suitable business opportunity and consummate a business combination. If we cannot continue as a going concern, our stockholders may lose their entire investment in us.\nWe do not have any agreement for a business combination or other transaction.\nWe have no arrangement, agreement or understanding with respect to engaging in a merger with, joint venture with or acquisition of, a private or public entity. We are currently engaged in discussions with Tyme, Inc. regarding a possible business combination involving the two companies. At this stage, no definitive terms have been agreed to, and neither party is currently bound to proceed with any transaction. We cannot assure you that we will consummate a transaction with Tyme, Inc., or successfully identify and evaluate other suitable business opportunities, or that we will conclude a business combination. We cannot guarantee that we will be able to negotiate a business combination on favorable terms, and there is consequently a risk that future funds allocated to the purchase of our shares will not be invested in a company with active business operations.\nFuture success is highly dependent on the ability of management to locate and attract a suitable acquisition.\nThe success of our proposed plan of operation will depend to a great extent on the operations, financial condition and management of the identified target company. While business combinations with entities having established operating histories are preferred, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in locating candidates meeting such criteria. The decision to enter into a business combination will likely be made without detailed feasibility studies, independent analysis, market surveys or similar information which, if we had more funds available to it, would be desirable. In the event we complete a business combination, the success of our operations will be dependent upon management of the target company and numerous other factors beyond our control. We cannot assure you that we will identify a target company and consummate a business combination.\nThere is competition for those private companies suitable for a merger or combination transaction of the type contemplated by management.\nWe are in a highly competitive market for a small number of business opportunities which could reduce the likelihood of consummating a successful business combination. We are and will continue to be an insignificant participant in the business of seeking mergers with, joint ventures with and acquisitions of small private and public entities. A large number of established and well-financed entities, including small public companies and venture capital firms, are active in mergers and acquisitions of companies that may be desirable target candidates for us. Nearly all these entities have significantly greater financial resources, technical expertise and managerial capabilities than we do. Consequently, we will be at a competitive disadvantage in identifying possible business opportunities and successfully completing a business combination. These competitive factors may reduce the likelihood of our identifying and consummating a successful business combination.\nWe have not conducted market research to identify business opportunities, which may affect our ability to identify a business to merge with or acquire.\nWe have neither conducted nor have others made available to us results of market research concerning prospective business opportunities. Therefore, we have no assurances that market demand exists for a merger or acquisition as contemplated by us. Our management has not identified any specific business combination or other transactions for formal evaluation by us, such that it may be expected that any such target business or transaction will present such a level of risk that conventional private or public offerings of securities or conventional bank financing will not be available. There is no assurance that we will be able to acquire a business opportunity on terms favorable to us. Decisions as to which business opportunity to participate in will be unilaterally made by our management, which may act without the consent, vote or approval of our stockholders.\n- 11 -\nManagement intends to devote only a limited amount of time to seeking a target company, which may adversely impact our ability to identify a suitable acquisition candidate.\nWhile seeking a business combination, management anticipates devoting very limited time to our affairs in total. Our sole officer has not entered into a written employment agreement with us and is not expected to do so in the foreseeable future. This limited commitment may adversely impact our ability to identify and consummate a successful business combination.\nWe are dependent on the services of our sole officer to obtain capital required to implement our business plan and for identifying, investigating, negotiating and integrating potential acquisition opportunities. The loss of services of our sole officer could have a substantial adverse effect on us. The expansion of our business will be largely contingent on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified corporate and operations level management team. We cannot assure you that we will find suitable management personnel or will have financial resources to attract or retain such people if found.\nThe time and cost of preparing a private company to become a public reporting company may preclude us from entering into a merger or acquisition with the most attractive private companies.\nTarget companies that fail to comply with SEC reporting requirements may delay or preclude acquisition. Sections 13 and 15(d) of the Exchange Act require reporting companies to provide certain information about significant acquisitions, including audited financial statements for the company acquired.\nThe time and additional costs that may be incurred by some target entities to prepare these statements may significantly delay or essentially preclude consummation of an acquisition. Otherwise suitable acquisition prospects that do not have or are unable to obtain the required audited statements may be inappropriate for acquisition so long as the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act are applicable.\nAny potential acquisition or merger with a foreign company may subject us to additional risks.\nIf we enter into a business combination with a foreign concern, we will be subject to risks inherent in business operations outside of the United States. These risks include, for example, currency fluctuations, regulatory problems, punitive tariffs, unstable local tax policies, trade embargoes, risks related to shipment of raw materials and finished goods across national borders and cultural and language differences. Foreign economies may differ favorably or unfavorably from the United States economy in growth of gross national product, rate of inflation, market development, rate of savings, and capital investment, resource self-sufficiency and balance of payments positions, and in other respects.\nWe will need to raise additional capital to execute our business plan. If our operations do not produce the necessary cash flow, or if we cannot obtain needed funds, we may be forced to reduce or cease our activities with consequent loss to investors.\nWe have a need for cash in order to pay obligations currently due in a timely manner, and to finance our business operations. Our continued operations will depend upon the sustainability of cash flow from our ability to raise additional funds, as required, through equity or debt financing. There is no assurance that we will be able to obtain additional funding when it is needed, or that such funding, if available, will be obtainable on terms acceptable to us. If we cannot obtain needed funds, we may be forced to reduce or cease our activities with consequent loss to investors. In addition, should we incur significant presently unforeseen expenses or delays, we may not be able to accomplish our goals.\nIf we fail to develop and maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud, as a result, current and potential shareholders could lose confidence in our financial reports, which could harm our business and the trading price of our common stock.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and effectively prevent fraud. Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 requires us to evaluate and report on our internal controls over financial reporting. We plan to comply with Section 404 by strengthening, assessing and testing our system of internal controls to provide the basis for our report. The process of strengthening our internal controls and complying with Section 404 is expensive and time consuming, and requires significant management attention, especially given that we have not yet undertaken any efforts to comply with the requirements of Section 404. We cannot be certain that the measures we will undertake will ensure that we will maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future. Furthermore, if we are able to rapidly grow our business, the internal controls that we will need will become more complex, and significantly more resources will be required to ensure our internal controls remain effective. Failure to implement required controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation, could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. If we discover a material weakness in our internal controls, the disclosure of that fact, even if the weakness is quickly remedied, could diminish investors\u2019 confidence in our financial statements and harm our stock price. In addition,\n- 12 -\nnon-compliance with Section 404 could subject us to a variety of administrative sanctions, including the suspension of trading, ineligibility for listing on the OTC Bulletin Board, the OTC Markets, one of the national securities exchanges, and the inability of registered broker-dealers to make a market in our common stock, which would further reduce our stock price.\nOur principal stockholder owns a controlling interest in our voting stock and investors will not have any voice in our management, which could result in decisions adverse to our general shareholders.\nGEM Global Yield Fund LLC SCS, a societ\u00e9 en commandite simple incorporated and existing under the law of Luxembourg (\u201cGGYF\u201d), beneficially owns 50.0% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, it has the ability to control substantially all matters submitted to our stockholders for approval including: (a) election of our Board of Directors (\u201cBoard\u201d); (b) removal of any of our directors; (c) amendments of our Certificate of Incorporation or bylaws; (d) adoption of measures that could delay or prevent a change in control or impede a merger, takeover or other business combination involving us, or (e) other significant corporate transactions. The shares were obtained pursuant to a Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of February 27, 2013, between GGYF, and Andrew Keck, our then principal stockholder and sole officer and director. The shares were purchased from the Mr. Keck for cash consideration of $206,000.\nOur failure to adopt certain corporate governance procedures may prevent us from obtaining a listing on a national securities exchange.\nPeter de Svastich is our sole director. We have no directors that are \u201cindependent\u201d as that term is defined in the rules of any national securities exchange. As a result, we do not have an audit, compensation or nominating and corporate governance committee. The functions of such committees would perform are performed by the Board as a whole. Consequently, there is a potential conflict of interest in Board decisions that may adversely affect our ability to become a listed security on a national securities exchange and as a result adversely affect the liquidity of our common stock.\nTrading in our shares of common stock is limited, and will not improve unless we increase our sales, become profitable and secure more active market makers.\nThere is currently no trading market for our common stock. There can be no assurance that a regular trading market for our securities will ever develop or that if developed it will be sustained. The trading price of our securities could be subject to wide fluctuations, in response to quarterly variations in our operating results, announcements by us or others, developments affecting us, and other events or factors. In addition, the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in recent years. These fluctuations have had a substantial effect on the market prices for many companies, often unrelated to the operating performance of such companies, and may adversely affect the market prices of the securities Such risks could have an adverse effect on the stock\u2019s future liquidity.\nWe may, in the future, issue additional common shares, which would reduce investors\u2019 percent of ownership and may dilute our share value.\nOur Certificate of Incorporation authorizes the issuance of 300,000,000 shares of common stock, $0.0001 par value per share, and 10,000,000 shares of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, $0.0001 par value per share (\u201cPreferred Stock\u201d). The future issuance of Common Stock or Preferred Stock may result in substantial dilution in the percentage of our Common Stock held by our then existing shareholders. We may value any Common Stock and/or Preferred Stock issued in the future on an arbitrary basis. The issuance of Common Stock and/or Preferred Stock for future services or acquisitions or other corporate actions may have the effect of diluting the value of the shares held by our investors, and might have an adverse effect on any trading market for our Common Stock.\nOur common shares are subject to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules of the SEC, and the trading market in our securities is limited, which makes transactions in our stock cumbersome and may reduce the value of an investment in our stock.\nRule 15g-9 under the Exchange Act establishes the definition of a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d for the purposes relevant to us, as any equity security that has a market price of less than $5.00 per share or with an exercise price of less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. For any transaction involving a penny stock, unless exempt, the rules require: (a) that a broker or dealer approve a person\u2019s account for transactions in penny stocks; and (b) the broker or dealer receive from the investor a written agreement to the transaction, setting forth the identity and quantity of the penny stock to be purchased.\nIn order to approve a person\u2019s account for transactions in penny stocks, the broker or dealer must: (a) obtain financial information and investment experience objectives of the person; and (b) make a reasonable determination that the transactions in penny stocks are suitable for that person and the person has sufficient knowledge and experience in financial matters to be capable of evaluating the risks of transactions in penny stocks.\n- 13 -\nThe broker or dealer must also deliver, prior to any transaction in a penny stock, a disclosure schedule prescribed by the Securities and Exchange Commission (\u201cSEC\u201d) relating to the penny stock market, which, in highlight form: (a) sets forth the basis on which the broker or dealer made the suitability determination; and (b) that the broker or dealer received a signed, written agreement from the investor prior to the transaction. Generally, brokers may be less willing to execute transactions in securities subject to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules. This may make it more difficult for investors to dispose of our common shares and cause a decline in the market value of our stock.\nDisclosure also has to be made about the risks of investing in penny stocks in both public offerings and in secondary trading and about the commissions payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and the rights and remedies available to an investor in cases of fraud in penny stock transactions. Finally, monthly statements have to be sent disclosing recent price information for the penny stock held in the account and information on the limited market in penny stocks.\nBecause we do not intend to pay any cash dividends on our Common Stock, our stockholders will not be able to receive a return on their shares unless they sell them.\nWe intend to retain any future earnings to finance the development and expansion of our business. We do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. Unless we pay dividends, our stockholders will not be able to receive a return on their shares unless they sell them. We cannot assure you that you will be able to sell shares when you desire to do so.", "PERMNO": 16834, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "TYME"}
