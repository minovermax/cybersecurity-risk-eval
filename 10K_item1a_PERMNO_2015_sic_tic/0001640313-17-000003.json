{"cik": "1640313", "company": "Amplify Snack Brands, INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2017-03-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nCertain factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and related notes. Any of the following risks could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results, financial condition, or prospects and cause the value of our common stock to decline, which could cause investors to lose all or part of their investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nRisks Related to Our Products\nWe rely on sales to a limited number of distributors and retailers for the substantial majority of our net sales, and the loss of one or more such distributors or retailers may harm our business.\nA substantial majority of our sales are generated from a limited number of distributors and retailers, which we refer to as customers. For the year ended December 31, 2016, sales to our two largest customers, Costco and Sam\u2019s Club, represented approximately 26% and 14% of our North America segment's net sales, respectively, and 22% and 12% of our consolidated net sales, respectively. Within our International segment, one customer represented 11% of the segment's net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016, none of which comprised more than 10% of our consolidated net sales. In addition, Costco and Sam's accounted for approximately 12% of our consolidated accounts receivable as of December 31, 2016. Although the composition of our significant customers may vary from period to period, we expect that most of our net sales and accounts receivable will continue to come from a relatively small number of customers for the foreseeable future. We do not have commitments or minimum volumes that ensure future sales of\nour products to any of our customers. Consequently, our financial results may fluctuate significantly from period to period based on the actions of one or more significant customers. A customer may take actions that affect us for reasons that we cannot always anticipate or control, such as their financial condition, changes in their business strategy or operations, the introduction of competing products or the perceived quality of our products. In addition, despite operating in different channels, our retailers sometimes compete for the same consumers. As a result of actual or perceived conflicts resulting from this competition, customers may take actions that negatively affect us. The loss of, or a reduction in sales or anticipated sales to, one or more of our most significant distributors or retailers may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operation and financial condition.\nFurther, over the last several years our anchor brand SkinnyPop, has gained several new relationships with some of the largest U.S. retail chains such as Walmart, Target, Albertsons, Safeway and CVS Pharmacy, and these customers may find, as they gain more experience selling our products, that their respective abilities to sell SkinnyPop products does not meet their expectations or they may not continue to place orders for our products. In 2016, we expanded our distribution of the Oatmega and Paqui brands to Target and Walmart. We can provide no assurance these brands will meet the retailer's sales expectations.\nTyrrells Group products including Tyrrells brand, Lisa's brand, the Wholesome Food Company brand, the Thomas Chipman brand, in addition to the private label products are sold in over 30 countries throughout the world. Some of these relationships we have with retailers are in excess of 10 years, however some of our relationships are relatively new. In particular, there are countries, such as China, that we have little experience operating in and our customer relationships have been short in duration.\nSales of a limited number of SkinnyPop and Tyrrells products and flavors contributed almost all of our historical profitability and cash flow. A reduction in the sale of our SkinnyPop and Tyrrells products would have a material adverse effect on our ability to remain profitable and achieve future growth.\nThe majority of our net sales for the year ended December 31, 2016 resulted from sales of our SkinnyPop products. The majority of our SkinnyPop branded net sales came from a variety of stock-keeping-units, or SKUs, under our Original flavor. Most of SkinnyPop's secondary flavors, White Cheddar Flavor, Naturally Sweet, and Sea Salt & Black Pepper flavored SKUs, were first introduced in late 2013 or 2014, and Dusted Dark Chocolate and Jalape\u00f1o, were introduced in early 2016, represent a relatively small portion of our sales. Historically the majority of Tyrrells sales have been derived from five core flavors; lightly salted, sea salt and cider vinegar, sweet chili and red pepper, mature cheddar and chives and mixed root vegetable chips. We cannot be certain that we will be able to continue to commercialize or expand distribution of our existing flavors of products or that any of our future food products and flavors will be accepted in their markets. Any inability on our part to stay current with food and consumer trends through new products could have a material adverse effect on our business performance.\nBecause sales of our SkinnyPop products make up much of our historical profitability and cash flows, reductions in sales of SkinnyPop products in particular will have an adverse effect on our profitability and ability to generate cash to fund our product development, research and development efforts or potential acquisitions.\nThe following factors, among others, could affect continued market acceptance and profitability of SkinnyPop products:\n\u2022\nthe introduction of competitive products;\n\u2022\nchanges in consumer preferences among RTE popcorn and other snack food products;\n\u2022\nchanges in consumer eating and snacking habits, including trends away from certain categories, including major allergen-free, gluten-free and non-GMO products;\n\u2022\nchanges in awareness of the social effects of farming and food production;\n\u2022\nchanges in consumer perception about trendy snack products;\n\u2022\nchanges in consumer perception regarding the healthfulness or BFY nature of our products;\n\u2022\nthe level and effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts;\n\u2022\nany unfavorable publicity regarding RTE popcorn products or similar products;\n\u2022\nany unfavorable publicity regarding the SkinnyPop brand;\n\u2022\nlitigation or threats of litigation with respect to our products;\n\u2022\nthe price of our products relative to other competing products;\n\u2022\nprice increases resulting from rising commodity costs;\n\u2022\nany changes in government policies and practices related to our products, labeling and markets;\n\u2022\nregulatory developments affecting the manufacturing, labeling, marketing or use of our products;\n\u2022\nnew science or research that disputes the healthfulness of our products; and\n\u2022\nadverse decisions or rulings limiting our ability to promote the benefits of popcorn products.\nAdverse developments with respect to the sale of SkinnyPop products would significantly reduce our net sales and profitability and have a material adverse effect on our ability to maintain profitability and achieve our business plan.\nWe currently depend primarily on one third-party co-manufacturer with two locations to manufacture the substantial majority of our SkinnyPop products. The loss of this co-manufacturer or the inability of this co-manufacturer to fulfill our orders would adversely affect our ability to make timely deliveries of our product and would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nCurrently, the substantial majority of our SkinnyPop products are produced by one third-party co-manufacturer, which maintains only two facilities for all of its customers. Our agreement with our primary third-party co-manufacturer provides that we will order a minimum amount of products each year during the agreement\u2019s term. If we do not meet the minimum order amount, we must pay a penalty fee if such third-party co-manufacturer is no longer our exclusive manufacturer. The agreement may be terminated by us upon written notice and the payment of a termination fee. There can be no assurance that the third-party co-manufacturer's capacity will be sufficient to fulfill our orders, and while we recently added an additional co-manufacturer, any supply shortfall could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nAdditionally, we face the risk of disruption to our production and sales processes if our primary third-party co-manufacturer is unable or unwilling to produce sufficient quantities of our SkinnyPop products in a timely manner or renew contracts with us or suffers a natural disaster, fire, power interruption, work stoppage or other unanticipated catastrophic event. In addition, we are responsible for any increase in either of our third-party co-manufacturers' costs and may not be able to pass these costs on to our customers. In order to continue manufacturing our products in the event of a disruption to our production and sales processes, we would have to increase our reliance on our other third-party co-manufacturer or identify and qualify new manufacturers, including obtaining third party certifications for claims, which we may be unable to do in a timely manner, if at all.\nFrom time to time, we need to seek new manufacturers or enter into new arrangements with our existing manufacturers. However, only a limited number of manufacturers may have the ability to produce our products at the volumes we need, and it could take a significant period of time to locate and qualify such alternative production sources. Moreover, it may be difficult or expensive to find manufacturers to produce small volumes of our new products. Manufacturers may impose minimum order requirements and any failure on our part to meet these requirements could increase our costs. There can also be no assurance that we would be able to identify and qualify new manufacturers in a timely manner or that such manufacturers could allocate sufficient capacity in order to meet our requirements, which could materially adversely affect our ability to make timely deliveries of product. In addition, we may be unable to negotiate pricing or other terms with our existing or new manufacturers as favorable as what we currently enjoy. Furthermore, there is no guarantee a new third-party manufacturing partner could accurately replicate the production process and taste profile of our existing products.\nGiven that our primary third-party co-manufacturer's two operating facilities are in close geographic proximity to one another, shipments to and from the warehouses where our products are stored could be delayed for a variety of reasons, including weather conditions, strikes and shipping delays. Any significant delay in the shipments of product would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition and could cause our sales and profitability to fluctuate during a particular period or periods.\nWe rely, in part, on our third-party co-manufacturers to maintain the quality of our products. The failure or inability of these co-manufacturers to comply with the specifications and requirements of our products could result in product recall and could adversely affect our reputation.\nOur third-party co-manufacturers are required to maintain the quality of our products and to comply with our product specifications and requirements for certain certifications. Our third-party co-manufacturers are also required to comply with all federal, state and local laws with respect to food safety. Additionally, certain retail customers, such as Costco, require our third-party co-manufacturers to maintain minimum independent certifications, such as SQF Level 2 Certification or Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (\"HACCP\"), certification. However, our third-party co-manufacturers may not continue to produce products that are consistent with our standards or that are in compliance with required certification programs or applicable laws, and we cannot guarantee that we will be able to identify instances in which our third-party co-manufacturers fail to comply with such programs or laws. Any such failure, particularly if it is not identified by us, could harm our brand and reputation as well as our customer relationships. We would have\nthese same issues with any new co-manufacturer, and they may be exacerbated due to the newness of the relationship. The failure of any manufacturer to produce products that conform to our standards could materially and adversely affect our reputation in the marketplace and result in product recalls, product liability claims and severe economic loss.\nWe have undertaken efforts to expand our product portfolio with the acquisition of Tyrrells Group. If we do not realize the expected benefits, including synergies, from the Tyrrells Group acquisition, our business and results of operations will suffer.\nOn September 2, 2016, we completed our acquisition of Tyrrells Group, a company incorporated under the laws of England and Wales, which owns the Tyrrells Group's international portfolio of premium snack brands. We acquired all of the outstanding equity interests of Tyrrells Group for total consideration of approximately $416.4 million.\nSince the acquisition of Tyrrells Group, our business has become significantly larger and more complex. Our future success significantly depends upon our ability to manage our expanded enterprise, including multiple locations, which pose substantial challenges for management, including challenges related to the management and monitoring of new operations and associated increased costs and complexity. In order to support this expanded enterprise in the future, we need to achieve net sales from the Tyrrells Group businesses and synergies consistent with our business expectations, which may prove more difficult than currently expected. Any failure to achieve the expected level of net sales and synergies could affect our profitability, our ability to service the debt that we took on to partially fund this acquisition, and our ability to meet the financial covenants under our Credit Facility with our lenders.\nWith the acquisition of Tyrrells Group, we are exposed to numerous risks and uncertainties which could adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nStrategic and transformative transactions like our recent acquisition of Tyrrells Group create numerous uncertainties and risks. With the consummation of the acquisition, Tyrrells Group became a wholly-owned subsidiary of Amplify and has significantly broadened our operations in foreign countries. This addition to our business will entail many changes, including the integration of Tyrrells Group and its personnel, changes in systems and employee benefit plans and management of multiple geographic locations across the world. These transition activities are complex and we may encounter unexpected difficulties, incur unexpected costs or experience business disruptions, including as a result of:\n\u2022\nincreased commitments for the management team, including the need to divert management's attention to integration matters, particularly if we are unable to retain key personnel;\n\u2022\ndifficulties realizing the revenue projections, financial benefits, synergies and other strategic opportunities anticipated in connection with the transaction;\n\u2022\nour inexperience with maintaining multiple geographic locations spread out across the world;\n\u2022\nchallenges in leveraging our commercial expertise, which could result in unforeseen expenses and disrupt our business operations; and\n\u2022\ndifficulties in the assimilation and retention of employees, including key personnel responsible for the success of Tyrrells Group.\nIf any of these factors limits our ability to integrate Tyrrells Group into our operations successfully or on a timely basis, the expectations of future results of operations, including certain synergies expected to result from the acquisition, might not be met. As a result, we may not be able to realize the expected benefits that we seek to achieve from the acquisition, which could also affect our ability to service our debt obligations. In addition, we may be required to spend additional time or money on integration that otherwise would be spent on the development and expansion of our business, including efforts to further expand our product portfolio.\nFurther, the market price of our stock may decline if our integration of Tyrrells Group is unsuccessful, integration and synergies take longer than expected or the acquisition fails to achieve financial benefits to the extent anticipated by us, financial analysts or investors, or the effect of the acquisition on our post-closing financial results is otherwise not consistent with our expectations or those of our financial analysts or investors.\nOur level of indebtedness and the terms of the Credit Facility could adversely affect our operations and limit our ability to plan for or respond to changes in our business or acquire additional products for our portfolio. If we are unable to comply with restrictions in the Credit Facility or cannot make payments on the Credit Facility, the repayment of our indebtedness could be accelerated.\nTo consummate the Tyrrells Group acquisition, we incurred a substantial amount of additional debt, which could adversely affect our business. As of December 31, 2016, we had $614.9 million of total debt outstanding. In September 2016, we entered into a Credit Facility which provided for Term Loans in the aggregate principal amount of $600 million and Revolving Loans in the aggregate principal amount of $50 million. As of December 31, 2016, our Term Loans and Revolving Loans had a floating interest rate of 6.50% and 6.23% per annum, respectively. Our high level of indebtedness could adversely affect our business in the following ways, among other things:\n\u2022\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations under our current debt obligations, or other indebtedness, as well as our contractual and commercial commitments, and could increase the risk that we may default on our debt obligations;\n\u2022\nrequire us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to pay interest and principal on our current debt obligations, or other indebtedness, which would reduce the funds available for working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022\nlimit our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other investments, or general corporate purposes, which may limit the ability to execute our business strategy;\n\u2022\nheighten our vulnerability to downturns in our business, our industry or in the general economy and restrict us from exploiting business opportunities or making acquisitions;\n\u2022\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to those of our competitors that may have proportionately less debt;\n\u2022\nlimit management\u2019s discretion in operating our business;\n\u2022\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business, the industry in which we operate or the general economy; and\n\u2022\nresult in higher interest expense if interest rates increase and we have outstanding floating rate borrowings.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive and other factors that may be beyond our control. Our business may not generate cash flow from operations in the future sufficient to service our debt and support our growth strategies. If we are unable to generate such cash flow, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations, including under our current debt obligations. In addition, if for any reason, we are unable to meet our debt service and repayment obligations, we would be in default under the terms of the agreements governing our indebtedness, which would allow our creditors at that time to declare all outstanding indebtedness to be due and payable. Under these circumstances, our lenders could compel us to apply all of our available cash to repay our indebtedness.\nThe Credit Facility requires us to make certain payments of principal and interest over time and contains a number of other restrictive covenants. The Credit Facility also contains covenants and terms limiting our ability to enter into new acquisitions, licenses, mergers, foreign investments, and to take on new debt and sell assets. The maturity date of the Credit Facility could also be accelerated in certain circumstances, including in the event of an uncured event of default as outlined in the Credit Facility. These and other terms in the Credit Facility have to be monitored closely for compliance and could restrict our ability to grow our business or enter into transactions that we believe will be beneficial to our business.\nOur variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nBorrowings under our Credit Facility will, and other indebtedness we incur in the future may, bear interest at variable rates exposing us to interest rate risk. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same, and our net income and cash available for servicing our indebtedness would decrease. A 100-basis point increase to the interest rate of our variable rate credit facility would result in an approximate $6.1 million increase in interest expense per year.\nExposure to United Kingdom political developments, including the outcome of the United Kingdom referendum on membership in the European Union, could have a material adverse effect on Tyrrells and therefore on us.\nOn June 23, 2016, a referendum was held on the United Kingdom's membership in the European Union, the outcome of which was a vote in favor of leaving the European Union. The United Kingdom's vote to leave the European Union\ncreates an uncertain political and economic environment in the United Kingdom and potentially across other European Union member states, which may last for a number of months or years.\nArticle 50 of the Treaty of the European Union, or Article 50, allows a member state to decide to withdraw from the European Union in accordance with its own constitutional requirements. The formal process for leaving the European Union will be triggered only when the United Kingdom delivers an Article 50 notice to the European Council, although informal negotiations around the terms of any exit may be held before such notice is given. Delivery of the Article 50 notice will start a two-year period for the United Kingdom to exit from the European Union, although this period can be extended with the unanimous agreement of the European Council. Without any such extension (and assuming that the terms of withdrawal have not already been agreed), the United Kingdom's membership in the European Union would end automatically on the expiration of that two-year period.\nThe result of the referendum means that the long-term nature of the United Kingdom's relationship with the European Union is unclear and that there is considerable uncertainty as to when any such relationship will be agreed and implemented. In the interim, there is a risk of instability for both the United Kingdom and the European Union, which could adversely affect the results, financial condition and prospects of Tyrrells and could adversely affect our business results, financial condition and prospects as a whole.\nIt is currently expected that the United Kingdom government will shortly commence negotiations in connection with any exit from the European Union and will make a decision regarding the timing for giving an Article 50 notice. There is also considerable uncertainty as to whether, following any Article 50 notice being given, the arrangements for the United Kingdom to leave the European Union will be agreed upon within the two-year period and, if not, whether an extension of that time period would be agreed upon. It is also possible that the European Union will pressure the United Kingdom to exit prior to the end of the two-year period. There is also a risk of the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union being effected without mutually acceptable terms being agreed and that any terms of such exit could adversely affect our operating results, financial condition and prospects of Tyrrells and could adversely affect our business results, financial condition and prospects as a whole.\nThe political and economic instability created by the United Kingdom's vote to leave the European Union has caused and may continue to cause significant volatility in global financial markets and the value of the Pound Sterling currency or other currencies, including the Euro. Depending on the terms reached regarding any exit from the European Union, it is possible that there may be adverse practical and/or operational implications on the business of Tyrrells and on our business as a whole.\nConsequently, no assurance can be given as to the impact of the referendum outcome and, in particular, no assurance can be given that the result will not adversely impact the operating results, financial condition and prospects of Tyrrells and our operating results, financial condition and prospects as a whole.\nWe face risks associated with conducting business in foreign markets.\nSince completing the acquisition of Tyrrells Group, we have begun making substantial sales in foreign countries. The risk of inadequate intellectual property protections and differences in packaging, labeling, food and related laws, rules and regulations are all substantial matters that need to be continually evaluated while doing business in new territories. Additionally, Tyrrells Group's foreign sales and acquisitions could be adversely affected by economic, legal, political and regulatory developments in the countries in which we do business in the future or in which we expand our business, particularly those countries that have historically experienced a high degree of political or economic instability.\nExamples of risks inherent in doing business outside of North America include changes in the political and economic conditions in the countries in which we operate, unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, changes in tariffs, the adoption of foreign or U.S. laws limiting exports to or imports from certain foreign countries, fluctuations in currency exchange rates and the value of the U.S. dollar, restrictions on repatriation of earnings, expropriation of property without fair compensation, weak protection of intellectual property rights and the acceptance of business practices that are not consistent with or are antithetical to prevailing business practices we are accustomed to in the United States, including export compliance and anti-bribery practices and governmental sanctions. We may also face difficulties in operations and diversion of management time in connection with establishing our business in countries where we have not operated before.\nDoing business outside the United States requires us to comply with the laws and regulations of the U.S. government and various foreign jurisdictions, which place restrictions on our operations, trade practices, partners and investment\ndecisions. In particular, our operations are subject to U.S. and foreign anti-corruption and trade control laws and regulations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, export controls and economic sanctions programs, including those administered by the U.S. Treasury Department\u2019s Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC. As a result of doing business in foreign countries and with foreign partners, we are exposed to a heightened risk of violating anti-corruption and trade control laws and sanctions regulations. The FCPA prohibits us from providing anything of value to foreign officials for the purposes of obtaining or retaining business or securing any improper business advantage.\nIn addition, the United Kingdom Bribery Act, or the Bribery Act, extends beyond bribery of foreign public officials and also applies to transactions with individuals that a government does not employ. The provisions of the Bribery Act are also more onerous than the FCPA in a number of other respects, including jurisdiction, non-exemption of facilitation payments and penalties. Our continued expansion outside the United States, including in developing countries, and our development of new partnerships and joint venture relationships worldwide, could increase the risk of FCPA, OFAC or Bribery Act violations in the future. Violations of anti-corruption and trade control laws and sanctions regulations are punishable by civil penalties, including fines, denial of export privileges, injunctions, asset seizures, debarment from government contracts and revocations or restrictions of licenses, as well as criminal fines and imprisonment.\nWe do not have any contracts with our customers that require the purchase of a minimum amount of our products. The absence of such contracts could result in periods during which we must continue to pay costs and service indebtedness with reduced sales.\nOur customers do not provide us with firm, long-term or short-term volume purchase commitments. As a result of the absence of such contracts, we could have periods during which we have no or limited orders for our products, but we will continue to have to pay our costs, including those to maintain our work force and service our indebtedness with reduced sales. We cannot assure you that we will be able to timely find new customers to supplement periods where we experience no or limited purchase orders or that we can recover fixed costs as a result of experiencing reduced purchase orders. Periods of no or limited purchase orders for our products could have a material adverse effect on our net income, cause us to incur losses or result in violations of the covenants contained in our Credit Facility.\nConversely, we may experience unanticipated increased orders for our products from these customers that can create supply chain problems and may result in orders we may be unable to meet. Unanticipated fluctuations in product requirements by our customers could result in fluctuations in our results from quarter to quarter.\nBecause we rely on a limited number of raw materials to create our products and a limited number of third-party suppliers to supply our raw materials, we may not be able to obtain raw materials on a timely basis, at cost-effective pricing or in sufficient quantities to produce our products.\nThe principal ingredients to manufacture our products include, without limitation, popcorn kernels, white corn, potatoes, root vegetables, sunflower oil, canola oil, whey protein, oats and seasonings. There may be a limited market supply of any of our core ingredients, including in particular the specific popcorn kernel we use in our SkinnyPop products. In addition to the market limitations of the raw materials used to make our products, we rely on a limited number of third-party suppliers to supply us with such raw materials. Although we have multiple suppliers for some of our principal ingredients, we have more limited numbers of suppliers for other principal ingredients, including two suppliers for the sunflower oil and two suppliers for the popcorn kernels used in our products. Our Tyrrells Group businesses, currently individually single source many of their ingredients, but we believe these ingredients are readily available from other suppliers. Any ordering error on our part or disruption in the supply of our principal ingredients could have a material adverse effect on our business, particularly our profitability and our margins. Our financial performance depends in large part on our ability to arrange for the purchase of raw materials in sufficient quantities at competitive prices. We are not assured of continued supply, pricing or exclusive access to raw materials from these sources. Any of our suppliers could discontinue or seek to alter their relationships with us. Additionally, we may be adversely affected if there are increases in demand for the specific raw materials we use in our products, there is a reduction in overall supply of our required raw materials or our suppliers raise their prices, stop selling to us or our third-party manufacturer or enter into arrangements that impair their abilities to provide us or our third-party manufacturer with raw materials.\nEvents that adversely affect our suppliers could impair our ability to obtain raw material inventory in the quantities that we desire. Such events include problems with our suppliers\u2019 businesses, finances, labor relations, ability to import raw materials, costs, production, insurance, reputation and weather conditions during growing, harvesting or shipping, including flood, drought, frost and earthquakes, as well as natural or man-made disasters or other catastrophic occurrences.\nIf we experience significant increased demand for our products, or need to replace an existing supplier, there can be no assurance that additional supplies of raw materials will be available when required on acceptable terms, or at all, or that any supplier would allocate sufficient capacity to us in order to meet our requirements, fill our orders in a timely manner or meet our strict quality standards. Even if our existing suppliers are able to expand their capacities to meet our needs or we are able to find new sources of raw materials, we may encounter delays in production, inconsistencies in quality and added costs. We are not able to pass increased costs onto the customer immediately, if at all, which may decrease or eliminate our profitability in any period. Any delays or interruption in, or increased costs of, our supply of raw materials could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet consumer demand for our products and result in lower net sales and profitability both in the short and long term.\nAs a food production company, all of our products must be compliant with regulations by the Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and other international regulatory agencies, and in addition a number of our products rely on independent certification that they are non-GMO, gluten-free, organic or Kosher. Any non-compliance with the FDA, or other international regulatory agencies, or the loss of any such certification could harm our business.\nWe must comply with various FDA rules and regulations, including those regarding product manufacturing, food safety, required testing and appropriate labeling of our products. Internationally, we are subject to the laws and regulatory authorities of the foreign jurisdictions in which we manufacture and sell our products, including the Food Standards Agency in the United Kingdom and European Food Safety Authority which supports the European Commission, as well as individual country, province, state and local regulations. It is possible that regulations by these agencies and their interpretation thereof may change over time. As such, there is a risk that our products could become non-compliant with the applicable regulations and any such non-compliance could harm our business. In addition, we rely on independent certification of our non-GMO, gluten-free and Kosher products and must comply with the requirements of independent organizations or certification authorities in order to label our products as such. Currently, the FDA does not directly regulate the labeling of Kosher or non-GMO products as such. The FDA has defined the term \u201cgluten-free\u201d and we must comply with the FDA\u2019s definition if we include this label on our products. Our products could lose their non-GMO and gluten-free certifications if our raw material suppliers lose their product certifications for those specified claims. We could also lose our Kosher product certification if a contract manufacturing plant is found to be in violation of required manufacturing or cleaning processes. The loss of any of these independent certifications, including for reasons outside of our control, could harm our business.\nWe also must comply with state rules and regulations, including in California, Proposition 65. Interpretation and application of such rules, including potential differences in application on a state by state basis, may give rise to uncertainty as to the appropriate labeling and formulation of our products. In addition, the FDA has passed new labeling guidelines that will affect the labeling of both the front and back of many of our products. We are reviewing and revising our labeling activities in anticipation of those rules coming into effect. The application and enforcement around the new FDA regulations remains the subject of considerable uncertainty as the FDA is expected to provide further guidelines.\nWe must expend resources to create consumer awareness, build brand loyalty and generate interest in our products. In addition, competitors may offer significant price reductions, and we cannot ensure that consumers will find our products suitably differentiated from products of our competitors.\nOur ability to develop, market and sell new and existing products at an appropriate price may be hampered by unfavorable terms of sale imposed by our customers, the inability to obtain shelf space or preferable shelf placement for our products at a reasonable cost or, once placed, the failure to have an attractive price set for our products. Competitors, many of whom have greater resources than us, vie for the same shelf placement and may offer incentives to the retailers that we cannot match. In addition, unattractive shelf placement and pricing may put us at a disadvantage to our competitors.\nEven if we do obtain shelf space or preferable shelf placement, our new and existing products may fail to achieve the sales expectations set by our retailers, potentially causing these retailers to remove our products from the shelf. Additionally, an increase in the number and quality of private-label products in the product categories in which we compete could create more pressure for shelf space and placement for branded products within each such category, which could adversely affect our sales.\nTo obtain and keep shelf placement for our products, we may need to increase our marketing and advertising spending in order to create consumer awareness, protect and grow our existing market share or to promote new products, which\ncould impact our operating results. In addition, we consistently evaluate our product lines to determine whether or not to discontinue certain products. Discontinuing product lines may increase our profitability but could reduce our sales and hurt our brand, and a reduction in sales of certain products could result in a reduction in sales of other products. We cannot assure you that the discontinuation of product lines will not have an adverse effect on our business.\nIngredient and packaging costs are volatile and may rise significantly, which may negatively impact the profitability of our business.\nWe purchase large quantities of raw materials, including ingredients such as popcorn kernels, white corn, potatoes, root vegetables, sunflower oil, canola oil, whey protein, oats, seasonings and salt. In addition, we purchase and use significant quantities of film and corrugate to package our products. In recent periods, the prices of yellow corn (which impacts the price of popcorn kernels), white corn, canola oil, sunflower oil and fuel have been priced below their respective historical five-year averages and we have realized some benefits from these low prices in the form of reduced cost of goods sold and resulting higher gross profit margins. Costs of ingredients and packaging are volatile and can fluctuate due to conditions that are difficult to predict, including global competition for resources, weather conditions, natural or man-made disasters, consumer demand and changes in governmental trade and agricultural programs. In particular, the availability, quality and cost of our specific type of popcorn kernels, potatoes and sunflower oil are subject to risks inherent to farming, such as crop size, quality and yield fluctuations caused by poor weather and growing conditions, pest and disease problems and other factors beyond our control. Continued volatility in the prices of raw materials and other supplies we purchase could increase our cost of goods sold and reduce our profitability.\nWe currently secure raw materials capacity and pricing for up to two years forward on certain raw materials and not more than a year forward on other raw materials. We do not hedge pricing or availability of any raw materials. As such, any material upward movement in raw materials pricing could negatively impact our margins, if we are not able to pass these costs on to our customers, or sales if we are forced to increase our prices. Additionally, should raw materials prices move meaningfully lower, there is no guarantee our customers will not ask us to pass some or all of our savings on to them in the form of price reductions. If we are not successful in managing our ingredient and packaging costs, if we are unable to increase our prices to cover increased costs or if such price increases reduce our sales volumes, then such increases in costs will adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nCertain of our raw material contracts have minimum purchase commitments that could require us to continue to purchase raw materials even if our sales have declined. Future raw material prices may be impacted by new laws or regulations, suppliers\u2019 allocations to other purchasers, interruptions in production by suppliers, natural disasters, volatility in the price of crude oil and related petrochemical products and changes in exchange rates.\nIn addition, we compete with other food producers in the procurement of ingredients, such as sunflower oil, which are often less plentiful in the open market than conventional ingredients. If supplies of our core ingredients are reduced or there is greater demand for such ingredients from us and others, we may not be able to obtain sufficient supply on favorable terms, or at all, which could impact our ability to supply products to distributors and retailers and may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nFailure by our transportation providers to deliver our products on time or at all could result in lost sales.\nWe currently rely on third-party transportation providers for a significant portion of our product shipments. Our utilization of delivery services for shipments is subject to risks, including increases in fuel prices, which would increase our shipping costs, and employee strikes and inclement weather, which may impact the ability of providers to provide delivery services that adequately meet our shipping needs. We may, from time to time, change third-party transportation providers, and we could therefore face logistical difficulties that could adversely affect deliveries. In addition, we could incur costs and expend resources in connection with such change. Moreover, we may not be able to obtain terms as favorable as those we receive from the third-party transportation providers that we currently use, which in turn would increase our costs and thereby adversely affect our operating results.\nRisks Related to Our Brands\nChanges in consumer preferences and discretionary spending may have a material adverse effect on our brand loyalty, net sales, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe compete in a market that relies on innovation and evolving consumer preferences. We focus on products that are or are perceived to be BFY, an industry term not defined by the Food and Drug Administration. However, the food\nprocessing industry in general, and the snacking and dietary-need specific industries (including the Kosher, major allergen-free, organic and gluten-free industries) in particular, are subject to changing consumer trends, demands and preferences. Therefore, products once considered BFY may over time become disfavored by consumers or no longer perceived as BFY. Trends within the food industry change often and our failure to anticipate, identify or react to changes in these trends could, among other things, lead to reduced demand and price reductions, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Factors that may affect consumer perception of BFY products include dietary trends and attention to different nutritional aspects of foods, concerns regarding the health effects of specific ingredients and nutrients, trends away from gluten-free or non-GMO products, trends away from specific ingredients in products and increasing awareness of the environmental and social effects of product production. Consumer perceptions of the nutritional profile of gluten-free and non-GMO products may shift, and consumers may perceive food products with fewer carbohydrates, higher levels of protein, lower levels of fat and additional fiber as BFY. Our success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate the tastes and dietary habits of consumers and to offer products that appeal to their needs and preferences on a timely and affordable basis. A change in consumer discretionary spending, due to economic downturn or other reasons may have a material effect on sales. If consumer demand for our products decline, our sales and business would be negatively affected.\nWe may not be able to compete successfully in the highly competitive snack food industry.\nThe market for snack foods is large and intensely competitive. Competitive factors in the snack food industry include product quality and taste, brand awareness among consumers, access to supermarket shelf space, price, advertising and promotion, innovation of on-trend snacks, variety of snacks offered, nutritional content, product packaging and package design. We compete in that market principally on the basis of product taste and quality, but also brand recognition and loyalty, marketing, advertising, price and the ability to satisfy specific consumer dietary needs (including Kosher, major allergen-free and gluten-free needs) against numerous multinational, regional and local companies. With the international expansion of our BFY platform to include SkinnyPop and Tyrrells, the competition risks associated with being on-trend and satisfying consumer dietary demands will increase. Substantial advertising and promotional expenditures may be required to maintain or improve a brand\u2019s market position or to introduce a new product to the market, and participants in our industry are engaging with new media, including consumer outreach through social media and web-based channels. Our ability to compete may be also dependent on whether our products are placed in the BFY snack aisle or in the traditional snack food aisle, or both. An increasing focus on BFY products in the marketplace will likely increase these competitive pressures within the category in future periods.\nA substantial majority of sales in the snack food industry is concentrated among large food companies, including Frito-Lay, Inc. and Walkers, subsidiaries of PepsiCo, Inc., The Kellogg Company, ConAgra Foods, Inc., General Mills, Inc., Snyder\u2019s-Lance, Inc. (including its subsidiary Kettle Foods Inc.) and others that have substantially greater financial and other resources than us and sell brands that are more widely recognized than ours. These and numerous other companies that are actual or potential competitors of ours, many of which have greater financial and other resources (including more employees and more extensive facilities) than us, offer products similar to ours or a wider range of products than we offer. Local or regional markets often have significant smaller competitors, many of whom offer products similar to ours and may have unique ties to regional or national retail chains. Additionally, many of our retail customers, such as Costco, Whole Foods and our U.K. customers in particular have historically emphasized private-label offerings across categories as a key part of their strategy and these customers may create or expand competitive private-label product offerings. With expansion of our operations into new markets, we have and will continue to encounter significant competition from multinational, national, regional and local competitors that may be greater than that encountered by us in our existing markets. In addition, these competitors may challenge our position in our existing markets.\nAll of our sales involve the sale of BFY snack food products, which has various risks and uncertainties.\nAll of our sales involve the sale of products designed to be BFY snack food options. While BFY snack food products are currently popular and sales of such products have been increasing rapidly, consumers may not continue to be interested in BFY snack food products. Consumers may in the future choose to purchase other products that they perceive to be BFY or more \u201ctrendy\u201d at a future time. Consumers may prefer products with fewer carbohydrates, higher levels of protein, lower levels of certain nutrients including fat, additional fiber or different nutritional characteristics that do not favor our products or sub-segments in general. In addition, our business could be adversely affected if larger, well-capitalized companies elect to either enter into the healthier snack food space or competed in irrational ways that could damage our margins, or if lower-priced private-label products gain market share. We also face the risk that competitors may significantly improve the taste and quality of the BFY snack foods they sell that are competitive with our products. Additionally, we face the risk our retail customers may request or require our products to deliver\ncertain new \u201con trend\u201d attributes in our products, which may either be impossible for us to achieve or cost prohibitive for us to deliver.\nOur reputation as a producer of BFY products may be diminished due to real or perceived quality or health issues with our products or a change in consumers\u2019 perception of what is BFY itself, which could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nWe believe consumers of our products rely on us to provide them with high-quality, BFY food products containing no GMOs, gluten or major allergens and is organic. Concerns regarding the ingredients used in our products or the healthfulness, safety or quality of our products or our supply chain may cause consumers to stop purchasing our products, even if the basis for the concern is unfounded, has been addressed or is outside of our control. Although we believe we have a rigorous quality control process, there can be no assurance that our products will always comply with the standards we set for our products. Adverse publicity about the healthfulness, safety or quality of our products, whether or not ultimately based on fact, may discourage consumers from buying our products and have an adverse effect on our brand, reputation and operating results.\nWe have no control over our products once purchased by consumers. Accordingly, consumers may store our products for long periods of time, which may adversely affect the quality of our products. If consumers do not perceive our products to be of high quality, then the value of our brand would be diminished, and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nAny loss of confidence on the part of consumers in the ingredients used in our products or in the safety and quality of our products may be difficult and costly to overcome. Any such adverse effect could be exacerbated by our position in the market as a purveyor of high-quality, BFY food products and may significantly reduce our brand value. Issues regarding the safety of any of our products, regardless of the cause, may have a substantial and adverse effect on our brand, reputation and operating results.\nOur SkinnyPop brand is of significant value and our brand and reputation may be diminished due to possible consumer disagreement with the use of the word \u201cSkinny\u201d on our product, differences in opinion as to what products are \u201cSkinny\u201d or increased negative connotation with the word \u201cSkinny\u201d. We may be subject to claims or litigation concerning our branding or labeling practices. Food product companies are, from time to time, subject to class action lawsuits related their branding or labeling. In 2014, we settled one such lawsuit for a nominal amount. Related or similar claims or lawsuits may be brought against us in the future. Additionally, changes in applicable laws or regulations, or evolving interpretations thereof, could necessitate changes to our branding or labeling. While we have never claimed that SkinnyPop is a low-fat product, the FDA and FTC currently have no definition of the word \u201cSkinny\u201d and could, in the future, define the term in a way that is not favorable to our existing product branding or labeling.\nConsumers\u2019 loyalty to our brands may change due to factors beyond our control, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nOur business currently depends in a large part on repeat purchases by the same consumers. We believe this purchasing pattern is indicative of brand loyalty. However, these consumers are under no obligation to continue to repeatedly purchase our product and could stop purchasing our product at any time. These consumers could cease purchasing our product for any number of reasons, some of which are beyond our control, including changing consumer trends, negative publicity regarding our brand, real or perceived quality or health issues with our products, a change in consumers\u2019 perception of BFY, or the availability of lower priced alternative snack products, or for no reason at all. Erosion of our brand loyalty and the resulting decreased sales to consumers could have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nWe face competition in our business from generic or store branded products which may result in decreased demand for our products and pricing pressures.\nWe are subject to competition from companies, including from some of our customers, that either currently manufacture or are developing products directly in competition with our products. These generic or store-branded products may be a less expensive option for consumers than our products making it more difficult to sell our product. For example, Costco is well known for its Kirkland Signature brand, which offers high-quality products across a variety of categories at lower price points than many branded products. The development of competing Kirkland Signature products may cause Costco to decrease their orders of our products, require us to reduce the pricing of our products or drive Costco to change the shelf placement of our products in a detrimental way. Kroger, one of our largest customers, already competes with us through their Simple Truth RTE popcorn brand. Within the United Kingdom, our largest customers Tesco, Lidl, Sainsbury and Coop, purchase both branded and private labeling offerings from us. If these customers ceased to purchase our branded products or selected another third-party manufacturer for their private label products, our financial results could be adversely effected. Similarly, other large retail customers could follow similar private-label strategies. Our Tyrrells' brands and their international subsidiaries face significant competition from private label brands as most of their customers have a private label offering, some of which are manufactured by Tyrrells and their subsidiaries. In future years, we may experience competition-induced pricing pressure from our customers due to such competition, which could have a material and adverse effect on our operating results.\nIf our brand or reputation is damaged, the attractive characteristics that we offer retailers may diminish, which could adversely affect the value of our platform.\nWe are currently an attractive brand for our customers because our products generate a high level of retail sales at a premium margin relative to their shelf space. This is due to both our premium price point and our sales velocity. If our brand or reputation is damaged for any reason, consumers may no longer be willing to pay a premium price for our products and we may no longer be able to generate a high sales velocity at our then-current prices. If we no longer offer these characteristics, customers may decrease their orders of our products and downgrade the in-store placement of our products, which could have an adverse effect on our business and platform.\nRisks Related to Our Business Generally\nOur gross profit margins may be impacted by a variety of factors, including but not limited to variations in raw materials pricing, retail customer requirements and mix, sales velocities and required promotional support.\nWe have operated our company with strong gross profit margins as compared to other food and snacking companies. While we expect our gross profit to increase in absolute dollars in future periods, we expect that our gross profit as a percentage of net sales will decrease as a result of the competitive and other factors described herein. Our gross profit is impacted by a number of factors, including product pricing, raw material, labor, packaging and fuel costs. Our Paqui, Oatmega and Tyrrells Group brands typically operate at lower gross margins than our SkinnyPop products, primary due to ingredient costs. Should the competitive dynamic change in our industry (which could impact our margins through forces including but not limited to requiring us to alter our pricing strategy or requiring additional promotional activity), raw materials prices increase dramatically, or any of our customer relationships change materially, then we may not be able to continue to operate at our current margins. Additionally, should unforeseen events require our company to make significant and unplanned investments in additional infrastructure or marketing activities, our gross margins could be materially reduced.\nWe may be subject to significant liability should the consumption of any of our products cause or be claimed to cause illness or physical harm.\nWe sell products for human consumption, which involves risks such as product contamination or spoilage, product tampering, other adulteration, mislabeling and misbranding. Under certain circumstances, we may be required to, or may voluntarily, recall or withdraw products. A widespread product recall or product withdrawal may negatively and significantly impact our sales and profitability for a period of time and could result in significant losses depending on the costs of the recall, the destruction of product inventory, product availability, competitive reaction and customer and consumer reaction. We may also be subject to claims or lawsuits resulting in liability for actual or claimed injuries, illness or death. Any of these events may result in a material adverse effect on our business. Even if a product liability claim or lawsuit is unsuccessful or is not fully pursued, the negative publicity surrounding any assertion that our products caused illness or physical harm could adversely affect our reputation with existing and potential customers and consumers and our corporate and brand image. Moreover, claims or liabilities of this sort might not be covered by our\ninsurance or by any rights of indemnity or contribution that we may have against others. We maintain product liability insurance in an amount that we believe to be adequate. However, we cannot be sure that we will not incur claims or liabilities for which we are not insured or that exceed the amount of our insurance coverage. A product liability judgment against us or a product recall could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nLitigation or legal proceedings could expose us to significant liabilities and have a negative impact on our reputation.\nFrom time to time, we may be party to various claims and litigation proceedings. We evaluate these claims and litigation proceedings to assess the likelihood of unfavorable outcomes and to estimate, if possible, the amount of potential losses. Based on these assessments and estimates, we establish reserves, as appropriate. These assessments and estimates are based on the information available to management at the time and involve a significant amount of management judgment. Actual outcomes or losses may differ materially from our current assessments and estimates.\nFor example, in 2014, a putative class action lawsuit was filed against our Predecessor related to the compliance of its product labels with various state and federal laws. The case settled for a nominal amount and was later dismissed with prejudice in July 2014 after SkinnyPop Popcorn LLC updated its product labels. From time to time, we have received threats by plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys to bring similar class action lawsuits related to other alleged product label claims, including relating to the BFY nature of our products. For example, a lawsuit has been filed against the company in Missouri state court alleging that our prior use of the term \"evaporated cane juice\" was misleading. The complaint has not yet been served. We believe the alleged claims lack merit and involve a nominal amount of sales in Missouri that we do not believe would have a material adverse impact on our business or results of operations. We would vigorously defend this and any threatened lawsuit if brought. Such a lawsuit or related or similar claims or lawsuits may be brought against us in the future and the cost of defending against any such claims could be significant.\nThere is an additional risk that these types of suits may lead to consumer confusion, distrust and additional legal challenges for companies faced with them. Should we become subject to related or additional unforeseen lawsuits, including claims related to our products or their labeling or advertising, consumers may avoid purchasing our products or seek alternative products, even if the basis for the claims against us is unfounded. Additionally, adverse publicity about any lawsuit in which we are involved may further discourage consumers from buying our products. Any loss of confidence on the part of consumers in the truthfulness of our labeling or ingredient claims would be difficult and costly to overcome and may significantly reduce our brand value. Uncertainty as to the ingredients used in our products, regardless of the cause, may have a substantial and adverse effect on our brand and our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, some lawsuits have been filed against companies who make \u201cnatural\u201d claims on their products. We make no \u201cnatural\u201d claims on our products.\nWe have also been a party to several claims and proceedings in both the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and federal court regarding competitors\u2019 attempted or actual infringement of the \u201cSKINNYPOP\u201d trademark. Each of these proceedings has resulted in a resolution whereby the competitor has expressly acknowledged our exclusive trademark rights to use \u201cSKINNY\u201d with respect to popcorn products. In some instances, however, we have expressly acknowledged the competitor\u2019s rights to the term \u201cSKINNY\u201d with respect to non-popcorn snack foods. Additional matters may continue to arise from time to time where other competitors use the term \u201cSKINNY\u201d to refer to their products, and we may or may not be able to assert our trademark rights based on the specific facts in each case. We will continue to monitor and address such facts on a case-by-case basis.\nWe may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights that are material to our business.\nOur ability to compete effectively depends in part upon protection of our rights in trademarks, trade dress, copyrights and other intellectual property rights we own or license. Our use of contractual provisions, confidentiality procedures and agreements, and trademark, copyright, unfair competition, trade secret and other laws to protect our intellectual property and other proprietary rights may not be adequate. For example, we may not be able to preclude third parties from using the term \u201cSKINNY\u201d with respect to food or beverage products, and may not be able to leverage our branding beyond our current product offerings. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights and protect our proprietary information, or to defend against claims by third parties that our products or our use of intellectual property infringe their intellectual property rights. Any litigation or claims brought by or against us could result in substantial costs and diversion of our resources. A successful claim of trademark, copyright or other intellectual property infringement against us could prevent us from providing our products, which could harm our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, a breakdown in our internal policies and procedures may lead to an unintentional disclosure of our proprietary, confidential or material non-public information, which could in turn harm our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may not be successful in implementing our growth strategy, including without limitation, enhancing our brand recognition, increasing distribution of our products, attracting new consumers to our brands, and introducing new products and product extensions, either on a timely basis or at all.\nOur future success depends in large part on our ability to implement our growth strategy, including without limitation, enhancing our brand recognition, increasing distribution of our products, attracting new consumers to our brands, driving repeat purchase of our products and introducing new products and product extensions. Our ability to implement our growth strategy depends, among other things, on our ability to develop new products, identify and acquire additional product lines and businesses, secure shelf space in grocery stores and supermarkets, increase customer awareness of our brands, enter into distribution and other strategic arrangements with third-party retailers and other potential distributors of our products and compete with numerous other companies and products. In late 2014 and early 2015, SkinnyPop achieved significant distribution gains with some of the largest U.S. retail chains, including Walmart, Target and CVS Pharmacy. We cannot provide assurances to you that these customers will achieve performances comparable to our more seasoned retail customers nor that we will continue to expand retail distribution by adding more retail locations or SKU varieties as we have done with several other key customers in the past. We also cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully implement our growth strategy and continue to maintain growth in our sales. If we fail to implement our growth strategy, our sales and profitability may be adversely affected.\nWe may be unable to successfully identify and execute or integrate acquisitions.\nIn April 2015, April 2016, and September 2016 we acquired Paqui, Boundless Nutrition, and Tyrrells Group respectively. In addition, we plan to selectively pursue acquisitions in the future to continue to grow and increase our profitability. Our acquisition strategy is based on identifying and acquiring brands with products that complement our existing products and identifying and acquiring brands in new categories and in new geographies for purposes of expanding our platform of healthier snacks. Although we regularly evaluate multiple acquisition candidates, we cannot be certain that we will be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates, negotiate acquisitions of identified candidates on terms acceptable to us, or integrate acquisitions that we complete.\nAcquisitions involve numerous risks and uncertainties, including intense competition for suitable acquisition targets, which could increase prices and/or adversely affect our ability to consummate deals on favorable or acceptable terms, the potential unavailability of financial resources necessary to consummate acquisitions in the future, the risk that we improperly value and price a target, the potential inability to identify all of the risks and liabilities inherent in a target company notwithstanding our due diligence efforts, the diversion of management\u2019s attention from the operations of our business and strain on our existing personnel, increased leverage due to additional debt financing that may be required to complete an acquisition, dilution of our stockholder\u2019s net current book value per share if we issue additional equity securities to finance an acquisition, difficulties in identifying suitable acquisition targets or in completing any transactions identified on sufficiently favorable terms and the need to obtain regulatory or other governmental approvals that may be necessary to complete acquisitions.\nIn addition, any future acquisitions may pose risks associated with entry into new geographic markets, including outside the United States, distribution channels, lines of business or product categories, where we may not have significant or any prior experience and where we may not be as successful or profitable as we are in businesses and geographic\nregions where we have greater familiarity and brand recognition. Potential acquisitions may also entail significant transaction costs and require a significant amount of management time, even where we are unable to consummate or decide not to pursue a particular transaction.\nIn addition, even when acquisitions, such as the acquisition of Paqui, Boundless Nutrition, and Tyrrells Group are completed, integration of acquired entities can involve significant difficulties, such as failure to achieve financial or operating objectives with respect to an acquisition, strain on our personnel, systems and operational and managerial controls and procedures, the need to modify systems or to add management resources, difficulties in the integration and retention of customers or personnel and the integration and effective deployment of operations or technologies, amortization of acquired assets (which would reduce future reported earnings), possible adverse short-term effects on cash flows or operating results, diversion of management\u2019s attention from the operations of our business, integrating personnel with diverse backgrounds and organizational cultures, coordinating sales and marketing functions and failure to obtain and retain key personnel of an acquired business. Failure to manage these acquisition growth risks could have an adverse effect on us.\nOur continued success depends to a large extent on our ability to innovate successfully and on a cost-effective basis.\nThe food industry and retailers in the grocery industry use new products as a way of creating excitement and variety of choices in order to attract consumers. Therefore, a key element of our growth strategy is to introduce new products and to successfully innovate our existing products and to keep up with changing consumer tastes and trends. Success in product development is affected by our ability to anticipate consumer preferences, to leverage our research and development capabilities, and to utilize our management\u2019s ability to launch new or improved products successfully and on a cost-effective basis. It is possible that we will be unable to develop new products to address consumer demands.\nThe development and introduction of new products requires substantial research and development and marketing expenditures, which we may be unable to recover if the new products do not achieve commercial success and gain widespread market acceptance. Product innovation may also result in increased costs resulting from the use of new manufacturing techniques, capital expenditures, new raw materials and ingredients, new product formulas and possibly new manufacturers. There may also be regulatory restrictions on the production and advertising of our new products, and our new products may cannibalize sales of our existing products. In addition, under-performance of new product launches would damage overall brand credibility with customers and consumers.\nFurther, new products may not achieve success in the marketplace, due to lack of demand, failure to meet consumer tastes or otherwise. If we are unsuccessful in our product innovation efforts and demand for our products declines, our business would be negatively affected.\nSlotting fees and customer charges or charge-backs for promotion allowances, cooperative advertising and damaged, undelivered or unsold food products may have a significant impact on our operating results and may disrupt our customer relationships.\nRetailers in the grocery industry charge slotting fees for access to shelf space and often enter into promotional and advertising arrangements with manufacturers that result in the sharing of promotional and advertising costs among the retail customer, distributor or manufacturer. As the retail grocery industry has consolidated and become more competitive, retail customers have sought greater participation by manufacturers in cooperative promotional and advertising arrangements, and are more inclined to pass on unanticipated increases in promotional and advertising costs to manufacturers. Additionally, retailers are exhibiting a greater willingness to take deductions for damaged, undelivered and unsold products or to return unsold products to manufacturers. If we are charged significant and unanticipated promotional allowances or advertising charges by retail customers, or if our customers take substantial charge-backs or return material amounts of our products, the operating results and liquidity of our business could be harmed, perhaps substantially. Moreover, an unresolved disagreement with a retail customer concerning promotional allowances, advertising charges, charge-backs or returns could significantly disrupt or cause the termination of a customer relationship, immediately reducing our sales and liquidity. Because of the limited number of retail customers in the U.S. grocery market, the loss of even a single retail customer could have a long-term negative impact on our financial condition and net sales.\nChanges in retail distribution arrangements can result in the temporary loss of retail shelf space and disrupt sales of food products, causing our sales to fall.\nFrom time to time, retailers change distribution centers that supply some of their retail stores. If a new distribution center has not previously distributed our products in that region, it may take time to get a retailer\u2019s distribution center to begin distributing new products in its region. Even if a retailer approves the distribution of products in a new region, product sales may decline while the transition in distribution takes place. If we do not get approval to have our products offered in a new distribution region or if getting this approval takes longer than anticipated, our sales and operating results may suffer.\nFluctuations in our results of operations from quarter to quarter because of changes in our promotional activities may impact, and may have a disproportionate effect on, our overall financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is subject to quarterly fluctuations due to the timing of and demand for customer-driven promotional activities, which may have a disproportionate effect on our results of operations. Historically, we have offered a variety of sales and promotion incentives to our customers and to consumers, such as price discounts, consumer coupons, volume rebates, cooperative marketing programs, slotting fees and in-store displays. Our net sales are periodically influenced by the introduction and discontinuance of sales and promotion incentives. Reductions in overall sales and promotion incentives could impact our net sales and affect our results of operations in any particular fiscal quarter.\nWhile we expect our net sales to increase in absolute dollars in future periods, we expect that our net sales growth rate will not keep pace with our net sales growth rate in prior periods, due to the increasing cumulative size of the net sales base on which future growth rates will be measured.\nHistorical quarter-to-quarter and period-over-period comparisons of our sales and operating results are not necessarily indicative of future quarter-to-quarter and period-over-period results. The national launch of our Paqui brand in 2016, our acquisition of Boundless Nutrition in April 2016, and our acquisition of Tyrrells Group in September 2016 will limit the usefulness of comparisons to prior periods. You should not rely on the results of a single fiscal quarter or period as an indication of our annual results or our future performance.\nOur future results of operations may be adversely affected by increased fuel costs.\nMany aspects of our business have been, and may continue to be, directly affected by fuel costs. Increased fuel costs result in increased costs for the products and services we receive from our third-party providers including, but not limited to, increased distribution costs for our products and increased packaging costs. As the cost of doing business increases, we may not be able to pass these higher costs on to our customers and, therefore, any such cost increases may adversely affect our earnings. In addition, if fuel costs decline we may not benefit from these decreases because our customers may require us to pass on the benefit of lower prices to them.\nChanges in the legal and regulatory environment could limit our business activities, increase our operating costs, reduce demand for our products or result in litigation.\nThe conduct of our businesses, including the production, storage, distribution, sale, display, advertising, marketing, labeling, health and safety practices, transportation and use of many of our products, are subject to various laws and regulations administered by federal, state and local governmental agencies in the United States, as well as to laws and regulations administered by government entities and agencies outside the United States in markets in which our products or components thereof (such as packaging) may be made, manufactured or sold. These laws and regulations and interpretations thereof may change, sometimes dramatically, as a result of a variety of factors, including political, economic or social events. Such changes may include changes in:\n\u2022\nfood and drug laws (including FDA regulations and other applicable regulations including those of the Food Standards Agency in the United Kingdom and the European Food Safety Authority in Brussels);\n\u2022\nlaws related to product labeling;\n\u2022\nadvertising and marketing laws and practices;\n\u2022\nlaws and programs restricting the sale and advertising of certain of our products;\n\u2022\nlaws and programs aimed at reducing, restricting or eliminating ingredients present in certain of our products;\n\u2022\nlaws and programs aimed at discouraging the consumption of products or ingredients or altering the package or portion size of certain of our products;\n\u2022\nincreased regulatory scrutiny of, and increased litigation involving, product claims and concerns regarding the effects on health of ingredients in, or attributes of, certain of our products;\n\u2022\nstate consumer protection and disclosure laws;\n\u2022\ntaxation requirements, including the imposition or proposed imposition of new or increased taxes or other limitations on the sale of our products;\n\u2022\ncompetition laws;\n\u2022\nanti-corruption laws;\n\u2022\nemployment laws;\n\u2022\nprivacy laws;\n\u2022\nexport control laws:\n\u2022\nlaws regulating the price we may charge for our products; and\n\u2022\nfarming and environmental laws.\nNew laws, regulations or governmental policy and their related interpretations, or changes in any of the foregoing, including taxes or other limitations on the sale of our products, ingredients contained in our products or commodities used in the production of our products, may alter the environment in which we do business and, therefore, may impact our operating results or increase our costs or liabilities.\nLoss of our key management or other personnel, or an inability to attract and retain such management and other personnel, could negatively impact our business.\nOur success is substantially dependent on the continued service of certain members of our senior management, including Thomas Ennis, our Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\"); Brian Goldberg our current Chief Financial Officer (\"CFO\") (who will transition to Chief Strategy Officer in 2017) and other senior executives including David Milner, our International President and Executive Vice President (\"EVP\"). These executives have been primarily responsible for determining the strategic direction of our business and for executing our growth strategy and are integral to our brand and culture, and the reputation we enjoy with suppliers, contract manufacturers, distributors, retailers and consumers. The loss of the services of any of these executives could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects, as we may not be able to find suitable individuals to replace them on a timely basis, if at all. In addition, any such departure could be viewed in a negative light by investors and analysts, which may cause the price of our common stock to decline. We have employment agreements with our key senior executives, including our CEO, CFO, and EVP and International President and EVP. However, we do not maintain key-person life insurance with respect to any of them. We also had employment agreements with each of our founders, which expired on December 31, 2015. In the year ended December 31, 2016 we paid the founders $25.2 million related to the contingent consideration clauses of these agreements.\nAdditionally, we also depend on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel to operate and expand our business. If we fail to attract talented new employees, our business and results of operations could be negatively affected.\nAs a result of our rapid growth over the past few years, we need to continue developing an infrastructure and workforce sufficient to meet the growing demands for our products.\nWe have experienced rapid growth in the past few years, which involves various risks related to ensuring that our infrastructure and personnel are sufficient to meet the growing demand for our products. For example, we must seek to identify our personnel needs in light of expected demand for our products, and we will need to identify, recruit, train and retain qualified employees in order to serve this anticipated demand, in all areas of our operations. Because we may hire additional employees in order to meet potential future needs and to ensure that our sales growth does not outgrow our infrastructure, we may experience higher levels of costs of goods sold and general and administrative expense as we build this infrastructure. While we do not anticipate extensive management needs, as we grow, we may add additional layers of management, process and bureaucracy into our governing structure. In doing so, we risk losing qualified employees and members of management who were attracted to our entrepreneurial culture but who may not want to remain at a larger company.\nIn addition, with sales and demand growing rapidly, we need to ensure that we have sufficient manufacturing capacity, both internal capacity and manufacturing arrangements, to meet actual and potential demand for our products. This could require us to make significant capital expenditure investments in order to make sure we have sufficient manufacturing capacity. For example, with the acquisition of Tyrrells Group, we added four manufacturing facilities located in the United Kingdom, Germany and Australia. If growth does not materialize as planned, these large investments could increase our cost of goods sold without increasing our profitability.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be successful in all of these efforts, and any failure to maintain sufficient infrastructure and personnel will have an adverse effect on our ability to grow and improve our profitability.\nWe have a limited operating history, and our historical financial information is not necessarily representative of the results we may achieve in the future.\nWe have been in operation since 2010. However, we only have four years of available audited consolidated financial statements. Our relatively limited available historical financial information does not necessarily reflect our future financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, and the occurrence of any of the risks discussed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, or any other event, could cause our future financial position, results of operations, or cash flows to materially differ from our historical financial information. While we have been profitable in the past, we cannot assure you that our profits will continue, at a similar level or at all.\nWe rely on information technology systems, and any inadequacy, failure, interruption or security breach of those systems may harm our ability to effectively operate our business.\nWe are dependent on various information technology systems, including, but not limited to, networks, applications and outsourced services in connection with the operation of our business. A failure of our information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and result in transaction errors, processing inefficiencies and sales losses, causing our business to suffer. In addition, our information technology systems may be vulnerable to damage or interruption from circumstances beyond our control, including fire, natural disasters, systems failures, viruses and security breaches. Any such damage or interruption could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nIn addition, we sell our products over the internet through third-party websites, including those operated by Amazon.com. The website operations of such third parties may be affected by reliance on other third-party hardware and software providers, technology changes, risks related to the failure of computer systems through which these website operations are conducted, telecommunications failures, electronic break-ins and similar disruptions. Furthermore, the ability of our third-party partners to conduct these website operations may be affected by liability for online content and state and federal privacy laws.\nFurther, because of our rapid growth, we need to ensure that we have sufficient personnel to manage our growing IT infrastructure, and that our systems generate sufficient information and reports so that our management team can better anticipate future business needs. As we grow, we may decide in the future to install a new company-wide information technology system. Any future migration to a new company-wide information technology system would be costly and potentially disruptive to our business.\nOur indebtedness could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to operate our company, and we may incur additional debt.\nAs of December 31, 2016, and December 31, 2015, we had outstanding indebtedness in the aggregate principal amount of $614.9 million and $201.1 million, respectively. Our debt level and the terms of our financing arrangements could adversely affect our financial condition and limit our ability to successfully implement our growth strategy. In addition, our ability to increase the uncommitted portion of our revolving facility may be limited by our debt level or other factors.\nOur ability to meet our debt service obligations will depend on our future performance, which will be affected by the other risk factors described herein. If we do not generate enough cash flow to pay our debt service obligations, we may be required to refinance all or part of our existing debt, sell our assets, borrow more money or raise equity. There is no guarantee that we will be able to take any of these actions on a timely basis, on terms satisfactory to us, or at all.\nOur outstanding indebtedness under the Credit Agreement bears interest at variable rates. If market interest rates increase, variable rate debt will create higher debt service requirements, which could adversely affect our cash flow.\nThe Credit Agreement governing our Credit Facility contains various covenants that impose restrictions on us that may affect our ability to operate our business if we fail to meet those covenants or otherwise suffer a default thereunder.\nWe are required to comply with certain financial maintenance covenants pursuant to the Credit Agreement as of the end of each fiscal quarter, including a total funded debt ratio and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. The Credit Agreement contains other negative incurrence-based covenants that, among other things, limit our ability to:\n\u2022\nborrow money or guarantee debt;\n\u2022\ncreate liens;\n\u2022\nmake specified types of investments and acquisitions;\n\u2022\npay dividends on or redeem or repurchase stock;\n\u2022\nenter into new lines of business;\n\u2022\nenter into transactions with affiliates; and\n\u2022\nsell assets or merge with other companies.\nShould we be in default under any of such covenants, Jefferies Finance LLC shall have the right, upon written notice and after the expiration of any applicable period during which such default may be cured, to demand immediate payment of all of the then-unpaid principal and accrued but unpaid interest under the Credit Agreement and would permit lenders to foreclose upon the collateral securing the debt. As of December 31, 2016, we are in compliance with all covenants of the Credit Agreement.\nAs we execute our business strategy, we may not be able to remain in compliance with our financial covenants because various risks, uncertainties and events beyond our control could affect our ability to comply with these covenants. These restrictions on the operation of our business through the requirement that we meet certain ratios to take certain actions could harm us by, among other things, limiting our ability to take advantage of financing, merger and acquisition opportunities and other corporate opportunities. Additionally, any acceleration of the borrowings under the Credit Agreement prior to the applicable maturity dates could have a material adverse effect upon our business, financial condition and results of operations. See \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Indebtedness\u201d.\nOur TRA will require us to make cash payments to a counterparty in respect of certain tax benefits to which we may become entitled, and we expect that the payments we will be required to make will be substantial.\nIn August 2015, we entered into the TRA with the former holders of units of Topco, our former parent entity. In December 2015, all of the former holders of units of Topco collectively assigned their interests to a new counterparty. Pursuant to the TRA, we are required to make cash payments to the counterparty equal to 85% of the tax benefits, if any, that we actually realize, or in some circumstances are deemed to realize, as a result of certain tax attributes that were generated when SkinnyPop was acquired by affiliates of TA Associates in July 2014.\nThe amount of the cash payments that we are required to make under the TRA is expected to be significant. Assuming no material changes in the relevant tax law and that we earn sufficient taxable income to realize all tax benefits that are subject to the TRA, we expect that the future reduction in tax payments for us associated with the federal, state and local tax benefits described above would aggregate to approximately $104.7 million through 2030. Under such scenario, we would be required to pay the counterparty 85% of such amount, or $89.0 million through 2030.\nPayments under the TRA may vary from the foregoing estimates and will be based on the tax reporting positions that we determine internally and based on the advice of our tax advisers. Any payments made by us to the counterparty under the TRA will generally reduce the amount of overall cash flow that might have otherwise been available to us. If the Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\"), were to successfully challenge the tax benefits that give rise to any payments under the TRA, our future payments under the TRA to the counterparty would be reduced by the amount of such payments, but the TRA does not require the counterparty to reimburse us for the amount of such payments to the extent they exceed any future amounts payable under the TRA.\nOur obligation to make timely payments under the TRA is not conditioned upon, and will not be modified based upon, our historical net income for any previous period or our ability to generate net income in any future period. If, however, we fail to make any payments on a timely basis under the TRA because we do not have sufficient funds to make such payment despite using reasonable best efforts to obtain funds to make such payment (including by causing our subsidiaries to distribute or lend funds to us for such payment and accessing any sources of available credit to fund such payment), such failure will not be deemed to be a breach of a material obligation under the TRA that would give rise to an acceleration of our payment obligations under the agreement. To the extent that we are unable to make\ntimely payments under the TRA for this or any other reason, the unpaid amounts will be deferred and will accrue interest until paid by us.\nFurthermore, our future obligation to make payments under the TRA could make us a less attractive target for an acquisition, particularly in the case of an acquirer that cannot use some or all of the tax benefits that may be deemed realized under the TRA. Unless earlier terminated in accordance with its terms, the TRA will continue in force and effect until there is no further potential for tax benefit payments to be made by us to the counterparty in respect of the U.S. federal, state and local tax benefits that are the subject of such agreement.\nBased on current tax rules and regulations as of the date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we would expect the potential for tax benefit payments to cease no later than 2030 (or approximately fifteen years after the date of our IPO). For more information see Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Liquidity and Capital Resources.\nDisruptions in the worldwide economy may adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nAdverse and uncertain economic conditions may impact distributor, retailer and consumer demand for our products. In addition, our ability to manage normal commercial relationships with our suppliers, contract manufacturers, distributors, retailers, consumers and creditors may suffer. Consumers may shift purchases to lower-priced or other perceived value offerings during economic downturns, making it more difficult to sell our premium products. During economic downturns, it may be more difficult to convince consumers to switch to our brands or convince new users to choose our brands without expensive sampling programs and price promotions. In particular, consumers may reduce the amount of products with no GMOs, gluten, or preservatives that they purchase when there are conventional offerings of similar products, which generally have lower retail prices. In addition, consumers may choose to purchase private-label products rather than branded products because they are generally less expensive. Distributors and retailers may become more conservative in response to these conditions and seek to reduce their inventories. For example, during the economic downturn from 2007 through 2009, distributors and retailers significantly reduced their inventories. Our results of operations depend upon, among other things, our ability to maintain and increase sales volume with our existing distributors and retailers, to attract new consumers and to provide products that appeal to consumers at prices they are willing and able to pay. Prolonged unfavorable economic conditions may have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability.\nAn impairment of goodwill could materially adversely affect our net income.\nWe have significant goodwill, which amounted to 18.1% and 13.2% of our total assets as of December 31, 2016, and 2015, respectively. Our acquisition of Tyrrells Group in September 2016 increased this amount and any future acquisitions, could also increase this amount. Goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. In accordance with GAAP, we first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of our reporting unit is less than their carrying amounts as a basis to determine whether it is necessary to perform the goodwill impairment test, which we perform annually in the third fiscal quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable. Future events that may trigger impairment include, but are not limited to, significant adverse change in customer demand, the business climate or a significant decrease in expected cash flows. When impaired, the carrying value of goodwill is written down to fair value. In the event that an impairment to goodwill is identified, an immediate charge to earnings would be recorded, which would adversely affect our operating results. See Note 6 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 for further information.\nAn impairment of indefinite-lived intangibles could materially adversely affect our net income.\nWe have significant indefinite-lived intangible assets, which amounted to 66.8% and 75.3% of our total assets as of December 31, 2016, and 2015, respectively. Our acquisition of Tyrrells Group in 2016 increased this amount and any future acquisitions could also increase this amount. Indefinite-lived intangibles are tested for impairment annually in the third fiscal quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets may not be recoverable. When impaired, the carrying value of indefinite-lived intangible assets is written down to fair value. In the event that an impairment is identified, an immediate charge to earnings would be recorded, which would adversely affect our operating results. See Note 6 in the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements contained in Item 8 for further information.\nWe rely on sales agents for our products and there could be a disruption in our ability to sell products to our customers if our relationship with a major sales agent is terminated.\nWe are represented by approximately 25 sales agents who represent almost all of our product line to supermarkets and food stores in North America. There are a very limited number of national sales agents in the snack food industry. Our agreements with these agents are terminable by either us or them after satisfaction of a short notice period. The termination of these agreements would require us to seek other sales agents, likely causing significant disruption to our business, and could affect our relationships with our customers. New sales agents would also potentially face conflicts of interest with respect to their existing customers.\nA determination that the employees of our primary third-party manufacturer for SkinnyPop products or any future third-party co-manufacturers constitute our employees could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe currently outsource the manufacturing of all of our products other than Tyrrells Group brand products to four third-party co-manufacturers and we expect that we will continue to outsource the manufacturing of all of our products other than Tyrrells Group brand products to one or more third-party manufacturers in the future. We do not consider employees of these third-party manufacturers to be our employees. As such, we do not withhold federal or state income or other employment related taxes, make federal or state unemployment tax or Federal Insurance Contributions Act payments, provide workers\u2019 compensation insurance or other employee-related benefits with respect to these manufacturers\u2019 employees. Recently, there has been an increase in litigation against companies across industries claiming that certain individuals associated with outsourced business functions should be considered employees. Although we are not unique in our outsourcing of certain aspects of our business, such as manufacturing operations, to third parties, there is a risk that such claims may be brought against us. This risk would be increased to the extent that any of the employees of our third-party manufacturers work exclusively on the manufacture of our products. In the event of a determination by a court, federal or state taxing authorities or other relevant governmental authorities that the employees of our third-party manufacturers constitute our employees, we may be adversely affected and subject to retroactive taxes and penalties.\nRisks Related to Ownership of Our Common Stock\nOur stock price may be volatile or may decline regardless of our operating performance, and you may lose part or all of your investment.\nThe market price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, most of which we cannot control, including:\n\u2022\nmarket conditions or trends in the BFY packaged food industry or in the economy as a whole;\n\u2022\nactions by competitors;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated growth rates relative to our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe public\u2019s response to press releases or other public announcements by us or third parties, including our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC;\n\u2022\neconomic, legal and regulatory factors unrelated to our performance;\n\u2022\nany future guidance we may provide to the public, any changes in such guidance or any difference between our guidance and actual results;\n\u2022\nchanges in financial estimates or recommendations by any securities analysts who follow our common stock;\n\u2022\nspeculation by the press or investment community regarding our business;\n\u2022\nlitigation;\n\u2022\nchanges in key personnel; and\n\u2022\nfuture sales of our common stock by our officers, directors and significant stockholders.\nIn addition, the stock markets, including the NYSE, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. In the past, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. If we were involved in securities litigation, we could incur substantial costs and our resources and the attention of management could be diverted from our business.\nFuture sales of our common stock, or the perception in the public markets that these sales may occur, may depress our stock price.\nThe market price of our common stock could decline significantly as a result of sales of a large number of shares of our common stock in the market in the future. These sales, or the perception that these sales might occur, could depress the market price of our common stock. We previously filed a shelf registration statement on November 28, 2016. These sales, or the possibility that these sales may occur, also might make it more difficult for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate.\nAdditionally, the shares of common stock subject to outstanding options and restricted stock awards under our equity incentive plans and the shares reserved for future issuance under our equity incentive plans will become eligible for sale in the public market in the future, subject to certain legal and contractual limitations.\nAlso, in the future, we may issue shares of our common stock in connection with investments or acquisitions. The amount of shares of our common stock issued in connection with an investment or acquisition could constitute a material portion of our then-outstanding shares of our common stock.\nConcentration of ownership among our existing executive officers, directors and principal stockholders, and our stockholders agreement with TA Associates, may prevent new investors from influencing significant corporate decisions.\nAs of December 31, 2016, our directors, officers and holders of 10% or more of our outstanding stock beneficially owned, in the aggregate, approximately 57.5% of our outstanding common stock. As a result, these stockholders are able to exercise significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors, amendment of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and approval of significant corporate transactions and will have significant control over our management and policies. This concentration of influence could be disadvantageous to other stockholders with interests different from those of the principal stockholders. As a result of these ownership positions, these stockholders could take actions that have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us or discouraging others from making tender offers for our shares, which could prevent stockholders from receiving a premium for their shares. These actions may be taken even if other stockholders oppose them. The concentration of voting power held by the principal stockholders may have an adverse effect on the price of our common stock. The interests of these stockholders may not be consistent with the interests of other stockholders.\nIn addition, we and entities affiliated with TA Associates have entered into a stockholders agreement, which we refer to as our stockholders agreement. Under our stockholders agreement, TA Associates has the right to designate three of the members of our board of directors if TA Associates owns at least 50% or more of the shares they held immediately following our IPO regardless of the percentage such shares represent of our total outstanding shares, two members of our board of directors if TA Associates owns between 25% and 50% of the shares they held immediately following our IPO regardless of the percentage such shares represent of our total outstanding shares, and one member of our board of directors if TA Associates owns between 12.5% and 25% of the shares they held immediately following our IPO regardless of the percentage such shares represent of our total outstanding shares.\nOur stockholders agreement also provides that so long as the entities affiliated with TA Associates hold at least 25% of the shares they held immediately following our IPO regardless of the percentage such shares represent of our total outstanding shares, we, and our subsidiaries, shall not take the following actions (or enter into an agreement to take such actions) without the approval of at least one director designated by TA Associates:\n\u2022\nincrease or decrease the authorized number of members of our board of directors;\n\u2022\namend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws or the organizational documents of any of our subsidiaries;\n\u2022\nissue, create or assume any debt or equity security or debt obligation, or refinance, repurchase or prepay any security (other than repurchases of our common stock in accordance with agreements previously approved by our board of directors, including at least one director designated by TA Associates) or debt obligation;\n\u2022\npay or declare any dividend or make any distribution on, or repurchase or redeem shares of our common stock (other than repurchases of our common stock in accordance with agreements previously approved by our board of directors, including at least one director designated by TA Associates);\n\u2022\neffect any sale, liquidation or dissolution of the Company, or sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of the material assets or properties of the Company or any of its subsidiaries, or merge with or into, or consolidate with, another entity or effect any recapitalization, reorganization, change of form of organization, forward or reverse split, dividend or similar transaction;\n\u2022\nacquire any business, material assets or property for consideration in excess of $15,000,000, whether by acquisition of assets, capital stock or otherwise, and whether in consideration of the payment of cash, the\nissuance of capital stock or otherwise or make any investment in any person or entity in an amount in excess of $15,000,000;\n\u2022\nhire or terminate any our executive officers, or enter into, amend or modify, or waive any material term of any employment agreement or material term of employment with any of our executive officers; or\n\u2022\ntake any action to initiate, to cause or that would result in, the voluntary bankruptcy, insolvency, dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Company or any of its subsidiaries.\nAccordingly, our stockholders agreement will limit our ability to engage in significant transactions, such as a merger, acquisition or liquidation. Conflicts of interest could arise between us and TA Associates, and any conflict of interest may be resolved in a manner that does not favor us. Any decision that TA Associates may make at some future time regarding their ownership of us will be in their absolute discretion.\nIf we fail to establish and maintain effective internal controls in accordance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or if we fail to successfully integrate acquired businesses (including the Tyrrells Group business) into our internal controls processes and procedures, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and stock price.\nAs a public company, we are required to document and test our internal control procedures in order to satisfy the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. Beginning with this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we will be required to provide annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. Additionally, as of the date we are no longer an \u201cemerging growth company\u201d we will require a report by our independent registered public accounting firm that addresses the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. We may not be able to conclude that we have effective internal control over financial reporting in accordance with Section 404 and, when applicable to us, our independent registered public accounting firm may not be able or willing to issue an unqualified report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. If we identify any deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting, any remediation measures or efforts we undertake to address such deficiencies or material weaknesses might not be successful to the extent we expect, or at all. If we are unable to successfully remediate any identified deficiencies or material weaknesses, our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis may be adversely affected, we may be subject to sanctions or investigations by regulatory authorities, and investors may lose confidence in our financial information, which in turn could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nIf and when we acquire new businesses, we will also be required to integrate those acquired businesses into our consolidated internal controls processes and procedures and determine whether our consolidated internal control environment is effective. If we acquire businesses that are private companies at the time of acquisition and which are not previously subject to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 or other similar regulations requiring effective internal controls over financial reporting, it may be more likely that we identify deficiencies or material weaknesses in the internal controls of such acquired businesses when we evaluate those internal controls against the rigorous Sarbanes-Oxley Act public company standard under Section 404.\nIn accordance with guidance issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission, we are permitted to exclude acquisitions from our assessment of internal control over financial reporting for the first fiscal year in which the acquisition occurs. For example, our management\u2019s evaluation of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2016, as reported in Item 9A in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, excludes the internal control activities of Crisps Topco Limited and its subsidiaries (Tyrrells Group). Our management will be required to include the internal control activities of the Tyrrells Group in its evaluation of our consolidated internal controls under Section 404 in 2017. During the course of integrating the Tyrrells Group operations within our internal control structure and testing and evaluating internal controls at the Tyrrells Group, we may identify deficiencies or material weaknesses. If we are unable to successfully remediate any identified deficiencies or material weaknesses, our ability to report our financial results on a timely and accurate basis may be adversely affected, we may be subject to sanctions or investigations by regulatory authorities, and investors may lose confidence in our financial information, which in turn could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur costs will increase significantly as a result of operating as a public company, and our management will be required to devote substantial time to complying with public company regulations.\nAs a public company with SEC reporting, regulatory and stock exchange listing requirements, we are incurring additional legal, accounting, compliance and other expenses that we did not incur historically. We are obligated to file with the SEC annual and quarterly information and other reports that are specified in Section 13 and other sections of the Exchange Act, and therefore need to have the ability to prepare consolidated financial statements that are compliant with all SEC reporting requirements on a timely basis. In addition, we are subject to other reporting and corporate governance requirements, including certain requirements of the and certain provisions of Sarbanes-Oxley and the regulations promulgated thereunder, which impose significant compliance obligations upon us.\nWe are an emerging growth company, and we cannot be certain if the reduced disclosure requirements applicable to emerging growth companies will make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are an emerging growth company (\"EGC\"), as defined in the JOBS Act, and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not EGCs, including not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock, and our stock price may be more volatile.\nAlthough the JOBS Act permits an EGC such as us to take advantage of an extended transition period to comply with new or revised accounting standards applicable to public companies, we have chosen to \u201copt out\u201d of this provision, and, as a result, we will comply with new or revised accounting standards as required when they are adopted. This decision to opt out of the extended transition period under the JOBS Act is irrevocable.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or publish unfavorable research about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of these analysts ceases coverage of our company or fails to publish reports on us regularly, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which in turn could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline. Moreover, if our operating results do not meet the expectations of the investor community, one or more of the analysts who cover our company may change their recommendations regarding our company, and our stock price could decline.\nProvisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws, our stockholders agreement and the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware could prevent an acquisition or other change in control of our Company that may be beneficial to our stockholders.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws and provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, or the DGCL, to which we are subject contain provisions that could discourage, delay, or prevent a change in control of our Company or changes in our board of directors and management that the stockholders of our Company may deem advantageous.\nFor as long as TA Associates continues to own a substantial number of shares of our common stock, representing a substantial number of votes entitled to be cast by holders of our common stock, it will have the ability to control decisions regarding an acquisition of us by a third party that are subject to a vote of our stockholders. In addition, our stockholders agreement provides that so long as the entities affiliated with TA Associates hold at least 25% of the shares they held immediately following our IPO regardless of the percentage such shares represent of our total outstanding shares, we, and our subsidiaries, shall not, without the approval of at least one director designated by TA Associates, amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws or effect any sale, liquidation or dissolution of the Company, or sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of the material assets or properties of the Company or any of its subsidiaries. Accordingly, even though TA Associates may own a small percentage of our total outstanding shares of our common stock, they will continue to have substantial influence on our business and strategy.\nIn addition, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, amended and restated bylaws and the DGCL contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors. These provisions include a classified board of directors with each class serving three-year staggered terms, restrictions on the ability of our stockholders to remove directors, the inability of our stockholders to fill vacancies on our board of directors, in certain instances supermajority voting requirements for stockholders to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, prohibition on action by our stockholders by written consent, advance notice requirements for stockholder proposals and director nominations, and the inability of our stockholders to call special meetings of stockholders. In addition, our board of directors has the right to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could be used to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer. Moreover, we are subject to the restrictions on business combinations set forth in Section 203 of the DGCL, which generally will prohibit us from engaging in a business combination with a person who owns in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock for a period of three years after the time of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless, among other exceptions, the transaction is approved in a prescribed manner. Although we believe these provisions protect our stockholders from coercive or otherwise unfair takeover tactics and thereby provide for an opportunity to receive a higher bid by requiring potential acquirers to negotiate with our board of directors, these provisions apply even if the offer may be considered beneficial by some stockholders.\nFutures sales or other issuances of our common stock or issuances of securities convertible into our common stock would result in dilution to our stockholders and could adversely impact the market price of our common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2016, we had outstanding 76,786,000 shares of our common stock, including 2,948,995 shares of restricted stock. In the future, we may sell additional shares of our common stock or securities convertible into our common stock to raise capital or issue additional shares of our common stock or securities convertible into our common stock as consideration for future acquisitions, which would dilute the voting power and ownership percentage of our stockholders. We cannot predict the size of future issuances of our common stock or securities convertible into our common stock or the effect, if any, that such future issuances might have on the market price for our common stock. The issuance and sale of substantial amounts of our common stock or securities convertible into our common stock, or the perception that such issuances and sales may occur, could also materially and adversely affect the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the issuance of additional equity securities.", "PERMNO": 15599, "SIC": 2090, "TIC": "BETR"}
