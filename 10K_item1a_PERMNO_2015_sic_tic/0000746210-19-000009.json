{"cik": "746210", "company": "GLOWPOINT, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-03-08", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nGlowpoint\u2019s business faces numerous risks, including those set forth below or those described elsewhere in this Report or in our other filings with the SEC. The risks described below are not the only risks that we face, nor are they necessarily listed in order of significance. Other risks and uncertainties may also affect our business. Any of these risks may have a material adverse effect on Glowpoint\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow. When making an investment decision with respect to our common stock, you should also refer to the other information contained or incorporated by reference in this Report, including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have experienced declines in revenue in each of the last five fiscal years and may continue to experience further revenue decline in future periods.\nFrom fiscal year 2013 to fiscal year 2018, we experienced a decline in revenue from $33.5 million in 2013 to $12.6 million in 2018. We believe that these revenue declines are primarily due to net attrition of customers and lower demand for our services given the competitive environment and pressure on pricing that exists in our industry. During the past several years, we have had limited resources to invest in product development and sales and marketing in order to reverse the Company\u2019s revenue trends. In addition, after the execution of the letter of intent with SharedLabs, we ceased any investment in new services in order to focus our efforts and resources on the proposed Merger. If we cannot successfully introduce new product lines, either through rapid innovation or acquisition of new products or product lines, we may not be able to maintain or increase the market share of our products. In addition, if we are unable to successfully introduce or acquire new products with higher gross margins, or if we are unable to improve the margins on our existing product lines, our revenue and overall gross margin will likely continue to decline. We cannot assure you that we will have sufficient funds available to pursue any of these measures, or that any such measures will be successful. Further, if we complete the Merger with SharedLabs, the composition of our board of directors is expected to change in accordance with the Merger Agreement and, as a result, the combined organization may determine to not make such investments and/or pursue business strategies other than those discussed herein. Continued declines in our revenue will likely inhibit the combined organization\u2019s potential for growth after the closing of the Merger.\nWe have a history of substantial net operating losses and we may incur future net losses.\nWe have reported a substantial net loss from operations in fiscal years 2013 through 2018. We may not achieve revenue growth or profitability or generate positive cash flow on a quarterly or annual basis in the future. If we do not achieve profitability in the future, the value of our common stock may be adversely impacted, and we could have difficulty obtaining capital to continue our operations.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient cash to service all of our ongoing liquidity needs, and we may be forced to take other actions to fund our operations, which may not be successful.\nOur ability to fund our operating expenses, planned capital expenditures, expenses related to the Merger with SharedLabs and other ongoing liquidity needs depends on our financial condition and operating performance, which is subject to prevailing economic and competitive conditions and to certain financial, business and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. We believe that, based on our current projection of revenue, expenses, capital expenditures and cash flows, we have sufficient resources to fund our operations on a stand-alone basis for at least the next twelve months following the filing of this Report. However, there is no assurance that we will be able to accomplish this during this period and/or in the future following such period. In addition, we cannot predict the liquidity position of the combined organization at any point following the Merger, which is subject to, among other things, business decisions of the combined organization\u2019s management and board of directors.\nOur business activities may require additional financing that might not be obtainable on acceptable terms, if at all, which could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, liquidity and its ability to operate going forward.\nOur capital requirements continue to depend on numerous factors, including the timing and amount of revenue, the expense to deliver our services, expense for sales and marketing, expense for research and development, capital improvements, the cost involved in protecting our intellectual property rights, capital required to repurchase shares under our share buyback program, and the expenses related to the Merger with SharedLabs. We believe that, based on our current projection of revenue, expenses, capital expenditures and cash flows, we have sufficient resources to fund our operations on a stand-alone basis for at least the next twelve months following the filing of this Report. However, there is no assurance that we will be able to accomplish this during this period or in the future following such period. In addition, we cannot predict the liquidity position of the combined organization at any point following the Merger, which is subject to, among other things, business decisions of the combined organization\u2019s management and board of directors. We anticipate negative cash flow from operations in 2019 and we believe additional capital may be required to fund investments in product development and sales and marketing as a means to reverse our revenue trends. While we expect to continue to adjust our cost of revenue and other operating expenses to partially offset the impact of revenue declines associated with our legacy services, we believe additional capital may be necessary to fund our operations. In the event we need access to capital to fund operations or provide growth capital, we would likely need to raise capital in one or more equity offerings. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in raising necessary capital or that any such offering will be on terms acceptable to the Company. If we are unable to raise additional capital that may be needed on terms acceptable to us, it could have a material adverse effect on the Company. Failure to obtain financing, or obtaining financing on unfavorable terms, could result in a decrease in our stock price, would have a material adverse effect on future operating prospects, and could require us to significantly reduce operations.\nFurther, in connection with our issuance of the Series B Preferred Stock and the Series C Preferred Stock, we granted to the investors therein certain consent rights that could inhibit us from taking certain corporate actions while such securities are outstanding, including pursuing certain capital raising activities. While, as of the filing of this Report, no shares of Series B Preferred Stock remain outstanding, the rights granted to the Series C Preferred Stock may make it difficult for us to raise capital,\nrefinance indebtedness or borrow additional funds while such securities are outstanding. Please see \u201cHolders of Glowpoint\u2019s Series C Preferred Stock have certain consent rights that could inhibit us from taking certain corporate actions, and as a result may adversely affect our business, operating results and stock price\u201d below for further information. In addition, the Merger Agreement includes provisions applicable prior to the earlier of the (i) closing of the Merger or (ii) termination of the Merger Agreement that restrict Glowpoint\u2019s ability to raise capital through equity or debt financings without SharedLabs\u2019 consent.\nIn order to focus our resources on the proposed Merger with SharedLabs, we are not currently investing material resources in the development of new service offerings. As a result, we will likely continue to experience declines in revenue in the future.\nIn early 2018, we began investing in product development, sales and marketing expenses and capital expenditures in order to develop new service offerings, with the goal of reversing the Company\u2019s negative revenue trends. However, after we signed the letter of intent with SharedLabs, we ceased such investments in order to focus our efforts and resources on the completion of the Merger. As a result, at this time, we do not have an expected time line for the development and release of new services and/or the generation of additional revenue with new services, and, as a result, we will likely continue to experience declines in revenue in the future. In addition, as we continue to transform into a service-led organization, existing revenue attributable to our core and legacy product lines and services has declined. As a result of a growing market trend around cloud consumption preferences, more customers are exploring cost-effective software-based services for procuring technology. As this trend continues, we are focused on investing in future results by implementing cost savings programs designed to streamline our operations and eliminate overlapping processes and expenses. If we fail to make the necessary investments to develop new service offerings that achieve broad market acceptance on a timely basis, we will not be able to compete effectively and will likely experience continued declines in revenue and lower gross margins.\nFurther, if we complete the Merger with SharedLabs, the composition of our board of directors is expected to change in accordance with the Merger Agreement and, as a result, the combined organization may determine to not make such investments in the future and/or pursue business strategies other than those discussed herein. Even if the combined organization elects to invest in the development of new services offerings for Glowpoint\u2019s existing business, there can be no assurance that such investments will be successful, or that any new product offerings will be timely or achieve market acceptance. If trends shift away from our products or if we misjudge the market for our product lines, we may be faced with market conditions that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The failure of new product designs or new product lines to gain market acceptance could also adversely affect our business and the image of our brand. Achieving market acceptance for new products or technology may also require substantial marketing efforts and expenditures to generate consumer demand. These requirements could strain our management, financial and operational resources. If we do not, in the future, develop innovative products that provide better design, technology and performance attributes than the products of our competitors and that are accepted by consumers, or if our future product lines misjudge consumer demands, we may lose consumer loyalty, which could result in a decline in our sales and market share.\nIf we fail to introduce or acquire new products that achieve broad market acceptance on a timely basis, we will not be able to compete effectively and we will likely experience continued declines in revenue and lower gross margins.\nWe operate in a highly competitive, quickly changing environment, and our future success depends on our ability to develop or acquire, and introduce, new products that achieve broad market acceptance. Our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to identify demand trends in the markets in which we operate, and to quickly develop or acquire, and build and sell products that satisfy these demands in a cost-effective manner. In order to differentiate our products from our competitors\u2019 products, we must increase our focus and capital investment in research and development. If our products do not achieve widespread market acceptance, or if we are unsuccessful in capitalizing on market opportunities, our future growth may be slowed and our financial results could be harmed. Also, as the mix of our business increasingly includes new products and services that require additional investment, this shift may adversely impact our margins, at least in the near-term. Successfully predicting demand trends is difficult, and it is very difficult to predict the effect that introducing a new product will have on existing product sales. We will also need to respond effectively to new product announcements by our competitors by quickly introducing competitive products.\nIn addition, we may not be able to successfully manage integration of any new product lines with our existing products. Selling new product lines in new markets will require our management to learn different strategies in order to be successful. We may be unsuccessful in launching a new product line in new markets which requires management of new suppliers, potential new customers and new business models. Our management may not have the experience of selling in these new markets and we may not be able to grow our business as planned. If we are unable to effectively and successfully further develop these new product lines, we may not be able to achieve our desired sales targets and our gross margins may be adversely affected.\nWe may experience delays and quality issues in releasing new products, which could result in lower quarterly revenue than expected. In addition, we may experience product introductions that fall short of our projected rates of market adoption. Any\nfuture delays in product development and introduction, or product introductions that do not meet broad market acceptance, or unsuccessful launches of new product lines could result in:\n\u2022\nloss of or delay in revenue and loss of market share;\n\u2022\nnegative publicity and damage to our reputation and brand;\n\u2022\na decline in the average selling price of our products; and\n\u2022\nadverse reactions in our sales channels.\nIf we cannot successfully introduce new product lines, either through rapid innovation or acquisition of new products or product lines, we may not be able to maintain or increase the market share of our products. In addition, if we are unable to successfully introduce or acquire new products with higher gross margins, or if we are unable to improve the margins on our existing product lines, our revenue and overall gross margin will likely decline.\nWe cannot assure you that our present or future products will achieve market acceptance on a sustained basis. In order to achieve market acceptance and achieve future revenue growth, we must introduce new product lines, incorporate new technologies into our existing product lines and design, and develop and successfully commercialize higher performance products in a timely manner. We cannot assure you that it will be able to offer new or complementary products that gain market acceptance quickly enough to avoid decreased revenues during current or future product introductions or transitions. As of the date of this Report, and as discussed herein, we are focusing our efforts and resources on the proposed Merger with SharedLabs, and are not currently investing material resources in new service offerings.\nThe Merger with SharedLabs is expected to result in changes to our board of directors and the combined organization will likely pursue different strategies than the Company or SharedLabs may have pursued independently.\nIf the parties to the Merger Agreement complete the Merger, the composition of our board of directors is expected to change in accordance with the Merger Agreement. Further, because the composition of the board of directors of the combined organization is expected to consist primarily of directors of SharedLabs, with one director appointed by our board of directors, the combined organization will likely pursue certain business strategies that neither company would have pursued independently.\nHolders of Glowpoint\u2019s Series C Preferred Stock have certain consent rights that could inhibit us from taking certain corporate actions, and as a result may adversely affect our business, operating results and stock price.\nHolders of Glowpoint\u2019s Series C Preferred Stock have certain consent rights with respect to its ability to take certain corporate actions, including the following:\n\u2022\nthe issuance, authorization or creation of any class or series of capital stock senior to or on parity with the Series C Preferred Stock, or any class or series of capital stock junior to the Series C Preferred Stock but with a maturity, redemption or repayment date prior to the date on which any Series C Preferred Stock remains outstanding; and\n\u2022\nthe entry by the Company into certain \u201cfundamental transactions,\u201d including transactions constituting a change of control of the Company, certain reorganization transactions or a sale of all or substantially all of our assets.\nIn addition to the foregoing consent rights, holders of our Series C Preferred Stock have the right to participate, pro-rata on the post-conversion basis of its preferred stock, in (i) any purchase rights issued by us pro-rata to the holders of any class of our common stock and (ii) the distribution of securities or other assets made by us to the holders of common stock pursuant to certain fundamental corporate transactions. We have also granted a participation right in up to 100% of any future offering of common stock or other securities or equity linked debt obligations to the initial purchasers of the Series C Preferred Stock during the period such purchasers continue to hold Series C Preferred Stock until January 2020 (the \u201cParticipation Right\u201d).\nExcept as required by law or our Certificate of Incorporation, holders of our Series C Preferred Stock have the same voting rights as holders of common stock, voting together as one class on an as-converted basis as if converted at a conversion price of $0.33 per share (note that this conversion price for voting purposes is different than the actual conversion price of $0.30 per share).\nThe foregoing consent and other rights of the holders of our Series C Preferred Stock could, while such securities are outstanding, inhibit us from obtaining future financings to withstand a future downturn in our business or the economy in general, or to otherwise conduct necessary corporate activities, and as a result may adversely affect our business, operating results and stock price. We, as a condition to SharedLabs\u2019 obligation to effect the Merger, have agreed to, prior to the effective time, either (i) redeem each share of Series C Preferred Stock issued and outstanding as of the effective time, (ii) convert each share of Series\nC Preferred Stock issued and outstanding as of the effective time into shares of our common stock, or (iii) amend the terms of the Series C Preferred Stock to remove the Series C Participation Right. However, it is possible that SharedLabs could waive the foregoing condition to closing and the parties could close the Merger without the Company having redeemed or converted, or amended the terms of, the Series C Preferred Stock, in which event the terms of such securities would continue to inhibit the combined organization from obtaining future financings to withstand a future downturn in its business or the economy in general, or to otherwise conduct necessary corporate activities. Such a result may adversely affect the business, operating results and stock price of the combined organization.\nOur success is highly dependent on the evolution of our overall market and on general economic conditions.\nThe market for video communication services is evolving rapidly. Although certain industry analysts project significant growth for this market, their projections may not be realized. Our future growth depends on broad acceptance and adoption of video communications in the market for its services. There can be no assurance that the market for our services will grow, that our services will be adopted or that businesses will purchase our suite of managed video services. If we are unable to react quickly to changes in the market, if the market fails to develop or develops more slowly than expected, or if our services do not achieve market acceptance, then we are unlikely to achieve profitability. Additionally, adverse economic conditions may cause a decline in business and consumer spending which could adversely affect our business and financial performance.\nWe may be unable to adequately respond to rapid changes in technology.\nThe market for our video collaboration services is characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards and frequent product introductions. The introduction of products and services embodying new technology and the emergence of new industry standards may render our existing managed video services obsolete and unmarketable if we are unable to adapt to change. A significant factor in our ability to grow and to remain competitive is our ability to successfully introduce new products and services that embody new technology, anticipate and incorporate evolving industry standards and achieve levels of functionality and price acceptable to the market. If our managed video services are unable to meet expectations or unable to keep pace with technological changes in the video communication industry, our managed video services could eventually become obsolete. We may be unable to allocate the funds necessary to upgrade our managed video services as improvements in video communication technologies are introduced. In the event that other companies develop more advanced service offerings, our competitive position relative to such companies would be harmed.\nWe operate in a highly competitive market and many of our competitors have greater financial resources and established relationships with major corporate customers.\nThe video communications industry is highly competitive and includes large, well-financed participants. Many of these organizations have substantially greater financial and other resources than us, furnish some of the same services provided by us, and have established relationships with major corporate customers that have policies of purchasing directly from them. Our competitors offer services similar both on a bundled and un-bundled basis, creating a highly competitive environment with pressure on pricing of such services. We believe that as the demand for video communications systems continues to increase, additional competitors, many of which may have greater resources than us, will continue to enter the video communications market.\nWe rely on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our revenue, and the loss of any one of those customers, or several of our smaller customers, could materially harm our business.\nA significant portion of our revenue is generated from a limited number of customers. For the year ended December 31, 2018, two major customers accounted for 25% and 21%, respectively, of our total revenue. The composition of our significant customers will vary from period to period and we expect that most of our revenue will continue, for the foreseeable future, to come from a relatively small number of customers. Consequently, our financial results may fluctuate significantly from period-to-period based on the actions of one or more significant customers. A customer may take actions that affect the Company for reasons that we cannot anticipate or control, such as reasons related to the customer\u2019s financial condition, changes in the customer\u2019s business strategy or operations, changes in technology and the introduction of alternative competing products, or as the result of the perceived quality or cost-effectiveness of our products. Our agreements with these customers may be canceled if we materially breach the agreement or for other reasons outside of our control such as insolvency or financial hardship that may result in a customer filing for bankruptcy court protection against unsecured creditors. In addition, our customers may seek to renegotiate the terms of current agreements or renewals. The loss of or a reduction in sales or anticipated sales to our most significant or several of our smaller customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAny system failures or interruptions may cause loss of customers.\nOur success depends, in part, on the seamless, uninterrupted operation of our managed service offerings. As the complexity and volume continue to increase, we will face increasing demands and challenges in managing them. Any prolonged failure of\nthese services or other systems or hardware that cause significant interruptions to our operations could seriously damage our reputation and result in customer attrition and financial loss.\nThere is limited market awareness of our services.\nOur future success will be dependent in significant part on our ability to generate demand for our video collaboration services. To this end, our direct marketing and indirect sales operations must increase market awareness of our service offerings to generate increased revenue. We have limited sales and marketing resources, with two employees in sales and marketing as of December 31, 2018, and we have had limited resources and/or cash flow in the last several years for spending on advertising, marketing and additional personnel. Our products and services require a sophisticated sales effort targeted at the senior management of our prospective customers. If we were to hire new employees in sales and marketing, those employees will require training and take time to achieve full productivity. We cannot be certain that our new hires will become as productive as necessary or that we will be able to hire enough qualified individuals or retain existing employees in the future. We cannot be certain that we will be successful in our efforts to market and sell our products and services, and, if we are not successful in building market awareness and generating increased sales, future results of operations will be adversely affected.\nWe rely on third-party software that may be difficult to replace or may not perform adequately.\nWe integrate third-party licensed software components into our technology infrastructure (e.g., ServiceNow Inc.) in order to provide our services. This software may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms or pricing or may fail to continue to be updated to remain competitive. The loss of the right to use this third-party software may increase our expenses or impact the provisioning of our services. The failure of this third-party software could materially impact the performance of our services and may cause material harm to our business or results of operations.\nWe depend upon our network providers and facilities infrastructure.\nOur success depends upon our ability to implement, expand and adapt our network infrastructure and support services to accommodate an increasing amount of video traffic and evolving customer requirements at an acceptable cost. This has required and will continue to require that we enter into agreements with providers of infrastructure capacity, equipment, facilities and support services on an ongoing basis. We cannot ensure that any of these agreements can be obtained on satisfactory terms and conditions. We also anticipate that future expansions and adaptations of our network infrastructure facilities may be necessary in order to respond to growth in the number of customers served.\nOur network could fail, which could negatively impact our revenues.\nOur success depends upon our ability to deliver reliable, high-speed access to our channels\u2019 and customers\u2019 data centers and upon the ability and willingness of our telecommunications providers to deliver reliable, high-speed telecommunications service through their networks. Our network and facilities, and other networks and facilities providing services to us, are vulnerable to damage, unauthorized access or cessation of operations from human error and tampering, breaches of security, fires, earthquakes, severe storms, power losses, telecommunications failures, software defects, intentional acts of vandalism including computer viruses, and similar events. The occurrence of a natural disaster or other unanticipated problems at the network operations center, key sites at which we locate routers, switches and other computer equipment that make up the backbone of our service offering and hosted infrastructure, or at one or more of our partners\u2019 data centers, could substantially and adversely impact our business. We cannot ensure that we will not experience failures or shutdowns relating to individual facilities or even catastrophic failure of the entire network or hosted infrastructure. Any damage to, or failure of, our systems or service providers could result in reductions in, or terminations of, services supplied to our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur network depends upon telecommunications carriers who could limit or deny us access to their network or fail to perform, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely upon the ability and willingness of certain telecommunications carriers and other corporations to provide us with reliable high-speed telecommunications service through their networks. If these telecommunications carriers and other corporations decide not to continue to provide service to us through their networks on substantially the same terms and conditions (including, without limitation, price, early termination liability, and installation interval), if at all, it would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, many of our service level objectives are dependent upon satisfactory performance by our telecommunications carriers. If they fail to so perform, it may have a material adverse effect on our business.\nCybersecurity incidents could disrupt business operations, result in the loss of critical and confidential information, and adversely impact our reputation and results of operations.\nIn the ordinary course of providing video communications services, we transmit sensitive and proprietary information of our customers. We are dependent on the proper function, availability and security of our information systems, including without limitation those systems utilized in our operations. We have undertaken measures to protect the safety and security of our information systems and the data maintained within those systems, and on an annual basis, we test the adequacy of our security measures. As part of our efforts, we may be required to expend significant capital to protect against the threat of security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches, including unauthorized access to proprietary customer data stored in our information systems and the introduction of computer malware to our systems. However, there can be no assurance our safety and security measures will detect and prevent security breaches in a timely manner or otherwise prevent damage or interruption of our systems and operations. We may be vulnerable to losses associated with the improper functioning, security breach or unavailability of our information systems. We may be held liable to our affiliates and customers, which could result in reputational damage, litigation, or negative publicity.\nWe may experience material disconnections and/or reductions in the prices of our services and may not be able to replace the loss of revenues.\nHistorically, we have experienced both significant disconnections of services and also reductions in the prices of our services. We endeavor to obtain long-term commitments from new customers, as well as expand our relationships with current customers. The disconnection of services by our significant customers or by several of our smaller customers could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Service contract durations and termination liabilities are defined within the terms and conditions of the Company\u2019s agreements with our customers. Termination of services in our existing agreements typically require a minimum of 30 days\u2019 notice and are subject to early termination penalties equal to the amount of accrued and unpaid charges including the remaining term length multiplied by any fixed monthly fees. The standard form of service agreement with us includes an auto-renewal clause at the end of each term if the customer does not choose to terminate service at that time. Certain customers and partners negotiate master agreements with custom termination liabilities that differ from our standard form of service agreement.\nOur failure to obtain or maintain the right to use certain intellectual property may negatively affect our business.\nOur future success and competitive position depends in part upon our ability to obtain and maintain certain proprietary intellectual property to be used in connection with our services. While we are not currently engaged in any intellectual property litigation, we could become subject to lawsuits in which it is alleged that we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others or we could commence lawsuits against others who we believe are infringing upon our rights. Our involvement in intellectual property litigation could result in significant expense, adversely affecting the development of sales of the challenged product and diverting the efforts of our technical and management personnel, whether or not such litigation is resolved in our favor.\nIn the event of an adverse outcome as a defendant in any such litigation, we may, among other things, be required to pay substantial damages; cease the development, use or sale of services that infringe upon other patented intellectual property; expend significant resources to develop or acquire non-infringing intellectual property; discontinue the use or incorporation of infringing technology; or obtain licenses to the infringing intellectual property. We cannot ensure that we would be successful in such development or acquisition or that such licenses would be available upon reasonable terms. Any such development, acquisition or license could require the expenditure of substantial time and other resources and could have a negative effect on our business and financial results.\nAn adverse outcome as plaintiff in any such litigation, in addition to the costs involved, may, among other things, result in the loss of the intellectual property (such as a patent) that was the subject of the lawsuit by a determination of invalidity or unenforceability, significantly increase competition as a result of such determination, and require the payment of penalties resulting from counterclaims by the defendant.\nWe may not be able to protect the rights to its intellectual property.\nFailure to protect our existing intellectual property rights may result in the loss of our exclusivity or the right to use our technologies. If we do not adequately ensure our freedom to use certain technology, we may have to pay others for rights to use their intellectual property, pay damages for infringement or misappropriation and/or be enjoined from using such intellectual property. We rely on patent, trade secret, trademark and copyright law to protect our intellectual property. Some of our intellectual property is not covered by any patent. As we further develop our services and related intellectual property, we expect to seek additional patent protection. Our patent position is subject to complex factual and legal issues that may give rise to uncertainty as to the validity, scope and enforceability of a particular patent. Accordingly, we cannot assure that any of the patents owned by us or other patents that other parties license to us in the future will not be invalidated, circumvented, challenged, rendered unenforceable or licensed to others; any of our pending or future patent applications will be issued with the breadth of claim coverage sought by it, if issued at all; or any patents owned by or licensed to us, although valid, will not be dominated by a patent or patents to others\nhaving broader claims. Additionally, effective patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret protection may be unavailable, limited or not applied for in certain foreign countries.\nWe also seek to protect our proprietary intellectual property, including intellectual property that may not be patented or patentable, in part by confidentiality agreements. We cannot ensure that these agreements will not be breached, that we will have adequate remedies for any breach or that such persons will not assert rights to intellectual property arising out of these relationships.\nWe are exposed to the credit and other counterparty risk of our customers in the ordinary course of our business.\nOur customers have varying degrees of creditworthiness, and we may not always be able to fully anticipate or detect deterioration in their creditworthiness and overall financial condition, which could expose us to an increased risk of nonpayment under our contracts with them. In the event that a material customer or customers default on their payment obligations to us, discontinue buying services from us or use their buying power with us to reduce its revenue, this could materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur future plans could be adversely affected if we are unable to attract or retain key personnel.\nWe have attracted a highly skilled management team and specialized workforce. Our future success is dependent in part on attracting and retaining qualified management and technical personnel. Our inability to hire qualified personnel on a timely basis, or the departure of key employees (including Peter Holst, Glowpoint\u2019s President and CEO) without a suitable replacement therefor could materially and adversely affect our business development and therefore, our business, prospects, results of operations and financial condition.\nIf our actual liability for sales and use taxes and federal regulatory fees is different from our accrued liability, it could have a material impact on our financial condition.\nEach state has different rules and regulations governing sales and use taxes, and these rules and regulations are subject to varying interpretations that may change over time. We review these rules and regulations periodically and, when we believe our services are subject to sales and use taxes in a particular state, voluntarily engages state tax authorities in order to determine how to comply with their rules and regulations. Vendors of services, like us, are typically held responsible by taxing authorities for the collection and payment of any applicable sales taxes and federal fees. If one or more taxing authorities determines that taxes should have, but have not, been paid with respect to our services, we may be liable for past taxes in addition to taxes going forward. Liability for past taxes may also include very substantial interest and penalty charges. Our customer contracts provide that our customers must pay all applicable sales taxes and fees. Nevertheless, customers may be reluctant to pay back taxes and may refuse responsibility for interest or penalties associated with those taxes. If we are required to collect and pay back taxes and the associated interest and penalties, and if our customers fail or refuse to reimburse us for all or a portion of these amounts, we will have incurred unplanned expenses that may be substantial. Moreover, imposition of such taxes on our services going forward will effectively increase the cost of such services to our customers and may adversely affect our ability to retain existing customers or to gain new customers in the areas in which such taxes are imposed. We may also become subject to tax audits or similar procedures in states where we already pays sales and use taxes. The assessment of taxes, interest, and penalties as a result of audits, litigation, or otherwise could be materially adverse to our current and future results of operations and financial condition.\nWe depend upon suppliers and have limited sources for some services.\nWe rely on other companies to supply some components of our network infrastructure and the means to access our network. Certain products and services that we resell and certain components that we require for our network are available only from limited sources. We could be adversely affected if such sources were to become unavailable to us on commercially reasonable terms. We cannot ensure that, on an ongoing basis, we will be able to obtain third-party services cost-effectively and on the scale and within the time frames that we require, if at all. Failure to obtain or to continue to make use of such third-party services would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur failure to properly manage the distribution of our services could result in a loss of revenues.\nWe currently sell our services both directly to customers and through channel partners. Successfully managing the interaction of our direct and indirect sales channels to reach various potential customers for our services is a complex process. Each sales channel has distinct risks and costs, and therefore, our failure to implement the most advantageous balance in the sales model for our services could adversely affect our revenue and profitability.\nWe incur significant accounting and administrative costs as a publicly traded corporation that impact our financial condition.\nAs a publicly traded corporation, we incur certain costs to comply with regulatory requirements. If regulatory requirements were to become more stringent or if controls thought to be effective later fail, we may be forced to make additional expenditures, the amounts of which could be material. Some of our competitors are privately owned so their comparatively lower accounting and administrative costs can be a competitive disadvantage for us. Should our sales continue to decline or if we are unsuccessful at increasing prices to cover higher expenditures for internal controls and audits, ours costs associated with regulatory compliance will rise as a percentage of sales.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal controls, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, current and potential stockholders may not be confident in our financial reporting, which could adversely affect the price of our stock and harm our business.\nPursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, we are required to include in our annual report on Form 10-K its assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting. Although we believe that we currently have adequate internal control procedures in place, we cannot be certain that our internal controls over financial reporting will remain effective. If we cannot adequately maintain the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting, we may be subject to liability and/or sanctions or investigation by regulatory authorities, such as the SEC. Any such action could adversely affect our financial results and the market price of our common stock.\nRisks Related to the Proposed Merger with SharedLabs\nThere can be no assurance that a transaction will be consummated.\nAll of the conditions to the closing of the Merger would have to be satisfied or, if permissible, waived, in order for the Merger to be completed. The conditions to the closing of the Merger require, among other things, Glowpoint and SharedLabs to (i) complete, file with the SEC and obtain from the SEC the effectiveness of a Registration Statement on Form S-4 pursuant to which the shares of Common Stock to be issued in connection with the Merger are to be registered with the SEC; and (ii) satisfy the initial listing standards of the NYSE American, including but not limited to standards with respect to market value of public float, stockholders\u2019 equity and minimum price per listed share, all of which may be difficult or impossible for the combined organization to satisfy. In addition, the conditions to the closing of the Merger also include, among other things, the receipt of all required approvals of our stockholders and the stockholders of SharedLabs and any required third-party consents and regulatory clearances, including from the NYSE American, the completion by SharedLabs of an equity financing on terms set forth in the Merger Agreement, the execution of one or more term sheets by SharedLabs with lending institutions for one or more credit facilities aggregating not less than $16 million in borrowing capacity, the satisfaction and termination prior to closing of all contracts or other agreements to which SharedLabs is a party that provide a counterparty with redeemable or contingent common stock or a guaranteed return, and other customary closing conditions. To our knowledge, many of these conditions to closing remain uncompleted. In addition, many of these conditions to closing are outside of our control, and conditions to closing constituting obligations of SharedLabs may be outside of their sole control. The satisfaction of these conditions to the closing of the Merger will require the dedication of large amounts of financial resources and management attention from each of Glowpoint and SharedLabs, and there can be no assurance that all conditions to the closing of the Merger will be satisfied or, if permissible, waived.\nThe exchange ratio is not adjustable based on the market price of our common stock, so the Merger Consideration at the closing may have a greater or lesser value than at the time the Merger Agreement was signed.\nSubject to certain exchange ratio adjustment mechanisms, the Merger Agreement has set the exchange ratio for our common stock, and the exchange ratio is based on the outstanding capital stock of SharedLabs and the outstanding common stock of the Company, in each case immediately prior to the closing of the Merger. Any changes in the market price of our common stock before the completion of the Merger will not affect the number of shares of our common stock issuable to SharedLabs\u2019 stockholders pursuant to the Merger Agreement. Therefore, if before the completion of the Merger the market price of our common stock declines from the market price on the date of the Merger Agreement, then SharedLabs\u2019 stockholders could receive Merger Consideration with substantially lower value than the value of such Merger Consideration on the date of the Merger Agreement. Similarly, if before the completion of the Merger the market price of our common stock increases from the market price of our common stock on the date of the Merger Agreement, then SharedLabs\u2019 stockholders could receive Merger Consideration with substantially greater value than the value of such Merger Consideration on the date of the Merger Agreement. The Merger Agreement does not include a price-based termination right. Because the exchange ratio does not adjust as a result of changes in the market price of our common stock, for each one percentage point change in the market price of our common stock, there is a corresponding one percentage point rise or decline, respectively, in the value of the total Merger Consideration payable to SharedLabs\u2019 stockholders pursuant to the Merger Agreement.\nRequired regulatory clearances and approvals may impose conditions to the closing of the Merger that are not presently anticipated or that cannot be met.\nCompletion of the Merger is conditioned upon the receipt of all required regulatory clearances and approvals, including filing and obtaining the effectiveness of the Form S-4 Registration Statement with the SEC, and approval from the NYSE American for the listing of the shares of common stock to be issued to the stockholders of SharedLabs in the Merger. Further, we will be required by the NYSE American to file an initial listing application for the combined organization and to satisfy the initial listing requirements of such exchange in order to remain listed on the NYSE American following completion of the Merger. Receipt of the NYSE American\u2019s approval of such initial listing application is a condition to closing under the Merger Agreement and will require the combined organization to meet the NYSE American\u2019s initial listing standards, including but not limited to standards with respect to such entity\u2019s market value of public float, stockholders\u2019 equity and minimum price per listed share, that may be difficult or impossible for such entity to satisfy. These initial listing standards are generally more strict than the NYSE American\u2019s continued listing standards, and meeting them will constitute a significant challenge for the combined organization. In addition to the foregoing, there may be other regulatory clearances and approvals that the Company and SharedLabs will be required to receive in order to complete the Merger, any of which may be outside of our control. There can be no assurance that the Company and SharedLabs will be able to meet these or other conditions to the closing of the Merger.\nFailure to complete the Merger may result in us or SharedLabs paying a termination fee or expenses to the other party and could significantly harm the market price of our common stock and negatively affect the future business and operations of each company.\nIf the Merger is not completed and the Merger Agreement is terminated under certain circumstances, we or SharedLabs may be required to pay the other party a termination fee of $250,000 or reimburse the transaction expenses of the other party, up to a maximum of $1,000,000. Even if a termination fee is not payable or transaction expenses are not reimbursable in connection with a termination of the Merger Agreement, each of us and SharedLabs will have incurred significant fees and expenses, such as legal and accounting fees, which must be paid whether or not the Merger is completed. Further, if the Merger is not completed, it could significantly harm the market price of our common stock.\nIn addition, if the Merger Agreement is terminated and the board of directors of the Company or SharedLabs determines to seek another business combination, there can be no assurance that either we or SharedLabs will be able to find a partner and close an alternative transaction on terms that are as favorable or more favorable than the terms set forth in the Merger Agreement.\nThe Merger may be completed even though certain events occur prior to the closing that materially and adversely affect us or SharedLabs.\nThe Merger Agreement provides that either us or SharedLabs can refuse to complete the Merger if there is a material adverse change affecting the other party between December 20, 2018, the date of the Merger Agreement, and the closing of the Merger. However, certain types of changes do not permit either party to refuse to complete the Merger, even if such change could be said to have a material adverse effect on us or SharedLabs, including changes relating to or arising in connection with:\n\u2022\nthe public announcement or the pendency of the Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated thereby, or any actions required to be taken (or refrained from being taken) in compliance with the Merger Agreement, including any action taken (or omitted to be taken) with the written consent of or at the written request of us (in the case of SharedLabs) or SharedLabs (in the case of Glowpoint);\n\u2022\nany change in federal, state, non-U.S. or local law, regulations, policies or procedures, or interpretations thereof, GAAP or regulatory accounting requirements applicable or potentially applicable to the industries in which we or SharedLabs operate;\n\u2022\nchanges generally affecting the industries in which we or SharedLabs or any of their subsidiaries operate that are not specifically related to us or SharedLabs or any of their subsidiaries and that do not have a materially disproportionate adverse effect on us and its subsidiaries taken as a whole or SharedLabs and its subsidiaries taken as a whole;\n\u2022\nchanges in general economic conditions or political conditions, or in the financial, credit or securities markets in general (including changes in the prevailing interest rates, exchange rates or stock, bond and/or debt prices) in the United States, in any region thereof, or in any non-U.S. or global economy that do not have a materially disproportionate adverse effect on us and our subsidiaries taken as a whole or SharedLabs and its subsidiaries taken as a whole;\n\u2022\nany attack on, or by, outbreak or escalation of hostilities or acts of terrorism (including cyberterrorism) involving, the United States, or any declaration of war by the United States Congress or any hurricane or other natural disaster;\n\u2022\nin the case of the Company, changes in the market price or trading volume of its common stock on the NYSE American; and\n\u2022\nin the case of the Company, changes relating to or arising in connection with, but not materially worse than, our historical negative financial results and historical negative trends reflected in our past filings with the SEC.\nIf adverse changes occur and we and SharedLabs still complete the Merger, the market price of the combined organization\u2019s common stock may suffer. This in turn may reduce the value of the Merger to the stockholders of the Company, SharedLabs or both.\nEven if the Merger is completed, the combined organization will need to raise additional capital by issuing securities or debt, which may cause significant dilution to the combined organization\u2019s stockholders and restrict the combined organization\u2019s operations.\nWhile the completion of the Merger is contingent upon the completion by SharedLabs of certain debt and equity financings described in the Merger Agreement, we may, under the terms of the Merger Agreement, elect to waive such conditions to closing and proceed to close the Merger with a reduction in the shares of common stock to be issued to SharedLabs\u2019 stockholders. As a result of such waiver or otherwise, following the completion of the Merger, we expect the combined organization will need to raise additional capital to fund its near and long-term operations. Additional financing may not be available to the combined organization when it needs it or may not be available on favorable terms. To the extent that the combined organization raises additional capital by issuing equity securities, the terms of such an issuance may cause more significant dilution to the combined organization\u2019s stockholders\u2019 ownership, and the terms of any new equity securities may have preferences over the combined organization\u2019s common stock. Any debt financing the combined organization enters into may involve covenants that restrict its operations. These restrictive covenants may include limitations on additional borrowing and specific restrictions on the use of the combined organization\u2019s assets, as well as prohibitions on its ability to create liens, pay dividends, redeem its stock or make investments.\nThe market price of our common stock following the Merger may decline as a result of the Merger.\nThe market price of our common stock may decline as a result of the Merger for a number of reasons, including if:\n\u2022\ninvestors react negatively to the prospects of the combined organization\u2019s product line, business and financial condition following the Merger;\n\u2022\nthe effect of the Merger on the combined organization\u2019s business and prospects is not consistent with the expectations of financial or industry analysts; or\n\u2022\nthe combined organization does not achieve the perceived benefits of the Merger as rapidly or to the extent anticipated by financial or industry analysts. The Company and SharedLabs stockholders may not realize a benefit from the Merger commensurate with the ownership dilution they will experience in connection with the Merger.\nIf the combined organization is unable to realize the strategic and financial benefits currently anticipated from the Merger, the Company and SharedLabs stockholders will have experienced substantial dilution of their ownership interests in their respective companies without receiving the expected commensurate benefit, or only receiving part of the commensurate benefit to the extent the combined organization is able to realize only part of the expected strategic and financial benefits currently anticipated from the Merger.\nDuring the pendency of the Merger, we and SharedLabs may not be able to enter into a business combination with another party at a favorable price because of restrictions in the Merger Agreement, and such parties may experience other restrictions on its business, which could, in each case, adversely affect their respective businesses.\nCovenants in the Merger Agreement impede the ability of us and SharedLabs to make acquisitions, subject to certain exceptions relating to fiduciary duties, as set forth below, or to complete other transactions that are not in the ordinary course of business pending completion of the Merger. As a result, if the Merger is not completed, the parties may be at a disadvantage to their competitors during such period. In addition, while the Merger Agreement is in effect, each party is generally prohibited from soliciting, initiating, encouraging or entering into certain extraordinary transactions, such as a merger, sale of assets, or other business combination outside the ordinary course of business with any third party, subject to certain exceptions relating to fiduciary duties, as set forth below. Any such transactions could be favorable to such party\u2019s stockholders.\nFurthermore, uncertainty about the effect of the Merger on our employees and customers or those of SharedLabs may have an adverse effect on both parties on a pre-transaction and post-transaction basis. These uncertainties may impair our ability and the ability of SharedLabs to attract, retain and motivate key personnel until the Merger is consummated, and could cause customers and others that deal with us or SharedLabs to seek to change existing business relationships. Retention of certain employees may be challenging while the transaction is pending, as certain employees may experience uncertainty about their\nfuture roles. If key employees depart because of issues relating to the uncertainty and difficulty of integration or a desire not to remain following the transaction, the combined organization\u2019s business following the transaction could be harmed.\nFailure to complete or a delay in completing the Merger may have an adverse effect on both companies\u2019 businesses due to uncertainty or operating restrictions while the Merger is pending or cause the market price of our stock to drop.\nNeither party can predict what the effect on the market price of its shares would be if the Merger is not completed, but depending on market conditions at the time, it could result in a decline in market price. A substantial delay in completing the transaction due to the need to file and obtain the effectiveness of the Form S-4 Registration Statement, satisfy conditions to closing, or the imposition of any unfavorable terms, conditions, or restrictions in obtaining a waiver to such conditions or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on the anticipated benefits of, or increase the costs associated with or delay the cost savings anticipated from, the transaction, thereby impacting our or SharedLabs\u2019 business, prospects, results of operation and financial condition or results of operations after the Merger. In addition, the parties may be subject to restrictions on the operation of their business while the Merger is pending, which could impair their ability to operate their business and prevent them from pursuing attractive business opportunities that may arise prior to the completion of the transaction. Any of these situations could also result in a decline in the market price of our Common Stock.\nCertain provisions of the Merger Agreement may discourage third parties from submitting alternative takeover proposals, including proposals that may be superior to the arrangements contemplated by the Merger Agreement.\nThe terms of the Merger Agreement prohibit each of us and SharedLabs, from soliciting alternative takeover proposals or cooperating with persons making unsolicited acquisition proposals, except in limited circumstances when such party\u2019s board of directors determines in good faith that an unsolicited acquisition proposal is or is reasonably likely to lead to a superior proposal and that failure to cooperate with the proponent of the proposal would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the board of directors\u2019 fiduciary duties and in certain other limited circumstances.\nBecause the lack of a public market for SharedLabs\u2019 capital stock makes it difficult to evaluate the value of SharedLabs\u2019 capital stock, the stockholders of SharedLabs may receive shares of our common stock in the Merger that have a value that is less than, or greater than, the fair market value of SharedLabs\u2019 capital stock.\nThe outstanding capital stock of SharedLabs is privately held and is not traded in any public market. The lack of a public market makes it extremely difficult to determine the fair market value of SharedLabs. Because the percentage of our common stock to be issued to SharedLabs stockholders was determined based on negotiations between the parties, it is possible that the value of our common stock to be received by SharedLabs stockholders will be less than the fair market value of SharedLabs, or we may pay more than the aggregate fair market value for SharedLabs.\nThe issuance of our common stock to SharedLabs security holders in connection with the transaction will substantially dilute the voting power of our stockholders.\nIf the Merger is completed, we will issue a significant percentage of our outstanding shares of capital stock to SharedLabs\u2019 security holders as consideration for the acquisition of SharedLabs, such that, upon consummation of the Merger, our stockholders existing prior to the transaction would collectively own an approximately 34% interest in the combined organization, based on the number of shares of our and SharedLabs common stock outstanding on February 28, 2019, and not including any of our common shares reserved for future issuance under the Glowpoint 2019 Equity Incentive Plan to be approved in connection with the Merger. The issuance of our securities to SharedLabs security holders in connection with the transaction will significantly reduce the relative voting power of each share of our common stock held by its current stockholders.\nCash costs associated with the proposed Merger will negatively impact the financial condition, operating results and cash flow for each of the Company and SharedLabs.\nThe Company and SharedLabs have each incurred and expect to continue to incur a number of non-recurring costs associated with the proposed Merger. These costs and expenses include fees paid to financial, legal and accounting advisors, filing fees, printing expenses and other related charges, and, if a Merger is consummated, facilities and systems consolidation costs, potential employment-related costs and other expenses related to the integration of processes, policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems between us and SharedLabs. There are many factors beyond the parties\u2019 control that could affect the total amount or the timing of such expenses. These transaction expenses, coupled with the parties\u2019 ongoing costs and expenses of conducting their businesses, will negatively impact each party\u2019s financial condition, operating results and cash flow over the course of the transaction.\nIn addition, there may also be additional unanticipated significant costs in connection with the business combination that the combined organization may not recoup. These costs and expenses could reduce the realization of efficiencies, strategic benefits\nand additional income we expect to achieve from the business combination. Although we expect that these benefits will offset the transaction expenses and implementation costs over time, this net benefit may not be achieved in the near term or at all.\nThe failure to successfully operate and integrate our business and the business of SharedLabs in the expected timeframe could adversely affect the combined organization\u2019s future results following the completion of the transaction.\nThe success of the transaction will depend, in large part, on the ability of the combined organization following the completion of the transaction to realize the anticipated benefits from combining our and SharedLabs\u2019 respective businesses. The failure to operate and integrate successfully and to manage successfully the challenges presented by the integration process may result in the combined organization\u2019s failure to achieve some or all of the anticipated benefits of the transaction. Potential difficulties that may be encountered in the integration process include the following:\n\u2022\nusing the combined organization\u2019s cash and other assets efficiently to develop the business of the combined organization;\n\u2022\nappropriately managing the liabilities of the combined organization;\n\u2022\nlimited experience of management in performing acquisitions and managing growth;\n\u2022\npotential unknown and unforeseen expenses, delays or regulatory conditions associated with the transaction; and\n\u2022\nperformance shortfalls at one or both of the companies as a result of the diversion of management\u2019s attention caused by completing the transaction and integrating the companies\u2019 operations.\nRisks to Owning Glowpoint Common Stock\nThroughout much of our history, our common stock has been thinly traded and subject to volatile price fluctuations.\nThroughout much of our corporate history, our common stock has been thinly traded, and has therefore been susceptible to wide price swings. Our common stock is currently traded on the NYSE American under the symbol \u201cGLOW.\u201d While our common stock has recently experienced increased trading volume, we cannot ensure that this level of trading volume will continue, or that the increased trading volumes will lessen the historic volatility in the price for our common stock. Thinly traded stocks are more susceptible to significant and sudden price changes and the liquidity of our common stock depends upon the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers and sellers. At any time, the liquidity of our common stock may decrease to the thinly traded levels it has experienced in the past, and we cannot ensure that any holder of our securities will be able to find a buyer for its shares. Further, we cannot ensure that an organized public market for our securities will continue or that there will be any private demand for our common stock.\nWe could fail to satisfy the standards to maintain our listing on a stock exchange.\nWe could fail to satisfy the standards for continued exchange listing on the NYSE American, such as standards having to do with a minimum share price, the minimum number of public shareholders, a minimum amount of stockholders\u2019 equity or the aggregate market value of publicly held shares. As previously disclosed, on July 5, 2018, we received a letter (the \u201cDeficiency Letter\u201d) from the NYSE American stating that we were not in compliance with the continued listing standards as set forth in Section 1003(f)(v) of the NYSE American Company Guide (the \u201cCompany Guide\u201d). Specifically, the Deficiency Letter informed us that the NYSE American had determined that shares of our common stock had been selling for a low price per share for a substantial period of time and, pursuant to Section 1003(f)(v) of the Company Guide, the continued listing of our common stock on the NYSE American was predicated on our effecting a reverse stock split of our common stock or otherwise demonstrating sustained price improvement within a reasonable period of time, which the NYSE American determined to be no later than January 5, 2019. As disclosed in our Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on January 7, 2019, the NYSE American subsequently granted us an additional time period to the date of our annual meeting in May 2019 to regain compliance with the continued listing standards as set forth in Section 1003(f)(v) of the Company Guide. Given the many conditions to the closing of the Merger discussed in this Report, we are currently working to implement, in the near future, a reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock. See Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Report for more information regarding this proposed reverse stock split. While there can be no assurances that a reverse stock split of our issued and outstanding Common Stock will be implemented in the near future, we expect that either such an interim reverse stock split or the reverse stock split expected to be effected in connection with the proposed Merger will allow the company to regain compliance with this continued listing standard. However, there can be no guaranty that any such reverse stock split will be effected on the terms disclosed herein or at all, or that any such measures will be successful or that the NYSE American will deem the company to be in compliance.\nFurther, we will be required by the NYSE American to file an initial listing application for the combined organization and to satisfy the initial listing requirements of such exchange in order to remain listed on the NYSE American following completion\nof the Merger with SharedLabs. Receipt of the NYSE American\u2019s approval of such initial listing application is a condition to closing under the Merger Agreement and will require the combined organization to meet the NYSE American\u2019s initial listing standards, including but not limited to standards with respect to such entity\u2019s market value of public float, stockholders\u2019 equity and minimum price per listed share, each of which may be difficult or impossible for the combined organization to satisfy.\nAs a result of each of the foregoing, we may be unable to maintain our listing on the NYSE American, which would negatively affect, among other things (i) our ability to complete the Merger, (ii) our ability to raise capital on terms we deem advisable, or at all, and (iii) the liquidity of our common stock. Failure to obtain financing, or obtaining financing on unfavorable terms, could result in a decrease in our stock price, would have a material adverse effect on future operating prospects, and could require us to significantly reduce operations.\nAny holder of our securities should regard them as a long-term investment and should be prepared to bear the economic risk of an investment in such securities for an indefinite period.\nPenny stock regulations may impose certain restrictions on the marketability of our securities.\nThe SEC has adopted regulations which generally define a \u201cpenny stock\u201d to be any equity security that has a market price less than $5.00 per share, subject to certain exceptions. Our common stock is presently subject to these regulations, which impose additional sales practice requirements on broker-dealers who sell such securities to persons other than established customers and accredited investors (generally those with a net worth in excess of $1,000,000 or annual income exceeding $200,000, or $300,000 together with their spouse). For transactions covered by these rules, the broker-dealer must make a special suitability determination for the purchase of such securities and have received the purchaser\u2019s written consent to the transaction prior to the purchase. Additionally, for any transaction involving a \u201cpenny stock,\u201d unless exempt, the rules require the delivery, prior to the transaction, of a risk disclosure document mandated by the SEC relating to the \u201cpenny stock\u201d market. The broker-dealer must also disclose the commission payable to both the broker-dealer and the registered representative, current quotations for the securities and, if the broker-dealer is the sole market maker, the broker-dealer must disclose this fact and the broker-dealer\u2019s presumed control over the market. Finally, monthly statements must be sent disclosing recent price information for the \u201cpenny stock\u201d held in the account and information on the limited market in \u201cpenny stocks.\u201d Consequently, the \u201cpenny stock\u201d rules may restrict the ability of broker-dealers to sell our securities and may negatively affect the ability of purchasers of our shares of common stock to sell such securities.\nFuture operating results may vary from quarter to quarter, and we may fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors at any given time.\nWe have experienced, and may continue to experience, significant quarterly fluctuations in operating results. Factors that cause fluctuation in our results of operations include lack of growth, declines in revenue and our ability to control expenses relative to our revenue. Accordingly, it is possible that in one or more future quarters our operating results will be adversely affected and fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors. If this happens, the trading price of our common stock may decline.\nSales of substantial amounts of common stock in the public market, or the perception that such sales may occur, could reduce the market price of our common stock and make it more difficult for us and our stockholders to sell our equity securities in the future.\nThe sale into the public market of a significant number of shares issued in the Merger or in future financings, or the resale into the public market of shares issued in prior financings, could depress the trading price of our common stock and make it more difficult for us or our stockholders to sell equity securities in the future. Such transactions may include, but are not limited to (i) any future issuances by us of additional shares of our common stock or of other securities that are convertible or exchangeable for shares of common stock; (ii) the resale of any previously issued but restricted shares of our common stock that become freely available for re-sale, whether through an effective registration statement or under Rule 144 of the Securities Act; and (iii) future conversions of some or all of our outstanding Series C Convertible Preferred Stock into shares of our common stock, which may dilute the ownership interests of our common stockholders upon conversion, and any sales in the public market of any shares of our common stock issued upon such conversion, which could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock.\nWhile the sale of shares to the public might increase the trading volume of our common stock and thus the liquidity of our stockholders\u2019 investments, the resulting increase in the number of shares available for public sale could drive the price of our common stock down, thus reducing the value of our stockholders\u2019 investment and perhaps hindering our ability to raise additional funds in the future.\nOur common stock ranks junior to our outstanding shares of Series A-2 Convertible Preferred Stock and Series C Convertible Preferred Stock with respect to any dividends and upon liquidation.\nThe rights of the holders of our common stock rank junior to the rights of the holders of our outstanding shares of preferred stock with respect to any dividends and payments upon the Company\u2019s liquidation, dissolution or winding up. Further, our certificate of incorporation permits our board of directors to authorize the issuance of additional series of preferred stock that would rank senior to our common stock with respect to any dividends and payments upon the Company\u2019s liquidation, dissolution or winding up. As of the filing of this Report, no shares of Series B Preferred Stock remain outstanding.\nOur charter documents and Delaware law could discourage takeover attempts and lead to management entrenchment.\nThe Company\u2019s certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of the company. These provisions could also make it difficult for stockholders to elect directors that are not nominated by the current members of the board of directors or take other corporate actions, including effecting changes in the Company\u2019s management. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nno cumulative voting in the election of directors, which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors to issue shares of preferred stock and to determine the price and other terms of those shares, including preferences and voting rights, without stockholder approval, which could be used to significantly dilute the ownership of a hostile acquirer;\n\u2022\nthe exclusive right of our board of directors to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of our board of directors or the resignation, death or removal of a director, which prevents stockholders from being able to fill vacancies on its board of directors;\n\u2022\nthe requirement that a special meeting of stockholders may be called only by the chairman of our board of directors or a majority of our board of directors, which could delay the ability of our stockholders to force consideration of a proposal or to take action, including the removal of directors;\n\u2022\nthe ability of our board of directors, by majority vote, to amend the Company\u2019s amended and restated bylaws, which may allow our board of directors to take additional actions to prevent an unsolicited takeover and inhibit the ability of an acquirer to amend the amended and restated bylaws to facilitate an unsolicited takeover attempt; and\n\u2022\nadvance notice procedures with which stockholders must comply to nominate candidates to our board of directors or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders\u2019 meeting, which may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation of proxies to elect the acquirer\u2019s own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of the Company.", "PERMNO": 81761, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "OBLG"}
