RISK FACTORS\nSeveral of the matters discussed in this document contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Factors associated with the forward-looking statements that could cause actual results to differ from those projected or forecast are included in the statements below. In addition to other information contained in this report, readers should carefully consider the following cautionary statements and risk factors.\nU.S. and global financial and economic uncertainties could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur performance is subject to worldwide economic conditions and their impact on levels of consumer spending that affect not only the ultimate consumer, but also retailers, which are served by many of our largest customers. The worldwide apparel industry is heavily influenced by general economic cycles. Purchases of fashion apparel and accessories tend to decline in periods of recession or uncertainty regarding future economic prospects, as disposable income declines. Many factors affect the level of consumer spending in the apparel industries, including among others: prevailing economic conditions, levels of employment, salaries and wage rates, energy costs, interest rates, the availability of consumer credit, taxation and consumer confidence in future economic conditions. During periods of recession or economic uncertainty, we may not be able to maintain or increase our sales to existing customers, make sales to new customers, or maintain our earnings from operations as a percentage of net sales. As a result, our operating results may be adversely and materially affected by weak or downward trends in the United States or global economy.\nIf we lose our larger brand and retail nominations or customers, or the customers fail to purchase at anticipated levels, our sales and operating results will be adversely affected.\nOur results of operations depend to a significant extent upon the commercial success of our larger brand nominations and customers. If we lose our significant brand nominations, or these customers fail to purchase our products at anticipated levels, or our relationship with these customers or the brands and retailers they serve diminishes, it may have an adverse effect on our results because we may lose a primary source of revenue if these customers choose not to purchase our products or services; we may lose the nomination of the retailer or brand; we may not be able to recoup development and inventory costs associated with this customer; and we may not be able to collect our receivables from them.\nWe may not be able to satisfy the financial covenants in our Credit Agreement and if we cannot, then our lender could declare the debt obligations in default.\nOur Commercial Credit Agreement, originally entered into on December 31, 2013 (the \u201cCredit Agreement\u201d), with our secured lender, MUFG Union Bank, N.A. (formerly Union Bank, N.A. , \u201cUnion Bank\u201d), requires certain covenants, including a minimum level of EBITDA (as defined in the Credit Agreement). If we fail to satisfy the Credit Agreement covenants, the Credit Agreement could be in default and the outstanding balance could be declared immediately due and payable by the lender.\nWhile we did not satisfy the minimum fixed charge coverage covenant and the minimum EBITDA covenant under the Credit Agreement for the 12-month periods ended September 30, 2014 and December 31, 2014, we obtained waivers of the non-compliance from Union Bank for those periods. We have recently agreed to amended covenants with Union Bank for the remaining term of the Credit Agreement. As a result of this amendment, we anticipate that we will meet the required covenants in the next year. However, there can be no assurance that we will satisfy these covenants for future periods (See Subsequent Events Note 11 to the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements).\nIn the event we do not meet the required covenants in future periods, we will either negotiate for changes in the relative covenants or negotiate a waiver with the lender. There is no assurance that Union Bank will grant future waivers. Our expectations of future operating results and compliance with all debt covenants cannot be assured and our lender\u2019s actions are not controllable by us. If we default under the loan agreement, all amounts due under the loan agreement could be declared immediately due and payable and, unless we are able to secure alternative financing to repay the lender, the lender would have the right to exercise its remedies including enforcement of its lien on substantially all of our assets. Further, if the debt is placed in default, we could be required to reduce our expenses, curtail operations and/or raise capital through the sale of assets, issuance of equity or otherwise.\nThe loss of key management and sales personnel could adversely affect our business, including our ability to obtain and secure accounts and generate sales.\nOur success has and will continue to depend upon key management and sales personnel, many of whom would be difficult to replace. The loss of the services of key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, including our ability to establish and maintain client relationships. Our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain personnel with a variety of sales, operating and managerial skills.\nGlobal credit conditions may increase our credit risks.\nMost of our customers are extended credit terms which are approved by us internally. While we attempt to cover as much of our credit risks as possible, not all of our risks can be fully covered due to the countries we operate in or the current credit conditions. Such exposure may translate into losses should there be any adverse changes to the financial condition of customers.\nWe operate in an industry that is subject to significant fluctuations in operating results that may result in unexpected reductions in revenue and stock price volatility.\nWe operate in an industry that is subject to seasonal and operational fluctuations that can significantly impact our results from quarter to quarter. Factors that may influence our quarterly operating results include:\n\u25cf\nThe volume and timing of customer orders received during the quarter;\n\u25cf\nThe timing and magnitude of customers\u2019 marketing campaigns;\n\u25cf\nThe loss or addition of a major customer or of a major retailer nomination;\n\u25cf\nThe availability and pricing of materials for our products;\n\u25cf\nThe increased expenses incurred in connection with the introduction of new products;\n\u25cf\nCurrency fluctuations;\n\u25cf\nPolitical factors that may affect the expected flow of commerce;\n\u25cf\nDelays caused by third parties; and\n\u25cf\nChanges in our product mix or in the relative contribution to sales of our subsidiaries.\nDue to these factors, it is possible that in some quarters our operating results may be below our stockholders\u2019 expectations and those of public market analysts. If this occurs, the price of our common stock could be adversely affected.\nOur products may not comply with various industry and governmental regulations and our customers may incur losses in their products or operations as a consequence of our non-compliance.\nOur products are produced under strict supervision and controls to ensure that all materials and manufacturing processes comply with the industry and governmental regulations governing the markets in which these products are sold. However, if these controls fail to detect or prevent non-compliant materials from entering the manufacturing process, our products could cause damages to our customers' products or processes and could also result in fines being incurred. The possible damages, replacement costs and fines could significantly exceed the value of our products and these risks may not be covered by our insurance policies.\nIf customers default on inventory purchase commitments with us, we may be left holding non-salable inventory.\nWe hold inventories for specific customer programs, which the customers have committed to purchase. If any customer defaults on these commitments, or insists on markdowns, we may incur a charge in connection with our holding non-salable inventory and this would have a negative impact on our operations and cash flow.\nBecause we depend on a limited number of suppliers, we may not be able to always obtain materials when we need them and we may lose sales and customers.\nLead times for materials we order can vary significantly and depend on many factors, including the specific supplier, the contract terms and the demand for particular materials at a given time. From time to time, we may experience fluctuations in the prices and disruptions in the supply of materials. Shortages or disruptions in the supply of materials, or our inability to procure materials from alternate sources at acceptable prices in a timely manner, could lead us to miss deadlines for orders and lose sales and customers.\nOur customers have cyclical buying patterns which may cause us to have periods of low sales volume.\nMost of our customers are in the apparel industry. The apparel industry historically has been subject to substantial cyclical variations. Our business has experienced significant cyclical fluctuations due, in part, to customer buying patterns, which may result in periods of low sales usually in the first and fourth quarters of our financial year. Backlogs of sales orders are not considered material in the industries in which we compete, which reduces the predictability of revenues and reinforces the volatility of these cyclical buying patterns on our sales volume.\nIf we experience disruptions at any of our foreign facilities, we will not be able to meet our obligations and may lose sales and customers.\nCurrently, we do not operate duplicate facilities in different geographic areas. Therefore, in the event of a regional disruption where we maintain one or more of our facilities, it is unlikely that we could shift our operations to a different geographic region and we may have to cease or curtail our operations in a selected area. This may cause us to lose sales and customers. The types of disruptions that may occur include:\n\u25cf\nForeign trade disruptions;\n\u25cf\nImport restrictions;\n\u25cf\nLabor disruptions;\n\u25cf\nEmbargoes;\n\u25cf\nGovernment intervention;\n\u25cf\nNatural disasters; or\n\u25cf\nRegional pandemics.\nCounterfeit products are not uncommon in the apparel industry and our customers may make claims against us for products we have not produced, adversely impacting us by these false claims.\nCounterfeiting of valuable trade names is commonplace in the apparel industry and while there are industry organizations and federal laws designed to protect the brand owner, these counterfeit products are not always detected and it can be difficult to prove the manufacturing source of these products. Accordingly, we may be adversely affected if counterfeit products damage our relationships with customers, and we incur costs to prove these products are counterfeit, to defend ourselves against false claims and to pay for false claims.\nOn occasion, we have discovered that certain Asian factories have counterfeited Talon\u2019s zippers. We undertake efforts to eliminate and prosecute all offenders. Counterfeiting of known quality brand products is commonplace within Asia and in particular where retailers limit their sources to recognized brands such as Talon. The full extent of counterfeiting of Talon products, its effect on our business operations and the costs to investigate and eliminate this activity are ongoing and are generally undeterminable. However, based upon evidence available, we believe the impact is not significant to our current overall operations. We continue to work closely with major retailers to identify these activities within the marketplace and will aggressively combat these efforts worldwide to protect the Talon brand.\nOur business model is dependent on integration of information systems on a global basis and, to the extent that we fail to maintain and support our information systems, it can result in lost revenues.\nWe must consolidate and centralize the management of our subsidiaries and significantly expand and improve our financial and operating controls. Additionally, we must effectively integrate the information systems of our worldwide operations with the information systems of our principal offices in California. Our failure to do so could result in lost revenues, delay financial reporting or have adverse effects on the information reported.\nInternet-based systems that we rely upon for our order tracking and management systems may experience disruptions and as a result we may lose revenues and customers.\nTo the extent that we fail to adequately update and maintain the hardware and software implementing our integrated systems, our customers may be delayed or interrupted due to defects in our hardware or our source code. In addition, since our software is Internet-based, interruptions in Internet service generally can negatively impact our ability to use our systems to monitor and manage various aspects of our customers' needs. Such defects or interruptions could result in lost revenues and lost customers.\nUnauthorized use of our proprietary technology may increase our litigation costs and adversely affect our sales.\nWe rely on trademark, patent, trade secret and copyright laws to protect our designs and other proprietary property worldwide. We cannot be certain that these laws will be sufficient to protect our property. In particular, the laws of some countries in which our products are distributed or may be distributed in the future may not protect our products and intellectual rights to the same extent as the laws of the United States. If litigation is necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others, such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources. This could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. Ultimately, we may be unable, for financial or other reasons, to enforce our rights under intellectual property laws, which could result in lost sales.\nIf our products infringe any other person\u2019s proprietary rights, we may be sued and have to pay legal expenses and judgments and redesign or discontinue selling our products.\nFrom time to time in our industry, third parties allege infringement of their proprietary rights. Any infringement claims, whether or not meritorious, could result in costly litigation or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements as a means of settlement. If we are found to have infringed the proprietary rights of others, we could be required to pay damages, cease sales of the infringing products and redesign the products or discontinue their sale. Any of these outcomes, individually or collectively, could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition.\nThe outcome of any dispute or litigation in which we have been named as a defendant is unpredictable and an adverse decision in any such matter could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nFrom time to time we are party to various disputes or litigation matters. These claims may divert financial and management resources that would otherwise be used to benefit our operations. Although we believe that we have meritorious defenses and arguments to the claims made in each and all of the matters to which we have been named a party and we intend to contest each vigorously, no assurances can be given that the results of these matters will be favorable to us. We maintain product liability, errors and omissions, product recall and director and officer insurance that we regard as reasonably adequate to protect us from potential claims; however, we cannot assure adequacy to cover any loss, or that we will be able to maintain our current levels of insurance at a reasonable cost or at all.\nWe may not be able to realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions.\nWe may consider strategic acquisitions as opportunities arise. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including diversion of our management\u2019s attention away from our operating activities. We cannot assure you that we will not encounter unanticipated problems or liabilities relating to the integration of an acquired company\u2019s operations, nor can we assure you that we will realize the anticipated benefits of any future acquisitions.\nOur actual tax liabilities may differ from estimated tax resulting in unfavorable adjustments to our future results.\nThe amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. Our estimate of the potential outcome of uncertain tax issues is subject to our assessment of relevant risks, facts and circumstances existing at that time. Our future results may include favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our estimated tax liabilities in the period the assessments are made or resolved, which may impact our effective tax rate and our financial results.\nWe may face interruption of production and services due to increased security measures in response to terrorism.\nOur business depends on the free flow of products and services through the channels of commerce. In response to terrorists\u2019 activities and threats aimed at the United States, transportation, mail, financial and other services may be slowed or stopped altogether. Extensive delays or stoppages in transportation, mail, financial or other services could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Furthermore, we may experience an increase in operating costs, such as costs for transportation, insurance and security as a result of the activities and potential delays. We may also experience delays in receiving payments from payers that have been affected by the terrorist activities. The United States economy in general may be adversely affected by the terrorist activities and any economic downturn could adversely impact our results of operations, impair our ability to raise capital or otherwise adversely affect our ability to grow our business.\nWe have experienced and may continue to experience major fluctuations in the market price for our common stock.\nThe following factors could cause the market price of our common stock to decrease, perhaps substantially:\n\u25cf\nThe failure of our quarterly operating results to meet expectations of investors or securities analysts;\n\u25cf\nAdverse developments in the financial markets, the apparel industry and the worldwide or regional economies;\n\u25cf\nChanges in interest rates;\n\u25cf\nChanges in accounting principles;\n\u25cf\nDisputes relating to intellectual property and legal matters;\n\u25cf\nSales of common stock by existing stockholders or holders of options;\n\u25cf\nAnnouncements of key developments by our competitors; and\n\u25cf\nThe reaction of markets and securities analysts to announcements and developments involving our company.\nIf we need to sell or issue additional shares of common stock or assume additional debt to finance future growth, our stockholders\u2019 ownership could be diluted or our earnings could be adversely impacted.\nOur business strategy may include expansion through internal growth, by acquiring complementary businesses or by establishing strategic relationships with targeted customers and suppliers. In order to do so, or to fund our other activities, we may issue additional equity securities that could dilute our stockholders\u2019 value. We may also assume additional debt and incur impairment losses to our intangible assets if we acquire another company.\nWe have adopted anti-takeover measures that may depress the price of our common stock.\nOur ability to issue shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval and some provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and of Delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to make an unsolicited takeover attempt of our Company. These anti-takeover measures may depress the price of our common stock by making it more difficult for third parties to acquire us by offering to purchase shares of our stock at a premium to its market price.", "PERMNO": 85776, "SIC": 2300, "TIC": "TALN"}
