RISK FACTORS.\nThe following risk factors should be read carefully in connection with evaluating VF\u2019s business and the forward-looking statements contained in this Form 10-K. Any of the following risks could materially adversely affect VF\u2019s business, its operating results and its financial condition.\nVF\u2019s revenues and profits depend on the level of consumer spending for apparel and footwear, which is sensitive to global economic conditions and other factors. A decline in consumer spending could have a material adverse effect on VF.\nThe success of VF\u2019s business depends on consumer spending on apparel and footwear, and there are a number of factors that influence consumer spending, including actual and perceived economic conditions, disposable consumer income, interest rates, consumer credit availability, unemployment, stock market performance, weather conditions, energy prices, consumer discretionary spending patterns and tax rates in the international, national, regional and local markets where VF\u2019s products are sold. The current global economic environment is unpredictable, and adverse economic trends or other factors could negatively impact the level of consumer spending, which could have a material adverse impact on VF.\nThe apparel and footwear industries are highly competitive, and VF\u2019s success depends on its ability to gauge consumer preferences and product trends, and to respond to constantly changing markets.\nVF competes with numerous apparel and footwear brands and manufacturers. Competition is generally based upon brand name recognition, price, design, product quality, selection, service and purchasing convenience. Some of our competitors are larger and have more resources than VF in some product categories and regions. In addition, VF competes directly with the private label brands of its wholesale customers. VF\u2019s ability to compete within the apparel and footwear industries depends on our ability to:\n\u2022\nAnticipate and respond to changing consumer preferences and product trends in a timely manner;\n\u2022\nDevelop attractive, innovative and high quality products that meet consumer needs;\n\u2022\nMaintain strong brand recognition;\n\u2022\nPrice products appropriately;\n\u2022\nProvide best-in-class marketing support and intelligence;\n\u2022\nEnsure product availability and optimize supply chain efficiencies;\n\u2022\nObtain sufficient retail store space and effectively present our products at retail;\n\u2022\nProduce or procure quality products on a consistent basis; and,\n\u2022\nAdapt to a more digitally driven consumer landscape.\nFailure to compete effectively or to keep pace with rapidly changing consumer preferences, markets and product trends could have a material adverse effect on VF\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, there are significant shifts underway in the wholesale and retail (e-commerce and retail store) channels. VF may not be able to manage its brands within and across channels sufficiently, which could have a material adverse\neffect on VF\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nVF\u2019s results of operations could be materially harmed if we are unable to accurately forecast demand for our products.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully anticipate changing consumer preferences and product trends or economic conditions, and, as a result, we may not successfully manage inventory levels to meet our future order requirements. We often schedule internal production and place orders for products with independent manufacturers before our customers\u2019 orders are firm. If we fail to accurately forecast consumer demand, we may experience excess inventory levels or a shortage of product required to meet the demand. Inventory levels in excess of consumer demand may result in inventory write-downs, the sale of excess inventory at discounted prices or excess inventory held by our wholesale customers, which could have a negative impact on future sales, an adverse effect on the image and reputation of VF\u2019s brands and negatively impact profitability. On the other hand, if we underestimate demand for our products, our manufacturing facilities or third-party manufacturers may not be able to produce products to meet consumer requirements, and this could result in delays in the shipment of products and lost revenues, as well as damage to VF\u2019s reputation and relationships. These risks could have a material adverse effect on our brand image as well as our results of operations and financial condition.\nVF\u2019s business and the success of its products could be harmed if VF is unable to maintain the images of its brands.\nVF\u2019s success to date has been due in large part to the growth of its brands\u2019 images and VF\u2019s customers\u2019 connection to its brands. If we are unable to timely and appropriately respond to changing consumer demand, the names and images of our brands may be impaired. Even if we react appropriately to changes in consumer preferences, consumers may consider our brands\u2019 images to be outdated or associate our brands with styles that are no longer popular. In addition, brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions on a variety of qualities, including merchandise quality and corporate integrity. Negative claims or publicity regarding VF, its brands or its products, including licensed products, could adversely affect our reputation and sales regardless of whether such claims are accurate. Social media, which accelerates the dissemination of information, can increase the challenges of responding to negative claims. In the past, many apparel companies have experienced periods of rapid growth in sales and earnings followed by periods of declining sales and losses. Our businesses may be similarly affected in the future. In addition, we have sponsorship contracts with a number of athletes, musicians and celebrities and feature those individuals in our advertising and marketing efforts. Actions taken by those individuals associated with our products could harm their reputations, which could adversely affect the images of our brands.\nVF\u2019s revenues and cash requirements are affected by the seasonal nature of its business.\nVF\u2019s business is increasingly seasonal, with a higher proportion of revenues and operating cash flows generated during the second half of the calendar year, which includes the fall and holiday selling seasons. Poor sales in the second half of the calendar year would have a material adverse effect on VF\u2019s full year operating results and cause higher inventories. In addition, fluctuations in sales and\n10 VF Corporation Fiscal 2019 Form 10-K\noperating income in any fiscal quarter are affected by the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales.\nVF\u2019s profitability may decline as a result of increasing pressure on margins.\nThe apparel industry is subject to significant pricing pressure caused by many factors, including intense competition, consolidation in the retail industry, rising commodity and conversion costs, pressure from retailers to reduce the costs of products, changes in consumer demand and shifts to online shopping and purchasing. Consumers may increasingly seek markdown allowances, incentives and other forms of economic support. If these factors cause us to reduce our sales prices to retailers and consumers, and we fail to sufficiently reduce our product costs or operating expenses, VF\u2019s profitability will decline. This could have a material adverse effect on VF\u2019s results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nVF may not succeed in its business strategy.\nOne of VF\u2019s key strategic objectives is growth. We seek to grow organically and through acquisitions. We seek to grow by building our lifestyle brands, expanding our share with winning customers, stretching VF\u2019s brands to new regions, managing costs, leveraging our supply chain and information technology capabilities across VF and expanding our direct-to-consumer business, including opening new stores, remodeling and expanding our existing stores and growing our e-commerce business. However, we may not be able to grow our existing businesses. For example:\n\u2022\nWe may have difficulty completing acquisitions or dispositions to reshape our portfolio, and we may not be able to successfully integrate a newly acquired business or achieve the expected growth, cost savings or synergies from such integration.\n\u2022\nWe may not be able to transform our model to be more consumer- and retail-centric.\n\u2022\nWe may not be able to expand our market share with winning customers, or our wholesale customers may encounter financial difficulties and thus reduce their purchases of VF products.\n\u2022\nWe may not be able to expand our brands in Asia or other geographies or achieve the expected results from our supply chain initiatives.\n\u2022\nWe may have difficulty recruiting, developing or retaining qualified employees.\n\u2022\nWe may not be able to achieve our direct-to-consumer expansion goals, manage our growth effectively, successfully integrate the planned new stores into our operations or operate our new, remodeled and expanded stores profitably.\n\u2022\nWe may not be able to offset rising commodity or conversation costs in our product costs with pricing actions or efficiency improvements.\nFailure to implement our strategic objectives may have a material adverse effect on VF\u2019s business.\nVF relies significantly on information technology. Any inadequacy, interruption, integration failure or security failure of this technology could harm VF\u2019s ability to effectively operate its business.\nOur ability to effectively manage and operate our business depends significantly on information technology systems. We rely heavily on information technology to track sales and inventory and manage our supply chain. We are also dependent on information technology, including the Internet, for our direct-to-consumer sales, including our e-commerce operations and retail business credit card transaction authorization. Despite our preventative efforts, our systems and those of our third-party service providers may be vulnerable to damage, failure or interruption due to viruses, data security incidents, technical malfunctions, natural disasters or other causes, or in connection with upgrades to our system or the implementation of new systems. The failure of these systems to operate effectively, problems with transitioning to upgraded or replacement systems, difficulty in integrating new systems or systems of acquired businesses or a breach in security of these systems could adversely impact the operations of VF\u2019s business, including management of inventory, ordering and replenishment of products, manufacturing and distribution or products, e-commerce operations, retail business credit card transaction authorization and processing, corporate email communications and our interaction with the public on social media.\nVF is subject to data security and privacy risks that could negatively affect its business operations, results of operations or reputation.\nIn the normal course of business, we often collect, retain and transmit certain sensitive and confidential customer information, including credit card information, over public networks. There is a significant concern by consumers and employees over the security of personal information transmitted over the Internet, identity theft and user privacy. Data security attacks are increasingly sophisticated, and if unauthorized parties gain access to our networks or databases, or those of our third-party service providers, they may be able to steal, publish, delete or modify our private and sensitive information, including credit card information and personal information. Despite the security measures we currently have in place, our facilities and systems and those of our third-party service providers may be vulnerable and unable to anticipate or detect security breaches and data loss. In addition, employees may intentionally or inadvertently cause data security breaches that result in the unauthorized release of personal or confidential information. VF and its customers could suffer harm if valuable business data, or employee, customer and other proprietary information were corrupted, lost or accessed or misappropriated by third parties due to a security failure in VF\u2019s systems or one of our third-party service providers. It could require significant expenditures to remediate any such failure or breach, severely damage our reputation and our relationships with customers, results in unwanted media attention and lost sales, and expose us to risks of litigation and liability. In addition, as a result of recent security breaches at a number of prominent retailers, the media and public scrutiny of information security and privacy has become more intense and the regulatory environment has become increasingly uncertain, rigorous and complex. As a result, we may incur significant costs to comply with laws regarding the protection and unauthorized disclosure of personal information and we may not be able to comply with new regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation in the European Union and the California Consumer Privacy Act. Any failure to comply with the laws and regulations surrounding the protection of personal information could subject us to legal and reputational\nVF Corporation Fiscal 2019 Form 10-K 11\nrisk, including significant fines for non-compliance, any of which could have a negative impact on revenues and profits.\nVF\u2019s business is exposed to the risks of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. VF\u2019s hedging strategies may not be effective in mitigating those risks.\nA growing percentage of VF\u2019s total revenues (approximately 41% in Fiscal 2019) is derived from markets outside the U.S. VF\u2019s international businesses operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Changes in currency exchange rates affect the U.S. dollar value of the foreign currency-denominated amounts at which VF\u2019s international businesses purchase products, incur costs or sell products. In addition, for VF\u2019s U.S.-based businesses, the majority of products are sourced from independent contractors or VF plants located in foreign countries. As a result, the costs of these products are affected by changes in the value of the relevant currencies. Furthermore, much of VF\u2019s licensing revenue is derived from sales in foreign currencies. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates could have an adverse impact on VF\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn accordance with our operating practices, we hedge a significant portion of our foreign currency transaction exposures arising in the ordinary course of business to reduce risks in our cash flows and earnings. Our hedging strategy may not be effective in reducing all risks, and no hedging strategy can completely insulate VF from foreign exchange risk.\nFurther, our use of derivative financial instruments may expose VF to counterparty risks. Although VF only enters into hedging contracts with counterparties having investment grade credit ratings, it is possible that the credit quality of a counterparty could be downgraded or a counterparty could default on its obligations, which could have a material adverse impact on VF\u2019s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThere are risks associated with VF\u2019s acquisitions.\nAny acquisitions or mergers by VF will be accompanied by the risks commonly encountered in acquisitions of companies. These risks include, among other things, higher than anticipated acquisition costs and expenses, the difficulty and expense of integrating the operations, systems and personnel of the companies and the loss of key employees and customers as a result of changes in management. In addition, geographic distances may make integration of acquired businesses more difficult. We may not be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with any acquisitions.\nOur acquisitions may cause large one-time expenses or create goodwill or other intangible assets that could result in significant impairment charges in the future. We also make certain estimates and assumptions in order to determine purchase price allocation and estimate the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed. If our estimates or assumptions used to value these assets and liabilities are not accurate, we may be exposed to losses that may be material.\nVF\u2019s operations and earnings may be affected by legal, regulatory, political and economic risks.\nOur ability to maintain the current level of operations in our existing markets and to capitalize on growth in existing and new markets is subject to legal, regulatory, political and economic risks. These include the burdens of complying with U.S. and international laws\nand regulations, unexpected changes in regulatory requirements, tariffs or other trade barriers and the economic uncertainty associated with the pending exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union (\"Brexit\") or any other similar referendums that may be held.\nA significant portion of VF's Fiscal 2019 net income was earned in jurisdictions outside the U.S. and most of our goods are manufactured outside the U.S. VF is exposed to risks of changes in U.S. policy for companies having business operations and manufacturing products outside the U.S. We cannot predict any changes to U.S. participation in or renegotiations of certain trade agreements or whether quotas, duties, taxes, exchange controls or other restrictions will be imposed by the U.S., China, the European Union or other countries on the import or export of our products, or what effect any of these actions would have on VF\u2019s business, financial condition or results of operations. Changes in regulatory, geopolitical policies and other factors may adversely affect VF\u2019s business or may require us to modify our current business practices. While enactment of any such change is not certain, if such changes were adopted, our costs could increase, which would reduce our earnings.\nChanges in tax laws could increase our worldwide tax rate and materially affect our financial position and results of operations.\nWe are subject to taxation in the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. On December 22, 2017, the U.S. government enacted comprehensive tax legislation commonly referred to as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \u201cTax Act\u201d), which included a broad range of tax reform proposals affecting businesses, including a reduction in the U.S. federal corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%, a one-time mandatory deemed repatriation tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously tax-deferred, and a new minimum tax on certain foreign earnings. The Tax Act significantly impacted our effective tax rate for the year ended December 2017 as a result of the deemed repatriation tax, and may continue to impact several other elements of our operating model. Certain additional provisions of the Tax Act, such as a minimum tax on foreign earnings, could also apply to VF depending on certain facts and circumstances and, as a result, could increase our effective tax rate. Taxes due over a period of time as a result of the new tax law could be accelerated upon certain triggering events, including failure to pay such taxes when due. The new law made broad and complex changes to the U.S. tax code and regulatory, administrative and legislative guidance continues to be released. To the extent any future guidance differs from our preliminary interpretation of the law, it could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nIn addition, many countries in the European Union and around the globe have adopted and/or proposed changes to current tax laws. Further, organizations such as the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development have published action plans that, if adopted by countries where we do business, could increase our tax obligations in these countries. Due to the large scale of our U.S. and international business activities, many of these enacted and proposed changes to the taxation of our activities could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results of operations.\nWe may have additional tax liabilities.\nAs a global company, we determine our income tax liability in various tax jurisdictions based on an analysis and interpretation of local tax laws and regulations. This analysis requires a significant\n12 VF Corporation Fiscal 2019 Form 10-K\namount of judgment and estimation and is often based on various assumptions about the future actions of the local tax authorities. These determinations are the subject of periodic U.S. and international tax audits. Although we accrue for uncertain tax positions, our accrual may be insufficient to satisfy unfavorable findings. Unfavorable audit findings and tax rulings may result in payment of taxes, fines and penalties for prior periods and higher tax rates in future periods, which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe Company petitioned the U.S. Tax Court to resolve an Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") dispute regarding the timing of income inclusion associated with the 2011 Timberland acquisition. The Company remains confident in our timing and treatment of the income inclusion, and therefore this matter is not reflected in our financial statements. We are vigorously defending our position, and do not expect the resolution to have a material adverse impact on the Company's financial position, results of operations or cash flows. While the IRS argues immediate income inclusion, the Company's position is to include the income over a period of years. As the matter relates to 2011, nearly half of the timing at dispute has passed with the Company including the income, and paying the related tax, on our income tax returns. The Company notes that should the IRS prevail in this timing matter, the net interest expense would be up to $130 million. Further, this timing matter is impacted by the Tax Act that reduced the U.S. corporate income tax rate from 35% to 21%. If the IRS is successful, this rate differential would increase tax expense by approximately $136 million.\nVF\u2019s balance sheet includes a significant amount of intangible assets and goodwill. A decline in the fair value of an intangible asset or of a business unit could result in an asset impairment charge, which would be recorded as an operating expense in VF\u2019s Consolidated Statement of Income and could be material.\nVF\u2019s policy is to evaluate indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill for possible impairment as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of each year, or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of such assets may be below their carrying amount. In addition, intangible assets that are being amortized are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable. For these impairment tests, we use various valuation methods to estimate the fair value of our business units and intangible assets. If the fair value of an asset is less than its carrying value, we would recognize an impairment charge for the difference.\nIt is possible that we could have an impairment charge for goodwill or trademark and trade name intangible assets in future periods if (i) overall economic conditions in Fiscal 2020 or future years vary from our current assumptions, (ii) business conditions or our strategies for a specific business unit change from our current assumptions, (iii) investors require higher rates of return on equity investments in the marketplace, or (iv) enterprise values of comparable publicly traded companies, or of actual sales transactions of comparable companies, were to decline, resulting in lower comparable multiples of revenues and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and, accordingly, lower implied values of goodwill and intangible assets. A future impairment charge for goodwill or intangible assets could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.\nVF uses third-party suppliers and manufacturing facilities worldwide for a substantial portion of its raw materials and finished products, which poses risks to VF\u2019s business operations.\nDuring Fiscal 2019, approximately 79% of VF\u2019s units were purchased from independent manufacturers primarily located in Asia, with substantially all of the remainder produced by VF-owned and operated manufacturing facilities located in the U.S., Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean. Any of the following could impact our ability to produce or deliver VF products, or our cost of producing or delivering products and, as a result, our profitability:\n\u2022\nPolitical or labor instability in countries where VF\u2019s facilities, contractors and suppliers are located;\n\u2022\nChanges in local economic conditions in countries where VF\u2019s facilities, contractors, and suppliers are located;\n\u2022\nPolitical or military conflict could cause a delay in the transportation of raw materials and products to VF and an increase in transportation costs;\n\u2022\nDisruption at ports of entry, such as the west coast dock workers labor dispute that disrupted international trade at seaports, could cause delays in product availability and increase transportation times and costs;\n\u2022\nHeightened terrorism security concerns could subject imported or exported goods to additional, more frequent or more lengthy inspections, leading to delays in deliveries or impoundment of goods for extended periods;\n\u2022\nDecreased scrutiny by customs officials for counterfeit goods, leading to more counterfeit goods and reduced sales of VF products, increased costs for VF\u2019s anti-counterfeiting measures and damage to the reputation of its brands;\n\u2022\nDisruptions at manufacturing or distribution facilities caused by natural and man-made disasters;\n\u2022\nDisease epidemics and health-related concerns could result in closed factories, reduced workforces, scarcity of raw materials and scrutiny or embargo of VF\u2019s goods produced in infected areas;\n\u2022\nImposition of regulations and quotas relating to imports and our ability to adjust timely to changes in trade regulations could limit our ability to produce products in cost-effective countries that have the required labor and expertise;\n\u2022\nImposition of duties, taxes and other charges on imports; and,\n\u2022\nImposition or the repeal of laws that affect intellectual property rights.\nAlthough no single supplier and no one country is critical to VF\u2019s production needs, if we were to lose a supplier it could result in interruption of finished goods shipments to VF, cancellation of orders by customers and termination of relationships. This, along with the damage to our reputation, could have a material adverse effect on VF\u2019s revenues and, consequently, our results of operations.\nIn addition, although we audit our third-party material suppliers and contracted manufacturing facilities and set strict compliance standards, actions by a third-party supplier or manufacturer that fail to comply could expose VF to claims for damages, financial penalties and reputational harm, any of which could have a material adverse effect in our business and operations.\nVF Corporation Fiscal 2019 Form 10-K 13\nOur business is subject to national, state and local laws and regulations for environmental, consumer protection, employment, privacy, safety and other matters. The costs of compliance with, or the violation of, such laws and regulations by VF or by independent suppliers who manufacture products for VF could have an adverse effect on our operations and cash flows, as well as on our reputation.\nOur business is subject to comprehensive national, state and local laws and regulations on a wide range of environmental, consumer protection, employment, privacy, safety and other matters. VF could be adversely affected by costs of compliance with or violations of those laws and regulations. In addition, while we do not control their business practices, we require third-party suppliers to operate in compliance with applicable laws, rules and regulations regarding working conditions, employment practices and environmental compliance. The costs of products purchased by VF from independent contractors could increase due to the costs of compliance by those contractors.\nFailure by VF or its third-party suppliers to comply with such laws and regulations, as well as with ethical, social, product, labor and environmental standards, or related political considerations, could result in interruption of finished goods shipments to VF, cancellation of orders by customers and termination of relationships. If one of our independent contractors violates labor or other laws, implements labor or other business practices or takes other actions that are generally regarded as unethical, it could jeopardize our reputation and potentially lead to various adverse consumer actions, including boycotts that may reduce demand for VF\u2019s merchandise. Damage to VF\u2019s reputation or loss of consumer confidence for any of these or other reasons could have a material adverse effect on VF\u2019s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, as well as require additional resources to rebuild VF\u2019s reputation.\nFluctuations in wage rates and the price, availability and quality of raw materials and finished goods could increase costs.\nFluctuations in the price, availability and quality of fabrics, leather or other raw materials used by VF in its manufactured products, or of purchased finished goods, could have a material adverse effect on VF\u2019s cost of goods sold or its ability to meet its customers\u2019 demands. The prices we pay depend on demand and market prices for the raw materials used to produce them. The price and availability of such raw materials may fluctuate significantly, depending on many factors, including general economic conditions and demand, crop yields, energy prices, weather patterns and speculation in the commodities markets. Prices of purchased finished products also depend on wage rates in Asia and other geographic areas where our independent contractors are located, as well as freight costs from those regions. Inflation can also have a long-term impact on us because increasing costs of materials and labor may impact our ability to maintain satisfactory margins. For example, the cost of the materials, that are used in our manufacturing process, such as oil-related commodity prices and other raw materials, such as cotton, dyes and chemical and other costs, such as fuel, energy and utility costs, can fluctuate as a result of inflation and other factors. Similarly, a significant portion of our products are manufactured in other countries and declines in the values of the U.S. dollar may result in higher manufacturing costs.In addition, fluctuations in wage rates required by legal or industry standards could increase our costs. In the future, VF may not be able to offset cost increases with other cost reductions or efficiencies or to pass higher costs on to its customers. This could have a material adverse effect on VF\u2019s results of operations, liquidity and financial condition.\nWe may be adversely affected by weather conditions.\nOur business is adversely affected by unseasonable weather conditions. A significant portion of the sales of our products is dependent in part on the weather and is likely to decline in years in which weather conditions do not favor the use of these products. For example, periods of unseasonably warm weather in the fall or winter can lead to inventory accumulation by our wholesale customers, which can, in turn, negatively affect orders in future seasons. In addition, abnormally harsh or inclement weather can also negatively impact retail traffic and consumer spending. Any and all of these risks may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nA substantial portion of VF\u2019s revenues and gross profit is derived from a small number of large customers. The loss of any of these customers or the inability of any of these customers to pay VF could substantially reduce VF\u2019s revenues and profits.\nA few of VF\u2019s customers account for a significant portion of revenues. Sales to VF\u2019s ten largest customers were 19% of total revenues in Fiscal 2019, with our largest customer accounting for 8% of revenues. Sales to our customers are generally on a purchase order basis and not subject to long-term agreements. A decision by any of VF\u2019s major customers to significantly decrease the volume of products purchased from VF could substantially reduce revenues and have a material adverse effect on VF\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\nThe retail industry has experienced financial difficulty that could adversely affect VF's business.\nRecently there have been consolidations, reorganizations, restructurings, bankruptcies and ownership changes in the retail industry. These events individually, and together, could materially, adversely affect VF's business. These changes could impact VF\u2019s opportunities in the market and increase VF\u2019s reliance on a smaller number of large customers. In the future, retailers are likely to further consolidate, undergo restructurings or reorganizations or bankruptcies, realign their affiliations or reposition their stores\u2019 target markets. In addition, consumers have continued to transition away from traditional wholesale retailers to large online retailers. These developments could result in a reduction in the number of stores that carry VF\u2019s products, an increase in ownership concentration within the retail industry, an increase in credit exposure to VF or an increase in leverage by VF\u2019s customers over their suppliers.\nFurther, the global economy periodically experiences recessionary conditions with rising unemployment, reduced availability of credit, increased savings rates and declines in real estate and securities values. These recessionary conditions could have a negative impact on retail sales of apparel and other consumer products. The lower sales volumes, along with the possibility of restrictions on access to the credit markets, could result in our customers experiencing financial difficulties including store closures, bankruptcies or liquidations. This could result in higher credit risk to VF relating to receivables from our customers who are experiencing these financial difficulties. If these developments occur, our inability to shift sales to other customers or to collect on VF\u2019s trade accounts receivable could have a material adverse effect on VF\u2019s financial condition and results of operations.\n14 VF Corporation Fiscal 2019 Form 10-K\nOur ability to obtain short-term or long-term financing on favorable terms, if needed, could be adversely affected by geopolitical risk and volatility in the capital markets.\nAny disruption in the capital markets could limit the availability of funds or the ability or willingness of financial institutions to extend capital in the future. This could adversely affect our liquidity and funding resources or significantly increase our cost of capital. An inability to access capital and credit markets may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nVF has a global revolving credit facility. One or more of the participating banks may not be able to honor their commitments, which could have an adverse effect on VF\u2019s business.\nVF has a $2.25 billion global revolving credit facility that expires in December 2023. If the financial markets return to recessionary conditions, this could impair the ability of one or more of the banks participating in our credit agreements to honor their commitments. This could have an adverse effect on our business if we were not able to replace those commitments or to locate other sources of liquidity on acceptable terms.\nThe loss of members of VF\u2019s executive management and other key employees could have a material adverse effect on its business.\nVF depends on the services and management experience of its executive officers and business leaders who have substantial experience and expertise in VF\u2019s business. The unexpected loss of services of one or more of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on VF. Our future success also depends on our ability to recruit, retain and engage our personnel sufficiently. Competition for experienced and well-qualified personnel is intense and we may not be successful in attracting and retaining such personnel.\nVF\u2019s direct-to-consumer business includes risks that could have an adverse effect on its results of operations.\nVF sells merchandise direct-to-consumer through VF-operated stores and e-commerce sites. Its direct-to-consumer business is subject to numerous risks that could have a material adverse effect on its results. Risks include, but are not limited to, (i) U.S. or international resellers purchasing merchandise and reselling it overseas outside VF\u2019s control, (ii) failure of the systems that operate the stores and websites, and their related support systems, including computer viruses, theft of customer information, privacy concerns, telecommunication failures and electronic break-ins and similar disruptions, (iii) credit card fraud, and (iv) risks related to VF\u2019s direct-to-consumer distribution centers and processes. Risks specific to VF\u2019s e-commerce business also include (i) diversion of sales from VF stores or wholesale customers, (ii) difficulty in recreating the in-store experience through direct channels, (iii) liability for online content, (iv) changing patterns of consumer behavior, and (v) intense competition from online retailers. VF\u2019s failure to successfully respond to these risks might adversely affect sales in its e-commerce business, as well as damage its reputation and brands.\nOur VF-operated stores and e-commerce business require substantial fixed investments in equipment and leasehold improvements, information systems, inventory and personnel. We have entered into substantial operating lease commitments for retail space. Due to the high fixed-cost structure associated with our direct-to-consumer operations, a decline in sales or the closure of or poor performance of individual or multiple stores\ncould result in significant lease termination costs, write-offs of equipment and leasehold improvements and employee-related costs.\nVF\u2019s net sales depend on the volume of traffic to its stores and the availability of suitable lease space.\nA growing portion of our revenues are direct-to-consumer sales through VF-operated stores. In order to generate customer traffic, we locate many of our stores in prominent locations within successful retail shopping centers or in fashionable shopping districts. Our stores benefit from the ability of the retail center and other attractions in an area to generate consumer traffic in the vicinity of our stores. Part of our future growth is significantly dependent on our ability to operate stores in desirable locations with capital investment and lease costs providing the opportunity to earn a reasonable return. We cannot control the development of new shopping centers or districts; the availability or cost of appropriate locations within existing or new shopping centers or districts; competition with other retailers for prominent locations; or the success of individual shopping centers or districts. Further, if we are unable to renew or replace our existing store leases or enter into leases for new stores on favorable terms, or if we violate the terms of our current leases, our growth and profitability could be harmed. All of these factors may impact our ability to meet our growth targets and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nVF may be unable to protect its trademarks and other intellectual property rights.\nVF\u2019s trademarks and other intellectual property rights are important to its success and its competitive position. VF is susceptible to others copying its products and infringing its intellectual property rights, especially with the shift in product mix to higher priced brands and innovative new products in recent years. Some of VF\u2019s brands, such as The North Face\u00ae, Timberland\u00ae, Vans\u00ae, JanSport\u00ae, Dickies\u00ae, Wrangler\u00ae and Lee\u00ae, enjoy significant worldwide consumer recognition, and the higher pricing of those products creates additional risk of counterfeiting and infringement.\nVF\u2019s trademarks, trade names, patents, trade secrets and other intellectual property are important to VF\u2019s success. Counterfeiting of VF\u2019s products or infringement on its intellectual property rights could diminish the value of our brands and adversely affect VF\u2019s revenues. Actions we have taken to establish and protect VF\u2019s intellectual property rights may not be adequate to prevent copying of its products by others or to prevent others from seeking to invalidate its trademarks or block sales of VF\u2019s products as a violation of the trademarks and intellectual property rights of others. In addition, unilateral actions in the U.S. or other countries, including changes to or the repeal of laws recognizing trademark or other intellectual property rights, could have an impact on VF\u2019s ability to enforce those rights.\nThe value of VF\u2019s intellectual property could diminish if others assert rights in or ownership of trademarks and other intellectual property rights of VF, or trademarks that are similar to VF\u2019s trademarks, or trademarks that VF licenses from others. We may be unable to successfully resolve these types of conflicts to our satisfaction. In some cases, there may be trademark owners who have prior rights to VF\u2019s trademarks because the laws of certain foreign countries may not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the U.S. In other cases, there may be holders who have prior rights to similar trademarks.\nVF Corporation Fiscal 2019 Form 10-K 15\nThere have been, and there may in the future be, opposition and cancellation proceedings from time to time with respect to some of VF's intellectual property rights. In some cases, litigation may be necessary to protect or enforce our trademarks and other intellectual property rights. Furthermore, third parties may assert intellectual property claims against us, and we may be subject to liability, required to enter into costly license agreements, if available at all, required to rebrand our products and/or prevented from selling some of our products if third parties successfully oppose or challenge our trademarks or successfully claim that we infringe, misappropriate or otherwise violate their trademarks, copyrights, patents or other intellectual property rights. Bringing or defending any such claim, regardless or merit, and whether successful or unsuccessful, could be expensive and time-consuming and have a negative effect on VF's business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nVF is subject to the risk that its licensees may not generate expected sales or maintain the value of VF\u2019s brands.\nDuring Fiscal 2019, $95.9 million of VF\u2019s revenues were derived from licensing royalties. Although VF generally has significant control over its licensees\u2019 products and advertising, we rely on our licensees for, among other things, operational and financial controls over their businesses. Failure of our licensees to successfully market licensed products or our inability to replace existing licensees, if necessary, could adversely affect VF\u2019s revenues, both directly from reduced royalties received and indirectly from reduced sales of our other products. Risks are also associated with a licensee\u2019s ability to:\n\u2022\nObtain capital;\n\u2022\nManage its labor relations;\n\u2022\nMaintain relationships with its suppliers;\n\u2022\nManage its credit risk effectively;\n\u2022\nMaintain relationships with its customers; and,\n\u2022\nAdhere to VF\u2019s Global Compliance Principles.\nIn addition, VF relies on its licensees to help preserve the value of its brands. Although we attempt to protect VF\u2019s brands through approval rights over design, production processes, quality, packaging, merchandising, distribution, advertising and promotion of our licensed products, we cannot completely control the use of licensed VF brands by our licensees. The misuse of a brand by a licensee, including through the marketing or products under one of our brand names that do not meet our quality standards, could have a material adverse effect on that brand and on VF.\nIf VF encounters problems with its distribution system, VF\u2019s ability to deliver its products to the market could be adversely affected.\nVF relies on owned or independently-operated distribution facilities to warehouse and ship product to its customers. VF\u2019s distribution system includes computer-controlled and automated equipment, which may be subject to a number of risks related to security or computer viruses, the proper operation of software and hardware, power interruptions or other system failures. Because substantially all of VF\u2019s products are distributed from a relatively small number of locations, VF\u2019s operations could also be interrupted by earthquakes, floods, fires or other natural disasters affecting its distribution centers. We maintain business interruption insurance, but it may not adequately protect VF from the adverse effects that could be caused by significant disruptions in VF\u2019s distribution facilities, such as the long-term loss of\ncustomers or an erosion of brand image. In addition, VF\u2019s distribution capacity is dependent on the timely performance of services by third parties, including the transportation of product to and from its distribution facilities. If we encounter problems with our distribution system, our ability to meet customer expectations, manage inventory, complete sales and achieve operating efficiencies could be materially adversely affected.\nVolatility in securities markets, interest rates and other economic factors could substantially increase VF\u2019s defined benefit pension costs.\nVF currently has obligations under its defined benefit pension plans. The funded status of the pension plans is dependent on many factors, including returns on investment assets and the discount rate used to determine pension obligations. Unfavorable impacts from returns on plan assets, decreases in discount rates, changes in plan demographics or revisions in the applicable laws or regulations could materially change the timing and amount of pension funding requirements, which could reduce cash available for VF\u2019s business.\nVF\u2019s operating performance also may be negatively impacted by the amount of expense recorded for its pension plans. Pension expense is calculated using actuarial valuations that incorporate assumptions and estimates about financial market, economic and demographic conditions. Differences between estimated and actual results give rise to gains and losses that are deferred and amortized as part of future pension expense, which can create volatility that adversely impacts VF\u2019s future operating results.\nThe relocation of our global headquarters; The North Face\u00ae, JanSport\u00ae, Smartwool\u00ae, Altra\u00ae and Eagle Creek\u00ae brands; and VF\u2019s Global Innovation Center for technical fabrics and Digital Lab could adversely affect our operations, operating results and financial condition, as we may experience disruptions to our business and incur additional costs in connection with the relocation.\nWe announced on August 13, 2018 the relocation of our global headquarters to the metro Denver area, which will also serve as the home for The North Face\u00ae, JanSport\u00ae, Smartwool\u00ae, Altra\u00ae and Eagle Creek\u00ae brands (the \u201cRelocating Brands\u201d) and VF\u2019s Global Innovation Center for technical fabrics and Digital Lab (the \u201cInnovation Center and Lab\u201d). The process of moving our headquarters, the Relocating Brands and the Innovation Center and Lab is inherently complex and not part of our day-to-day operations. The relocation process could cause significant disruption to our operations, cause the temporary diversion of management resources and result in the loss of key employees who have substantial experience and expertise in our business, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, operating results and financial condition. The need to replace Company personnel who do not relocate, train new employees and transition Company operating knowledge may cause disruptions in our business. While we have implemented a transition plan to provide for the move of our global headquarters, the Relocating Brands and the Innovation Center and Lab, including relocation benefits for employees who may be transferring, and severance and retention benefits for employees who will not be continuing with the Company after the move, we may encounter difficulties retaining employees who elect to transfer and attracting new talent in the Denver area to replace our employees who are unwilling to relocate. We may also experience difficulties in retaining employees who will remain in Greensboro during the transition period and who we are relying on to facilitate the transition of operating knowledge. In addition, we may incur additional costs for\n16 VF Corporation Fiscal 2019 Form 10-K\nduplication in staff as we effect the transition. We can give no assurance that the relocation will be completed as planned or within the expected timeframe. In addition, the relocation may involve significant additional costs to us and the expected benefits of the move may not be fully realized due to associated disruption to our operations and personnel.\nWe may be unable to achieve some or all of the benefits we expect to achieve from the spin-off.\nOn May 22, 2019, we completed the spin-off of our Jeans business, Kontoor Brands, Inc. (\"Kontoor Brands\"). Although we believe that the spin-off will enhance our long-term value, we may not be able to achieve some or all of the anticipated benefits from the separation of our businesses, and the spin-off may adversely affect our business. Separating the businesses resulted in two independent, publicly traded companies, each of which is now a smaller, less diversified and more narrowly focused business than before the spin-off, which makes us more vulnerable to changing market and economic conditions. Additionally, a potential loss of synergies from separating the businesses could negatively impact the balance sheet, profit margins or earnings of both businesses and the combined value of the common stock of the two publicly traded companies may not be equal to or greater than the value of VF common stock had the spin-off not occurred. If we fail to achieve some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve as a result of the spin-off, or do not achieve them in the time we expect, our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nThe Kontoor Brands spin-off could result in substantial tax liability to us and our stockholders.\nWe received opinions of tax advisors substantially to the effect that, for U.S. Federal income tax purposes, the spin-off and certain related transactions qualify for tax-free treatment under certain sections of the Internal Revenue Code. However, if the factual assumptions or representations made by us in connection with the delivery of the opinions are inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect, including those relating to the past and future conduct of our business, we will not be able to rely on the opinions. Furthermore, the opinions are not binding on the IRS or the courts. If, notwithstanding receipt of the opinions, the spin-off transaction and certain related transactions are determined to be taxable, we would be subject to a substantial tax liability. In addition, if the spin-\noff transaction is taxable, each holder of our common stock who received shares of Kontoor Brands in connection with the spin-off would generally be treated as receiving a taxable distribution of property in an amount equal to the fair market value of the shares received.\nEven if the spin-off otherwise qualifies as a tax-free transaction, the distribution would be taxable to us (but not to our stockholders) in certain circumstances if future significant acquisitions of our stock or the stock of Kontoor Brands are deemed to be part of a plan or series of related transactions that included the spin-off. In this event, the resulting tax liability could be substantial. In connection with the spin-off, we entered into a tax matters agreement with Kontoor Brands, pursuant to which Kontoor Brands agreed to not enter into any transaction that could cause any portion of the spin-off to be taxable to us without our consent and to indemnify us for any tax liability resulting from any such transaction. In addition, these potential tax liabilities may discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of us.\nCertain directors who serve on our Board of Directors also serve as directors of Kontoor Brands, and ownership of shares of common stock of Kontoor Brands following the spin-off by our directors and executive officers, may create, or appear to create, conflicts of interest.\nCertain of our directors who serve on our Board of Directors currently serve on the Board of Directors of Kontoor Brands. This may create, or appear to create, conflicts of interest when our or Kontoor Brands' management and directors face decisions that could have different implications for us and Kontoor Brands, including the resolution of any dispute regarding the terms of the agreements governing the spin-off and the relationship between us and Kontoor Brands after the spin-off or any other commercial agreements entered into in the future between us and Kontoor Brands.\nMost of our executive officers and non-employee directors currently own shares of the common stock of Kontoor Brands. The continued ownership of such common stock by our directors and executive officers following the spin-off creates or may create the appearance of a conflict of interest when these directors and executive officers are faced with decisions that could have different implications for us and Kontoor Brands.", "PERMNO": 43553, "SIC": 2320, "TIC": "VFC"}
