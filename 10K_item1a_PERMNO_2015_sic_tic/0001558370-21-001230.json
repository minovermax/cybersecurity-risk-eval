RISK FACTORS.\nINDUS\u2019s real estate business is subject to a number of risks. The risk factors discussed below are those that management deems to be material, but they may not be the only risks facing INDUS. Additional risks not currently known or currently deemed not to be material may also impact INDUS. If any of the following risks occur, INDUS\u2019s business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows and ability to pay dividends could be adversely affected. Investors should also refer to INDUS\u2019s quarterly reports on Form 10-Q for any material updates to these risk factors.\nRisks Related to INDUS\u2019s Business and Properties\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused and could continue to cause disruptions to INDUS\u2019s business, and its financial condition, results of operations or stock price may be adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn December 2019, a novel strain of coronavirus (\u201cCOVID-19\u201d) surfaced in Wuhan, China. During and subsequent to fiscal 2020, the world (including all states in which INDUS\u2019s buildings are located) has been impacted by COVID-19, including government restrictions to minimize the spread of this virus and ongoing effects of the pandemic. Such restrictions, including the institution of quarantines, travel restrictions, mandatory closure or reduced capacity of\nbusinesses and other measures have caused global business disruptions and significant volatility in U.S. and international debt and equity markets.\nINDUS has directly experienced, and may continue to experience, disruptions and other impacts to its business as a result of the ongoing pandemic and actions taken to mitigate its effects, including, without limitation:\n\u25cf disruptions in availability and supply, and increased costs, of materials and products, including raw materials for INDUS\u2019s current or planned development projects (especially the increased cost and lessened availability of structural steel);\n\u25cf delays in receipt of approvals and entitlements, due to government agencies, labor and other businesses working in reduced or restricted capacities;\n\u25cf inability of contractors or third party managers to perform effectively or on a timely basis, including as a result of restrictions on construction and other business activities;\n\u25cf the transition of INDUS\u2019s and its tenants\u2019 employees toward an increased trend of working from home;\n\u25cf effects of government travel restrictions or the general discouragement of non-essential travel to contain the spread of COVID-19;\n\u25cf tenant requests for rent deferrals or abatement as a result of the impact of the pandemic;\n\u25cf difficulty accessing debt and equity capital on attractive terms, or at all, and other effects of disruption and instability in the global financial markets; and\n\u25cf a general decline in business activity, demand for real estate and other market conditions.\nThese and other factors may continue to impact INDUS, including, without limitation, by delaying or preventing INDUS from completing current or planned development projects, or monetizing our current or future real estate assets; reducing INDUS\u2019s ability to lease vacant space, particularly in its office/flex portfolio; restricting INDUS\u2019s ability to travel to, locate and execute on acquisitions or enter new markets; and reducing its access to debt and equity capital.\nThere is significant uncertainty around the breadth and duration of business disruptions related to COVID-19, as well as its impact on the U.S. economy. The extent to which the coronavirus pandemic further impacts INDUS\u2019s business or ultimately impacts its results of operations, financial condition and stock price and its ability to develop, acquire, dispose or lease properties for its portfolio, will depend on numerous evolving factors that are highly uncertain and which INDUS may not be able to predict, including: the duration and scope of the pandemic; governmental, business and individuals\u2019 actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic; the availability and effectiveness of vaccines to combat COVID-19; the impact on economic activity from the pandemic and actions taken in response, including ongoing travel restrictions; the impact on the availability and pricing of certain materials and supplies; the impact on INDUS\u2019s employees; any other operational disruptions or difficulties INDUS may face; the effect on INDUS\u2019s tenants and their businesses; the ability of tenants to pay their rent; any closures of our tenants\u2019 facilities, including, without limitation, due to shutdowns that may be requested or mandated by governmental authorities; the ability of prospective tenants to inspect vacant space in our buildings; and INDUS\u2019s ability to complete sales of real estate assets, acquisitions or planned construction and development. Any of these events could materially adversely impact INDUS\u2019s business, financial condition, results of operations or stock price.\nINDUS\u2019s real estate portfolio is concentrated in the industrial real estate sector, and its business would be adversely affected by an economic downturn in that sector.\nAs of November 30, 2020, 91.5% of INDUS\u2019s square footage was classified as industrial/logistics space . This level of concentration exposes INDUS to the risk of economic downturns in the industrial real estate sector to a greater extent than if its properties were more diversified across other sectors of the real estate industry. In particular, an economic downturn affecting the leasing market for industrial properties could have a material adverse effect on\nINDUS\u2019s results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, ability to satisfy debt obligations and ability to pay dividends to stockholders.\nINDUS\u2019s real estate portfolio is geographically concentrated, which causes it to be especially susceptible to adverse developments in those markets.\nIn addition to general, regional, national and international economic conditions, INDUS\u2019s operating performance is impacted by the economic conditions of the specific geographic markets in which it has concentrations of properties. The portfolio includes holdings in Connecticut, the Lehigh Valley of Pennsylvania, the greater Charlotte, North Carolina area and Orlando, Florida, which represented 53%, 29%, 12% and 6% of INDUS\u2019s total portfolio by square footage, respectively, as of November 30, 2020. This geographic concentration could adversely affect INDUS\u2019s operating performance if conditions become less favorable in any of the states or regions in which it has a concentration of properties. It is possible that some or all of its markets will not grow or that underlying real estate fundamentals will not be favorable to owners and operators of properties. INDUS\u2019s operations may also be adversely affected if competing properties are built in its target markets. The construction of new facilities by competitors would increase capacity in the marketplace, and an increase in the amount of vacancies in competitors\u2019 properties and negative absorption of space could result in INDUS experiencing longer times to lease vacant space, eroding lease rates or hindering renewals by existing tenants. Any adverse economic or real estate developments in INDUS\u2019s target markets, or any decrease in demand for industrial space resulting from the regulatory environment, business climate or energy or fiscal problems in these markets, could materially and adversely impact INDUS\u2019s results of operations, cash flows, financial condition, ability to satisfy debt obligations and ability to pay dividends to stockholders.\nINDUS\u2019s ability to grow its portfolio partially depends on its ability to develop properties, which may suffer under certain circumstances.\nINDUS intends to continue to develop properties when warranted by its assessment of market conditions. INDUS\u2019s general construction and development activities include the risks that:\n\u25fe INDUS\u2019s assessment of market conditions may be inaccurate, including market impact from macroeconomic factors such as the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u25fe development activities may require the acquisition of undeveloped land. Competition from other real estate investors may significantly increase the purchase price of that land;\n\u25fe INDUS may be unable to obtain, or may face delays in obtaining required zoning, land-use, building, occupancy, and other governmental permits and authorizations, which could result in increased costs and require INDUS to abandon its activities entirely with respect to a project;\n\u25fe construction and leasing of a property may not be completed on schedule, which could result in increased expenses and construction costs, and would result in reduced profitability;\n\u25fe construction costs (including required offsite infrastructure costs) may exceed INDUS\u2019s original estimates due to increases in interest rates and increased materials, labor or other costs, possibly making the property less profitable than projected or unprofitable because INDUS may not be able to increase rents to compensate for the increase in construction costs;\n\u25fe INDUS may expend funds on and devote management's time to development projects that it does not complete;\n\u25fe If INDUS alters or discontinues its development efforts, costs of the investment may need to be expensed rather than capitalized and INDUS may determine the investment is impaired, resulting in a loss;\n\u25fe occupancy rates and rents at newly completed properties and the time it takes to fully or substantially lease such facilities may not meet INDUS\u2019s expectations. This may result in lower than projected occupancy and rental rates resulting in an investment that is less profitable than projected or unprofitable; and\n\u25fe\n\u25fe INDUS may incur losses under construction warranties, guaranties and delay damages under INDUS\u2019s contracts with tenants and other customers.\nThe actual initial full year stabilized cash net operating income yields from INDUS\u2019s planned development and acquisition activities may not be consistent with the underwritten stabilized Cash NOI yield ranges set forth in this Annual Report.\nAs a part of INDUS\u2019s standard development and acquisition underwriting process, INDUS analyzes the targeted initial full year stabilized Cash NOI yield for each development project and acquisition target and establishes a range of initial full year stabilized Cash NOI yields, which it refers to as \u201cunderwritten stabilized Cash NOI yields.\u201d Underwritten stabilized Cash NOI yields are calculated as a development project\u2019s or acquisition\u2019s initial full year stabilized Cash NOI as a percentage of its estimated total investment, including costs to stabilize the buildings to 95% occupancy (other than in connection with build-to-suit development projects and single tenant properties). INDUS calculates the targeted initial full year stabilized Cash NOI by subtracting the development project\u2019s or acquisition\u2019s estimated initial full year stabilized operating expenses, real estate taxes and non-cash rental revenue, including straight-line rents (before interest expense, income taxes, if any, and depreciation and amortization), from its estimated initial full year stabilized rental revenue.\nINDUS cautions you not to place undue reliance on the underwritten stabilized Cash NOI yield ranges for its planned development and acquisition activities because they are based solely on INDUS\u2019s estimates, using data available to it in its development and acquisition underwriting processes. INDUS\u2019s total cost to complete a development project or acquisition may differ substantially from its estimates due to various factors, including unanticipated expenses, delays in the estimated start and/or completion date of planned development projects, effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and other contingencies. In addition, INDUS\u2019s actual initial full year stabilized Cash NOI from its planned development and acquisition activities may differ substantially from its estimates based on numerous other factors, including delays and/or difficulties in leasing and stabilizing a development project or acquisition, failure to obtain estimated occupancy and rental rates, inability to collect anticipated rental revenues, tenant bankruptcies and unanticipated expenses of the development project or acquisition that INDUS cannot pass on to its tenants. It is possible that that the actual initial full year stabilized Cash NOI yield from INDUS\u2019s planned development and acquisition activities will not be consistent with the underwritten stabilized Cash NOI yield ranges set forth in this Annual Report.\nINDUS\u2019s ability to achieve growth in its portfolio partially depends in part on INDUS\u2019s ability to acquire properties, which may suffer under certain circumstances.\nINDUS acquires individual properties and in the future may continue to acquire individual properties or portfolios of properties. INDUS\u2019s acquisition activities and their success are generally subject to the following risks:\n\u25fe INDUS\u2019s ability to travel to, locate and execute on desirable properties or in certain markets, as a result of travel restrictions and other effects of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u25fe when INDUS is able to locate a desirable property, competition from other real estate investors may significantly increase the purchase price;\n\u25fe acquired properties may fail to perform as expected;\n\u25fe the actual costs of repositioning or redeveloping acquired properties may be higher than INDUS estimates;\n\u25fe acquired properties have been and may continue to be located in new markets where INDUS faces risks associated with an incomplete knowledge or understanding of the local market, a limited number of established business relationships in the area and a relative unfamiliarity with local governmental and permitting procedures; and\n\u25fe INDUS may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate new acquisitions, particularly acquisitions of portfolios of properties and operating entities, into its existing operations, and as a result, INDUS\u2019s results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nINDUS may acquire properties subject to liabilities and without any recourse, or with only limited recourse, with respect to unknown liabilities. As a result, if a liability were asserted against INDUS based upon ownership of those properties, INDUS might have to pay substantial sums to settle the liabilities, which could adversely affect its cash flow and financial position.\nWeakness in INDUS\u2019s office/flex portfolio could negatively impact its business.\nINDUS\u2019s office/flex portfolio, which as of November 30, 2020 comprised 8.5% of its total square footage and was 71% occupied, is concentrated in the north submarket of Hartford, Connecticut. The demand for office/flex space in this market is weak and competitive, with market vacancy in excess of 30% as of December 31, 2020, according to the Q4 2020 CBRE|New England Report, and such demand may continue to be impacted by effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. There is no certainty that INDUS will retain existing tenants or attract new tenants to its office/flex buildings. Re-leasing INDUS\u2019s office/flex properties typically requires greater investment per square foot than for INDUS\u2019s industrial/logistics properties and could negatively impact INDUS\u2019s results of operations and cash flow.\nINDUS may experience increased operating costs, which could adversely affect its results of operations.\nINDUS\u2019s properties are subject to increases in operating expenses such as real estate taxes, fuel, utilities, labor, repairs and maintenance, building materials and insurance, some of which have been and may continue to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. While many of INDUS\u2019s current tenants generally are obligated to pay a significant portion of these costs, it is possible that existing or new tenants will not agree to, or make, these payments. If operating expenses increase, INDUS may not be able to pass these costs on to its tenants and, therefore, any increases could have an adverse effect on INDUS\u2019s results of operations and cash flow. Additionally, for space that has remained or remains unleased, INDUS has incurred, and will continue to incur, all of the building\u2019s operating costs for the space without reimbursements from tenants.\nINDUS relies on third-party managers for day-to-day property management of certain of its properties.\nINDUS relies on local third-party managers for the day-to-day management of its properties in the Lehigh Valley of Pennsylvania, the greater Charlotte, North Carolina area and Orlando, Florida. To the extent that INDUS uses a third-party manager, the cash flows from its Lehigh Valley, greater Charlotte and Orlando properties may be adversely affected if the property manager fails to provide quality services. These third-party managers may fail to manage INDUS\u2019s properties effectively or in accordance with their agreements with INDUS, may be negligent in their performance and may engage in criminal or fraudulent activity. If any of these events occur, INDUS could incur losses or face liabilities from the loss or injury to its property or to persons at its properties. In addition, disputes may arise between INDUS and these third-party managers, and INDUS may incur significant expenses to resolve those disputes, or terminate the relevant agreement with these third parties and locate and engage competent and cost-effective alternative service providers to manage the relevant properties. Additionally, third party managers may manage and own other properties that may compete with INDUS\u2019s properties, which may result in conflicts of interest and decisions regarding the operation of INDUS\u2019s properties that are not in INDUS\u2019s best interests. INDUS has and likely will continue to rely on third-party managers in any new markets it enters through its acquisition activities.\nUnfavorable events affecting INDUS\u2019s existing and potential tenants and its properties, or negative market conditions that may affect INDUS\u2019s existing and potential tenants, could have an adverse impact on INDUS\u2019s ability to attract new tenants, re-let space, collect rent and renew leases, and thus could have a negative effect on INDUS\u2019s results of operations and cash flow.\nThe substantial majority of INDUS\u2019s revenue is derived from lease revenue from its industrial/logistics and office/flex buildings. INDUS\u2019s results of operations and cash flows depend on its ability to lease space to tenants on economically favorable terms. Therefore, INDUS has and could in the future be adversely affected by various factors and events over which INDUS has limited control, such as:\n\u25fe inability to retain existing tenants and attract new tenants;\n\u25fe oversupply of or reduced demand for space and changes in market rental rates in the areas where INDUS\u2019s properties are located;\n\u25fe defaults by INDUS\u2019s tenants or failure to pay rent on a timely basis due to bankruptcy, economic conditions or other factors, such as the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u25fe physical damage to INDUS\u2019s properties and the need to repair the damage;\n\u25fe economic or physical decline or impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic in the areas where INDUS\u2019s properties are located; and\n\u25fe potential risk of functional obsolescence of INDUS\u2019s properties over time.\nINDUS\u2019s tenants have and may in the future be unable to pay rent due to INDUS. INDUS may be forced to evict the tenant, or engage in other remedies, similar to the rent relief and deferral agreements INDUS has been required to consider and grant during fiscal 2020, which may be expensive and time consuming and may adversely affect INDUS\u2019s results of operation and cash flows.\nIf INDUS\u2019s tenants do not renew their leases as they expire, INDUS may not be able to re-lease the space. Furthermore, leases that are renewed, or new leases for space that is re-let, may have terms that are less economically favorable to INDUS than current lease terms, or may require INDUS to incur significant costs, such as for renovations, tenant improvements or lease transaction costs.\nAny of these events could adversely affect INDUS\u2019s results of operations and cash flows and its ability to make dividend payments and service its indebtedness.\nA significant portion of INDUS\u2019s costs, such as real estate taxes, insurance costs, and debt service payments, are fixed, which means that they generally are not reduced when circumstances cause a decrease in cash flow from its properties.\nDeclining real estate valuations and any related impairment charges could materially adversely affect INDUS\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, ability to satisfy debt obligations and ability to pay dividends on, and the per share trading price of, its common stock.\nINDUS reviews the carrying value of its properties when circumstances, such as adverse market conditions, indicate a potential impairment may exist. INDUS bases its review on an estimate of the future cash flows, excluding interest charges, expected to result from the property\u2019s use and eventual disposition on an undiscounted basis. INDUS considers factors such as future operating income, trends and prospects, as well as the effects of leasing demand, competition and other factors. With respect to undeveloped land, INDUS evaluates the cash flow to be generated from the potential use or sale of such land as compared to the costs, including entitlement and infrastructure costs for the intended use or costs required to prepare the land for sale. If INDUS\u2019s evaluation indicates that it may be unable to recover the carrying value of a real estate investment, an impairment loss would be recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value of the property.\nImpairment losses have a direct impact on INDUS\u2019s results of operations because recording an impairment loss results in an immediate negative adjustment to INDUS\u2019s operating results. The evaluation of anticipated cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding future occupancy, rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results in future periods. A worsening real estate market may cause INDUS to reevaluate the assumptions used in its impairment analysis. Impairment charges could materially adversely affect INDUS\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and ability to pay dividends on, and the per share trading price of, its common stock.\nINDUS\u2019s use of nonrecourse mortgage loans and construction loans could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition.\nAs of November 30, 2020, INDUS had indebtedness under nonrecourse mortgage loans of approximately $163.2 million, collateralized by approximately 94% of the total square footage of its industrial/logistics and office/flex buildings. If a significant number of INDUS\u2019s tenants were unable to meet their obligations to INDUS or if INDUS were unable to lease a significant amount of space in its properties on economically favorable lease terms, there would be a risk that INDUS would not have sufficient cash flow from operations for payments of required principal and interest on these loans. If INDUS was unable to make the payments and was to default, the property collateralizing the mortgage loan could be foreclosed upon, and INDUS\u2019s financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected. In addition, two of INDUS\u2019s nonrecourse mortgage loans contain cross default provisions. A default under a mortgage loan that has cross default provisions may cause INDUS to automatically default on another loan.\nINDUS\u2019s use of financing arrangements that include balloon payment obligations could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition.\nApproximately 95% of the principal balance of INDUS\u2019s nonrecourse mortgage loans as of November 30, 2020 require a lump-sum or \u201cballoon\u201d payment at maturity. INDUS\u2019s ability to make a balloon payment at maturity may be uncertain and may depend upon its ability to obtain additional financing. At the time the balloon payment is due, INDUS may or may not be able to refinance the balloon payment on terms as favorable as the original mortgage terms. If INDUS were to be unable to refinance the balloon payment, then it may be forced to sell the property or pay the balloon payment using its existing cash on hand or other liquidity sources, or the property could be foreclosed. Any balloon payments that INDUS makes out of its existing cash or liquidity may have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and leave it with insufficient cash to invest in other properties, pay dividends to stockholders or meet its other obligations.\nINDUS\u2019s failure to effectively hedge against interest rate fluctuation could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition.\nINDUS has entered into several interest rate swap agreements to hedge its interest rate exposures related to its variable rate nonrecourse mortgages on certain of its industrial/logistics and office/flex buildings. These agreements have costs and involve the risks that these arrangements may not be effective in reducing INDUS\u2019s exposure to interest rate fluctuations and that a court could rule that such agreements are not legally enforceable. The failure to hedge effectively against interest rate fluctuations may have a material adverse effect on INDUS\u2019s results of operations if interest rates were to rise materially. Additionally, any settlement charges incurred to terminate an interest rate swap agreement may result in increased interest expense, which may also have an adverse effect on INDUS\u2019s results of operations.\nINDUS may suffer adverse effects as a result of the terms of and covenants relating to its credit facilities.\nINDUS\u2019s continued ability to borrow under its credit facilities with Webster Bank, N.A. (\u201cWebster Bank\u201d) including its $19.5 million revolving credit facility and its $15 million acquisition credit facility, is subject to compliance with certain financial and other covenants. INDUS\u2019s failure to comply with such covenants under any of its credit facilities could cause a default under such credit facility, and INDUS may then be required to repay amounts outstanding, if any, under such facility with capital from other sources. Under those circumstances, other sources of capital may not be available to INDUS, or may be available only on unattractive terms.\nINDUS\u2019s risk related to the discontinuation of LIBOR.\nIn July 2017, the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2023. It is expected that a transition away from the widespread use of LIBOR to alternative interest rates will occur over the course of the next two years. As of November 30, 2020, INDUS had approximately $98.1 million of floating rate debt under nonrecourse mortgage loans, the interest on which is based on LIBOR, however, INDUS entered into interest rate swap agreements whereby the floating LIBOR rates under all mortgage loans are hedged, effectively fixing the interest rate on those loans.\nIn the event that LIBOR is no longer available, the revolving credit line provides for a transition to a comparable rate of interest determined by Webster Bank and the Acquisition Credit Line contemplates that Webster Bank will transition to an alternate rate of interest to the LIBOR rate taking into account then prevailing standards in the market for determining interest rates for commercial loans made by financial institutions in the United States at such time. Such an event would not affect INDUS\u2019s ability to borrow or maintain already outstanding borrowings, but the replacement rate or alternate base rate could be higher or more volatile than LIBOR prior to its discontinuance. The full impact of the expected transition away from LIBOR and the potential discontinuation of LIBOR after 2023 is unclear, but these changes could adversely affect INDUS\u2019s cash flow, financial condition and results of operations.\nINDUS relies on key personnel.\nINDUS\u2019s success depends to a significant degree upon the contribution of certain key personnel, including but not limited to INDUS\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer, INDUS Realty, LLC\u2019s Executive Vice President and its Senior Vice President of Construction and Development. If any key personnel of INDUS or its subsidiaries were to cease\nemployment, INDUS\u2019s operating results could suffer. INDUS\u2019s ability to retain its senior management group or attract suitable replacements should any members of the senior management group leave is dependent on the competitive nature of the employment market. The loss of services from key members of the management group or a limitation on their availability could adversely affect INDUS\u2019s results of operations and cash flows. INDUS has not obtained and does not expect to obtain key man life insurance on any of its key personnel.\nRisks Related to the Real Estate Industry\nChanging or adverse political and economic conditions, credit markets or other events may impact INDUS\u2019s results of operations and financial condition.\nINDUS\u2019s real estate business may be affected by market conditions, political and economic uncertainty experienced by the U.S. economy as a whole, conditions in the credit markets, by local economic conditions in the markets in which its properties are located or by other global and domestic events, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Such conditions may impact INDUS\u2019s results of operations, financial condition or ability to expand its operations and pay dividends to stockholders as a result of the following:\n\u25fe The financial condition of INDUS\u2019s tenants may be adversely affected, which may result in tenant defaults under leases due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failures or for other reasons;\n\u25fe A decrease in investment spending, the curtailment of expansion plans or significant job losses may decrease demand for INDUS\u2019s industrial/logistics and office/flex space, causing market rental rates and property values to be negatively impacted;\n\u25fe INDUS\u2019s ability to borrow on terms and conditions that it finds acceptable, or at all, may be limited, which could reduce its ability to pursue acquisition and development opportunities, refinance existing debt, and/or increase future interest expense;\n\u25fe Reduced values of INDUS\u2019s properties may limit its ability to obtain debt financing collateralized by its properties or may limit the proceeds from such potential financings;\n\u25fe A weak economy may limit sales of land intended for commercial, industrial and residential use;\n\u25fe Changes in supply or demand for similar or competing properties in an area where INDUS\u2019s properties are located may adversely affect INDUS\u2019s competitive position and market rental rates in that area; and\n\u25fe Long periods of time may elapse between the commencement and the completion of INDUS\u2019s projects.\nAn increase in interest rates could adversely impact INDUS\u2019s ability to refinance existing debt or to finance new developments and acquisitions.\nRising interest rates could limit INDUS\u2019s ability to refinance existing debt on favorable terms, or at all, when it matures. Interest rates have been in recent years, and currently remain, low by historical standards. However, the Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate multiple times in 2017 and 2018, and, although rates were reduced during 2020 in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, further interest rate increases may occur in the future. If interest rates increase, so will INDUS\u2019s interest costs, which would adversely affect INDUS\u2019s cash flow and could affect INDUS\u2019s ability to pay principal and interest on its debt.\nFrom time to time, INDUS enters into interest rate swap agreements and other interest rate hedging contracts, including swaps, caps and floors. These agreements, which are intended to lessen the impact of rising interest rates on INDUS, expose INDUS to the risks that the other parties to the agreements might not perform, or that INDUS could incur significant costs associated with the settlement of the agreements, or that the agreements might be unenforceable and the underlying transactions would fail to qualify as highly-effective cash flow hedges under relevant accounting guidance.\nIn addition, an increase in interest rates could decrease the amounts third parties are willing to lend to INDUS for use towards potential acquisitions or development costs, thereby limiting its ability to grow its property portfolio.\nINDUS may not be able to compete successfully with other entities that operate in its industry.\nThe market for leasing industrial/logistics space and office/flex space is highly competitive. INDUS competes for tenants with owners of numerous properties in the areas where INDUS\u2019s buildings are located. Some of INDUS\u2019s competitors for tenants have greater financial resources than INDUS and may be able to offer prospective tenants more attractive financial or other terms than INDUS is able to offer and may be able to accept more risk related to the creditworthiness of tenants. INDUS\u2019s competes for tenants on the bases of location, price, availability of space, convenience and amenities.\nThere is a great amount of competition for the acquisition of industrial/logistics buildings and for the acquisition of undeveloped land for construction of such buildings. INDUS competes for the acquisition of industrial/logistics properties with other REITs, institutional investors, such as pension funds, private real estate investment funds, insurance company investment accounts, public and private investment companies, individuals and other entities engaged in real estate investment activities. Some of these competitors have greater financial resources than INDUS, and may be able to accept more risk, including risk related to the degree of leverage they may be willing to take on and risk related to acquiring properties that are not substantially leased. Competitors for acquisitions may also have advantages from a lower cost of capital or greater operating efficiencies associated with being a larger entity.\nINDUS may experience increased costs or delays in supply of raw materials, labor and energy, which could adversely affect its operations.\nINDUS\u2019s construction activities and maintenance of its current portfolio could be adversely affected by increases in raw materials, labor or energy costs or disruption of these supply chains, including, without limitation, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. An increase in the cost of building new facilities could negatively impact INDUS\u2019s future operating results through increased depreciation expense. An increase in construction costs would also require increased investment in INDUS\u2019s real estate assets, which may lower the return on investment in new facilities. The lack of availability of raw materials or labor has impacted and could continue to impact INDUS, resulting in higher construction costs as a result of increases in wage rates and delay construction of new facilities. Furthermore, as petroleum and other energy costs increase, products used in the construction of INDUS\u2019s facilities, such as steel, masonry, asphalt, cement and building products may increase. Additionally, government international trade policies, including implementation of or changes in tariffs, could impact the cost of products used in INDUS\u2019s facilities. An increase in energy costs could increase INDUS\u2019s building operating expenses and thereby lower INDUS\u2019s operating results.\nReal estate investments are illiquid, and INDUS may not be able to sell its properties when INDUS determines it is appropriate to do so.\nReal estate properties are not as liquid as other types of investments and this lack of liquidity could limit INDUS\u2019s ability to react promptly to changes in economic, financial, investment or other conditions, such as the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d), provide for the ability to exchange \u201clike-kind\u201d property to defer income taxes related to a gain on sale (\u201c1031 Like-Kind Exchange\u201d). The illiquidity of real estate properties may limit INDUS\u2019s ability to find a replacement property to effectuate an exchange.\nPotential environmental liabilities could result in substantial costs.\nINDUS has properties in Connecticut, the Lehigh Valley of Pennsylvania, the greater Charlotte area in North Carolina and Orlando, Florida in addition to extensive land holdings in Connecticut, Massachusetts and northern Florida. Under federal, state and local environmental laws, ordinances and regulations, INDUS may be required to investigate and clean up the effects of releases of hazardous substances or petroleum products at its properties because of its current or past ownership or operation of the real estate. If previously unidentified environmental problems arise, INDUS may have to make substantial payments, which could adversely affect its cash flow. As an owner or operator of properties, INDUS may have to pay for investigation and clean-up costs incurred in connection with a contamination. The law typically imposes cleanup responsibility and liability regardless of whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the contamination. Changes in environmental regulations may impact the development potential of INDUS\u2019s undeveloped land or could increase operating costs due to the cost of complying with new regulations.\nCompliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and fire, safety and other regulations may require INDUS to make expenditures that adversely impact INDUS\u2019s operating results.\nAll of INDUS\u2019s properties are required to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act (\"ADA\"). The ADA generally requires that places of public accommodation comply with federal requirements related to access and use by people with disabilities. Compliance with the ADA requirements could require removal of access barriers, and non-compliance could result in imposition of fines by the U.S. government or an award of damages to private litigants, or both. Expenditures related to complying with the provisions of the ADA could adversely affect INDUS\u2019s results of operations and financial condition. In addition, INDUS is required to operate its properties in compliance with fire and safety regulations, building codes and other land use regulations, as they may continue to be adopted by governmental agencies and bodies and become applicable to INDUS\u2019s properties. INDUS has made and may continue to be required to make substantial capital expenditures to comply with those requirements and these expenditures could have a material adverse effect on INDUS\u2019s operating results and financial condition and INDUS\u2019s ability to satisfy debt obligations and issue dividends to stockholders.\nGovernmental regulations and control could adversely affect INDUS\u2019s real estate development activities.\nINDUS\u2019s operations are subject to governmental regulations that affect real estate development, such as local zoning ordinances, wetlands restrictions, storm water regulations and open space preservation initiatives. Any changes in regulations regarding these matters may impact the ability of INDUS to develop its properties or increase INDUS\u2019s costs of development. Subdivision and other residential development may also be affected by the potential adoption of initiatives meant to limit or concentrate residential growth. Commercial and industrial development activities of INDUS\u2019s undeveloped land may also be affected by traffic considerations, potential environmental issues, community opposition and other restrictions to development imposed by governmental agencies.\nUninsured losses or a loss in excess of insured limits could adversely affect INDUS\u2019s business, results of operations and financial condition.\nINDUS carries comprehensive insurance coverage, including property, liability, terrorism and loss of rental revenue. The insurance coverage contains policy specifications and insured limits. However, there are certain losses that are not generally insured against or that are not fully insured against. If an uninsured loss or a loss in excess of insured limits occurs with respect to one or more of INDUS\u2019s properties, INDUS could experience a significant loss of capital invested in and potential revenue from the properties affected.\nInformation technology (\u201cIT\u201d) security breaches and other incidents could disrupt INDUS\u2019s operations, compromise confidential information maintained by INDUS, and damage INDUS\u2019s reputation, all of which could negatively impact INDUS\u2019s business, results of operations and the per share trading price of its common stock.\nAs part of INDUS\u2019s normal business activities, it uses IT and other computer resources to carry out important operational activities and to maintain its business records. INDUS\u2019s computer systems, including its backup systems, are subject to interruption or damage from power outages, computer and telecommunications failures, computer viruses, security breaches (including through cyber-attack and data theft), usage errors and catastrophic events, such as fires, floods, tornadoes and hurricanes. If INDUS\u2019s computer systems and its backup systems are compromised, degraded, damaged or breached, or otherwise cease to function properly, INDUS could suffer interruptions in its operations or unintentionally allow misappropriation of proprietary or confidential information, which could damage its reputation and require INDUS to incur significant costs to remediate or otherwise resolve these issues. It is possible that the security efforts and measures INDUS has implemented will not be effective or that attempted security breaches or disruptions will be successful or damaging.\nINDUS is exposed to the potential impacts of future climate change and climate-change related risks.\nINDUS is exposed to potential physical risks from possible future changes in climate. INDUS\u2019s properties may be exposed to rare catastrophic weather events, such as severe storms, hurricanes and/or floods. If the frequency of extreme weather events increases due to climate change, INDUS\u2019s exposure to these events could increase.\nAs a real estate owner and developer, INDUS may be adversely impacted in the future by stricter energy efficiency standards for buildings. INDUS may be required to make improvements to its existing properties to meet such standards and the costs to meet these standards may increase INDUS\u2019s costs for new construction.\nINDUS\u2019s properties may contain or develop harmful mold or suffer from other air quality issues, which could lead to liability for adverse health effects and costs of remediation.\nWhen excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials, mold growth may occur, particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed. Some molds may produce airborne toxins or irritants. Indoor air quality issues can also stem from inadequate ventilation, chemical contamination from indoor or outdoor sources, and other biological contaminants such as pollen, viruses and bacteria. Indoor exposure to airborne toxins or irritants above certain levels can be alleged to cause a variety of adverse health effects and symptoms, including allergic or other reactions. As a result, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants at any of INDUS\u2019s properties could require INDUS to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold or other airborne contaminants from the affected property or increase indoor ventilation. In addition, the presence of significant mold or other airborne contaminants could expose INDUS to liability from its tenants, employees of its tenants or others if property damage or personal injury is alleged to have occurred.\nRisks Related to INDUS\u2019s Organization and Structure\nINDUS\u2019s rights and the rights of INDUS stockholders to take action against its directors and officers are limited.\nMaryland law provides that a director has no liability in the capacity as a director if he or she performs his or her duties in good faith, in a manner he or she reasonably believes to be in the company\u2019s best interests and with the care that an ordinarily prudent person in a like position would use under similar circumstances. As permitted by Maryland law, INDUS\u2019s charter limits the liability of its directors and officers to the Company and its stockholders for money damages, except for liability resulting from:\n\u25cf actual receipt of an improper benefit or profit in money, property or services; or\n\u25cf a final judgment based on a finding of active and deliberate dishonesty by the director or officer that was material to the cause of action adjudicated.\nIn addition, INDUS\u2019s charter requires it to indemnify its directors and officers for actions taken by them in those capacities and to pay or reimburse their reasonable expenses in advance of final disposition of a proceeding to the maximum extent permitted by Maryland law, and INDUS has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and executive officers. As a result, INDUS and its stockholders may have more limited rights against its directors and officers than might otherwise exist under common law. Accordingly, in the event that any of INDUS\u2019s directors or officers are exculpated from, or indemnified against, liability but whose actions impede the Company\u2019s performance, INDUS\u2019s stockholders\u2019 ability to recover damages from that director or officer will be limited.\nINDUS\u2019s charter and bylaws contain provisions that may delay, defer or prevent an acquisition of its common stock or a change in control.\nINDUS\u2019s charter and bylaws contain a number of provisions, the exercise or existence of which could delay, defer or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for its stockholders or otherwise be in their best interests, including the following:\nINDUS\u2019s charter contains restrictions on the ownership and transfer of its stock.\nIn order for INDUS to qualify as a REIT, no more than 50% of the value of outstanding shares of its stock may be owned, beneficially or constructively, by five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of each taxable year other than the first year for which INDUS elects to be taxed as a REIT. Subject to certain exceptions, INDUS\u2019s charter prohibits any stockholder from owning, beneficially or constructively, more than 5.5% in value or in number of shares, whichever is more restrictive, of the outstanding shares of its common stock, or 5.5% in value of the aggregate of the outstanding shares of all classes or series of our stock. INDUS refers to these restrictions collectively as the \u201cownership limits.\u201d The constructive ownership rules under the Code are complex and may cause the outstanding stock owned by a\ngroup of related individuals or entities to be deemed to be constructively owned by one individual or entity. As a result, the acquisition of less than 5.5% of INDUS\u2019s outstanding common stock or the outstanding shares of all classes or series of INDUS\u2019s stock by an individual or entity could cause that individual or entity or another individual or entity to own constructively in excess of the relevant ownership limits. INDUS\u2019s charter also prohibits any person from owning shares of INDUS\u2019s stock that could result in INDUS being \u201cclosely held\u201d under Section 856(h) of the Code or otherwise cause INDUS to fail to qualify as a REIT. Any attempt to own or transfer shares of INDUS\u2019s common stock or of any of INDUS\u2019s other capital stock in violation of these restrictions may result in the shares being automatically transferred to a charitable trust or may be void. These ownership limits may prevent a third-party from acquiring control of INDUS if INDUS\u2019s Board does not grant an exemption from the ownership limits, even if INDUS\u2019s stockholders believe the change in control is in their best interests. Although it is under no continuing obligation to do so, INDUS\u2019s Board intends to grant some limited exemptions from the ownership limits applicable to certain holders of its common stock, subject to certain initial and ongoing conditions designed to protect INDUS\u2019s status as a REIT, including, if deemed advisable, the receipt of an Internal Revenue Service, or IRS, private letter ruling or an opinion of counsel.\nINDUS\u2019s Board has the power to cause the Company to issue additional shares of INDUS stock without stockholder approval.\nINDUS\u2019s charter authorizes the Company to issue additional authorized but unissued shares of common or preferred stock. In addition, INDUS\u2019s Board may, without stockholder approval, amend the Company\u2019s charter to increase the aggregate number of INDUS shares of common stock or the number of shares of stock of any class or series that INDUS has the authority to issue and classify or reclassify any unissued shares of common or preferred stock and set the preferences, rights and other terms of the classified or reclassified shares. As a result, INDUS\u2019s Board may establish a class or series of shares of common or preferred stock that could delay or prevent a transaction or a change in control that might involve a premium price for the Company\u2019s shares of common stock or otherwise be in the best interests of INDUS\u2019s stockholders.\nCertain provisions of Maryland law may limit the ability of a third-party to acquire control of INDUS.\nCertain provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law (the \u201cMGCL\u201d) may have the effect of inhibiting a third-party from acquiring INDUS or of impeding a change of control under circumstances that otherwise could provide INDUS\u2019s common stockholders with the opportunity to realize a premium over the then-prevailing market price of such shares, including:\n\u25cf\u201cbusiness combination\u201d provisions that, subject to limitations, prohibit certain business combinations between an \u201cinterested stockholder\u201d (defined generally as any person who beneficially owns 10% or more of the voting power of INDUS\u2019s outstanding shares of voting stock or an affiliate or associate of the corporation who, at any time within the two-year period immediately prior to the date in question, was the beneficial owner of 10% or more of the voting power of the then outstanding stock of the corporation) or an affiliate of any interested stockholder for five years after the most recent date on which the stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, and thereafter imposes two super-majority stockholder voting requirements on these combinations; and\n\u25cf\u201ccontrol share\u201d provisions that provide that holders of \u201ccontrol shares\u201d of the Company (defined as voting shares of stock that, if aggregated with all other shares of stock owned or controlled by the acquirer, would entitle the acquirer to exercise one of three increasing ranges of voting power in electing directors) acquired in a \u201ccontrol share acquisition\u201d (defined as the direct or indirect acquisition of issued and outstanding \u201ccontrol shares\u201d) have no voting rights except to the extent approved by our stockholders by the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of all of the votes entitled to be cast on the matter, excluding all interested shares.\nPursuant to the Maryland Business Combination Act (the \u201cMBCA\u201d), INDUS\u2019s Board has by resolution exempted from the provisions of the MBCA business combinations between any other person and INDUS. INDUS\u2019s bylaws contain a provision exempting from the Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act any and all acquisitions by any person of shares of INDUS stock. There can be no assurance that these exemptions or resolutions will not be amended or eliminated at any time in the future.\nAdditionally, Title 3, Subtitle 8 of the MGCL permits INDUS\u2019s Board, without stockholder approval and regardless of what is currently provided in INDUS\u2019s charter or bylaws, to implement certain takeover defences, such as a classified board, some of which INDUS does not have.\nINDUS\u2019s bylaws designate the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland, as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by INDUS stockholders, which could limit INDUS\u2019s stockholders\u2019 ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that the stockholders believe is a more favorable judicial forum for disputes with INDUS or its directors, officers or other employees.\nINDUS\u2019s bylaws provide that, subject to limited exceptions, the Circuit Court for Baltimore City, Maryland, is the sole and exclusive forum for (a) any Internal Corporate Claim, as such term is defined in the MGCL, (b) any derivative action or proceeding brought on INDUS\u2019s behalf, other than actions arising under federal securities laws, (c) any action asserting a claim of breach of any duty owed by any of INDUS\u2019s directors, officers or other employees to INDUS or its stockholders, (d) any action asserting a claim against INDUS or any of its directors, officers or other employees arising pursuant to any provision of the MGCL, INDUS\u2019s charter or its bylaws or (e) any action asserting a claim against INDUS or any of its directors, officers or other employees that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it believes is more favorable for disputes against INDUS or its directors, officers or employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against INDUS and its directors, officers and other employees.\nThe concentrated ownership of INDUS common stock by members of the Cullman and Ernst families may limit other INDUS stockholders\u2019 ability to influence INDUS\u2019s corporate and management policies.\nMembers of the Cullman and Ernst families (the \u201cCullman and Ernst Group\u201d), which include Michael S. Gamzon, a director and INDUS\u2019s President and Chief Executive Officer and Frederick M. Danziger and Edgar M. Cullman, Jr., directors of INDUS, members of their families and trusts for their benefit, partnerships in which they own substantial interests and charitable foundations on whose boards of directors they sit, owned, directly or indirectly, approximately 40.2% of the outstanding common stock of INDUS as of November 30, 2020. There is an informal understanding that the persons and entities included in the Cullman and Ernst Group will vote together the shares owned by each of them. As a result, the Cullman and Ernst Group may effectively control the determination of INDUS\u2019s corporate and management policies and may limit other INDUS stockholders\u2019 ability to influence INDUS\u2019s corporate and management policies.\nINDUS\u2019s Board may change its investment and financing policies without stockholder approval and INDUS may become more highly leveraged, which may increase INDUS\u2019s risk of default under its debt obligations.\nINDUS\u2019s investment and financing policies are exclusively determined by its Board. Accordingly, INDUS\u2019s stockholders do not control these policies. Further, INDUS\u2019s charter and bylaws do not limit the amount or percentage of indebtedness, funded or otherwise, that INDUS may incur. INDUS\u2019s Board may alter or eliminate its current policy on borrowing at any time without stockholder approval. If this policy changed, INDUS could become more highly leveraged which could result in an increase in its debt service. Higher leverage also increases the risk of default on INDUS\u2019s obligations. In addition, a change in INDUS\u2019s investment policies, including the manner in which INDUS allocates its resources across the portfolio or the types of assets in which INDUS seeks to invest, may increase its exposure to interest rate risk, real estate market fluctuations and liquidity risk. Changes to INDUS\u2019s policies with regard to the foregoing could adversely affect INDUS\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and its ability to pay dividends on, and the per share trading price of, its common stock.\nRisks Related to INDUS\u2019s REIT Structure\nIf INDUS fails to remain qualified as a REIT, INDUS would be subject to corporate income taxes and would not be able to deduct distributions to stockholders when computing its taxable income.\nINDUS currently operates in a manner that is intended to allow it to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes commencing with its taxable year beginning January 1, 2021. However, it is possible that INDUS will not have qualified or will not remain qualified as a REIT. Qualification as a REIT requires INDUS to satisfy numerous requirements established under highly technical and complex sections of the Code, which may change from time to time and for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within INDUS\u2019s control. If INDUS fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year:\n\u25cf INDUS would be subject to federal income tax on its taxable income computed in the usual manner for corporate taxpayers without deduction for distributions to its stockholders and INDUS may need to borrow additional funds or issue securities to pay such additional tax liability;\n\u25cf unless INDUS is entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions, INDUS could not elect to be taxed as a REIT for four taxable years following the year during which INDUS was disqualified; and\n\u25cf INDUS will not be required to make distributions to its stockholders.\nAs a result of all these factors, INDUS\u2019s failure to qualify as a REIT also could impair its ability to expand its business and raise capital. Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex Code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations.\nIn order to qualify as a REIT, INDUS must satisfy a number of requirements, including requirements regarding the ownership of its stock, requirements regarding the composition of its assets and requirements regarding the sources of its gross income. Also, INDUS must make distributions to stockholders aggregating annually at least 90% of its REIT taxable income, determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and excluding net capital gains. In addition, legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions may materially adversely affect INDUS investors, its ability to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes or the desirability of an investment in a REIT relative to other investments.\nEven if INDUS remains qualified as a REIT, it may owe taxes under certain circumstances.\nEven if INDUS qualifies as a REIT, it will be subject to certain U.S. federal, state and local taxes on its income and property, including on taxable income that the Company does not distribute to its stockholders, and on net income from certain \u201cprohibited transactions\u201d. In addition, if INDUS fails to qualify as a REIT but nevertheless qualifies for relief under certain statutory relief provisions, it may be required to pay an excise or penalty tax (which could be significant in amount) in order to utilize one or more such relief provisions under the Code to maintain its qualification as a REIT. Moreover, INDUS\u2019s taxable REIT subsidiary will be subject to tax as a regular corporation in the jurisdictions it operates. Furthermore, if INDUS sells an asset it held on the first day of the first taxable year for which it qualifies as a REIT (i.e., January 1, 2021) during the five-year period beginning on such first day, INDUS generally will be required to pay regular U.S. federal corporate income tax on the gain to the extent of the excess of (i) the fair market value of the asset, over (ii) the adjusted tax basis of the asset, determined as of the first day of the first taxable year for which INDUS qualifies as a REIT.\nTo maintain INDUS\u2019s REIT status, INDUS may be forced to obtain capital during unfavorable market conditions, which could adversely affect its overall financial performance.\nIn order to qualify as a REIT, INDUS will generally be required each year to distribute to its stockholders at least 90% of its REIT taxable income (determined without regard to the dividends paid deduction and by excluding any net capital gain), and INDUS will be subject to tax to the extent its taxable income (including net capital gain) is not fully distributed. In addition, INDUS will be subject to a 4% nondeductible excise tax on the amount, if any, by which distributions it pays in any calendar year are less than the sum of 85% of its ordinary income, 95% of its net capital gains, and 100% of its undistributed income from prior years. Accordingly, INDUS may not be able to retain sufficient cash flow from operations to meet its debt service requirements and repay its debt. Therefore, INDUS may need to raise additional capital for these purposes, and INDUS cannot assure that a sufficient amount of capital will be available to INDUS on favorable terms, or at all, when needed. Further, in order to maintain its REIT qualification and avoid the payment of income and excise taxes, INDUS may need to borrow funds to meet the REIT distribution requirements even if the then prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings. These borrowing needs could result from, among other things, differences in timing between the actual receipt of cash and inclusion of income for federal income tax purposes, or the effect of non-deductible capital expenditures, the creation of reserves or required debt or amortization payments. These sources, however, may not be available on favorable terms or at all. INDUS\u2019s access to third-party sources of capital depends on a number of factors, including the market\u2019s perception of INDUS\u2019s growth potential, INDUS\u2019s current debt levels, the per share trading price of INDUS\u2019s common stock, and INDUS\u2019s current and potential future earnings. It is possible that INDUS will not have access to such capital on favorable terms at the desired times, or at all, which may cause INDUS to curtail its investment activities and/or to dispose of assets at inopportune times.\nThere will be uncertainties relating to INDUS\u2019s estimate of the E&P Distribution.\nTo qualify for taxation as a REIT effective for the year ended December 31, 2021, INDUS is required to distribute to its stockholders on or before December 31, 2021, its undistributed accumulated earnings and profits attributable to taxable periods ending prior to January 1, 2021, which is referred to as the \u201cE&P Distribution.\u201d INDUS believes that the total value of the E&P Distribution will be sufficient to fully distribute its accumulated earnings and profits and that a portion of the E&P Distribution will exceed its accumulated earnings and profits. However, the amount of INDUS\u2019s accumulated earnings and profits is a complex factual and legal determination. INDUS may have less than complete information at the time it estimates its earnings and profits or may interpret the applicable law differently from the IRS. Substantial uncertainties exist relating to the computation of INDUS\u2019s undistributed accumulated earnings and profits, including the possibility that the IRS could, in auditing tax years through 2020, successfully assert that INDUS\u2019s taxable income should be increased, which could increase INDUS\u2019s pre-REIT accumulated earnings and profits. Thus, INDUS could fail to satisfy the requirement that it distribute all of its pre-REIT accumulated earnings and profits by the close of its first taxable year as a REIT. Moreover, although there are procedures available to cure a failure to distribute all of its pre-REIT accumulated earnings and profits, INDUS cannot now determine whether it would be able to take advantage of them or the economic impact to INDUS of doing so.\nINDUS\u2019s taxable REIT subsidiaries will be subject to federal income tax, and INDUS will be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on certain income or deductions if its transactions with its taxable REIT subsidiaries are not conducted on arm\u2019s length terms.\nINDUS owns an interest in a taxable REIT subsidiary and may acquire securities in additional taxable REIT subsidiaries in the future. A taxable REIT subsidiary is an entity treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes other than a REIT in which a REIT directly or indirectly holds stock, and that has made a joint election with such REIT to be treated as a taxable REIT subsidiary. If a taxable REIT subsidiary owns more than 35% of the total voting power or value of the outstanding securities of another corporation, such other corporation will also be treated as a taxable REIT subsidiary. Other than some activities relating to lodging and health care facilities, a taxable REIT subsidiary may generally engage in any business, including the provision of customary or non-customary services to tenants of its parent REIT. A taxable REIT subsidiary is subject to federal income tax as a regular C corporation. INDUS will be required to pay a 100% penalty tax on certain income or deductions if its transactions with its taxable REIT subsidiary are not conducted on an arm\u2019s length basis.\nREIT ownership limitations may restrict or prevent stockholders from engaging in certain transfers of INDUS\u2019s common stock.\nIn order to satisfy the requirements for REIT qualification, no more than 50% in value of all classes or series of INDUS\u2019s outstanding shares of stock may be owned, actually or constructively, by five or fewer individuals (as defined in the Code to include certain entities) at any time during the last half of each taxable year beginning with INDUS\u2019s 2022 taxable year. To assist INDUS in satisfying this share ownership requirement, INDUS\u2019s charter imposes ownership limits on its shares of stock. Under applicable constructive ownership rules, any shares of stock owned by certain affiliated owners generally would be added together for purposes of the common stock ownership limits. See the section entitled \u201cDescription of Capital Stock - Common Stock - Restrictions on Ownership and Transfer.\u201d These ownership limitations may restrict or prevent stockholders from engaging in certain transfers of our common stock.\nComplying with REIT requirements may cause INDUS to forego otherwise attractive opportunities or liquidate otherwise attractive investments.\nTo qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, INDUS must continually satisfy tests concerning, among other things, the sources of its income, the nature and diversification of its assets, the amounts INDUS distributes to its stockholders and the ownership of its common stock. If INDUS fails to comply with one or more of the asset tests at the end of any calendar quarter, INDUS must correct the failure within 30 days after the end of the calendar quarter or qualify for certain statutory relief provisions to avoid losing its REIT qualification and suffering adverse tax consequences. In order to meet these tests, INDUS may be required to forego investments it might otherwise make or to liquidate otherwise attractive investments. Thus, compliance with the REIT requirements may hinder INDUS\u2019s performance and reduce amounts available for distribution to its stockholders.\nThe tax imposed on REITs engaging in \u201cprohibited transactions\u201d may limit INDUS\u2019s ability to engage in transactions which would be treated as sales for federal income tax purposes.\nAny gain that INDUS realizes on the sale of property (other than any foreclosure property) held as inventory or otherwise held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business, including its share of any such gain realized by its operating company, either directly or through its subsidiary partnerships, will be treated as income from a prohibited transaction that is subject to a 100% penalty tax, unless certain safe harbor exceptions apply. Although INDUS does not intend to hold any properties that would be characterized as held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of its business, such characterization is a factual determination and it is possible the IRS would not agree with INDUS\u2019s characterization of its properties or that INDUS will not always be able to make use of the available safe harbors.\nINDUS has not established a minimum distribution payment level, and INDUS may be unable to generate sufficient cash flows from its operations to make distributions to its stockholders at any time in the future.\nINDUS is generally required to distribute to its stockholders at least 90% of its net taxable income (excluding net capital gains) each year to qualify as a REIT under the Code. To the extent INDUS satisfies the 90% distribution requirement but distributes less than 100% of its net taxable income (including net capital gains), INDUS will be subject to federal corporate income tax on its undistributed net taxable income. INDUS intends to distribute at least 100% of its net taxable income (including net capital gains). However, INDUS\u2019s ability to make distributions to its stockholders may be adversely affected by the issues described in the risk factors set forth herein and in those incorporated herein by reference. Subject to satisfying the requirements for REIT qualification, INDUS intends over time to make regular quarterly distributions to its stockholders. INDUS\u2019s Board has the sole discretion to determine the timing, form and amount of any distributions to its stockholders. INDUS\u2019s Board makes determinations regarding distributions based upon, among other factors, its historical and projected results of operations, financial condition, cash flows and liquidity, satisfaction of the requirements for REIT qualification and other tax considerations, capital expenditure and other expense obligations, debt covenants, contractual prohibitions or other limitations and applicable law and such other matters as its Board may deem relevant from time to time. Among the factors that could impair INDUS\u2019s ability to make distributions to its stockholders are:\n\u25cf INDUS\u2019s inability to realize attractive returns on its investments;\n\u25cf unanticipated expenses that reduce INDUS\u2019s cash flow or non-cash earnings;\n\u25cf decreases in the value of the underlying assets; and\n\u25cf the fact that anticipated operating expense levels may not prove accurate, as actual results may vary from estimates.\nAs a result, it is possible that INDUS will not be able to continue to make distributions to its stockholders or that the level of any distributions INDUS does make to its stockholders will achieve a market yield or increase or even be maintained over time, any of which could materially and adversely affect the market price of INDUS shares of common stock. Distributions could be dilutive to INDUS\u2019s financial results and may constitute a return of capital to its investors, which would have the effect of reducing each stockholder\u2019s basis in its shares of common stock. INDUS also may need to borrow funds or use proceeds from the sale of assets to fund distributions.\nDividends payable by REITs, including INDUS, generally do not qualify for the reduced tax rates available for some dividends.\nThe maximum tax rate applicable to \u201cqualified dividend income\u201d payable to U.S. stockholders that are individuals, trusts and estates is 20%. Dividends payable by REITs, however, generally are not eligible for these reduced rates. Under the 2017 Tax Reform Act, however, U.S. stockholders that are individuals, trusts and estates generally may deduct up to 20% of the ordinary dividends (e.g., dividends not designated as capital gain dividends or qualified dividend income) received from a REIT for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2026. Although this deduction reduces the effective tax rate applicable to certain dividends paid by REITs (generally to 29.6% assuming the stockholder is subject to the 37% maximum rate), such tax rate is still higher than the tax rate applicable to corporate dividends that constitute qualified dividend income. Accordingly, investors who are individuals,\ntrusts and estates may perceive investments in REITs to be relatively less attractive than investments in the stocks of non-REIT corporations that pay dividends, which could adversely affect the value of the shares of REITs.\nLegislative or regulatory action affecting REITs could adversely affect INDUS or its stockholders.\nIn recent years, numerous legislative, judicial and administrative changes have been made to the federal income tax laws applicable to investments in REITs and similar entities. At any time, the federal income tax laws governing REITs or the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended. Changes to the tax laws, regulations and administrative interpretations, which may have retroactive application, could adversely affect INDUS and may impact our taxation or that of its stockholders. Accordingly, it is possible that any such change will significantly affect INDUS\u2019s ability to qualify for taxation as a REIT or the federal income tax consequences to INDUS of such qualification.\nU.S. federal tax reform legislation could affect REITs generally, the geographic markets in which INDUS operates, its stock and its results of operations, both positively and negatively in ways that are difficult to anticipate.\nAs a REIT, INDUS is generally not required to pay federal taxes otherwise applicable to regular corporations (except for income generated by INDUS\u2019s TRSs) if INDUS complies with the various tax regulations governing REITs. Stockholders, however, are generally required to pay taxes on REIT dividends. Tax reform legislation affects the way in which dividends paid on shares of our common stock are taxed and could impact INDUS\u2019s stock price or how stockholders and potential investors view an investment in REITs generally. In addition, while certain elements of tax reform legislation may not impact INDUS directly as a REIT, they could impact the geographic markets in which INDUS operates, particularly affecting tenants of INDUS\u2019s leased property and their corporate tax obligations, if any.\nRisks Related to INDUS\u2019s Common Stock\nIssuances or sales of INDUS\u2019s common stock or the perception that issuances or sales might occur could adversely affect the per share trading price of INDUS\u2019s common stock.\nINDUS\u2019s ability to develop and acquire properties in part depends on INDUS\u2019s access to capital, which may in the future include the issuance of common equity. INDUS\u2019s Board can authorize the issuance of additional securities without stockholder approval. Furthermore, INDUS intends to have an active a shelf registration statement on Form S-3 that will allow it to offer and sell securities from time to time in one or more public offerings, including shares of its common stock.\nThe issuance or sale of INDUS common stock, including under INDUS\u2019s shelf registration statement, in connection with future property, portfolio or business acquisitions, to repay indebtedness or for general corporate purposes, or the availability of shares for resale in the open market, could have an adverse effect on the per share trading price of INDUS\u2019s common stock and would be dilutive to existing stockholders.\nThe exercise of any options or the issuance of any common stock granted to certain directors, executive officers and other employees under INDUS\u2019s 2020 Incentive Award Plan or INDUS\u2019s 2009 Stock Option Plan or other equity incentive plan could also have an adverse effect on the per share trading price of its common stock and be dilutive to existing stockholders. The existence of such options could also adversely affect the terms upon which INDUS may be able to obtain additional capital through the sale of equity securities.\nFuture offerings of debt securities, which would be senior to INDUS common stock upon liquidation, and/or preferred stock, which may be senior to INDUS common stock for purposes of dividend distributions or upon liquidation, may adversely affect the per share trading price of its common stock.\nIn the future, INDUS may attempt to increase its capital resources by making offerings of debt or additional equity securities, including medium-term notes, senior or subordinated notes and classes or series of its preferred stock under its shelf registration statement or otherwise, including on a private placement basis. Upon liquidation, holders of INDUS debt securities and shares of INDUS preferred stock, and lenders with respect to other borrowings will be entitled to receive its available assets prior to distribution to the holders of its common stock. Additionally, any convertible or exchangeable securities that INDUS issues in the future may have rights, preferences and privileges more favorable than those of its common stock and may result in dilution to owners of its common stock. Holders of INDUS common stock are not entitled to preemptive rights or other protections against dilution. Any shares of INDUS preferred stock that are issued in the future under its shelf registration statement or otherwise, could have a preference on\nliquidating distributions or a preference on dividend payments that could limit INDUS\u2019s ability pay dividends to the holders of its common stock. Because INDUS\u2019s decision to issue securities in any future offering under its shelf registration statement or otherwise will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond its control, INDUS cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of its any such future offerings. Thus, INDUS\u2019s stockholders bear the risk of any such future offerings reducing the per share trading price of its common stock and diluting their interest in INDUS.\nMarket interest rates may have an effect on the per share trading price of INDUS\u2019s common stock.\nOne of the factors that influences the price of INDUS\u2019s common stock is the dividend yield on its common stock (as a percentage of the price of its common stock) relative to market interest rates. An increase in market interest rates, which are currently at low levels relative to historical rates, may lead prospective purchasers of INDUS\u2019s common stock to expect a higher dividend yield and higher interest rates would likely increase its borrowing costs and potentially decrease funds available for distribution. Thus, higher market interest rates could cause the market price of INDUS\u2019s common stock to decrease.\nINDUS\u2019s earnings and cash distributions will affect the market price of shares of its common stock.\nTo the extent that the market value of a REIT\u2019s equity securities is based primarily upon market perception of the REIT\u2019s growth potential and its current and potential future cash distributions, whether from operations, sales, acquisitions, development or refinancing and is secondarily based upon the value of the underlying assets, shares of INDUS\u2019s common stock may trade at prices that are higher or lower than the net asset value per share. To the extent INDUS retains operating cash flow for investment purposes, working capital reserves or other purposes rather than distributing the cash flow to stockholders, these retained funds, while increasing the value of INDUS\u2019s underlying assets, may negatively impact the market price of its common stock. INDUS\u2019s failure to meet market expectations with regard to future earnings and cash distributions would likely adversely affect the market price of its common stock.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nVolatility in the capital and credit markets could materially adversely impact INDUS.\nVolatility and disruption in the capital and credit markets could make it more difficult to borrow money. Market volatility could hinder INDUS\u2019s ability to obtain new debt financing or refinance maturing debt on favorable terms, or at all. Any financing or refinancing issues could have a material adverse effect on INDUS. Market turmoil and the tightening of credit could lead to an increased lack of consumer confidence and widespread reduction of business activity in general, which also could materially adversely impact INDUS, including its ability to acquire and dispose of assets on favorable terms, or at all.\nIf INDUS fails to maintain appropriate internal controls in the future, it may not be able to report its financial results accurately, which may adversely affect the per share trading price of its common stock and its business.\nINDUS\u2019s efforts to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, and the related regulations regarding its required assessment of internal control over financial reporting requires the commitment of significant financial and managerial resources. INDUS\u2019s system of internal controls may not prevent all errors, misstatements or misrepresentations, and it is possible that its internal control over financial reporting will not be effective in accomplishing all control objectives all of the time. Deficiencies, including any material weakness or significant deficiency, in INDUS\u2019s internal control over financial reporting that may occur in the future could result in misstatements of its results of operations, restatements of its financial statements and a decline in its stock price, or otherwise materially adversely affect INDUS\u2019s business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity.\nINDUS is subject to litigation that may adversely impact operating results.\nFrom time to time, INDUS may be a party to legal proceedings and claims arising in the ordinary course of business which could become significant. Given the inherent uncertainty of litigation, INDUS can offer no assurance\nthat a future adverse development related to existing litigation or any future litigation will not have a material adverse impact on its business, consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nThe market price and trading volume of INDUS\u2019s common stock may be volatile.\nThe trading volume in INDUS\u2019s common stock may fluctuate and cause significant price variations to occur. If the per share trading price of INDUS\u2019s common stock declines significantly, stockholders may be unable to resell their shares at or above the price paid for them. It is possible that the per share trading price of INDUS\u2019s common stock will fluctuate or decline significantly in the future.\nSome of the factors that could negatively affect INDUS\u2019s share price or result in fluctuations in the price or trading volume of its common stock include:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated variations in INDUS\u2019s quarterly operating results or dividends;\n\u2022\nchanges in INDUS\u2019s results of operations or cash flows;\n\u2022\npublication of research reports about INDUS or the real estate industry;\n\u2022\nprevailing interest rates;\n\u2022\nthe market for similar securities;\n\u2022\nlack of liquidity or low trading volume of INDUS common stock;\n\u2022\nchanges in market valuations of similar companies;\n\u2022\nadverse market reaction to any additional or future issuance of debt or equity INDUS incurs in the future;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key management personnel;\n\u2022\nactions by institutional stockholders;\n\u2022\nspeculation in the press or investment community;\n\u2022\nthe realization of any of the other risk factors presented in this Annual Report;\n\u2022\nthe extent of investor interest in INDUS\u2019s securities or attractiveness of INDUS\u2019s equity securities in comparison to other equity securities, including securities issued by other real estate-based companies;\n\u2022\nINDUS\u2019s underlying asset value;\n\u2022\ninvestor confidence in the stock and bond markets, generally;\n\u2022\nchanges in tax laws;\n\u2022\nfuture equity issuances; and\n\u2022\ngeneral market and economic conditions.\nIn the past, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in the price of their common stock. This type of litigation could result in substantial costs and divert INDUS\u2019s management\u2019s attention and resources, which could have an adverse effect on INDUS\u2019s financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and INDUS\u2019s ability to pay dividends on, and the per share trading price of, its common stock.", "PERMNO": 85982, "SIC": 6512, "TIC": "GRIF"}
