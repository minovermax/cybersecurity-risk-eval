{"cik": "1175505", "company": "FIVE PRIME THERAPEUTICS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-03-22", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nThis Annual Report contains forward-looking information based on our current expectations. Because our business is subject to many risks and our actual results may differ materially from any forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of us, this section includes a discussion of important factors that could affect our business, operating results, financial condition and the trading price of our common stock. You should carefully consider these risk factors, together with all of the other information included in this Annual Report as well as our other publicly available filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, or SEC. Such risks may be amplified by the COVID-19 pandemic and its potential impact on our business and the global economy.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Industry\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and efforts to reduce the spread of COVID-19, could adversely impact our business and operations, including our clinical trials.\nIn response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and in an effort to control the spread of COVID-19, state and local authorities continue to mandate travel and other restrictions and issue \u201cshelter-in-place\u201d and similar orders, which, among other things, direct individuals to shelter at their places of residence, direct businesses and governmental agencies to cease non-essential operations at physical locations, prohibit certain non-essential gatherings, and require cessation of non-essential travel. In response to these public health directives and orders, in March 2020, our entire workforce, other than those whose job responsibilities require them to be physically present at our offices, transitioned to working remotely, which we have continued through the date of this Annual Report. The effects of the government orders and directives, together with our remote working arrangements, may negatively impact productivity, disrupt our business, delay the progress of our clinical and preclinical programs, and exacerbate other risks to our business, including an increased risk of cybersecurity incidents and unauthorized dissemination of confidential or other sensitive information relating to us or third parties. Although certain restrictions have been or may be lifted or loosened in certain geographic areas, failure to contain the disease and the occurrence of further outbreaks of COVID-19 has required reinstatement of restrictions in certain parts of the United States and globally, and the extent to which these restrictions will remain in effect and the duration of these restrictions are uncertain. In addition, while certain vaccines against COVID-19 have received preliminary emergency use authorization for use by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, it is uncertain when vaccines will be widely available to the broader population and whether they will be widely adopted, which may further extend the duration of government restrictions. The magnitude of each of the risks to our business will depend, in part, on the duration and severity of the pandemic itself and the restrictions and other limitations on our ability to conduct our business in the ordinary course. These and other similar, and perhaps more severe, disruptions in our operations could result from the pandemic and may negatively impact our business, operating results and financial condition.\nGovernment orders and restrictions may also adversely impact the business operations of our collaborators, partners and service providers, including our CROs, that conduct most of the activities related to the conduct of our clinical trials and our CMOs that may produce our supply of drug product for use in our clinical trials and preclinical studies. If any of these third parties experience disruptions in their operations as a result of COVID-19, such as temporary facilities closures or suspension of services, the conduct of our clinical trials or preclinical studies could be delayed.\nWe do not currently expect that COVID-19 and the resulting government orders and restrictions will have a material impact on the supply of any of our product candidates or third-party drug products that may be used in our clinical trials or preclinical studies. However, if the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic persists and impacts our CMOs or other suppliers, or if the pandemic impacts essential distribution systems, we could experience disruptions to our supply chain and operations, and associated delays in the manufacturing and supply of our product candidates or third-party drug products, which would adversely impact our ability to conduct and complete our clinical trials and preclinical studies in accordance with our timelines or at all.\nIn addition, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may affect the initiation and conduct of our or our partners\u2019 current and planned clinical trials. Clinical site initiation may also be delayed due to prioritization of hospital resources toward the COVID-19 pandemic, and patients enrolled in our clinical trials may not be able to receive treatment in accordance with the relevant clinical trial protocol if, for example, quarantines impede patient movement or interrupt healthcare services. Similarly, COVID-19 may negatively impact our ability to recruit and retain patients for participation in our clinical trials, and principal investigators and clinical site staff who, as healthcare providers, may have heightened exposure to COVID-19, may be unable to participate in or continue participating in our clinical trials, each of which would adversely impact our clinical trials and our ability to conduct our trials in accordance with our timelines.\nAdditionally, ongoing clinical trials may be negatively affected by the COVID-19 pandemic if we or our partners experience delays in or are required to delay or pause various aspects of our trials, including site initiation, patient recruitment and enrollment, patient dosing, distribution of clinical trial materials, trial monitoring, data collection, cleaning and reporting, or data analysis, as a result of limitations in employee resources, access to clinical trial sites or otherwise. Even if we are able to collect clinical data throughout the duration of the pandemic, the quality, completeness or interpretability of that data may be negatively affected, including as a result of deviations from the clinical trial protocol, disruptions in patient screening or dosing or disruptions in patient evaluations. As a result, we may be unable to conduct and complete our ongoing and planned clinical trials in a timely manner or at all, which may increase our costs and prevent us from completing development of and obtaining approval for and commercializing our product candidates.\nThe extent of the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic on our business, including on our clinical and preclinical programs, and the value of and market for our common stock is highly uncertain and will depend on future developments that cannot be predicted with confidence at this time, such as the ultimate duration, spread and severity of the pandemic, travel restrictions, quarantines, social distancing and business closure requirements in the countries in which we and our collaborators, partners and service providers operate, including in the countries where we and our partners are conducting clinical trials, the effectiveness of actions taken globally to contain and treat the disease, including the widespread availability and adoption of safe and effective vaccines against COVID-19, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions resume. For example, if remote working arrangements for our business, or those of our partners or service providers, are extended for longer than we currently expect, we may need to reassess our priorities and our near- and longer-term corporate objectives. Accordingly, we do not yet know the full extent of potential delays or other effects on our business, healthcare systems or the global economy as a whole. However, these impacts, or any combination of them, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nIn addition, to the extent the COVID-19 pandemic adversely affects our business and results of operations, it may heighten the other risks and uncertainties described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nOur FIGHT trial evaluating the combination of bemarituzumab and mFOLFOX6 in patients with FGFR2b+, non-HER2+ gastric or GEJ cancer achieved all three efficacy endpoints. However, we will require substantial additional capital and resources to continue development of, seek regulatory approval for and commercialize bemarituzumab globally.\nAs discussed elsewhere in this Annual Report, in November 2020, we announced that all three primary and secondary endpoints in our global Phase 2 clinical trial evaluating bemarituzumab in combination with 5-fluorouracil, or 5-FU, leucovorin, and oxaliplatin, a standard of care chemotherapy regimen known as mFOLFOX6, as front-line treatment of patients with advanced FGFR2b+, non-HER2+ gastric or gastroesophageal junction, or GEJ, cancer, or the FIGHT trial, met pre-specified statistical significance (at a 2-sided alpha of 0.20) as compared to placebo in combination with mFOLFOX6.\nWe are evaluating pathways for further development and approval of bemarituzumab in combination with mFOLFOX6 as a potential treatment for FGFR2b+, non-HER2+ gastric or GEJ cancer and plan to advance discussions with regulatory authorities worldwide to determine next steps for the program. We plan to initiate a global Phase 3 clinical trial to further evaluate bemarituzumab in combination with mFOLFOX6 by the end of 2021. Based on the data observed in the FIGHT trial, we are also evaluating options for potential development of bemarituzumab in combination with standard of care chemotherapy and other therapeutic agents in other epithelial cancers that overexpress FGFR2b, including non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer and ovarian cancer. We will require substantial additional capital in order to further develop, seek regulatory approval for and commercialize bemarituzumab, which we may not be able to obtain on reasonable terms or at all. We may also be required to increase our workforce, potentially at a rapid pace, develop expertise in areas with which we may have limited experience, such as in sales and marketing, and obtain access to additional commercial manufacturing capabilities to which we do not currently have access. Our inability to achieve any of the foregoing or to otherwise successfully complete development of bemarituzumab may result in delays in, or prevent us from, obtaining approval for and commercializing bemarituzumab.\nIf clinical trials of our product candidates fail to demonstrate safety and efficacy to the satisfaction of regulatory authorities or do not otherwise produce meaningfully positive results, we may incur additional costs or experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of our product candidates.\nBefore obtaining marketing approval from regulatory authorities to sell our product candidates, we or our partners must conduct extensive clinical trials to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of such product candidates in humans. Clinical testing is expensive and difficult to design and implement, generally takes many years to complete and is uncertain as to outcome. A failure of one or more clinical trials can occur at any stage of testing. The outcome of preclinical studies and early clinical trials may not predict the success of later clinical trials and interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final results. A number of companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in later-stage clinical trials due to lack of efficacy or unacceptable safety profiles of their product candidates, notwithstanding promising results in earlier trials. Even though we have already generated results from certain preclinical studies and clinical trials of our product candidates, we do not know whether the clinical trials of our product candidates that we or our partners may conduct will demonstrate adequate efficacy and safety to result in regulatory approval to market any of these product candidates in any particular jurisdiction or jurisdictions. If later-stage clinical trials for one or more of our product candidates do not produce favorable results, we or our partners may be unable to obtain regulatory approval for such product candidates.\nDelays in clinical testing will delay the commercialization of our product candidates, increase our costs and harm our business.\nWe do not know whether any of our clinical trials will begin as and when planned, will need to be amended or restructured or will be completed on schedule, or at all. Our product development costs will increase if we experience delays in clinical testing. Significant clinical trial delays could also shorten any periods during which we may have the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidates or allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do, which would impair our ability to successfully commercialize our product candidates and may harm our business, results of operations and prospects. Events which may result in a delay in or unsuccessful completion of clinical development include:\n\u2022\nthe impact of public health epidemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic currently impacting countries worldwide;\n\u2022\ndelays in reaching an agreement with or failure to obtain authorization from the FDA or other comparable regulatory authorities and institutional review boards, or IRBs;\n\u2022\nimposition of a clinical hold following an inspection of our manufacturing or clinical trial operations, including clinical trial sites, by the FDA or other comparable regulatory authorities, or a decision by the FDA, other comparable regulatory authorities, IRBs or us, or a recommendation by a data safety monitoring board, to suspend or terminate a clinical trial at any time for safety or other reasons;\n\u2022\ndelays in reaching, or the inability to reach, agreement on acceptable terms with prospective CROs, clinical trial sites, laboratory service providers, companion diagnostic development partners, contract manufacturing organizations, or CMOs, and other service providers we may engage to support the conduct of our clinical trials or eventual commercialization of our products;\n\u2022\ndeviations from the clinical trial protocol by clinical trial sites or investigators or failure to conduct a clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements;\n\u2022\nfailure of third parties, such as CROs or other service providers, to satisfy their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines;\n\u2022\ndelays in the testing, validation and manufacturing of product candidates and the delivery of these product candidates to clinical trial sites;\n\u2022\nfor clinical trials testing combination treatment of our product candidates with third-party drug products, delays in procuring such third-party drug products and the delivery of such third-party drug products to clinical trial sites, or the inability to procure such third-party drug products at all;\n\u2022\nfor clinical trials in selected patient populations, delays in identifying and auditing central or other laboratories that develop or use assays to identify eligible patients for our clinical trials, delays in the validation of such assays or their transfer to such laboratories, or the failure of the clinical trial, as designed, to enroll the patient population necessary to meet the primary endpoints of such clinical trial;\n\u2022\nwith respect to patients in any of our clinical trials, delays in completing their participation in any such clinical trial or returning for post-treatment follow-up, or failure to complete such participation or return for such follow-up at all;\n\u2022\nthe occurrence of side effects, disease progression or other events requiring patients to drop out of before completing their participation in our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of one or more clinical trial sites from our clinical trials, including as a result of any investigator ceasing his or her affiliation with any such site, changes to any applicable standard of care or the ineligibility of any such site to participate in our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nadministrative actions or changes in government policies, laws or regulations affecting any aspect of the conduct of our clinical trials; or\n\u2022\nlack of adequate funding to continue our clinical trials.\nFor example, we have conducted and are in the process of completing the FIGHT trial in China in collaboration with Zai Lab (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., or Zai Lab. Zai Lab\u2019s ability to conduct the FIGHT trial and any future clinical trial of bemarituzumab in combination with mFOLFOX6 in China depends on Zai Lab\u2019s and our ability to comply with the government policies, laws and regulations applicable to conducting clinical trials in China. The government policies, laws and regulations in China are evolving rapidly, and changes to these policies, laws and regulations are difficult to predict. If any such government policies, laws or regulations in China evolve in a way that makes it more difficult or inefficient for us or Zai Lab to conduct the FIGHT trial or any such future clinical trial in China, we may experience delays in conducting such trials at clinical trial sites in China, which would delay our ability to obtain approval for and commercialize bemarituzumab.\nIn addition, in order to successfully conduct the FIGHT trial and any future clinical trial of bemarituzumab in combination with mFOLFOX6 in each country where the trial is taking place, we must obtain sufficient clinical supply of each component of mFOLFOX6 to administer the mFOLFOX6 regimen to patients in each such country. If we experience delays in obtaining or are unable to obtain sufficient supply of any component of the mFOLFOX6 regimen in any country, we may experience delays in conducting the FIGHT trial or any such future clinical trial at clinical trial sites in such country, which would delay our ability to obtain approval for and commercialize bemarituzumab.\nAdditionally, our and our partners\u2019 ability to successfully and timely complete our clinical trials requires that patients be treated with the relevant product candidate in accordance with the clinical trial protocol for the clinical trial testing such product candidate, including the specific dosing schedules and other timelines set forth in such protocol. The impact of public health epidemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic currently impacting countries worldwide, may delay or prevent patients from receiving treatment in accordance with the protocol and the required timelines, which could delay our clinical trials, or prevent us from completing our clinical trials at all, and harm our ability to obtain approval for such product candidate.\nIf we or our partners are unable to timely complete clinical development for any of our product candidates, we may incur additional costs and our ability to achieve development, regulatory, commercialization or sales milestones or to generate and receive royalties on product sales and product revenues for any such product candidate may be impaired.\nIf we or our partners are unable to timely enroll patients in our clinical trials, we will be unable to complete these trials on a timely basis.\nThe timely completion of clinical trials largely depends on the rate of patient enrollment. Many factors affect the rate of patient enrollment, including:\n\u2022\nthe impact of public health epidemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic currently impacting countries worldwide;\n\u2022\nthe size and nature of the patient population;\n\u2022\nthe number and location of clinical trial sites;\n\u2022\ncompetition with other companies for clinical trial sites or patients;\n\u2022\nthe eligibility and exclusion criteria for the clinical trial;\n\u2022\nfor clinical trials in selected patient populations, the ability and time required to properly identify for inclusion in the clinical trial the population of patients we seek to enroll;\n\u2022\nthe design of the clinical trial;\n\u2022\nthe ability to obtain and maintain patient consents;\n\u2022\nthe failure of enrolled patients to complete their participation in the trial; and\n\u2022\nclinicians\u2019 and patients\u2019 perceptions as to the potential advantages of the product candidate being studied in relation to other available therapies, including any new drugs that may be approved for the indications we are investigating.\nWe currently face and will continue to face significant competition in recruiting patients for our and our partners\u2019 current and future clinical trials, and we or our partners may be unable to timely enroll the patients necessary to complete clinical trials on a timely basis or at all.\nIn addition, enrollment in and the conduct of our clinical trials may be affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. For example, clinical site initiation and patient enrollment may be delayed due to prioritization of hospital resources towards the COVID-19 pandemic, and patients enrolled in our clinical trials may not be able to receive treatment in accordance with the relevant clinical trial protocol if, for example, quarantines impede patient movement or interrupt healthcare services. Similarly, COVID-19 may negatively impact our ability to recruit and retain patients for participation in our clinical trials, and principal investigators and clinical site staff who, as healthcare providers, may have heightened risk of exposure to COVID-19, may be unable or unwilling to participate in or continue participating in our clinical trials. Additionally, we may experience interruption of key clinical trial activities, such as clinical trial site monitoring and data collection, cleaning, reporting and analysis, due to limitations on travel, quarantines or social distancing protocols imposed or recommended by federal, state or local authorities, employers and others in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, including reduced access to clinical trial sites resulting from such restrictions. As a result, we may face delays in meeting our anticipated timelines for our ongoing and planned clinical trials.\nWe may not successfully develop or commercialize our current or future product candidates, which may force us to terminate our development efforts for one or more programs.\nThe success of our business depends primarily upon our ability to develop and commercialize protein therapeutics. We currently have three late-stage research and preclinical programs, including FPA157, that arose from our work with our in-house discovery capabilities and validation and protein therapeutic generation and engineering capabilities, which we eliminated in 2019. In addition, we plan to supplement our ongoing development pipeline from time to time by selectively acquiring or licensing, on an exclusive basis, rights to product candidates from biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies.\nOur efforts to preclinically develop potential new protein therapeutic candidates may initially show promise, yet fail to yield product candidates for clinical development or candidates that we successfully clinically develop and ultimately commercialize for numerous reasons, including the following:\n\u2022\nour research methodology may not successfully identify potential product candidates;\n\u2022\nour product candidates may yield unexpected results in research or preclinical studies that make such product candidates unsuitable for further development;\n\u2022\nproduct manufacturing difficulties may limit product yield or produce undesirable product characteristics that may increase our costs, cause delays or make our product candidates unmarketable;\n\u2022\nthird parties on whom we may rely to generate antibody or other product candidates may fail to produce candidates that we can successfully validate or that have the characteristics necessary to become marketable product candidates;\n\u2022\nwe may design one or more of our clinical trials in a way that makes it difficult or impossible to meet the primary endpoints of such trial, which could make further clinical development of the applicable product candidate infeasible, even if that product candidate proves to be efficacious;\n\u2022\nour product candidates may cause adverse effects in patients, even after successful initial toxicology studies or early-stage clinical trials, which may make our product candidates unsuitable for approval or otherwise unmarketable;\n\u2022\nour product candidates may have unacceptable safety profiles or otherwise fail to provide a meaningful benefit to patients; or\n\u2022\nour collaboration partners may change their development profiles or plans for our partnered product candidates or abandon a therapeutic area for or the development of a partnered product candidate.\nThe occurrence of any of these events may force us to abandon our development efforts for one or more programs, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and prospects and could potentially require us to cease operations.\nIf we are unable to advance our late-stage research or preclinical programs and any future product candidates into and through clinical development, or if we experience significant delays in doing so, our business may be materially harmed.\nOur ability to generate product revenues, which we do not expect to occur for many years, if ever, will depend heavily on our and our partners\u2019 ability to successfully advance our late-stage research or preclinical programs, including FPA157, and any future product candidates into and through clinical development. The outcome of preclinical studies of any of our future product candidates may not predict the success of such product candidates in clinical trials. Moreover, preclinical results regarding a product candidate are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses and may not translate into similar results when the product candidate is tested clinically in humans. Many companies have believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical and early clinical studies, but such product candidates have nonetheless failed during clinical development. Our inability to successfully complete preclinical or clinical development of any of our future product candidates could cause us to incur additional costs, delay or prevent our ability to advance these product candidates into clinical development or commercialization, or impair our ability to receive development, regulatory, commercialization or sales milestone payments from our current or future collaboration partners or to generate and receive royalties on product sales or product revenues from our current or future collaboration partners.\nWe and our product candidates are subject to a multitude of manufacturing risks, the occurrence of any of which could substantially increase our costs and limit supply of such product candidates.\nThe process of manufacturing our product candidates is complex and subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u2022\nThe biologics manufacturing process is susceptible to product loss due to contamination, equipment failure, improper installation or operation of equipment or vendor or operator error leading to manufacturing process deviations. Even minor deviations from specified manufacturing processes could result in reduced production yields, product defects and other supply disruptions. If microbial, viral or other contaminations are discovered in our products or in the manufacturing facilities in which our products are made, such manufacturing facilities may need to be closed for an extended time to investigate and remediate the contamination.\n\u2022\nThe manufacturing facilities in which our products are made, and their ability to successfully and timely manufacture our products, could be adversely affected by equipment failures, labor and raw material shortages, natural disasters, power failures and numerous other factors.\n\u2022\nAny adverse developments affecting manufacturing operations for our products may result in shipment delays, inventory shortages, lot failures, product withdrawals or recalls, or other interruptions in the supply of our products to clinical trial sites. If any of our products fail to meet specifications, we may also have to take inventory write-offs and incur other charges and expenses or undertake costly remediation efforts or seek more expensive manufacturing alternatives.\nCertain raw materials necessary for the manufacture of our products, such as growth media, resins and filters, are sourced from a single supplier. We do not have agreements in place that guarantee our supply or the price of these raw materials. Any significant delay in the acquisition, decrease in the availability or increase in the price of these raw materials could considerably delay the manufacture of our product candidates, which could adversely impact the timing of any planned clinical trials or the regulatory approval of those product candidates.\nWe currently have process development capabilities. Historically, we generally performed cell line and process development for our product candidates and manufactured quantities of our product candidates necessary to conduct preclinical studies of those product candidates. We are increasingly relying on third-party service providers with respect to cell line and process development activities, as well as the manufacturing of quantities of our product candidates for use in preclinical studies. We do not have, and we do not have current plans to acquire or develop, the facilities or capabilities to manufacture bulk drug substance or filled drug product for use in human clinical trials or commercialization. We rely on third-party manufacturers to produce bulk drug substance required for our clinical trials and expect to continue to rely on third parties to manufacture drug supplies for our clinical trials, as well as any commercial drug product for any of our product candidates that may receive regulatory approval, for the foreseeable future. We also contract with additional third parties for the filling, labeling, packaging, storage and distribution of investigational drug products.\nWe have not contracted with alternate suppliers in the event that our third-party manufacturers or other third parties on whom we rely to provide us with clinical trial drug supplies are unable to scale production, including for larger clinical trials or commercial-scale production, or if we otherwise experience any problems with these manufacturers or other third parties. For example, public health epidemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic currently impacting countries worldwide, may impact the ability of our existing or future manufacturers to perform their obligations under our manufacturing agreements with such parties. Any problems we experience with our current manufacturers or these third parties could delay the manufacturing of our product candidates or the progress of our clinical trials or preclinical studies, or the ultimate successful commercialization of any products for which we receive regulatory approval, which could increase our costs and harm our results of operations. In addition, if we are unable to arrange for alternative third-party manufacturing sources, or are unable to do so on commercially reasonable terms or in a timely manner, the development and potential commercialization of our product candidates may be delayed.\nOur reliance on third-party manufacturers subjects us to risks to which we would not be subject if we manufactured product candidates internally, including potential failure of any such third party to abide by regulatory and quality assurance requirements, breach of the manufacturing agreement by such third party due to factors beyond our control (including the third party\u2019s failure to manufacture our product candidates or any products we may eventually commercialize in accordance with our specifications) and termination of or a decision not to renew such agreement by such third party, based on its own business priorities, at a time when finding and retaining a replacement manufacturer may be costly or damaging to our business.\nThe regulatory approval processes of the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities are lengthy, time-consuming and inherently unpredictable. Failure to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates would substantially harm our business.\nThe FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities extensively and rigorously regulate and evaluate the manufacture, testing, distribution, advertising and marketing of drug products prior to granting marketing approvals with respect to such products. This approval process generally requires, at minimum, testing of any product candidate in preclinical studies and clinical trials to establish its safety and effectiveness, and confirmation by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities that any such product candidate, and any parties involved in its manufacturing, testing and development, complied with current Good Manufacturing Practices, or GMP, current Good Laboratory Practices, or GLP, and current Good Clinical Practices, or GCP, regulations, standards and guidelines during such manufacturing, testing and development. The time required to obtain approval to market a product candidate from the FDA or any comparable foreign regulatory authority is unpredictable, but typically takes many years following the commencement of clinical trials and depends on numerous factors, including the conduct of manufacturing, testing and development activities with respect to such product candidate and the substantial discretion of the applicable regulatory authorities. In addition, approval policies, regulations, or the type or amount of preclinical and clinical data necessary to obtain approval may change over the course of a product candidate\u2019s development and may vary across jurisdictions. We have not obtained regulatory approval for any of our product candidates and it is possible that none of our existing or potential future product candidates will ever obtain regulatory approval.\nAny of our product candidates could fail to receive regulatory approval from the FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority for many reasons, including:\n\u2022\nthe FDA\u2019s or such comparable foreign regulatory authority\u2019s disagreement with the design or implementation of our clinical trials testing any such product candidate;\n\u2022\nour failure to demonstrate that a product candidate is effective for its proposed indication and has an acceptable safety profile;\n\u2022\nour failure to demonstrate that a product candidate\u2019s clinical and other benefits outweigh its safety risks;\n\u2022\nthe failure of our clinical trial data for a product candidate to meet the level of statistical significance required for regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nthe FDA\u2019s or such comparable foreign regulatory authority\u2019s disagreement with our interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials testing a product candidate;\n\u2022\nthe insufficiency of our clinical trial data for a product candidate to support the submission and filing of a Biologic License Application or other regulatory submission or to obtain regulatory approval for such product candidate;\n\u2022\nour failure to obtain approval from the FDA or such comparable foreign regulatory authority for the manufacturing or testing processes or facilities of CMOs or CROs with whom we contract for clinical and commercial product supply or preclinical or clinical testing; or\n\u2022\nchanges in the applicable standard of care or the FDA\u2019s or such comparable foreign regulatory authority\u2019s approval policies or regulations that render our preclinical and clinical data for a product candidate insufficient for regulatory approval.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could cause delays in the timing of our interactions with the FDA or other regulatory authorities, including due to absenteeism by governmental employees or the diversion of regulatory authority efforts and attention to other activities related to COVID-19, which could delay or limit our ability to make planned regulatory submissions or otherwise progress our programs in accordance with our timelines, and delay or limit our ability to obtain approval for and commercialize our product candidates.\nThe FDA or a comparable foreign regulatory authority may require additional information, including preclinical or clinical data, to support approval of a product candidate, which may delay or prevent approval and our commercialization plans, or result in our decision to abandon the development program with respect to such product candidate. In addition, if we were to obtain approval for any of our product candidates, regulatory authorities may approve any such product candidate for fewer or more limited indications than we request, may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly post-marketing clinical trials or establishment of risk evaluation and mitigation strategy, or REMS, drug safety programs, or may approve a product candidate with a label that does not include the labeling claims necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of that product candidate.\nOur product candidates may cause undesirable side effects that could delay or prevent their regulatory approval, limit their commercial profiles, if approved, or result in significant negative consequences following any marketing approval.\nOur product candidates may cause undesirable side effects in patients, which could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in a more restrictive label or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities or otherwise limit the commercial potential of any such product candidate. Our clinical trial results could reveal an unacceptable severity or prevalence of side effects. If this were to occur, we may elect to suspend or terminate our clinical trials or the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities could order us to cease our clinical trials or deny approval of our product candidates for any or all targeted indications. Drug-related side effects could negatively affect patient recruitment for our clinical trials, cause enrolled patients to drop out of a clinical trial and result in product liability claims. Any of these occurrences may significantly harm our business, financial condition and prospects.\nAdditionally, if one or more of our product candidates receives marketing approval, and we or others later identify undesirable side effects caused by any such product, numerous potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:\n\u2022\nwe may suspend marketing of, or withdraw or recall, such product;\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may withdraw approvals of such product;\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may require additional warnings on the label for such product;\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may issue safety alerts, Dear Healthcare Provider letters, press releases or other communications containing warnings about such product;\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may require the establishment or modification of a REMS or a similar program that may, for instance, restrict distribution of such product and impose burdensome implementation requirements on us;\n\u2022\nregulatory authorities may require that we conduct post-marketing studies;\n\u2022\nwe could be sued and held liable for harm caused to patients; and\n\u2022\nour reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us from achieving or maintaining marketing approval for or acceptance of a product candidate or otherwise materially harm the commercial prospects for such product, if approved, and could significantly harm our business, results of operations and prospects.\nCertain of our product candidates, including bemarituzumab, are expected to be effective only in certain selected patient populations. If we are unable to successfully develop and obtain FDA approval for companion diagnostics for these product candidates, or experience significant delays in doing so, we may not obtain marketing approval for such product candidates or realize their full commercial potential.\nCertain of our current product candidates, including bemarituzumab, may be effective only in selected patient populations. For any such product candidate, we expect that the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require the development and regulatory approval of at least one companion diagnostic as a condition to approving such product candidate for use in patients within the selected patient population. We do not have experience in or capabilities for developing or commercializing companion diagnostics and have depended and will continue to depend on the sustained cooperation and effort of our third-party diagnostic development collaborators to perform these functions.\nFor example, we are developing bemarituzumab to treat epithelial cancers that overexpress FGFR2b. We have developed, in collaboration with a third-party companion diagnostic development partner, an IHC-based assay to identify patients with FGFR2b+ gastric and GEJ cancer who would be most likely to benefit from treatment with bemarituzumab. We plan to conduct additional work with our third-party companion diagnostic development partner to adapt this IHC-based assay to identify FGFR2b overexpression in other epithelial cancers such as non-small cell lung, breast and ovarian cancers to support our clinical development of bemarituzumab to treat FGFR2b+ epithelial cancers.\nCompanion diagnostics are subject to regulation by the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities as medical devices and may require separate regulatory approval prior to commercialization. For any companion diagnostic that we develop for use with one of our product candidates, we or our collaboration partners may experience delays in obtaining or may fail to obtain regulatory approval for such companion diagnostic, which could delay its development and harm our business. If we or our collaboration partners are unable to obtain necessary regulatory approvals for our companion diagnostics, including for bemarituzumab, or experience delays in doing so, we may suffer significant negative consequences, including:\n\u2022\nthe applicable product candidate may not receive marketing approval if it\u2019s safe and effective use depends on use of a companion diagnostic; or\n\u2022\nwe may not realize the full commercial potential of the applicable product candidate if, among other reasons, we are unable to appropriately identify patients that are likely to respond to treatment with such product candidate.\nThe occurrence of any of these events would harm our business, possibly materially.\nEven if our product candidates receive regulatory approval, they may face future development and regulatory difficulties, which may prevent us from commercializing our products and generating revenue.\nEven if we obtain regulatory approval for a product candidate in a particular jurisdiction, the product would be subject to ongoing requirements by the FDA or applicable comparable foreign regulatory authorities governing the manufacture, quality control, further development, labeling, packaging, storage, distribution, safety surveillance, import, export, advertising, promotion, recordkeeping and reporting of safety and other post-market information of or with respect to such product. The FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities will continue to closely monitor the safety profile of any product after approval. If the FDA or any comparable foreign regulatory authority becomes aware of new safety information after approval of any of our product candidates, it may require labeling changes or establishment of a REMS or similar program, impose significant restrictions on the product\u2019s indicated uses or marketing, or impose ongoing requirements for costly post-approval studies or post-market surveillance.\nIn addition, drug product manufacturers and their facilities are subject to continual review and periodic inspections by the FDA and other regulatory authorities to evaluate compliance with GMP and GLP regulations, standards and guidelines. If we or a regulatory authority discover previously unknown problems with one of our product candidates, such as side effects or adverse events of unanticipated severity or frequency, or problems with the facility where such product candidate is manufactured, a regulatory authority may impose restrictions on that product, the manufacturing facility or us, including requiring recall or withdrawal of such product from the market or suspension of manufacturing. If we, our product candidates or the manufacturing facilities for our product candidates fail to comply with applicable regulatory requirements, a regulatory authority may:\n\u2022\nissue warning letters or untitled letters;\n\u2022\nmandate modifications to promotional materials or require us to provide corrective information to healthcare practitioners;\n\u2022\nrequire us to enter into a consent decree, which may require payment of various monetary fines and reimbursement for inspection costs, impose due dates for specific actions by us, and impose penalties for non-compliance;\n\u2022\nseek an injunction or bring other court action to impose civil or criminal penalties or monetary fines;\n\u2022\nsuspend or withdraw regulatory approval for our product candidates;\n\u2022\nsuspend any ongoing clinical trials of our product candidates;\n\u2022\nrefuse to approve pending applications or supplements to applications that we have filed with respect to our product candidates;\n\u2022\nsuspend or impose restrictions on our or our manufacturing facilities\u2019 operations, including costly new manufacturing requirements; or\n\u2022\nseize or detain products, refuse to permit the import or export of products, or require us to initiate a product recall.\nThe occurrence of any event or penalty described above may limit or prevent our ability to commercialize our products and generate revenue.\nAdvertising and promotion of any product candidate that obtains approval in the United States will be heavily scrutinized by the FDA, the Department of Justice, the Department of Health and Human Services\u2019 Office of Inspector General, state attorneys general, members of Congress and the public. While doctors may prescribe products for off-label uses as the FDA and other regulatory agencies do not regulate a doctor\u2019s choice of drug treatment made in the doctor\u2019s independent medical judgment, they do restrict promotional communications from companies or their sales force with respect to off-label uses of products for which marketing clearance has not been issued. Companies may only share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with a product\u2019s FDA-approved labeling. Violations of applicable laws and regulations, including promotion of our products for unapproved or off-label uses, may subject us to enforcement letters, inquiries, investigations and civil and criminal sanctions by the government. Similarly, comparable foreign regulatory authorities will heavily scrutinize advertising and promotion of any product candidate that obtains approval outside of the United States.\nIn the United States, engaging in the impermissible promotion of products for off-label uses can also subject a company to false claims litigation under federal and state statutes, which can lead to civil and criminal penalties and fines and agreements that materially restrict the manner in which such company promotes or distributes drug products. These false claims statutes include the federal False Claims Act, which allows any individual to bring a lawsuit against a pharmaceutical company on behalf of the federal government alleging submission of false or fraudulent claims or that such company caused another entity or individual to present such false or fraudulent claims for payment by a federal program such as Medicare or Medicaid. If the government prevails in the lawsuit, the individual will receive a portion of any fines or settlement funds. Since 2004, False Claims Act lawsuits against pharmaceutical companies have increased significantly in volume and breadth, leading to several substantial civil and criminal settlements involving fines exceeding $1.0 billion based on certain sales practices promoting off-label drug uses. This growth in litigation has increased the risk that a pharmaceutical company will have to defend against false claims actions, pay settlement fines or restitution, agree to comply with burdensome reporting and compliance obligations and be excluded from Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs. If we do not lawfully promote any of our products that may receive marketing approval, we may become subject to such litigation and our inability to successfully defend the company in such litigation may material adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe policies of the FDA or any comparable foreign regulatory authority may change, and additional government regulations may be enacted that could prevent, limit or delay regulatory approval of our product candidates. If we are slow or unable to adapt to changes in existing requirements or policies or new requirements or policies that may be adopted, or if we are not able to maintain regulatory compliance, we may lose any marketing approval that we may have obtained, which would adversely affect our business, prospects and ability to achieve or sustain profitability.\nOur failure to obtain regulatory approval in international jurisdictions would prevent us from marketing our product candidates outside the United States.\nIn order to market and sell our products in other jurisdictions, we or our collaboration partners must obtain separate marketing approvals and comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements in those jurisdictions. The approval procedures vary among countries and can involve additional testing. The time required to obtain approval outside of the United States may differ substantially from that required to obtain FDA approval. The regulatory approval processes outside the United States generally include all the risks associated with obtaining FDA approval and may include additional risks that we cannot predict. In addition, in many countries outside the United States, we or our collaboration partners must secure product reimbursement approvals before regulatory authorities will approve a product for sale in that country. Obtaining foreign regulatory approvals and compliance with foreign regulatory requirements could result in significant difficulties and costs for us and could delay or prevent the introduction of our products in certain countries. We may not obtain foreign regulatory approvals for our product candidates on a timely basis, if at all.\nWe are conducting certain of our clinical trials in countries outside of the United States and will need to obtain marketing approval for our product candidates in each such country before we can sell our products there. For example, we have conducted and are in the process of completing the FIGHT trial in China in collaboration with Zai Lab and are relying on Zai Lab\u2019s ability to obtain approval for bemarituzumab in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau, or collectively, Greater China, from the China Food and Drug Administration. However, Zai Lab\u2019s ability to obtain approval in Greater China depends on Zai Lab\u2019s and our ability to comply with the government policies, laws and regulations applicable to conducting clinical trials and obtaining approval for and commercializing drug products in Greater China. The government policies, laws and regulations in China are evolving rapidly and future changes are difficult to predict. If any such government policies, laws or regulations evolve in a way that make it more difficult or inefficient for Zai Lab or us to clinically develop, obtain approval for or commercialize bemarituzumab in China, the conduct of the FIGHT trial or any future clinical trials of bemarituzumab in combination with mFOLFOX6 may be delayed, which will delay our ability to obtain approval for and commercialize bemarituzumab.\nFurther, data and results from clinical trials conducted in one country may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other countries, and regulatory approval in one country or by one regulatory authority outside the United States does not ensure approval by regulatory authorities in any other country or jurisdiction or by the FDA, while a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval for any of our product candidates in one country or by one regulatory authority may have a negative effect on the regulatory approval process in other countries or jurisdictions and may significantly diminish the commercial prospects of that product candidate, which may cause our business prospects to decline. Also, regulatory approval for any of our product candidates may be withdrawn in any country or jurisdiction. If we fail to comply with the regulatory requirements in international jurisdictions, we may not receive the necessary marketing approvals for our product candidates in these jurisdictions, our target market for these product candidates will be reduced, we may be unable to realize the full market potential of these product candidates and our business will be adversely affected.\nThe withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the EU, commonly referred to as Brexit, may adversely impact our ability to obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates in the United Kingdom or the EU, result in restrictions or imposition of taxes and duties for importing our product candidates into the United Kingdom or the EU and may require us to incur additional expenses in order to develop, manufacture and commercialize our product candidates in the United Kingdom or the EU.\nFollowing the result of a referendum in 2016, the United Kingdom left the European Union, or EU, on January 31, 2020, an event commonly referred to as Brexit. Pursuant to the formal withdrawal arrangements agreed between the United Kingdom and the EU, the United Kingdom was subject to a transition period until December 31, 2020, or the Transition Period, during which EU rules continued to apply. A trade and cooperation agreement, or the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, which outlines the future trading relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union, was agreed upon in December 2020.\nSince a significant proportion of the regulatory framework in the United Kingdom applicable to our business and our product candidates is derived from EU directives and regulations, Brexit has had, and may continue to have, a material impact on the regulatory regime with respect to the development, manufacture, importation, approval and commercialization of our product candidates in the United Kingdom and the EU. For example, Great Britain is no longer be covered by the centralized procedures for obtaining EU-wide marketing authorization from the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, and a separate marketing authorization will be required to market our product candidates in Great Britain. It is currently unclear whether the Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, is sufficiently prepared to handle the increased volume of marketing authorization applications that it is likely to receive. Any delay in obtaining, or inability to obtain, any marketing approvals, as a result of Brexit or otherwise, would result in delays in or prevent us from commercializing our product candidates in the United Kingdom or the EU and restrict our ability to generate revenue and achieve or sustain profitability. If we are forced to restrict or delay efforts to seek regulatory approval in the United Kingdom or the EU for our product candidates, we may have to incur significant additional expenses to operate our business, which could significantly and materially harm or delay our ability to generate revenues or achieve or sustain profitability.\nWhile the Trade and Cooperation Agreement provides for the tariff-free trade of medicinal products between the United Kingdom and the EU, there may be additional non-tariff costs to such trade which did not exist prior to the end of the Transition Period. Further, should the United Kingdom diverge from the EU from a regulatory perspective with respect to medicinal products, tariffs could be put into place in the future. We could, therefore, both now and in the future, face significant additional expenses (when compared to the position prior to the end of the Transition Period) in the operation of our business, which could significantly and materially harm or delay our ability to generate revenues or achieve or sustain profitability. Any further changes in international trade, tariff and import/export regulations as a result of Brexit or otherwise may subject us to unexpected duty costs or other non-tariff barriers. These developments, or the perception that any of them could occur, may significantly reduce global trade and, in particular, trade between the impacted nations and the United Kingdom.\nIn addition, Brexit may influence the attractiveness of the United Kingdom as a place to conduct clinical trials. The EU\u2019s regulatory environment for clinical trials is being harmonized as part of the Clinical Trial Regulations, which are due to enter into full effect at the end of 2021, but it is currently unclear to what extent the United Kingdom will seek to align its regulations with those of the EU. Failure of the United Kingdom to closely align its regulations with those of the EU may affect the cost of conducting clinical trials in the United Kingdom as compared to other countries or make it harder to seek marketing authorization for our product candidates based on clinical trials conducted in the United Kingdom. In the short term, there will be few changes to clinical trials that only have sites in the United Kingdom. The MHRA has confirmed that the sponsor of a clinical trial can be based in the European Economic Area, or EEA, for an initial period following the Transition Period. Further investigational medicinal products can be supplied directly from the EU/EEA to a clinical trial site in Great Britain without further oversight until January 1, 2022, and to Northern Ireland beyond such date. The United Kingdom is now a \u201cthird country\u201d for the purpose of clinical trials that have sites in the EEA. For such clinical trials, the sponsor/legal representative must be based in the EEA, and the trial must be registered on the EU Clinical Trials Register (including data from clinical trial sites outside of the EEA).\nWe face substantial competition from third parties that may develop or commercialize products before or more successfully than we do.\nThe biotechnology industry is intensely competitive and subject to rapid and significant technological change. We face worldwide competition from major pharmaceutical companies, specialty pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology companies with respect to our current product candidates and will face such competition with respect to our future product candidates. Many of our competitors have significantly greater financial, technical and human resources than we do. Smaller and early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through their collaborative arrangements with large and established companies.\nOur competitors may obtain regulatory approval for their products more rapidly than we do or may obtain patent protection or other intellectual property rights that limit our ability to develop or commercialize our product candidates or otherwise effectively compete in the markets for our product candidates. Our competitors may also develop, acquire or license on an exclusive basis products that are more effective, more convenient, more widely accepted or less costly or have better safety profiles than our product candidates and may also be more successful in manufacturing and marketing such products than we are with respect to our product candidates. In addition, if third parties obtain regulatory approval for their products before we do, such products may change the treatment landscape for our product candidates and affect our ability to successfully launch and commercialize any products for which we receive regulatory approval.\nWe also currently and will in the future compete with other companies in recruiting and retaining qualified personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and enrolling patients in clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, our research and development programs.\nIn addition, we plan to supplement our ongoing development pipeline from time to time by selectively acquiring or licensing, on an exclusive basis, rights to develop product candidates from biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. We continue to evaluate for potential acquisition or licensing assets that are IND-ready or in early clinical development and that we can leverage our in-house development capabilities to develop to data read-outs in the near- to medium-term. Our primary focus remains on oncology therapeutics. The acquisition and licensing of pharmaceutical product candidates is very competitive, and we expect to compete with third parties seeking to acquire or license product candidates in which we are interested, including more established companies that have strategies to license or acquire products and may have competitive advantages over us, as well as other emerging companies that take similar or different approaches to product acquisitions and licensing.\nAlthough there are no approved therapies that specifically target the signaling pathways that our current product candidates are designed to modulate or inhibit, there are numerous drugs that are currently approved to treat the same diseases or indications for which our current product candidates may be useful and many of these currently-approved therapies act through mechanisms similar to those of our current product candidates. Many of these approved drugs are well-established therapies or products, or are in well-established classes of drugs, and are widely accepted by physicians, patients and third-party payors. Approved drugs with which our products may compete may include branded drugs that may be subject to patent protection and generic drugs, each of which may offer key differentiators based on efficacy, safety or available coverage and reimbursement. Insurers and other third-party payors may also encourage the use of generic products or specific branded products. We expect that if our product candidates are approved, they will be priced at a significant premium over competitive generic, including branded generic, products. This may make it difficult for us to differentiate our products from currently-approved therapies, which may adversely impact our business strategy. In addition, many companies are developing new therapeutics and we cannot predict if and how the applicable standards of care will change as our product candidates progress through clinical development.\nIf bemarituzumab in combination with mFOLFOX6 were approved for the treatment of previously untreated, advanced FGFR2b+/HER2- gastric or GEJ cancer, it could face competition from currently-approved and marketed products, including chemotherapeutic agents, such as 5-fluorouracil, S-1, capecitabine, doxorubicin, cisplatin, epirubicin, oxaliplatin, leucovorin, carboplatin, paclitaxel, irinotecan, docetaxel, including combination regimens involving the foregoing, such as mFOLFOX6 and EOX, as well as antibodies that bind to PD1/PD-L1, including Bristol-Myers Squibb Company, or BMS/Ono Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.\u2019s, or Ono, Opdivo monotherapy, Opdivo in combination with BMS/Ono\u2019s Yervoy\u00ae (ipilimumab) anti-CTLA-4 antibody or Opdivo in combination with chemotherapy, Merck & Co., Inc.\u2019s Keytruda\u00ae (pembrolizumab) anti-PD1 antibody, alone or in combination with chemotherapy, AstraZeneca UK Limited, or AstraZeneca/MedImmune, LLC\u2019s, or MedImmune, Imfinzi\u00ae (durvalumab) anti-PD-L1 antibody in combination with AstraZeneca/MedImmune\u2019s tremelimumab anti-CTLA4 antibody, BeiGene Ltd.\u2019s tislelizumab anti-PD1 antibody, Innovent Biologics Inc./Eli Lilly and Company\u2019s Tyvyt\u00ae (sintilimab) anti-PD1 antibody, Incyte Corporation/MacroGenics, Inc./Zai Lab\u2019s retifanlimab (INCMGA0012) anti-PD1 antibody, and Jiangsu Hengrui Medicine Co., Ltd.\u2019s AiRuiKa\u2122 (camrelizumab, SHR-1210) anti-PD1 antibody, Elevar Therapeutics, Inc./Jiangsu Hengrui Medicine Co., Ltd.\u2019s rivoceranib (ex-China)/apatinib (China) small molecule targeting VEGFR2 and Astellas Pharma Inc.\u2019s zolbetuximab anti-Claudin 18.2 antibody in combination with chemotherapy. It is possible bemarituzumab will be used in combination with or be adjunctive to one or more of these therapies and potential therapies, or that bemarituzumab will be used at different stages of the treatment regimen or disease progression.\nWe believe that our ability to successfully compete will depend on, among other things:\n\u2022\nthe efficacy and safety profile of our product candidates, including relative to marketed products, including the standard of care therapies for diseases or indications for which we are developing our product candidates, and product candidates undergoing development by third parties;\n\u2022\nthe time it takes for our product candidates to complete clinical development and receive marketing approval, including our ability to take advantage of any expedited regulatory or approval pathways;\n\u2022\nour and our partners\u2019 ability to successfully launch and commercialize any of our product candidates that receive regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nour and our partners\u2019 ability to manufacture commercial quantities of any of our product candidates that receive regulatory approval, including in sufficient amounts to meet the market demand;\n\u2022\nthe price of our products, including in comparison to branded or generic competitors;\n\u2022\nthe availability of coverage and reimbursement levels under private and governmental health insurance plans, including Medicare, that enable patients to access any of our product candidates that receive regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nacceptance of any of our product candidates that receive regulatory approval by patients and physicians and other healthcare providers; and\n\u2022\nour ability to establish, maintain and protect intellectual property rights related to our product candidates.\nOur product candidates may not achieve the level of market acceptance among physicians, patients, healthcare payors and others in the medical community necessary for commercial success.\nEven if our product candidates receive regulatory approval, they may not gain the level of market acceptance among physicians, patients, healthcare payors and others in the medical community necessary for commercial success. Whether and the extent to which our product candidates achieve commercial success will also depend on coverage of and adequate reimbursement for these product candidates by third-party payors, including government payors, which may be difficult or time-consuming to obtain, may be limited in scope and may not be available or otherwise obtained in all jurisdictions in which we may seek to market our approved product candidates. The degree of market acceptance of any of our approved product candidates will depend on numerous factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe efficacy and safety profile of the product candidate, as demonstrated in clinical trials;\n\u2022\nthe acceptance of the product candidate as a safe and effective treatment by physicians, clinics and patients;\n\u2022\nthe timing of market introduction of both the product candidate and products competitive to such product candidate;\n\u2022\nthe clinical indications for which the product candidate is approved;\n\u2022\nthe potential and perceived advantages of the product candidate over alternative treatments, including any similar generic treatments;\n\u2022\nthe cost of treatment with the product candidate in relation to alternative treatments;\n\u2022\nthe pricing of our products and the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement by third parties and government authorities;\n\u2022\nthe relative convenience and ease of administration of the product candidate;\n\u2022\nthe frequency and severity of adverse events caused by the product candidate;\n\u2022\nthe effectiveness of sales and marketing efforts with respect to the product candidate; and\n\u2022\nthe existence and nature of any unfavorable publicity relating to the product candidate.\nIf any of our product candidates is approved but does not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, hospitals, healthcare payors and patients, we may not generate or derive sufficient revenue from that product candidate to enable us to achieve or sustain profitability.\nEven if we commercialize one or more of our product candidates, these product candidates may become subject to unfavorable pricing regulations, third-party coverage and reimbursement practices or healthcare reform initiatives, which could harm our business.\nThe regulations that govern marketing approvals, pricing, coverage and reimbursement for new drug products vary widely from country to country. Current and future legislation may significantly change the approval requirements in ways that could involve additional costs and cause delays in obtaining approvals. Some countries require approval of the sale price of a drug before it can be marketed. In many countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing or product licensing approval is granted. In some foreign markets, prescription pharmaceutical pricing remains subject to continuing governmental control even after initial approval is granted. As a result, even if we obtain marketing approval for a product in a particular country, we may be subject to price regulations that delay the commercial launch of such product, possibly for lengthy time periods, which could negatively impact the revenues we generate from the sale of such product in that particular country. Adverse pricing limitations may hinder our ability to recoup our investment in one or more product candidates, even if such product candidates obtain marketing approval.\nOur ability to successfully commercialize any products will also depend in part on the extent to which coverage and adequate reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. Government authorities and other third-party payors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, determine which medications they will cover, establish reimbursement levels for medications and attempt to control costs by limiting such coverage and reimbursement levels. Increasingly, third-party payors are requiring that pharmaceutical companies provide such third-party payors with predetermined discounts from list prices and are challenging the prices charged for medications. We cannot be sure that coverage and reimbursement will be available for any product that we commercialize and, if reimbursement is available, what the level of reimbursement will be. Coverage and reimbursement may impact the demand for, or the price of, any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval. If coverage and reimbursement for any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval are not available or reimbursement is available only at limited levels, we may be unable to successfully commercialize any such product candidate.\nThere may be significant delays in obtaining coverage and reimbursement for newly approved drugs, and coverage may be more limited than the purposes for which the drug is approved by the FDA or any comparable foreign regulatory authority. Moreover, eligibility for coverage and reimbursement does not guarantee that a drug will be paid for in all cases or at a rate that covers our costs, including with respect to research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution. Interim reimbursement levels for new drugs, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover our costs and may only be provided on a temporary basis. Reimbursement rates may vary depending on the approved uses for the drug and the clinical setting in which it is used, may be based on reimbursement levels already set for lower cost drugs and may be incorporated into existing payments for other services. Net prices for drugs may be reduced by mandatory discounts or rebates required by government healthcare programs or private payors and by any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. Additionally, companion diagnostic tests that we or our collaborators may develop require coverage and reimbursement separate and apart from the coverage and reimbursement for their companion pharmaceutical or biologics products. Similar challenges to obtaining coverage and reimbursement, applicable to pharmaceutical or biologics products, will apply to companion diagnostic tests. Our inability to promptly obtain coverage and profitable reimbursement rates from both government-funded and private payors for any of our approved products or companion diagnostic tests that we or our collaborators may develop could have a material adverse effect on our operating results, our ability to raise capital needed to commercialize products and our overall financial condition.\nEnacted and future legislation may increase the difficulty and cost of commercialization of our product candidates and affect the prices we may charge for such product candidates.\nThe United States and many foreign jurisdictions have enacted or proposed legislative and regulatory changes affecting the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of our product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to profitably sell any product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval.\nIn March 2010, Congress enacted the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, or collectively, the Affordable Care Act, which includes measures that have changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers. There have been executive, judicial and congressional challenges to certain aspects of the Affordable Care Act. While Congress has not passed comprehensive repeal legislation, several bills affecting the implementation of certain taxes under the Affordable Care Act have been signed into law. The federal Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, or the Tax Act, includes a provision that became effective on January 1, 2019 and repealed the tax-based shared responsibility payment imposed by the Affordable Care Act on certain individuals who fail to maintain qualifying health coverage for all or part of a year, which payment is commonly referred to as the \u201cindividual mandate.\u201d In addition, the 2020 federal spending package permanently eliminated, effective January 1, 2020, the Affordable Care Act-mandated \u201cCadillac\u201d tax on high-cost employer-sponsored health coverage and medical device tax and, effective January 1, 2021, also eliminated the health insurer tax. The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, or the BBA, among other things, amended the Affordable Care Act, effective January 1, 2019, to close the coverage gap in most Medicare drug plans, commonly referred to as the \u201cdonut hole.\u201d On December 14, 2018, a Texas U.S. District Court judge ruled that the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional in its entirety because the individual mandate was repealed by Congress as part of the Tax Act. Additionally, on December 18, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit upheld the District Court ruling that the individual mandate was unconstitutional and remanded the case back to the District Court to determine whether the remaining provisions of the Affordable Care Act are invalid as well. The U.S. Supreme Court is currently reviewing the case, although it is unknown when a decision will be made. Further, although the U.S. Supreme Court has not yet ruled on the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act, on January 28, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order to initiate a special enrollment period from February 15, 2021 through May 15, 2021 for purposes of obtaining health insurance coverage through the Affordable Care Act marketplace. The executive order also instructs certain governmental agencies to review and reconsider their existing policies and rules that limit access to healthcare, including among others, reexamining Medicaid demonstration projects and waiver programs that include work requirements, and policies that create unnecessary barriers to obtaining access to health insurance coverage through Medicaid or the Affordable Care Act. It is unclear how the Supreme Court ruling, other such litigation and the healthcare reform measures of the Biden administration will impact the Affordable Care Act and our business.\nOther legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the Affordable Care Act was enacted. These changes include aggregate reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year pursuant to the Budget Control Act of 2011, which began in 2013, and due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, including the BBA, will remain in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through March 31, 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, unless Congress takes additional action. The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, among other things, further reduced Medicare payments to several providers, including hospitals and cancer treatment centers, and increased the statute of limitations period for the government to recover overpayments to providers from three to five years.\nFurther, there has been increasing legislative and enforcement interest in the United States with respect to drug pricing practices. Specifically, there have been several recent U.S. congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal legislation designed to, among other things, increase transparency in drug pricing, reduce the cost of prescription drugs under Medicare, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for drugs. At the federal level, the Trump administration used several means to propose or implement drug pricing reform, including through federal budget proposals, executive orders and policy initiatives. For example, on July 24, 2020 and September 13, 2020, the Trump administration announced several executive orders related to prescription drug pricing that seek to implement several of the administration\u2019s proposals. As a result, the FDA released a final rule on September 24, 2020, effective November 30, 2020, providing guidance for states to build and submit importation plans for drugs from Canada. Further, on November 20, 2020, HHS finalized a regulation removing safe harbor protection for price reductions from pharmaceutical manufacturers to plan sponsors under Medicare Part D, either directly or through pharmacy benefit managers, unless the price reduction is required by law. The implementation of the rule has been delayed by the Biden administration from January 1, 2022 to January 1, 2023 in response to ongoing litigation. The rule also creates a new safe harbor for price reductions reflected at the point-of-sale, as well as a new safe harbor for certain fixed fee arrangements between pharmacy benefit managers and manufacturers, the implementation of which have also been delayed pending review by the Biden administration until March 22, 2021. On November 20, 2020, CMS issued an interim final rule implementing the Trump administration\u2019s Most Favored Nation executive order, which would tie Medicare Part B payments for certain physician-administered drugs to the lowest price paid in other\neconomically advanced countries, effective January 1, 2021. On December 28, 2020, the U.S. District Court in Northern California issued a nationwide preliminary injunction against implementation of the interim final rule. It is unclear whether the Biden administration will work to reverse these measures or pursue similar policy initiatives. In addition, there have been and continue to be similar initiatives at the state level to reduce drug costs.\nWe cannot predict the likelihood, nature or extent of government regulation that may arise from future legislative, administrative or executive action. We expect that the healthcare reform measures that have been adopted and may be adopted in the future may result in more rigorous coverage criteria and additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product, which could materially harm our future revenues. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare or other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain or maintain profitability or successfully commercialize our products.\nIt is also possible that additional governmental action will be taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe may become subject to product liability lawsuits, which could cause us to incur substantial liabilities and limit commercialization of any products we may develop.\nWe face an inherent risk of product liability exposure related to the testing of our product candidates in human clinical trials and will face an even greater risk if we commercially sell any products that receive marketing approval. Product liability claims may be brought against us by patients, including those enrolled in our clinical trials, healthcare providers or others that use, administer or sell our products. If we cannot successfully defend ourselves against claims that our product candidates or products that we may develop or commercialize caused injuries, we could incur substantial liabilities. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims may result in:\n\u2022\ndecreased demand for our product candidates or any products that receive marketing approval;\n\u2022\ntermination of clinical trials at particular sites or entire clinical trial programs;\n\u2022\ninjury to our reputation and significant negative media attention;\n\u2022\nwithdrawal of patients from participation in our clinical trials;\n\u2022\nsignificant costs to defend the related litigation;\n\u2022\nsubstantial monetary awards payable to claimants, including patients enrolled in our clinical trials or patients that have been treated with any of our products that may receive regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nloss of revenue;\n\u2022\ndiversion of management and scientific resources from our business operations; and\n\u2022\ninability to commercialize any products that have received marketing approval.\nWe currently hold $10.0 million in clinical trial liability insurance coverage, which may not adequately cover all liabilities that we may incur. We may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in an amount adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise. We intend to expand our product liability insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products if we obtain marketing approval for one or more of our product candidates, but we may be unable to obtain such product liability insurance on commercially reasonable terms. Large judgments have been awarded in class action lawsuits based on drugs that had unanticipated side effects. A successful product liability claim or series of claims brought against us, particularly if judgments exceed our insurance coverage, could decrease our cash and adversely affect our business.\nOur relationships with healthcare providers, third-party payors and customers will be subject to applicable anti-kickback, fraud and abuse, transparency, privacy and other healthcare laws and regulations, violation of which could expose us to criminal sanctions, civil penalties, contractual damages, reputational harm, administrative burdens and diminished profits and future earnings.\nHealthcare providers, physicians and third-party payors will play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Our current and future arrangements with healthcare providers, third-party payors and customers may expose us to broadly applicable fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations that may constrain the business or financial arrangements and\nrelationships through which we market, sell and distribute any of our products that have received marketing approval. Restrictions under applicable federal and state healthcare laws and regulations include the following:\n\u2022\nThe federal Anti-Kickback Statute prohibits any person or entity from, among other things, knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or providing remuneration, directly or indirectly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward, or in return for, the referral of an individual for the furnishing or arranging for the furnishing, or the purchase, lease or order, or arranging for or recommending purchase, lease or order, of any good or service for which payment may be made under a federal healthcare program, such as Medicare or Medicaid;\n\u2022\nThe federal false claims laws, including the civil federal False Claims Act (which can be enforced by private citizens through whistleblower or qui tam actions), impose civil and criminal penalties against individuals or entities for knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, to the federal government claims for payment that are false or fraudulent or making a false statement to avoid, decrease or conceal an obligation to pay money to the federal government;\n\u2022\nThe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, or HIPAA, imposes criminal liability for knowingly and willfully executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program, knowingly and willfully embezzling or stealing any money or other assets of a healthcare benefit program, willfully obstructing a criminal investigation of a healthcare fraud offense or knowingly and willfully making false statements relating to healthcare matters;\n\u2022\nHIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, and their implementing regulations, also impose obligations on certain healthcare providers, health plans and healthcare clearinghouses, known as covered entities, as well as their business associates that perform certain services involving the use or disclosure of individually identifiable health information and subcontractors of such business associates that use, disclose or otherwise process individually identifiable health information, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information;\n\u2022\nThe federal Open Payments program requires manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics or medical supplies for which payment is available under Medicare, Medicaid or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (with certain exceptions) to report annually to CMS information related to \u201cpayments or other transfers of value\u201d made to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists and chiropractors) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by such physicians and their immediate family members, which will be expanded beginning in 2022 to require applicable manufacturers to report information regarding payments and other transfers of value made to physician assistants, nurse practitioners, clinical nurse specialists, certified registered nurse anesthetists, anesthesiologist assistants and certified nurse midwives during the previous year; and\n\u2022\nAnalogous state and foreign laws and regulations impose similar restrictions to those described above, such as state anti-kickback and false claims laws, which may apply to sales or marketing arrangements and claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by non-governmental third-party payors, including private insurers; state and foreign laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the federal government or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers; state and foreign laws that require drug manufacturers to report information related to payments and other transfers of value to physicians and other healthcare providers or marketing expenditures; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to report information on the pricing of certain drugs; state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales representatives; and state and foreign laws that govern the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by or are in conflict with HIPAA, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, which imposes privacy and security obligations on any entity that collects or processes health data from individuals located in the EU and became enforceable on May 25, 2018. As well as complicating our compliance efforts, these laws could subject us to penalties or significant legal liability in the event that we fail or are unable to comply. For example, significant non-compliance with the GDPR may result in the imposition of fines of up to 20 million euros or up to four percent of the annual global turnover of the responsible entity, whichever is greater.\nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws and regulations will involve substantial costs. It is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices do not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law interpreting applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws and regulations. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other governmental regulations that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, imprisonment, exclusion from government-funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, reputational harm and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any physician or other healthcare provider or entity with whom we expect to do business is found to have violated applicable laws, that person or entity may be subject to significant criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government-funded healthcare programs.\nWe must attract and retain highly skilled employees to succeed.\nTo succeed, we must recruit, develop, retain, manage and motivate qualified clinical, scientific, technical, general and administrative and management personnel while facing significant competition for experienced personnel. In January 2019, we announced our implementation of a corporate restructuring, or the January 2019 restructuring, to focus our resources on our clinical development and preclinical and late-stage research programs. In connection with the January 2019 restructuring, we eliminated 41 positions, representing approximately 20% of our then-current headcount. In October 2019, we implemented a second corporate restructuring, or the October 2019 restructuring, to extend our cash runway and ensure our long-term sustainability. In connection with the October 2019 restructuring, we reduced our workforce by 63 positions across all functions. We believe the restructurings harmed our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel and resulted in reduced morale among our remaining personnel. In addition, as disclosed elsewhere in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, we anticipate that we may need to expand our workforce, potentially at a rapid pace, in order to advance bemarituzumab into a Phase 3 clinical trial and to prepare to seek regulatory approval for and commercialize bemarituzumab. We may also need to hire personnel in functions with which we have limited experience, such as sales and marketing.\nOur inability or failure to successfully attract and retain qualified personnel, particularly at the management level, could adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan and harm our operating results. In particular, the loss of one or more of our executive officers could be detrimental if we cannot recruit suitable replacements in a timely manner. The competition for qualified personnel in the pharmaceutical field is intense and we may be unable to continue to attract and retain qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business or to recruit suitable replacement personnel.\nMany of the other pharmaceutical companies with which we compete for qualified personnel have greater financial and other resources, different risk profiles and a longer history in the industry than we have. These companies may also provide more diverse opportunities and better or more chances for development or career advancement. Some of these characteristics may appeal more to high-quality candidates than what we offer. If we are unable to continue to attract and retain personnel, the rate at which we can develop and advance current and future product candidates, and our success in doing so, will be limited and our business may be harmed.\nOur operations are vulnerable to interruption by natural disasters, including fire and earthquake, public health epidemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, telecommunications failure, geo-political actions, including war and terrorism, political and economic instability and other events beyond our control, which could harm our business.\nOur computer and other systems, or those of our partners, CROs or other service providers, may fail or be interrupted, including due to natural disasters, including earthquakes, typhoons, floods, and fires, public health epidemics, such as the COVID-19 pandemic currently impacting countries worldwide, hardware, software, telecommunication or electrical failures, geo-political actions, including war and terrorism, or political and economic instability, which could significantly disrupt or harm our business or operations. For example, a computing system failure could result in the loss of research or preclinical or clinical data important to our research or development programs, interrupt the conduct of ongoing research or otherwise impair our ability to operate, which could result in delays in the advancement of our programs or cause us to incur costs to recover or reproduce lost data. Our facility is in a seismically-active region. We have not undertaken a systematic analysis of the potential consequences to our business and financial results from a major earthquake, fire, power loss, terrorist activity or other disaster and do not have a recovery plan for such disasters. In addition, we do not carry sufficient insurance to compensate us for actual losses that may occur from interruption of our business and any losses or damages incurred by us could harm our business.\nOur business operations depend significantly on information technology systems, and a cyber-attack or other significant disruption or breach of our information technology systems, or those of third parties on whom we may rely or with whom we share confidential information, could cause us significant financial, legal, regulatory, business and reputational harm.\nWe are increasingly dependent on information technology systems and infrastructure, including mobile technologies, to operate our business. In the ordinary course of our business, we collect, store, process and transmit sensitive information, including intellectual property, proprietary business information, personal information and other confidential information belonging to us and to third parties. It is critical that we do so in a secure manner to maintain the confidentiality, integrity and availability of such sensitive information. We also outsource elements of our operations, including elements of our information technology infrastructure, to third-party vendors, and as a result, these vendors may have access to our computer networks or our confidential information. In addition, many of those vendors subcontract or outsource to other third parties some of their responsibilities under our agreements with such vendors. While all information technology operations are inherently vulnerable to inadvertent or intentional security breaches, incidents, attacks and exposures, the accessibility and distributed nature of our information technology systems, and the nature of the sensitive information stored on these systems, make such systems particularly vulnerable to internal and external attacks, both unintentional and malicious. In addition, as disclosed elsewhere in this report, including in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, state and local authorities have issued shelter-in-place orders and implemented other restrictions to control the spread of COVID-19. These restrictions have resulted in office closures and travel restrictions that have required our and our vendors\u2019 and business partners\u2019 personnel to transition to remote working arrangements, which increases the risk that our systems, or those of our vendors or business partners, and any confidential or sensitive information contained in such systems may be subject to a security breach, incident, attack or other exposure. Potential vulnerabilities can be exploited through inadvertent or intentional actions of our employees, third-party vendors, and business partners, or by malicious third parties. Attacks of this nature are increasing in their frequency, levels of persistence, sophistication and intensity and are being conducted by sophisticated and organized groups and individuals, including organized criminal groups, \u201chacktivists,\u201d nation-states and others, with a wide range of motives, including industrial espionage, and expertise. In addition to the extraction of sensitive information, such attacks could involve the deployment of harmful malware, ransomware, denial-of-service attacks, social engineering and other means to affect service reliability and threaten the confidentiality, integrity and availability of such information. In addition, the prevalent use of mobile devices, including personal mobile devices, increases the risk of the occurrence of data security incidents.\nData security incidents or other significant disruptions affecting our, our vendors\u2019 or our business partners\u2019 information technology systems could adversely affect our business operations and result in loss or misappropriation of, or unauthorized access to, use or disclosure of, or the prevention of access to, sensitive information, which could cause us financial, legal, regulatory, business and reputational harm. In addition, disruptions to our information technology systems could result in a material disruption of our development programs and our business operations. For example, the loss of clinical trial data from completed, current or future clinical trials could result in delays in our regulatory approval efforts and significantly increase our costs to recover or reproduce such data.\nThere is no way to know with certainty whether we have experienced any data security incidents that we have not yet discovered. While we have no reason to believe this to be the case, attackers have become sophisticated with respect to concealing their access to systems, and many companies whose information security systems have been attacked are not aware that they have been attacked. Any event that leads to unauthorized access, use or disclosure of personal information, including personal information of our employees or patients or investigators in our clinical trials, could disrupt our business, harm our reputation, compel us to comply with applicable federal, state or foreign breach notification laws, subject us to time-consuming, distracting and expensive litigation, regulatory investigations and oversight or mandatory corrective action, require us to verify the correctness of certain stored information, or otherwise subject us to liability under applicable laws, regulations and our contracts with third parties, including those that require us to protect the privacy and security of personal information. This could cause us to incur significant costs and expose us to significant legal and financial liability and reputational harm. In addition, if there is any failure or perceived failure by us or our vendors or business partners to comply with our or their privacy, confidentiality or data security-related legal or other obligations to third parties, or if there are any security incidents or other inappropriate access events that result in the unauthorized access, release or transfer of sensitive information, including personally identifiable information, we may be the subject of governmental investigations, enforcement actions, regulatory fines, litigation, or public statements against us by advocacy groups or others, third parties, including clinical trial sites, regulators or current and potential business partners, may lose trust in us, and we could be subject to claims by third parties that we have breached our privacy- or confidentiality-related obligations, which could materially and adversely affect our business and prospects. Moreover, data security incidents and other unauthorized access can be difficult to detect, and any delay in identifying such incidents or unauthorized access may lead to increased harm of the types described above. While we have implemented technical and organizational measures designed to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risks involved, there can be no assurance that such measures have prevented or will prevent service interruptions or security incidents.\nOur employees and consultants, collaborators and other third parties may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including insider trading and activities that violate regulatory standards and requirements.\nOur employees and consultants, collaborators and other third parties with whom we interact may engage in fraudulent or illegal activity. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional, reckless or negligent conduct that violates United States and international laws and regulations, including laws requiring the true, complete and accurate reporting of financial and other information or data, drug manufacturing standards and healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry, including the sale of pharmaceutical products, are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. Such laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. It is not always possible to detect, identify and deter misconduct by our employees or third parties, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective to control risks or losses or protect us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from an actual or perceived failure to comply with such laws or regulations. If any such actions are instituted against us and we are not successful in defending ourselves or asserting our rights, such actions could result in the imposition of significant monetary fines or other sanctions, including the imposition of civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, imprisonment, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, additional reporting obligations and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or other agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings and curtailment of operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our results of operations. Whether or not we are successful in defending against such actions or investigations, this could cause us to incur substantial costs, including legal fees, and divert the attention of management in our defending against any such actions or responding to related investigations.\nRisks Related to Our Dependence on Third Parties\nZai Lab has exclusive rights to develop and commercialize bemarituzumab in Greater China. Zai Lab\u2019s failure to timely develop or commercialize bemarituzumab would have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nWe granted Zai Lab an exclusive license to develop and commercialize bemarituzumab in Greater China, subject to certain rights that we retained in that territory. Our China collaboration with Zai Lab may not be successful for various reasons, including the following:\n\u2022\nbemarituzumab may fail to demonstrate in clinical trials sufficient efficacy and an acceptable safety profile to support regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nZai Lab may not be able to obtain from us or manufacture, as applicable, bemarituzumab in a sufficiently timely or cost-effective manner to support clinical development and potential commercialization;\n\u2022\nZai Lab may be unable to obtain regulatory approval to commercialize bemarituzumab, even if preclinical and clinical testing is successful;\n\u2022\nZai Lab may not succeed in obtaining sufficient reimbursement for bemarituzumab if approved;\n\u2022\nexisting or future products or technologies developed by competitors may be safer, more effective, more conveniently delivered to patients or otherwise better accepted than bemarituzumab; and\n\u2022\npublic health crises, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic currently impacting countries worldwide, may adversely impact the development and commercialization of bemarituzumab.\nIn addition, we could be adversely affected by:\n\u2022\nZai Lab\u2019s failure to timely perform its obligations under our collaboration agreement;\n\u2022\nZai Lab\u2019s failure to timely or fully develop or effectively commercialize bemarituzumab; or\n\u2022\na material contractual dispute with Zai Lab.\nThe occurrence of any of the foregoing could adversely impact the likelihood and timing of any milestone payments we are eligible to receive under our collaboration agreement with Zai Lab, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and prospects and would likely cause our stock price to decline. In addition, reimbursement for our research and development expenses and other payments we may receive from Zai Lab may fluctuate from period to period, which may adversely affect our stock price.\nZai Lab has the right to terminate its collaboration agreement with us without cause as well as upon the existence of certain conditions and, in some cases, Zai Lab may terminate on short notice. Zai Lab could also pursue alternative potentially competitive products, therapeutic approaches or technologies as a means of developing treatments for the diseases targeted by bemarituzumab during the course of our collaboration.\nWe may not succeed in establishing and maintaining additional license agreements or product or clinical collaborations with strategic partners, which could adversely affect our ability to generate funding or develop and commercialize product candidates.\nA part of our strategy is to establish license agreements and product and clinical collaborations with strategic partners, including major biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, with respect to the product candidates we are researching or developing. These licenses and collaborations allow us to supplement our development, manufacturing, regulatory and commercialization capabilities to broaden and accelerate clinical development and commercialization of our product candidates, provide us with significant funding to advance our pipeline and validate our technology. We face significant competition in seeking appropriate partners for additional licenses and collaborations and the negotiation process is time-consuming and complex and the outcome uncertain. Moreover, we may not succeed in our efforts to establish additional licenses or collaborations or other alternative arrangements for any of our other existing or future product candidates and programs because development of our product candidates and programs may be deemed to be too early in development or third parties may not view our product candidates as having the requisite potential to demonstrate safety and efficacy or otherwise to timely become competitive marketable products, if approved. Even if we succeed in our efforts to establish new product licenses or collaborations, the terms that we agree upon may not be favorable to us and we may not be able to maintain such licenses or collaborations if, for example, development or approval of the applicable product candidate is delayed or sales of such product candidate, once approved, are disappointing. Any delay in entering into new license or collaboration agreements related to our product candidates could delay the development and commercialization of such product candidates and reduce their competitiveness if they reach the market.\nMoreover, if we fail to timely establish and maintain licenses or collaborations related to our product candidates:\n\u2022\nwe would not receive revenue from these licenses or collaborations within the timeframe we planned or at all;\n\u2022\nour cash expenditures related to continued development of these product candidates would increase and we may need to seek additional financing;\n\u2022\nif we are unable to secure additional financing, the development of our current or future product candidates may be delayed or terminated;\n\u2022\nwe may be required to hire additional employees for which we have not budgeted, or otherwise develop expertise in areas in which we may have limited experience, such as sales and marketing; and\n\u2022\nwe will bear all the risk related to the development of any such product candidates.\nWe may not succeed in executing strategic transactions to acquire or in-license rights to additional product candidates.\nWe plan to supplement our ongoing development pipeline from time to time by selectively acquiring or in-licensing, on an exclusive basis, rights to develop product candidates from biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. We continue to evaluate for potential acquisition or licensing assets that are IND-ready or in early clinical development and that we can leverage our in-house development capabilities to develop to data read-outs in the near- to medium-term. Our primary focus remains on oncology therapeutics. If we are unable to identify product candidates or otherwise successfully execute transactions granting us rights to such product candidates within our desired timeframes or at all, we will not be able to grow our development pipeline, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition. We may fail to successfully execute strategic acquisitions of or in-licenses for rights to develop product candidates for numerous reasons. Suitable acquisition or in-licensing opportunities may not exist, which could impair our ability to grow or obtain access to products or technologies that may be important to the development of our business. Other pharmaceutical companies, many of which may have substantially greater financial and other resources, compete with us for these opportunities and may succeed in acquiring or licensing third-party product candidates before we do. Even if appropriate opportunities are available, we may not be able to successfully identify such opportunities or they may not be available to us on terms that are commercially reasonable or otherwise acceptable to us.\nWe rely on CMOs, CROs and other third-party service providers to develop and produce drug product for and conduct our clinical trials and to conduct services related to our preclinical and late-stage research programs, and the unsatisfactory performance by such CMOs, CROs or other third-party service providers may harm our business.\nWe rely on CROs to perform most of the activities related to the conduct of our clinical trials, including site identification, screening, preparation, training, initiation and monitoring, document preparation and coordination, program management and data management. We do not directly control the conduct, timing, expense or quality of the performance of these activities. The performance of our CROs will impact the quality and validity of our clinical trial results, which we rely on for business planning purposes and include in submissions to regulatory authorities. Although we contract with CROs to conduct most clinical trial-related activities, we remain responsible for ensuring that each of our clinical trials is conducted in accordance with the applicable clinical protocol and legal and regulatory requirements. Our reliance on CROs does not relieve us of our legal and regulatory responsibilities with respect to our clinical trials.\nWe and our CROs are required to comply with GCP, which are regulations, standards and guidelines enforced by the FDA, the Competent Authorities of the Member States of the European Economic Area and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, for all of our product candidates in clinical development. Regulatory authorities enforce GCP requirements through periodic inspections of clinical trial sponsors, principal investigators and clinical trial sites. If we or any of our CROs fail to comply with applicable GCP, the clinical data generated in our clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional clinical trials before approving our marketing applications. We cannot ensure that upon inspection by a given regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that any of our clinical trials are being conducted in accordance with GCP requirements. In addition, we must conduct our clinical trials using drug product developed and produced in accordance with GLP and GMP requirements. Our failure, or the failure of our CMOs, CROs or clinical trial sites, to comply with applicable GLP, GMP or GCP may require us to repeat preclinical studies and clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process.\nOur CMOs, CROs and other third-party service providers, and their representatives that perform services for us, are not our employees. Except for remedies available to us in connection with our agreements with such CMOs, CROs and other third-party service providers, we cannot control whether they devote sufficient time and resources to our ongoing clinical, preclinical and research programs. Our CMOs, CROs and other third-party service providers may not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, and the quality or accuracy of the data they obtain may be compromised, including due to their failure to adhere to regulatory requirements or for other reasons, including failure of our clinical CROs to adhere to our clinical protocols. In addition, our CROs and other third parties we engage in connection with the conduct of our clinical trials may experience business interruptions as a result of shelter-in-place or similar orders or other effects of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, our clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our product candidates. In such a case, our\nresults of operations and the commercial prospects for our product candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase and our ability to generate revenues could be delayed or significantly limited.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property\nIf we are unable to obtain, maintain or protect intellectual property rights, we may not be able to compete effectively in our market.\nOur success depends in significant part on our ability and the ability of our licensors and collaborators to obtain, maintain and defend patents and other intellectual property rights and to operate without infringing the intellectual property rights of others. We have filed numerous patent applications both in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions to obtain patent rights to inventions we have discovered. We have also licensed patent and other intellectual property rights to and from our partners and other third parties. Pursuant to some of these licenses, we have the right to prepare, file and prosecute patent applications and maintain and enforce the patents that are the subject of these licenses, whereas our partners or other third parties have such rights under other licenses.\nIn circumstances where we do not have the right to control the preparation, filing and prosecution of patent applications or to maintain the patents covering technology that we license to or from third parties, including our collaborators, we have to rely on such third parties to fulfill these responsibilities. Consequently, these patents and applications may not be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business. If our current or future licensors, licensees or collaborators fail to establish, maintain or protect such patents and other intellectual property rights, such rights may be reduced or eliminated. If our licensors, licensees or collaborators are not fully cooperative or disagree with us as to the strategy for prosecution, maintenance or enforcement of any patent rights, such patent rights could be compromised.\nThe patent prosecution process is expensive and time-consuming. We and our current or future licensors, licensees or collaborators may not be able to prepare, file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we or our licensors, licensees or collaborators will fail to file patent applications covering inventions made in the course of development and commercialization activities before a competitor or other third party files a patent application covering or publishes information disclosing a similar, independently-developed invention. Such competitor\u2019s or third party\u2019s patent application or other publication may hinder our or our licensors\u2019, licensees\u2019 or collaborators\u2019 ability to obtain patent protection for these inventions or may limit the scope of patent protection we or our licensors, licensees or collaborators may obtain.\nThe patent position of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies generally is uncertain, involves complex legal and factual questions and is the subject of much litigation. As a result, the scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our and our current or future licensors\u2019, licensees\u2019 or collaborators\u2019 patent rights, as well as whether any patents will ever be issued based on applications claiming such patent rights, are uncertain. Our and our current or future licensors\u2019, licensees\u2019 or collaborators\u2019 pending and future patent applications may not result in issued patents that protect our technology or products, in whole or in part, or that effectively exclude others from commercializing similar or otherwise competitive technologies and products. During the patent prosecution process, we or our licensors, licensees or collaborators may be required to narrow the scope of the claims of pending and future patent applications, which may limit the scope of protection of any patents that may issue from such applications. Our and our licensors\u2019, licensees\u2019 or collaborators\u2019 rights in the technology claimed in patent applications cannot be enforced against third parties using such technology unless and until a patent issues from such applications, and then only to the extent the issued claims effectively cover such technology.\nFurthermore, because the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates is lengthy, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are approved for commercialization. As a result, our owned and licensed patent portfolios may not provide us with adequate protection against third parties seeking to commercialize products similar or identical to ours. We expect to request extensions of patent terms to the extent available in countries where we obtain issued patents. In the United States, the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984 permits, in certain cases, a patent term extension of up to five years beyond the expiration of the patent. However, there are no assurances that the FDA or any comparable foreign regulatory authority will grant such extensions, in whole or in part. If we fail to obtain patent term extensions for any reason, our competitors may launch their products earlier than might otherwise be anticipated.\nWe may not be able to protect our intellectual property rights throughout the world.\nFiling, prosecuting, enforcing and defending patents covering our product candidates in all countries throughout the world would be prohibitively expensive, and our or our licensors\u2019 or collaborators\u2019 intellectual property rights in some countries outside the United States may be less extensive than those in the United States. Moreover, the requirements for patentability in certain foreign countries, particularly developing countries, differ materially from those of the United States and such requirements also vary among foreign countries. For example, compared to the United States, China\u2019s patentability requirements are more stringent and may limit the scope of a patent\u2019s claims solely to the specific examples described in the patent. Therefore, it may be more difficult to obtain patent protection in certain countries relative to others.\nThe laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as federal and state laws in the United States. Consequently, we and our licensors or collaborators may not be able to prevent third parties from using our and our licensors\u2019 or collaborators\u2019 inventions in certain countries outside the United States. In jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection, competitors may use our and our licensors\u2019 or collaborators\u2019 technologies to develop their own products. Competitors may also export infringing products to territories where we and our licensors or collaborators have patent protection but enforcement is not as strong or effective as in the United States. These products may compete with our product candidates and our and our licensors\u2019 or collaborators\u2019 patents or other intellectual property rights may not be sufficient to prevent them from competing.\nMany companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending intellectual property rights in foreign jurisdictions. The legal systems in certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the enforcement of patents and other intellectual property rights, particularly those relating to biopharmaceuticals, which could make it difficult for us and our licensors or collaborators to stop the infringement of our and our licensors\u2019 or collaborators\u2019 patents or marketing of competing products in violation of our and our licensors\u2019 or collaborators\u2019 proprietary rights generally. Proceedings to enforce our and our licensors\u2019 or collaborators\u2019 patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our and our licensors\u2019 or collaborators\u2019 efforts and attention from other aspects of our business and could provoke third parties to assert counterclaims against us or our licensors or collaborators, which could put our and our licensors\u2019 or collaborators\u2019 patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly. We or our licensors or collaborators may not prevail in any lawsuits that we or our licensors or collaborators initiate and, even if we or our licensors or collaborators prevail, the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful, particularly in light of any expenses incurred in connection with the initiation and conduct of such lawsuits.\nBiosimilar drug manufacturers or other competitors may challenge the scope, validity or enforceability of our or our licensors\u2019 or collaborators\u2019 foreign patents, requiring us or our licensors or collaborators to engage in complex, lengthy and costly litigation or other proceedings outside of the United States. Biosimilar drug manufacturers may develop, seek approval for and launch biosimilar versions of our products. India, certain countries in Europe and certain developing countries, including China, have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties. In those countries, we and our licensors or collaborators may have limited remedies if compelled to grant a license to a third party, which could materially diminish the value of the applicable patents and limit our potential revenue opportunities. Accordingly, we may be unable to derive a significant commercial advantage from our and our licensors\u2019 or collaborators\u2019 intellectual property rights or our enforcement of those rights.\nChanges to patent laws could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our rights in our product candidates.\nThe ability of a party to obtain and enforce patents in the biopharmaceutical industry is inherently uncertain, due in part to ongoing changes to applicable patent laws. Depending on decisions by Congress, the federal courts, and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, or USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways and could weaken our and our licensors\u2019 or collaborators\u2019 ability to obtain new patents or to enforce existing or future patents.\nFor example, several of the Supreme Court\u2019s rulings in patent cases in recent years have either narrowed the scope of patent protection available under certain circumstances or weakened the rights of patent owners in certain situations. Therefore, there is increased uncertainty with regard to our and our licensors\u2019 or collaborators\u2019 ability to obtain patents in the future, as well as uncertainty with respect to the value that any of our patents may have once they have issued. Additionally, significant changes to the patent laws under the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act of 2011, or the Leahy-Smith Act, have affected how patent applications are prosecuted and challenged in the U.S. Those changes include implementation of a \u201cfirst-to-file\u201d system, effective in 2013, for determining entitlement to inventions claimed by more than one party, as well as creation of new administrative proceedings for challenging issued patents. As such, there is increased uncertainty with respect to both outcome and costs associated with the prosecution of patent applications and the enforcement or defense of issued patents controlled by us or our licensors or collaborators, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nObtaining and maintaining patent protection requires compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated if we fail to comply with these requirements.\nPatent holders are required to pay periodic maintenance and annuity fees to the USPTO and foreign patent agencies over the lifetime of any issued patent. The USPTO and foreign patent agencies also require compliance with various procedural, documentary, fee payment and other similar requirements during the patent application and prosecution process. Non-compliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application include failure to respond to official communications within prescribed time limits, non-payment of fees and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents. In many cases, an inadvertent lapse can be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules. However, certain non-compliance events may result in irrevocable abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. If we or our licensors or collaborators fail to maintain the patents and patent applications covering our product candidates, our competitors might be able to enter the market and compete with such product candidates, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe may need to protect or enforce our intellectual property through litigation or other proceedings, which could be expensive, time-consuming and unsuccessful and have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nThird parties may infringe our or our licensors\u2019 or collaborators\u2019 patents or misappropriate or otherwise violate our or our licensors\u2019 or collaborators\u2019 intellectual property rights. In the future, we or our licensors or collaborators may initiate legal proceedings to enforce or defend our or our licensors\u2019 or collaborators\u2019 intellectual property rights or to protect our or our licensors\u2019 or collaborators\u2019 trade secrets. The outcome of such proceedings may determine or alter the validity or scope of intellectual property rights we own or control. Also, third parties may initiate legal proceedings, including litigation or administrative proceedings, against us or our licensors or collaborators to challenge the validity or scope of intellectual property rights we own or control. These proceedings can be expensive and time-consuming and many of our or our licensors\u2019 or collaborators\u2019 adversaries in these proceedings may have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to prosecuting these legal actions than we or our licensors or collaborators can. Accordingly, despite our or our licensors\u2019 or collaborators\u2019 efforts and the legitimacy of our or our licensors\u2019 or collaborators\u2019 arguments and positions in these proceedings, we or our licensors or collaborators may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing or misappropriating intellectual property rights we or our licensors or collaborators own or control, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the United States. Litigation or administrative proceedings could result in substantial costs and diversion of management resources, which could harm our business and financial results. In addition, in a patent infringement proceeding, a court may decide that a patent owned by or licensed to us is invalid or unenforceable, or may refuse to impose monetary damages or enjoin the infringing party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our or our licensors\u2019 or collaborators\u2019 patents do not cover the technology in question. Any legal proceeding involving one or more of our or our licensors\u2019 or collaborators\u2019 patents could put such patents at risk of being invalidated, held unenforceable or interpreted narrowly.\nDerivation or interference proceedings in the United States or similar proceedings in other jurisdictions may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our or our licensors\u2019 or collaborators\u2019 patents or patent applications. An unfavorable outcome in these proceedings could require us or our licensors or collaborators to cease using the technology covered by the applicable patents or patent applications and commercializing our product candidates or to attempt to license rights to such technology from the prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us or our licensors or collaborators a license or offers a license on terms that are not commercially reasonable or are otherwise unfavorable to us. Even if we or our licensors or collaborators obtain a license, it may be non-exclusive, allowing our competitors to gain access to the same technologies licensed to us or our licensors or collaborators. In addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our or our licensors\u2019 or collaborators\u2019 patents and patent applications is threatened, potential collaborators may be dissuaded from partnering with us with respect to the development or commercialization of our affected current or future product candidates. Even if we prevail in such a proceeding, such a proceeding may cause us to incur substantial costs and distract our management and other employees from our business and operations.\nFurthermore, because intellectual property litigation and certain other legal proceedings require discovery, which may in some cases be substantial, there is a risk that our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during the course of such proceedings. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim rulings or developments in the proceedings, and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, the price of shares of our common stock may be materially adversely affected.\nIf we breach the agreements under which third parties have licensed intellectual property rights to us, we could lose the ability to use certain of our technologies or continue the development and commercialization of our product candidates.\nOur commercial success depends upon our ability, and the ability of our licensors and collaborators, to develop, manufacture, market and sell product candidates without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties. Third parties currently, and may in the future, hold intellectual property rights, including patent rights, that are important or necessary for the development or commercialization of our product candidates. As a result, we are a party to a number of licenses that are important to our business and expect to enter into additional licenses in the future. For example, we have entered into non-exclusive licenses with third parties, including BioWa, Inc. and Lonza Sales AG, to use their proprietary protein expression and cell line technologies, which are necessary to produce our product candidates. If we fail to comply with the obligations under these license agreements, including payment and diligence terms, our licensors may have the right to terminate these agreements, in which event we may not be able to develop, manufacture, market or sell any product candidate that, or the development or manufacturing of which, is covered by the rights licensed under these agreements and may face other contractual penalties. Such an occurrence could materially adversely affect the value of any product candidate being developed using technology licensed under any such agreement. Termination of, or reduction or elimination of our rights under, these agreements may require us to negotiate new or reinstated agreements, which may not be available to us on equally favorable or otherwise commercially reasonable terms, or at all, or cause us to lose our rights we had under the original agreements, including our rights to intellectual property or technology important to or necessary for our development programs.\nThird parties may initiate legal proceedings against us alleging that we infringe their intellectual property rights, or we may initiate legal proceedings against third parties to challenge the validity or scope of intellectual property rights controlled by such third parties. The outcome of any of these proceedings would be uncertain and could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nThird parties may initiate legal proceedings against us or our licensors or collaborators alleging that we or our licensors or collaborators infringe the intellectual property rights controlled by these third parties, or we or our licensors or collaborators may initiate legal proceedings against third parties to challenge the validity or scope of intellectual property rights controlled by these third parties, including in oppositions, interferences, reexaminations, inter partes reviews, post-grant reviews or derivation proceedings in the United States or comparable proceedings in other jurisdictions. These proceedings can be expensive and time-consuming and many of our or our licensors\u2019 or collaborators\u2019 adversaries in these proceedings may have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to prosecuting these legal actions than we or our licensors or collaborators can.\nAn unfavorable outcome in any of these proceedings could require us or our licensors or collaborators to cease using the relevant technology or developing or commercializing our product candidates, or to attempt to license any necessary rights to such technology from the prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us or our licensors or collaborators a license, or otherwise offers a license on terms that are not commercially reasonable or are otherwise unfavorable to us. Even if we or our licensors or collaborators obtain a license, it may be non-exclusive, thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us or our licensors or collaborators. In addition, we could be found liable for monetary damages if we are found to have infringed a patent, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees if such infringement was willful. A finding of infringement could prevent us from commercializing our product candidates or force us to cease some of our business operations, which could materially harm our business.\nFurthermore, because intellectual property litigation and certain other legal proceedings require discovery, which may in some cases be substantial, there is a risk that our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during the course of such proceedings involving third party intellectual property rights. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim rulings or developments in the proceedings, and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, the price of shares of our common stock may be materially adversely affected.\nWe may be subject to claims by third parties asserting that we or our employees have misappropriated their intellectual property or that such third parties own what we regard as our own intellectual property.\nMany of our employees, including members of our senior management, were previously employed at universities or at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors, and executed proprietary rights, non-disclosure and non-competition agreements in connection with such previous employment. Although we work to ensure that our employees do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, including through written contractual obligations, we may be subject to claims that we or our employees have used or disclosed confidential information or intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of a former employer of any such employee. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims.\nIf we are unable to successfully defend against any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel. Such intellectual property rights could be determined to be owned by a third party, and we could be required to obtain a license from such third party to commercialize our technology or products. Such a license may not be available to us at all, may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms or may include obligations that are otherwise unfavorable for us. Even if we successfully defend against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and distract management from our day-to-day operations.\nOur inability to protect our confidential information and trade secrets would harm our business and competitive position.\nIn addition to seeking patents covering our technology and products, we also rely on trade secrets, including unpatented know-how, technology and other proprietary information, to maintain our competitive position. We seek to protect these trade secrets, in part, by entering into confidentiality agreements with parties who have access to them, including our employees, corporate collaborators, scientific collaborators, contract manufacturers and other service providers, advisors and other third parties. We also enter into confidentiality and intellectual property, including patent, assignment agreements with our employees and consultants. Despite these efforts, any of these parties, including our current or former employees or consultants and those of our service providers or collaborators, may breach the applicable agreements and disclose our confidential information, including our trade secrets, and we may not be able to obtain adequate remedies for any such breach. Bringing a claim against a party for illegally disclosing or misappropriating a trade secret is difficult, expensive and time-consuming and the outcome of any resulting litigation or other proceeding is unpredictable. Additionally, litigation involving our trade secrets puts us at significant risk that such trade secrets will be publicly disclosed, thereby significantly reducing or eliminating their value and potentially increasing competition and otherwise harming our business. Further, some courts both within and outside the United States may be less willing or unwilling to protect trade secrets. If a competitor lawfully obtained or independently developed any of our trade secrets, we would have no right to prevent such competitor from using any such trade secret to compete with us, which could harm our competitive position.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Position and Capital Needs\nWe will require additional capital to finance our operations, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. As a result, we may not complete the development and commercialization of our current or future product candidates.\nAs a research and development company, our operations have consumed substantial amounts of cash since inception. We have sufficient cash and cash equivalents to fund our projected operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months. We expect our research and development expenses may increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly if we advance our product candidates further into clinical development, advance additional product candidates into clinical trials and increase the number and size of our clinical trials. In addition, circumstances may cause us to consume capital more rapidly than we currently anticipate, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, we may be required to conduct additional research or development activities or studies for a product candidate or substantially redesign a product candidate, each of which could lengthen the development process and increase our development costs for such product candidate. If we initiate additional clinical trials for certain product candidates, we may need to raise additional funds or otherwise obtain funding through product collaborations beyond the collaborations we currently have in place. In any event, we will require additional capital to develop, obtain regulatory approval for and to commercialize our current and future product candidates.\nIf we need to secure additional financing, fundraising efforts may divert our management from our day-to-day activities, which may adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize current and future product candidates. In addition, we cannot guarantee that future financing will be available in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, if at all. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a significant disruption of global financial markets. If the disruption persists and deepens and global economic conditions worsen, we could experience an inability to access additional capital or engage in strategic transactions on terms reasonable to us, or at all. If we are unable to or otherwise do not raise additional capital when required or on acceptable terms, we may need to:\n\u2022\nsignificantly delay, scale back or discontinue the development or commercialization of one or more of our product candidates or cease all or a portion of our operations;\n\u2022\nseek collaborations for research and development programs at an earlier stage than we would otherwise desire or on terms less favorable than might otherwise be available; or\n\u2022\nrelinquish or license to third parties on unfavorable terms our rights to technologies or product candidates that we otherwise would seek to develop or commercialize ourselves.\nIf we need to conduct additional fundraising activities and we do not raise additional capital in sufficient amounts or on terms acceptable to us, we may be required to halt or delay our ongoing development efforts and may be prevented from pursuing further development and commercialization of our product candidates, and we may be required to halt or delay any acquisition or in-licensing of new product candidates or may be prevented from pursuing further acquisition or in-licensing opportunities, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results and prospects.\nThe time through which our financial resources will adequately support our operations could vary as a result of numerous factors, including factors discussed elsewhere in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section. Our future funding requirements, both short- and long-term, will depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022\nthe initiation, progress, timing, costs and results of preclinical and clinical studies for our current product candidates and any future product candidates;\n\u2022\nthe outcome, timing and cost of seeking and obtaining regulatory approvals from the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities, including the potential that such authorities may require us to perform more studies than we expect;\n\u2022\nthe cost to establish, maintain, expand and defend the scope of our intellectual property portfolio, including the amount and timing of any payments we may be required to make, or that we may receive, in connection with licensing, preparing, filing, prosecuting, maintaining, defending and enforcing any of our patents or other intellectual property rights;\n\u2022\nthe effect of competing technological and market developments;\n\u2022\nmarket acceptance of any of our product candidates that may receive regulatory approval;\n\u2022\nthe costs of acquiring, licensing or investing in additional businesses, products, product candidates and technologies;\n\u2022\nthe cost and timing of selecting, auditing and validating a manufacturing site for commercial-scale manufacturing; and\n\u2022\nthe cost of establishing sales, marketing and distribution capabilities for any product candidates for which we may receive regulatory approval and that we choose to commercialize ourselves or with our collaboration partners.\nIf a lack of available capital means that we cannot expand our operations or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nRaising additional capital may dilute our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies.\nUntil we generate sufficient product revenue, if ever, we expect to finance our future cash needs through public or private equity or debt offerings and collaborations, strategic alliances and other similar licensing transactions. Additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all. On August 6, 2020, we entered into a sales agreement with Cowen and Company, LLC, or Cowen, acting as sales agent, pursuant to which we may offer and sell, from time to time through Cowen, shares of our common stock having an aggregate offering price of up to $75.0 million, in a series of one or more at-the-market equity offerings, or collectively, the ATM facility. During 2020, we raised approximately $7.1 million in net proceeds under the ATM facility. In addition, in November 2020, we closed on a public offering of our common stock, resulting in net proceeds of approximately $163.2 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by us. To the extent that we raise additional funds through the issuance of additional debt or equity securities, our fixed payment obligations could increase and the ownership interests of our existing stockholders may be diluted. Furthermore, these securities may have rights senior to those of our common stock and could contain covenants that restrict our operations and potentially impair our competitiveness, including limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire, sell or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our business. Any of these events could significantly harm our business, financial condition and prospects.\nWe expect to incur net losses for the foreseeable future.\nWe are a clinical-stage biotechnology company with a limited operating history. Investment in biopharmaceutical product development is highly speculative because it entails substantial upfront capital expenditures and significant risk that any potential product candidate will fail to demonstrate adequate efficacy with an acceptable safety profile, gain regulatory approval and become commercially viable. We have no products approved for commercial sale, have not generated any revenue from product sales to date and continue to incur significant research and development and other expenses related to our ongoing operations. As a result, we are not profitable and have incurred losses in almost every period since our inception in 2001. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we reported a net loss of $84.3 million.\nAlthough we may from time to time report profitable results, we expect to continue to incur significant expenses and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future. The net losses we incur may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter. We expect our operating expenses to increase as we advance our research and development of, and seek regulatory approvals for, our product candidates. We may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other unknown circumstances that may adversely affect our business. The size of our future net losses will depend, in part, on the rate of future growth of our expenses and our ability to generate revenues. Our prior losses and expected future losses have had and will continue to have an adverse effect on our stockholders\u2019 equity and working capital.\nWe currently have no source of product revenue and may never become consistently profitable.\nTo date, we have not generated any revenue from commercialization of our product candidates. Our ability to generate product revenue and ultimately become profitable depends upon our ability, alone or with our partners, to successfully commercialize products, including our current product candidates and other product candidates that we may develop, in-license or acquire in the future. We do not anticipate that we will generate revenue from the sale of products for the foreseeable future. Our ability to generate future product revenue from our current or future product candidates also depends on additional factors, including our or our partners\u2019 ability to:\n\u2022\nsuccessfully complete research and clinical development of current and future product candidates;\n\u2022\nestablish and maintain supply and manufacturing relationships with third parties to ensure adequate, timely and compliant manufacturing of bulk drug substances and drug products to maintain our or our partners\u2019 supply of such bulk drug substances and drug products;\n\u2022\nlaunch and commercialize any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval, and if we launch independently or with certain partners, successfully establish a sales force and marketing and distribution infrastructure;\n\u2022\nobtain coverage and adequate product reimbursement from third-party payors, including government payors;\n\u2022\nsuccessfully and timely develop, validate and obtain any necessary regulatory approvals for companion diagnostics to any of our approved product candidates;\n\u2022\nachieve market acceptance for any of our or our partners\u2019 approved products;\n\u2022\nacquire rights to and otherwise establish, maintain and protect intellectual property rights necessary to develop and commercialize our product candidates; and\n\u2022\nattract, hire and retain qualified personnel.\nIn addition, because of the numerous risks and uncertainties generally associated with development of pharmaceutical products, including that they may not advance through clinical development or achieve the endpoints of applicable clinical trials, we are unable to predict the timing or amount of expenses associated with development of our product candidates, or if or when we will achieve or maintain profitability. In addition, our expenses could increase beyond our current expectations if we decide to or are required by the FDA or any comparable foreign regulatory authority to perform studies or trials in addition to those that we currently anticipate. Even if we successfully complete the development and regulatory processes described above, we expect that we will incur significant costs in connection with launching and commercializing our products.\nEven if we generate revenue from the sale of any of our products that may be approved, we may not become profitable and may need to obtain additional funding to continue operations. If we fail to become profitable or do not sustain profitability on a continuing basis, then we may be unable to continue our operations at planned levels and be forced to reduce our operations.\nRisks Related to the Ownership of Our Common Stock and Other General Matters\nThe market price of our stock is volatile.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been and is likely to continue to be volatile. Since shares of our common stock were sold in our initial public offering in September 2013, our closing stock price as reported on The Nasdaq Global Market and The Nasdaq Global Select Market has ranged from $1.86 to $60.89 through March 15, 2021. The following factors, in addition to other risk factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and elsewhere in this report, may have a significant impact on the market price of our common stock:\n\u2022\nresults or status of or plans for clinical trials of our product candidates or those of our competitors, as well as interpretation and perception of such results, status or plans by third parties;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us, our partners or our competitors of significant acquisitions, strategic collaborations, joint ventures, collaborations or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nsuccess or failure of products or technologies that compete or may compete with our product candidates and technologies;\n\u2022\nregulatory actions with respect to our product candidates or our competitors\u2019 products;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated changes in our or our partners\u2019 growth rates relative to our competitors;\n\u2022\nfailure of our partners to effectively execute or changes in our partners\u2019 strategies with respect to our product candidates or collaborations;\n\u2022\nregulatory or legal developments in the United States and other countries;\n\u2022\ndevelopments or disputes concerning our patent applications, issued patents or other proprietary rights;\n\u2022\nour dependence on third parties, including CMOs, CROs and collaboration partners, including those we may engage to develop and provide us with companion diagnostic products;\n\u2022\nrecruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u2022\nlevel of expenses related to any of our product candidates or clinical development programs;\n\u2022\nresults of our efforts to in-license or acquire additional product candidates or products;\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated changes in estimates as to our financial results, development timelines or recommendations by securities analysts;\n\u2022\nvariations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be comparable to us;\n\u2022\nfluctuations in the valuation of companies perceived by investors to be comparable to us;\n\u2022\nshare price and volume fluctuations attributable to inconsistent trading volume levels of our shares;\n\u2022\nannouncements or expectations of additional financing efforts;\n\u2022\nsales of our common stock by us, our insiders or our other stockholders;\n\u2022\nchanges in the structure of healthcare payment systems;\n\u2022\nmarket conditions in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sectors; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic, industry, political and market conditions and overall fluctuations in the financial markets in the United States and abroad, including as a result of ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and The Nasdaq Global Select Market and biotechnology companies, in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the relevant companies, including in connection with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which has resulted in decreased stock prices for many companies notwithstanding the lack of a fundamental change in their underlying business models or prospects. Broad market and industry factors, including potentially worsening economic conditions and other adverse effects or developments relating to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, may negatively affect the market price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance. The realization of any of the above risks or any of a broad range of other risks, including those described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, could have a dramatic and material adverse impact on the market price of our common stock.\nIf equity research analysts do not publish research or reports, or publish unfavorable research or reports, about us, our business or our market, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock is influenced by the research and reports that equity research analysts publish about us and our business. We have only limited research coverage by equity research analysts. Equity research analysts may elect not to initiate research coverage of our common stock or may discontinue research coverage, and a lack of research coverage may adversely affect the market price of our common stock. We do not have any control over the analysts or the content and opinions included in their reports. The price of our shares could decline if one or more equity research analysts downgrade our shares or issue other unfavorable commentary or research about us. If one or more equity research analysts ceases coverage of us or fails to publish reports on us regularly, demand for our shares could decrease, which in turn could cause the trading price or trading volume of our common stock to decline.\nWe may be subject to securities litigation, which is expensive and could divert management attention.\nThe market price of our common stock has declined over in recent years and may continue to be volatile. In the past, companies that have experienced volatility in the market price of their stock have been subject to securities class action litigation and we may become a target of this type of litigation in the future. Securities litigation against us could result in substantial costs and divert our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns, which could seriously harm our business.\nOur principal stockholders and management own a significant percentage of our stock and may be able to exert significant control over matters subject to stockholder approval.\nAs of December 31, 2020, our executive officers, directors, holders of 5% or more of our capital stock and their respective affiliates beneficially owned approximately 24% of our common stock. This concentration of share ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock because investors often perceive disadvantages in owning stock in companies with controlling stockholders. As a result, these stockholders, acting together, could significantly influence all matters requiring approval by our stockholders, including the election of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions. The interests of these stockholders may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market by our existing stockholders could cause our stock price to fall.\nSales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that these sales might occur could depress the market price of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity securities. We are unable to predict the effect that sales may have on the prevailing market price of our common stock.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud.\nWe are subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or the Exchange Act. We designed our disclosure controls and procedures to reasonably assure that information we must disclose in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, and recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the Securities and Exchange Commission. We believe that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures, no matter how well-conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met.\nThese inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the controls. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in our control system, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nChanges in tax laws or regulations that are applied adversely to us may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nNew tax laws or regulations could be enacted at any time, and existing tax laws or regulations could be interpreted, modified or applied in a manner that is adverse to us, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition. For example, the Tax Act resulted in many significant changes to the U.S. tax laws, including changes in corporate tax rates, the utilization of our net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, and other deferred tax assets, the deductibility of expenses, and the taxation of foreign earnings. Future guidance from the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities with respect to the Tax Act may affect us, and certain aspects of the Tax Act could be repealed or modified by future legislation. For example, the CARES Act modified certain provisions of the Tax Act. In addition, it is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to the Tax Act, the CARES Act, or any newly enacted federal tax legislation. The impact of changes under the Tax Act, the CARES Act, or future reform legislation could increase our future U.S. tax expense and could have a material adverse impact on our business and financial condition.\nOur ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nOur NOLs could expire unused and be unavailable to offset future income tax liabilities because of their limited duration or because of restrictions under U.S. tax law. Our NOLs generated in tax years ending on or prior to December 31, 2017 are permitted to be carried forward for only 20 years under applicable U.S. tax law. Our federal NOLs generated in tax years ending after December 31, 2017 may be carried forward indefinitely, but the deductibility of federal NOLs generated in tax years beginning after December 31, 2020 is subject to certain limitations. It is uncertain if and to what extent various states will conform to these provisions of U.S. tax law.\nIn addition, under Section 382 and Section 383 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and corresponding provisions of state law, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change,\u201d its ability to use its pre-change NOLs and other pre-change tax attributes (such as research tax credits) to offset its post-change income may be limited. A Section 382 \u201cownership change\u201d generally occurs if one or more stockholders or groups of stockholders who own at least 5% of our stock increase their ownership by more than 50 percentage points (by value) over their lowest ownership percentage over a rolling three-year period. We may have experienced ownership changes in the past and may experience ownership changes in the future as a result of shifts in our stock ownership, some of which are outside our control. As a result, if we earn net taxable income, our ability to use our pre-change NOLs to offset such taxable income may be subject to limitations.\nSimilar provisions of state tax law may also apply to limit our use of accumulated state tax attributes. In addition, at the state level, there may be periods during which the use of NOLs is suspended or otherwise limited, which could accelerate or permanently increase state taxes owed. In addition, California Assembly Bill 85, or AB 85, was signed into law by Governor Gavin Newsom on June 29, 2020. AB 85 suspends the California NOL deductions for 2020, 2021 and 2022 for certain taxpayers and imposes a limitation of certain California tax credits for 2020, 2021 and 2022. AB 85 disallows the use of California NOL deductions if the taxpayer recognizes business income and its adjusted gross income is greater than $1,000,000. The carryover periods for NOL deductions disallowed by this provision will be extended. As a result, if we earn net taxable income during this period, our ability to use tax attributes may be limited and increase state taxes owed. Consequently, even if we achieve profitability, we may not be able to utilize a material portion of our NOLs and certain other tax attributes, which could have a material adverse effect on cash flow and results of operations.\nSome provisions of our charter documents and Delaware law may have anti-takeover effects that could discourage an acquisition of us by others, even if an acquisition would benefit our stockholders, and may prevent attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management.\nProvisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws, as well as provisions of Delaware law, could make it more difficult or costly for a third party to acquire us, even if doing so would benefit our stockholders, and could make it more difficult to remove our current management. These provisions include:\n\u2022\nauthorizing the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock, the terms of which we may establish and shares of which we may issue without stockholder approval;\n\u2022\nprohibiting cumulative voting in the election of directors, which would otherwise allow for less than a majority of stockholders to elect director candidates;\n\u2022\nprohibiting stockholder action by written consent, thereby requiring all stockholder actions to be taken at a meeting of our stockholders;\n\u2022\neliminating the ability of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders; and\n\u2022\nestablishing advance notice requirements for nominations for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon at stockholder meetings.\nThese provisions may frustrate or prevent any attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management by making it more difficult for stockholders to replace members of our board of directors, who are responsible for appointing the members of our management. Because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, or the DGCL, which may discourage, delay or prevent someone from acquiring us or merging with us whether or not it is desired by or beneficial to our stockholders. Under the DGCL, a corporation may not, in general, engage in a business combination with any holder of 15% or more of its capital stock unless the holder has held the stock for three years or, among other things, the board of directors has approved the transaction. Any provision of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or amended and restated bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change of control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.", "PERMNO": 14161, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "FPRX"}
