{"cik": "939767", "company": "EXELIXIS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2021-02-11", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nIn addition to the risks discussed elsewhere in this report, the following are important factors that make an investment in our securities speculative or risky, and that could cause actual results or events to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statements made by us or on our behalf. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we deem immaterial also may impair our business operations. If any of the following risks or such other risks actually occur, our business and the value of your investment in our company could be harmed.\nRisks Related to the Commercialization of Our Products\nOur ability to grow our company is critically dependent upon the commercial success of CABOMETYX in its approved indications and the further clinical development, regulatory approval and commercial success of the cabozantinib franchise in additional indications.\nWe anticipate that for the foreseeable future, our ability to maintain or meaningfully increase cash flow to fund our business operations and growth will depend upon the continued commercial success of CABOMETYX, both alone and in combination with other therapies, as a treatment for the highly competitive indications for which it is approved, and possibly for other indications for which cabozantinib has been or is currently being evaluated in potentially label-enabling clinical trials, if warranted by the data generated from these trials. In this regard, part of our strategy is to pursue additional\nindications for the cabozantinib franchise to increase the number of cancer patients who could benefit from this medicine. However, we cannot be certain that the clinical trials we and our collaboration partners are currently conducting, or may conduct in the future, will demonstrate adequate safety and efficacy in these additional indications to receive regulatory approval in the major commercial markets where CABOMETYX is approved. Even if we and our collaboration partners receive the required regulatory approvals to market cabozantinib for additional indications, we and our collaboration partners may not be able to commercialize CABOMETYX effectively and successfully in these additional indications. If revenue from CABOMETYX decreases or remains flat, or if we are unable to expand the labeled indications in major commercial markets where CABOMETYX is approved, or if we or our partners fail to achieve anticipated product royalties and collaboration milestones, whether as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, we may need to reduce our operating expenses, access other sources of cash or otherwise modify our business plans, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur ability to grow revenues from sales of CABOMETYX will depend upon the degree of market acceptance among physicians, patients, healthcare payers, and the medical community.\nOur ability to increase or maintain revenues from sales of CABOMETYX for its approved indications is, and if approved for additional indications will be, highly dependent upon the extent of market acceptance of CABOMETYX among physicians, patients, government healthcare payers such as Medicare and Medicaid, commercial healthcare plans and the medical community. Market acceptance for CABOMETYX could depend on numerous factors, including the effectiveness and safety profile, or the perceived effectiveness and safety profile, of CABOMETYX compared to competing products, the strength of CABOMETYX sales and marketing efforts and changes in pricing and reimbursement for CABOMETYX. For example, with respect to the recent FDA approval of CABOMETYX in combination with OPDIVO as a first-line treatment of patients with advanced RCC, we cannot predict whether our commercialization efforts will lead to increased adoption of this combination by healthcare professionals, who may continue to treat first-line RCC patients with competing product combinations and reserve CABOMETYX for later in their treatment plan. If CABOMETYX does not continue to be prescribed broadly for the treatment of its approved RCC and HCC indications, our product revenues could flatten or decrease, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur competitors may develop products, combination therapies and technologies that impair the relative value of our marketed products and any future product candidates.\nThe biotechnology, biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical industries are competitive and are characterized by constant technological change and diverse offerings of products, particularly in the area of novel oncology therapies. Many of our competitors have greater capital resources, larger research and development staff and facilities, deeper regulatory expertise and more extensive product manufacturing and commercial capabilities than we do, which may afford them a competitive advantage. Further, our competitors may be more effective at in-licensing and developing new commercial products that could render our products, and those of our collaboration partners, obsolete and noncompetitive. We face, and will continue to face, intense competition from biotechnology, biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical companies, as well as academic research institutions, clinical reference laboratories and government agencies that are pursuing scientific and clinical research activities similar to ours.\nFurthermore, the specific indications for which CABOMETYX is currently or may be approved, based on the results from clinical trials currently evaluating cabozantinib, are highly competitive. Several novel therapies and combinations of therapies have been approved, are in advanced stages of clinical development or are under expedited regulatory review in these indications, and these other therapies are currently competing or are expected to compete with CABOMETYX. Given the shifting landscape of therapeutic strategy following the advent of ICIs, we believe our future success will depend upon our ability to achieve positive clinical trial results for therapies combining cabozantinib with ICIs across multiple indications, and if approved, successfully commercialize such combination therapies. While we have had success in adapting our development strategy for the cabozantinib franchise to address the expanding role of therapies that combine ICIs with other targeted agents, including the recent FDA approval of CABOMETYX in combination with OPDIVO as a first-line treatment of patients with advanced RCC, it is uncertain whether current and future clinical trials, including those evaluating cabozantinib in combination with an ICI in HCC, NSCLC and mCRPC, will lead to regulatory approvals, or whether physicians will prescribe regimens containing cabozantinib instead of competing product combinations. Moreover, the complexities of such a development strategy have required and are likely to continue to require collaboration with some of our competitors.\nIf we are unable to maintain or increase our sales, marketing, market access and product distribution capabilities for our products, we may be unable to maximize product revenues, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nMaintaining our sales, marketing, market access and product distribution capabilities requires significant resources, and there are numerous risks involved with maintaining and continuously improving such a commercial organization, including our potential inability to successfully recruit, train, retain and incentivize adequate numbers of qualified and effective sales and marketing personnel. We are competing for talent with numerous commercial- and precommercial-stage, oncology-focused biotechnology companies seeking to build out and maintain their commercial organizations, as well as other large pharmaceutical and biotechnology organizations that have extensive, well-funded and more experienced sales and marketing operations, and we may be unable to maintain or adequately scale our commercial organization as a result of such competition. Also, to the extent that the commercial opportunities for CABOMETYX grow over time, we may not properly scale the size and experience of our commercialization teams to market and sell CABOMETYX successfully in an expanded number of indications. If we are unable to maintain or scale our commercial function appropriately, or should we have to maintain primarily telephonic and virtual interactions in lieu of in-person meetings with healthcare professionals for an extended period of time as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we may not be able to maximize product revenues, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to obtain or maintain coverage and reimbursement for our products from third-party payers, our business will suffer.\nOur ability to commercialize our products successfully is highly dependent on the extent to which health insurance coverage and reimbursement is, and will be, available from third-party payers, including governmental payers, such as Medicare and Medicaid, and private health insurers. Third-party payers continue to scrutinize and manage access to pharmaceutical products and services and may limit reimbursement for newly approved products and indications. Patients are generally not capable of paying for CABOMETYX or COMETRIQ themselves and rely on third-party payers to pay for, or subsidize, the costs of their medications, among other medical costs. Accordingly, market acceptance of CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ is dependent on the extent to which coverage and reimbursement is available from third-party payers. These entities could refuse, limit or condition coverage for our products, such as by using tiered reimbursement or pressing for new forms of contracting. If third-party payers do not provide coverage or reimbursement for CABOMETYX or COMETRIQ, our revenues and results of operations will suffer. In addition, even if third-party payers provide some coverage or reimbursement for CABOMETYX or COMETRIQ, the availability of such coverage or reimbursement for prescription drugs under private health insurance and managed care plans, which often varies based on the type of contract or plan purchased, may not be sufficient for patients to afford CABOMETYX or COMETRIQ.\nCurrent healthcare laws and regulations in the U.S. and future legislative or regulatory reforms to the U.S. healthcare system may affect our ability to commercialize our marketed products profitably.\nFederal and state governments in the U.S. are considering legislative and regulatory proposals to change the U.S. healthcare system in ways that could affect our ability to continue to commercialize CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ profitably. Similarly, among policy makers and payers, there is significant interest in promoting such changes with the stated goals of containing healthcare costs, improving quality and expanding patient access. The life sciences industry and specifically the market for the sale, insurance coverage and distribution of pharmaceuticals has been a particular focus of these efforts and would likely be significantly affected by any major legislative or regulatory initiatives.\nFor instance, efforts to repeal, substantially modify or invalidate some or all of the provisions of the PPACA, some of which have been successful, create considerable uncertainties for all businesses involved in healthcare, including our own. Although such efforts have not significantly impacted our business to date, there is no assurance that the repeal, modification or invalidation of some or all of the provisions of the PPACA in the future, will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and we cannot predict how future federal or state legislative or administrative changes relating to healthcare reform will affect our business.\nIn addition, there are pending federal and state-level legislative proposals that would significantly expand government-provided health insurance coverage, ranging from establishing a single-payer, national health insurance system to more limited \u201cbuy-in\u201d options to existing public health insurance programs, each of which could have a significant impact on the healthcare industry. It is also possible that additional governmental actions will be taken in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and that such actions would have a significant impact on these public health insurance programs.\nWhile we cannot predict how future legislation (or enacted legislation that has yet to be implemented) will affect our business, such proposals could have the potential to impact access to and sales of our products. Furthermore, the expansion of the 340B Drug Discount Program has increased the number of purchasers who claim eligibility for significant discounts on branded drugs, including our marketed products. Due to general uncertainty in the current regulatory and healthcare policy environment, and specifically regarding positions that the new Biden Administration may take with respect to these issues, we are unable to predict the impact of any legislative, regulatory, third-party payer or policy actions, including potential cost containment and healthcare reform measures. If enacted, we and any third parties we may engage may be unable to adapt to any changes implemented as a result of such measures, and we may have difficulties in sustaining profitability or otherwise experience a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nPricing for pharmaceutical products in the U.S. has come under increasing attention and scrutiny by federal and state governments, legislative bodies and enforcement agencies. These activities may result in actions that have the effect of reducing our revenue or harming our business or reputation.\nThere have been several recent U.S. Congressional inquiries, hearings and proposed and enacted federal legislation and rules, as well as Executive Orders, designed to, among other things: reduce or limit the prices of drugs and make them more affordable for patients (including, for example, by tying the prices that Medicare reimburses for physician-administered drugs to the prices of drugs in other countries); reform the structure and financing of Medicare Part D pharmaceutical benefits, including through increasing manufacturer contributions to offset Medicare beneficiary costs; bring more transparency to drug pricing rationale and methodologies; enable the government to negotiate prices under Medicare; revise rules associated with the calculation of average manufacturer price and best price under Medicaid, which affect the amount of rebates that we pay on prescription drugs under Medicaid and to covered entities under the 340B Drug Discount Program; eliminate the AKS discount safe harbor protection for manufacturer rebate arrangements with Medicare Part D plan sponsors; create new AKS safe harbors applicable to certain point-of-sale discounts to patients and fixed fee administrative fee payment arrangements with pharmacy benefit managers; and facilitate the importation of certain lower-cost drugs from other countries. While we cannot know the final form or timing of any such legislative, regulatory and/or administrative measures, some of the pending and enacted legislative proposals or executive rulemaking, such as those incorporating International Pricing Index or Most-Favored-Nation models, if implemented without successful legal challenges, would likely have a significant and far-reaching impact on the biopharmaceutical industry and therefore also likely have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAt the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including restrictions on pricing or reimbursement at the state government level, limitations on discounts to patients, marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, policies to encourage importation from other countries (subject to federal approval) and bulk purchasing, including the National Medicaid Pooling Initiative. In particular, the obligation to provide notices of price increases to purchasers under laws such as California\u2019s SB-17 may influence customer ordering patterns for CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ, which in turn may increase the volatility of our revenues as a reflection of changes in inventory volumes. Furthermore, adoption of these drug pricing transparency regulations, and our associated compliance obligations, may increase general and administrative costs and/or diminish our revenues as a result of the imposition of caps on pricing and price increases. Therefore, the implementation of these cost-containment measures or other healthcare reforms may result in fluctuations in our results of operations and limit our ability to generate product revenue or commercialize our products.\nLengthy regulatory pricing and reimbursement procedures and cost control initiatives imposed by governments outside the U.S. could delay the marketing of and/or result in downward pressure on the price of our approved products, resulting in a decrease in revenue.\nOutside the U.S., particularly in the EU, the pricing and reimbursement of prescription pharmaceuticals is generally subject to governmental control. In EU countries, pricing and reimbursement negotiations with governmental authorities or payers can take six to 12 months or longer after the initial marketing authorization is granted for a product, or after the marketing authorization for a new indication is granted. This can substantially delay broad availability of the product. To obtain reimbursement and/or pricing approval in some countries, our collaboration partner Ipsen may also be required to conduct a study that seeks to establish the cost effectiveness of CABOMETYX compared with other available established therapies. The conduct of such a study could also result in delays in the commercialization of CABOMETYX. Additionally, cost-control initiatives, increasingly based on affordability, could decrease the price we and Ipsen might establish for CABOMETYX, which would result in lower license revenues to us.\nLegislation and regulatory action designed to facilitate the development, approval and adoption of generic drugs in the U.S., and the entrance of generic competitors, could limit the revenue we derive from our products, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUnder the FDCA, the FDA can approve an ANDA for a generic version of a branded drug without the applicant undertaking the human clinical testing necessary to obtain approval to market a new drug. The FDA can also approve an NDA under section 505(b)(2) of the FDCA that relies in whole or in part on the agency\u2019s findings of safety and/or effectiveness for a previously approved drug. Both the ANDA and 505(b)(2) processes are discussed in more detail above in \u201cItem 1. Business\u201d under the heading \u201cGovernment Regulation-FDA Review and Approval\u201d in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In either case, if an ANDA or 505(b)(2) applicant submits an application referencing one of our marketed products prior to the expiry of one or more our Orange Book-listed patents for the applicable product, we may litigate with the potential generic competitor to protect our patent rights, which would result in substantial costs and divert the attention of management, and could have an adverse impact on our stock price. For example, MSN has submitted an ANDA to the FDA requesting approval to market a generic version of CABOMETYX tablets. For a more detailed discussion of this litigation matter, see \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d in Part I, Item 3 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. It is possible that MSN or other companies, following FDA approval of an ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA, could introduce generic versions of our marketed products before our patents expire if they do not infringe our patents or if it is determined that our patents are invalid or unenforceable, and we expect that generic cabozantinib products would be offered at a significantly lower price compared to our marketed cabozantinib products. Therefore, regardless of the regulatory approach, the introduction of a generic version of cabozantinib could significantly decrease our revenues derived from the U.S. sales of CABOMETYX and thereby materially harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe U.S. federal government has also taken numerous legislative and regulatory actions to expedite the development and approval of generic drugs and biosimilars. The FDA Reauthorization Act of 2017 includes, inter alia, measures to expedite the development and approval of generic products, where generic competition is lacking even in the absence of exclusivities or listed patents. In addition, the FDA has also released a Drug Competition Action Plan, which proposes actions to broaden access to generic drugs and lower consumers\u2019 healthcare costs by, among other things, improving the efficiency of the generic drug approval process and supporting the development of complex generic drugs, and the FDA has taken steps to implement this plan. Moreover, both Congress and the FDA are considering various legislative and regulatory proposals focused on drug competition, including legislation focused on drug patenting and provision of drug to generic applicants for testing. For example, the Creating and Restoring Equal Access To Equivalent Samples (CREATES) Act of 2019, signed into law as part of the 2019 year-end federal spending package, purports to promote competition in the market for drugs and biological products by facilitating the timely entry of lower-cost generic and biosimilar versions of those drugs and biological products, including by allowing generic manufacturers access to branded drug samples. While the full impact of the CREATES Act is unclear at this time, its provisions do have the potential to facilitate the development and future approval of generic versions of our products, introducing generic competition that could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Healthcare Regulatory and Other Legal Compliance Matters\nWe are subject to healthcare laws, regulations and enforcement; our failure to comply with those laws could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to federal and state healthcare laws and regulations, which laws and regulations are enforced by the federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. Should our compliance controls prove ineffective at preventing or mitigating the risk and impact of improper business conduct or inaccurate reporting, we could be subject to enforcement of the following, including, without limitation:\n\u2022the federal AKS;\n\u2022the FDCA and its implementing regulations;\n\u2022federal civil and criminal false claims laws, including the civil False Claims Act, and civil monetary penalty laws;\n\u2022federal criminal laws that prohibit executing a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or making false statements relating to healthcare matters;\n\u2022HIPAA and its implementing regulations;\n\u2022state law equivalents of each of the above federal laws;\n\u2022the Open Payments program of the PPACA;\n\u2022state and local laws and regulations that require drug manufacturers to file reports relating to marketing activities, payments and other remuneration and items of value provided to healthcare professionals and entities; and\n\u2022state and federal pharmaceutical price and price reporting laws and regulations.\nIn addition, we may be subject to the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, a U.S. law which regulates certain financial relationships with foreign government officials (which could include, for example, medical professionals employed by national healthcare programs) and its foreign equivalents, as well as federal and state consumer protection and unfair competition laws.\nThese federal and state healthcare laws and regulations govern drug marketing practices, including off-label promotion. If our operations are found, or even alleged, to be in violation of the laws described above or other governmental regulations that apply to us, we, or our officers or employees, may be subject to significant penalties, including administrative civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines, regulatory penalties, the curtailment or restructuring of our operations, exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs, imprisonment, reputational harm, additional reporting requirements and oversight, any of which would adversely affect our ability to sell our products and operate our business and also adversely affect our financial results. Furthermore, responding to any such allegation and/or defending against any such enforcement actions can be time-consuming and would require significant financial and personnel resources. Therefore, if any state or the federal government initiates an enforcement action against us, our business may be impaired, and even if we are ultimately successful in our defense, litigating these actions could result in substantial costs and divert the attention of management.\nEnhanced governmental and private scrutiny over, or investigations or litigation involving, pharmaceutical manufacturer donations to patient assistance programs offered by charitable foundations could negatively impact our business practices, harm our reputation, divert the attention of management and increase our expenses.\nTo help patients afford our products, we have a patient assistance program and also occasionally make donations to independent charitable foundations that help financially needy patients. These types of programs designed to assist patients with affording pharmaceuticals have become the subject of Congressional interest and enhanced government scrutiny. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Inspector General established guidelines permitting pharmaceutical manufacturers to make donations to charitable organizations that provide co-pay assistance to Medicare patients, provided that manufacturers meet certain specified compliance requirements. In the event we make such donations but are found not to have complied with these guidelines and other laws or regulations respecting the operation of these programs, we could be subject to significant damages, fines, penalties or other criminal, civil or administrative sanctions or enforcement actions. We also rely on a third-party hub provider and exercise oversight to monitor patient assistance program activities. Hub providers are generally hired by manufacturers to assist patients with insurance coverage, financial assistance and treatment support after the patients receive a prescription from their healthcare professional. For manufacturers of specialty pharmaceuticals (including our marketed products), the ability to have a single point of contact for their therapies helps ensure efficient medication distribution to patients. Accordingly, our hub activities are also subject to scrutiny and may create risk for us if not conducted appropriately. A variety of entities, including independent charitable foundations and pharmaceutical manufacturers, but not including our company, have received subpoenas from the U.S. Department of Justice and other enforcement authorities seeking information related to their patient assistance programs and support. Should we or our hub providers receive a subpoena or other process, regardless of whether we are ultimately found to have complied with the regulations governing patient assistance programs, this type of government investigation could negatively impact our business practices, harm our reputation, divert the attention of management and increase our expenses.\nWe are subject to laws and regulations relating to privacy, data protection and the collection and processing of personal data. Failure to maintain compliance with these regulations could create additional liabilities for us.\nThe legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data protection continues to evolve globally and in the U.S. For example, the CCPA went into operation in 2020 and affords California residents expanded privacy rights and protections, including civil penalties for violations and statutory damages under a private right of action for data security breaches. These protections will be expanded by CPRA, which will be operational in most key respects on January 1, 2023. Similar legislative proposals are being advanced in other states and Congress is also considering federal privacy legislation. In addition, most healthcare providers are subject to privacy and security requirements under HIPAA. Although we are not considered to be a covered entity or business associate under HIPAA, we could be subject to penalties if we use or disclose individually identifiable health information in a manner not authorized or permitted by HIPAA. Other countries also have, or\nare developing, laws governing the collection, use and transmission of personal information. For example, the EU General Data Protection Regulation 2016/679 (GDPR) regulates the processing of personal data of individuals within the EU, even if, under certain circumstances, that processing occurs outside the EU, and also restricts transfers of such data to countries outside of the EU, including the U.S. Should we fail to provide adequate privacy or data security protections or maintain compliance with these laws and regulations, including the CCPA, CPRA and GDPR, we could be subject to sanctions or other penalties, litigation or an increase in our cost of doing business.\nRisks Related to Growth of Our Product Portfolio and Research and Development\nClinical testing of cabozantinib for new indications, or of new product candidates, is a lengthy, costly, complex and uncertain process that may fail ultimately to demonstrate safety and efficacy for those products sufficiently impressive to compete in our highly competitive market environment.\nClinical trials are inherently risky and may reveal that cabozantinib, despite its approval for certain indications, or a new product candidate, is ineffective or has an unacceptable safety profile with respect to an intended use. Such results may significantly decrease the likelihood of regulatory approval of that product for a particular indication. Moreover, the results of preliminary studies do not necessarily predict clinical or commercial success, and late-stage or other potentially label-enabling clinical trials may fail to confirm the results observed in early-stage trials or preliminary studies. Although we have established timelines for manufacturing and clinical development of cabozantinib and our other product candidates based on existing knowledge of our compounds in development and industry metrics, we may not be able to meet those timelines.\nWe may experience numerous unforeseen events, during or as a result of clinical investigations, that could delay or prevent commercialization of cabozantinib (or of other product candidates) in new indications, and in some cases, as described in the risk factor titled, \u201cIf the COVID-19 pandemic is further prolonged or becomes more severe, our business operations and corresponding financial results could suffer, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and prospects for growth,\u201d the COVID-19 pandemic has already increased and may further increase the potential for such developments to occur. These may include:\n\u2022lack of acceptable efficacy or a tolerable safety profile;\n\u2022negative or inconclusive clinical trial results that require us to conduct further testing or to abandon projects;\n\u2022discovery or commercialization by our competitors of other compounds or therapies that show significantly improved safety or efficacy compared to cabozantinib or our other product candidates;\n\u2022our inability to identify and maintain a sufficient number of trial sites;\n\u2022lower-than-anticipated patient registration or enrollment in our clinical testing;\n\u2022additional complexities posed by clinical trials evaluating cabozantinib or our other product candidates in combination with other therapies, including the failure by our collaboration partners to provide us with an adequate and timely supply of product that complies with the applicable quality and regulatory requirements for a combination trial;\n\u2022failure of our third-party contract research organizations or investigators to satisfy their contractual obligations, including deviating from any trial protocols; and\n\u2022withholding of authorization from regulators or institutional review boards to commence or conduct clinical trials or delays, suspensions or terminations of clinical research for various reasons, including noncompliance with regulatory requirements or a determination by these regulators and institutional review boards that participating patients are being exposed to unacceptable health risks.\nIf there are further delays in or termination of the clinical testing of cabozantinib or our other product candidates due to any of the events described above or otherwise, our expenses could increase and our ability to generate revenues could be impaired, either of which could adversely impact our financial results. Furthermore, we rely on our collaboration partners to fund a significant portion of our clinical development programs. Should one or all of our collaboration partners decline to support future planned clinical trials, we will be entirely responsible for financing the further development of the cabozantinib franchise or our other product candidates and, as a result, we may be unable to execute our current business plans, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to pursue the further development of the cabozantinib franchise or our other product candidates or meet current or future requirements of the FDA or regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions in accordance with our stated timelines or at all. Our planned clinical trials may not begin on time, or at all, may not be completed on\nschedule, or at all, may not be sufficient for registration of our product candidates or may not result in an approvable product. The duration and the cost of clinical trials vary significantly as a result of factors relating to the clinical trial, including, among others: characteristics of the product candidate under investigation; the number of patients who ultimately participate in the clinical trial; the duration of patient follow-up; the number of clinical sites included in the trials; and the length of time required to enroll eligible patients.\nAny delay could limit our ability to generate revenues, cause us to incur additional expense and cause the market price of our common stock to decline significantly. Our partners under our collaboration agreements may experience similar risks with respect to the compounds we have out-licensed to them. If any of the events described above were to occur with such programs or compounds, the likelihood of receipt of milestones and royalties under such collaboration agreements could decrease.\nThe regulatory approval processes of the FDA and comparable foreign regulatory authorities are lengthy and uncertain and may not result in regulatory approvals for cabozantinib or our other product candidates, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe activities associated with the research, development and commercialization of the cabozantinib franchise and our other product candidates are subject to extensive regulation by the FDA and other regulatory agencies in the U.S., as well as by comparable authorities in other territories. The processes of obtaining regulatory approvals in the U.S. and other foreign jurisdictions is expensive and often takes many years, if approval is obtained at all, and they can vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidates involved. For example, before an NDA or sNDA can be submitted to the FDA, or an MAA to the EMA or any application or submission to regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions, the product candidate must undergo extensive clinical trials, which can take many years and require substantial expenditures.\nAny clinical trial may fail to produce results satisfactory to the FDA or regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions. The FDA has substantial discretion in the approval process and may refuse to approve any NDA or sNDA or decide that our data is insufficient for approval and require additional preclinical, clinical or other studies. In addition, we may encounter delays or rejections based upon changes in policy, which could cause delays in the approval or rejection of an application for cabozantinib or for our other product candidates.\nEven if the FDA or a comparable authority in another jurisdiction approves cabozantinib for one or more new indications, such approval may be limited, imposing significant restrictions on the indicated uses, conditions for use, labeling, distribution, and/or production of the product and could impose requirements for post-approval studies, including additional research and clinical trials, all of which may result in significant expense and limit our and our collaboration partners\u2019 ability to commercialize cabozantinib in one or more new indications. For example, based on the regulatory feedback from the FDA, and if supported by the clinical data from COSMIC-021, we intend to submit an sNDA to the FDA seeking accelerated approval of cabozantinib in an mCRPC indication in 2021. We expect that as a condition of any potential approval accelerated approval, the FDA will require us to perform confirmatory post-marketing clinical trials to confirm the clinical benefit, if any, of cabozantinib in combination with Roche\u2019s atezolizumab in patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors, such as mCRPC. Failure to complete post-marketing requirements of the FDA in connection with a specific approval in accordance with the timelines and conditions set forth by the FDA could significantly increase costs or delay, limit or ultimately restrict the commercialization of cabozantinib in that indication. Further, regulatory agencies could also impose various administrative, civil or criminal sanctions for failure to comply with regulatory requirements, including withdrawal of product approval. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Congress enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act and the Coronavirus Response and Relief Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2021, Presidents Trump and Biden have issued various executive orders, and additional legislative, executive, and regulatory proposals are pending to, among other things, prevent drug shortages and reduce the dependency of the United States on foreign supply chains and manufacturing. While we are still assessing these enacted and proposed changes, they could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe may be unable to expand our development pipeline, which could limit our growth and revenue potential.\nOur business is focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of new medicines for difficult-to-treat cancers. In this regard, we have invested in substantial technical, financial and human resources toward drug discovery activities with the goal of identifying new product candidates to advance into clinical trials. Notwithstanding this investment, many programs that initially show promise will ultimately fail to yield product candidates for multiple reasons. For example, product candidates may, on further study, be shown to have inadequate efficacy, harmful side effects,\nsuboptimal pharmaceutical profiles or other characteristics suggesting that they are unlikely to be commercially viable products.\nApart from our drug discovery efforts, our strategy to expand our development pipeline is also dependent on our ability to successfully identify and acquire or in-license relevant product candidates. However, the in-licensing and acquisition of product candidates is a highly competitive area, and many other companies are pursuing the same or similar product candidates to those that we may consider attractive. In particular, larger companies with more capital resources and more extensive clinical development and commercialization capabilities may have a competitive advantage over us. Furthermore, companies that perceive us to be a competitor may be unwilling to assign or license rights to us. We may also be unable to in-license or acquire additional product candidates on acceptable terms that would allow us to realize an appropriate return on our investment. Even if we succeed in our efforts to obtain rights to suitable product candidates, the competitive business environment may result in higher acquisition or licensing costs, and our investment in these potential products will remain subject to the inherent risks associated with the development and commercialization of new medicines. In certain circumstances, we may also be reliant on the licensor for the continued development of the in-licensed technology and their efforts to safeguard their underlying intellectual property.\nWith respect to acquisitions, we may not be able to integrate the target company successfully into our existing business, maintain the key business relationships of the target, or retain key personnel of an acquired business. Furthermore, we could assume unknown or contingent liabilities or incur unanticipated expenses. Any acquisitions or investments made by us also could result in our spending significant amounts, issuing dilutive securities, assuming or incurring significant debt obligations and contingent liabilities, incurring large one-time expenses and acquiring intangible assets that could result in significant future amortization expense and significant write-offs, any of which could harm our financial condition and results of operations. If our drug discovery efforts, including research collaborations and in-licensing arrangements, do not result in suitable product candidates, our business and prospects for growth could suffer.\nRisks Related to Financial Matters and Capital Requirements\nOur profitability could be negatively impacted if expenses associated with our extensive clinical development, business development and commercialization activities, both for the cabozantinib franchise and our earlier-stage product candidates, grow more quickly than the revenues we generate.\nAlthough we reported net income of $111.8 million and $321.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, we may not be able to maintain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis, and we are unable to predict the extent of future profits or losses. The amount of our net profits or losses will depend, in part, on: the level of sales of CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ in the U.S.; our achievement of clinical, regulatory and commercial milestones, if any, under our collaboration agreements; the amount of royalties from sales of CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ outside of the U.S. under our collaboration agreements; other collaboration revenues; and the level of our expenses, including those associated with our extensive clinical development, business development and commercialization activities, both for the cabozantinib franchise and our earlier-stage product candidates. For example, we reported a net loss for the quarter ended September 30, 2020, primarily due to substantial increases in clinical trial costs, license and other collaboration costs, and personnel expenses relative to the prior fiscal quarters, and it is possible that we may experience net losses in future fiscal quarters or fiscal years, whether due to increases in costs and expenses or otherwise. We expect to continue to spend substantial amounts to fund the continued development of the cabozantinib franchise for additional indications and the commercialization of our approved products. In addition, we intend to continue to expand our oncology product pipeline through our drug discovery efforts, including research collaborations and in-licensing arrangements that align with our oncology drug development, regulatory and commercial expertise, which efforts could involve substantial costs. To offset these costs in the future, we will need to generate substantial revenues. If these costs exceed our current expectations, or we fail to achieve anticipated revenue targets, the market value of our common stock may decline.\nIf additional capital is not available to us when we need it, we may be unable to expand our product offerings and maintain business growth.\nOur commitment of cash resources to CABOMETYX and the reinvestment in our product pipeline through the continued development of the cabozantinib franchise and increasing drug discovery activities, as well as through the execution of business development transactions, could require us to obtain additional capital. We may seek such additional capital through some or all of the following methods: corporate collaborations; licensing arrangements; and public or private debt or equity financings. Our ability to obtain additional capital may depend on prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors beyond our control. Disruptions in the U.S. and global financial markets, including\ndisruptions that have resulted and may continue to result from the COVID-19 pandemic and the related downturn in the U.S. and global economy, as well as future potential U.S. federal government shutdowns, rising interest rate environments, increased or changed tariffs and trade restrictions or otherwise, may adversely impact the availability and cost of credit, as well as our ability to raise additional funds in the capital markets. Economic and capital markets conditions have been, and continue to be, volatile. Continued instability in these market conditions may limit our ability to access the capital necessary to fund and grow our business. In particular, our inability to access additional funds, whether due to the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, could in the future inhibit our ability to engage in larger-scale strategic transactions or investments. We do not know whether additional capital will be available when needed, or that, if available, we will obtain additional capital on terms favorable to us or our stockholders. If we are unable to raise additional funds when we need them, we may be unable to expand our product offerings and maintain business growth, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Our Relationships with Third Parties\nWe rely on Ipsen and Takeda for the commercial success of CABOMETYX in its approved indications outside of the U.S., and are unable to control the amount or timing of resources expended by these collaboration partners in the commercialization of CABOMETYX in its approved indications outside of the U.S.\nWe rely upon the regulatory, commercial, medical affairs, market access and other expertise and resources of our collaboration partners, Ipsen and Takeda, for commercialization of CABOMETYX in their respective territories outside of the U.S. We cannot control the amount and timing of resources that our collaboration partners dedicate to the commercialization of CABOMETYX, or to its marketing and distribution, and our ability to generate revenues from the commercialization of CABOMETYX by our collaboration partners depends on their ability to obtain and maintain regulatory approvals for, achieve market acceptance of, and to otherwise effectively market, CABOMETYX in its approved indications in their respective territories. Further, the operations of our collaboration partners, and ultimately their foreign sales of CABOMETYX, could be adversely affected by the degree and effectiveness of their respective corporate responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as by the imposition of governmental price or other controls, political and economic instability, trade restrictions or barriers and changes in tariffs, escalating global trade and political tensions, or otherwise. If our collaboration partners are unable or unwilling to invest the resources necessary to commercialize CABOMETYX successfully in the EU, Japan and other international territories where it has been approved, this could reduce the amount of revenue we are due to receive under these collaboration agreements, thus resulting in harm to our business and operations.\nOur clinical, regulatory and commercial collaborations with major companies make us reliant on those companies for their continued performance, which subjects us to a number of risks.\nWe have established clinical and commercial collaborations with leading biotechnology, biopharmaceutical and pharmaceutical companies, including, Ipsen, Takeda, Roche and Genentech, BMS and Daiichi Sankyo, for the development and commercialization of our products, and our dependence on these collaboration partners subjects us to a number of risks, including:\n\u2022our collaboration partners\u2019 decision to terminate our collaboration, or their failure to comply with the terms of our collaboration agreements and related ancillary agreements, either intentionally or as a result of negligent performance;\n\u2022our inability to control the amount and timing of resources that our collaboration partners devote to the development or commercialization of our products;\n\u2022the possibility that our collaboration partners may stop or delay clinical trials, fail to supply us on a timely basis with product required for a combination trial (including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic), or deliver product that fails to meet appropriate quality and regulatory standards;\n\u2022disputes that may arise between us and our collaboration partners that result in the delay or termination of the development or commercialization of our drug candidates, or that diminish or delay receipt of the economic benefits we are entitled to receive under the collaboration, or that result in costly litigation or arbitration;\n\u2022the possibility that our collaboration partners may experience financial difficulties, including, without limitation, difficulties arising from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic which prevent them from fulfilling their obligations under our agreements;\n\u2022our collaboration partners\u2019 inability to obtain regulatory approvals in a timely manner, or at all; and\n\u2022our collaboration partners\u2019 failure to properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or their use of our intellectual property rights or proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our intellectual property rights or expose us to potential litigation.\nIf any of these risks materialize, we may not receive collaboration revenues or otherwise realize anticipated benefits from such collaborations, and our product development efforts and prospects for growth could be delayed or disrupted, all of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur growth potential is dependent in part upon companies with which we have entered into research collaborations, in-licensing arrangements and similar business development relationships.\nTo expand our early-stage product pipeline, we have augmented our drug discovery activities with multiple research collaborations and in-licensing arrangements with other companies, including StemSynergy, Invenra, Iconic, Aurigene, Catalent, NBE and Adagene. Our dependence on our relationships with these research and in-licensing partners subjects us to numerous risks, including:\n\u2022our research and in-licensing partners\u2019 decision to terminate our relationship, or their failure to comply with the terms of our agreements, either intentionally or as a result of negligent performance;\n\u2022disputes that may arise between us and our research and in-licensing partners that result in the delay or termination of research activities with respect to any in-licensed assets or supporting technology platforms;\n\u2022the possibility that our research and in-licensing partners may experience financial difficulties, including, without limitation, difficulties arising from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which prevent them from fulfilling their obligations under our agreements;\n\u2022our research and in-licensing partners\u2019 failure to properly maintain or defend their intellectual property rights or their use of third-party intellectual property rights or proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation that could jeopardize or invalidate our license to develop these assets or utilize technology platforms; and\n\u2022our research and in-licensing partners\u2019 failure to comply with applicable healthcare laws, as well as established guidelines, laws and regulations related to GMP and GLP.\nIf any of these risks materialize, we may not be able to expand our product pipeline or otherwise realize a return on the resources we will have invested to develop these early-stage assets, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and prospects for growth.\nIf third parties upon which we rely to perform clinical trials for cabozantinib in new indications or for new potential product candidates do not perform as contractually required or expected, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize cabozantinib or other product candidates beyond currently approved indications.\nWe do not have the ability to conduct clinical trials for cabozantinib or for new potential product candidates independently, so we rely on independent third parties for the performance of these trials, such as the U.S. federal government (including NCI-CTEP, a department of the National Institutes of Health, with whom we have our CRADA), third-party contract research organizations, medical institutions, clinical investigators and contract laboratories to conduct our clinical trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or regulatory obligations or meet expected deadlines, whether as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, or if the third parties must be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the data they generate or provide is compromised due to their failure to adhere to our clinical trial or data security protocols or regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our preclinical development activities or clinical trials may be extended, delayed, suspended or terminated, and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize cabozantinib or other product candidates beyond currently approved indications. In addition, due to the complexity of our research initiatives, we may be unable to engage with third-party contract research organizations that have the necessary experience and sophistication to further our drug discovery efforts, which would impede our ability to identify, develop and commercialize our potential product candidates.\nWe lack our own manufacturing and distribution capabilities necessary for us to produce materials required for certain preclinical activities and to produce and distribute our products for clinical development or for commercial sale, and our reliance on third parties for these services subjects us to various risks.\nWe do not own or operate manufacturing facilities, distribution facilities or resources for CMC development activities, preclinical, clinical or commercial production and distribution for our current products and new product\ncandidates. Instead, we rely on various third-party contract manufacturing organizations to conduct these operations on our behalf. As our operations continue to grow in these areas, we continue to expand our supply chain through secondary third-party contract manufacturers, distributors and suppliers. To establish and manage our supply chain requires a significant financial commitment, the creation of numerous third-party contractual relationships and continued oversight of these third parties to fulfill compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. Although we maintain significant resources to directly and effectively oversee the activities and relationships with the companies in our supply chain, we do not have direct control over their operations.\nOur third-party contract manufacturers may not be able to produce material on a timely basis or manufacture material with the required quality standards, or in the quantity required to meet our preclinical, clinical development and commercial needs and applicable regulatory requirements, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Although we have not yet experienced production delays or seen significant impairment to our supply chain as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our third-party contract manufacturers, distributors and suppliers could experience operational delays due to facility closures and other hardships as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which could impact our supply chain by potentially causing delays to or disruptions in the supply of our commercial or clinical products or product candidates. If our third-party contract manufacturers, distributors and suppliers do not continue to supply us with our products or product candidates in a timely fashion and in compliance with applicable quality and regulatory requirements, or if they otherwise fail or refuse to comply with their obligations to us under our manufacturing, distribution and supply arrangements, we may not have adequate remedies for any breach. Furthermore, their failure to supply us could impair or preclude meeting commercial or clinical product supply requirements for us or our partners, which could delay product development and future commercialization efforts and have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, through our third-party contract manufacturers and data service providers, we continue to provide serialized commercial products as required to comply with the DSCSA. If our third-party contract manufacturers or data service providers fail to support our efforts to continue to comply with DSCSA and any future federal or state electronic pedigree requirements, we may face legal penalties or be restricted from selling our products.\nIf third-party scientific advisors and contractors we rely on to assist with our drug discovery efforts do not perform as expected, the expansion of our product pipeline may be delayed.\nWe work with scientific advisors at academic and other institutions, as well as third-party contractors in various locations throughout the world, that assist us in our research and development efforts, including in drug discovery and preclinical development strategy. These third parties are not our employees and may have other commitments or contractual obligations that limit their availability to us. Although these third-party scientific advisors and contractors generally agree not to do competing work, if a conflict of interest between their work for us and their work for another entity arises, we may lose their services. There has also been increased scrutiny surrounding the disclosures of payments made to medical researchers from companies in the pharmaceutical industry, and it is possible that the academic and other institutions that employ these medical researchers may prevent us from engaging them as scientific advisors and contractors or otherwise limit our access to these experts, or that the scientific advisors themselves may now be more reluctant to work with industry partners. Even if these scientific advisors and contractors with whom we have engaged intend to meet their contractual obligations, their ability to perform services may be impacted by external factors, as we experienced in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. If we experience additional delays in the receipt of services, lose work performed by these scientific advisors and contractors or are unable to engage them in the first place, our discovery and development efforts with respect to the matters on which they were working or would work in the future may be significantly delayed or otherwise adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Our Information Technology and Intellectual Property\nData breaches, cyber attacks and other failures in our information technology operations and infrastructure could compromise our intellectual property or other sensitive information, damage our operations and cause significant harm to our business and reputation.\nIn the ordinary course of our business, we and our third-party service providers, such as contract research organizations, collect, maintain and transmit sensitive data on our networks and systems, including our intellectual property and proprietary or confidential business information (such as research data and personal information) and confidential information with respect to our customers, clinical trial patients and our collaboration partners. We have also outsourced significant elements of our information technology infrastructure to third parties and, as a result, such third parties may or could have access to our confidential information. The secure maintenance of this information is critical to our business and reputation, and while we have enhanced and are continuing to enhance our cybersecurity efforts commensurate with the\ngrowth and complexity of our business, our systems and those of third-party service providers may be vulnerable to a cyber attack. Such vulnerabilities may be further exacerbated by the fact that our workforce is operating remotely as we comply with shelter in place orders and the recent rise in COVID-19 phishing attacks targeting remote workers. In addition, we are heavily dependent on the functioning of our information technology infrastructure to carry out our business processes, such as external and internal communications or access to clinical data and other key business information. Accordingly, both inadvertent disruptions to this infrastructure and cyber attacks could cause us to incur significant remediation or litigation costs, result in product development delays, disrupt critical business operations, expend key information technology resources and divert the attention of management.\nAlthough the aggregate impact of cyber attacks on our operations and financial condition has not been material to date, we and our third-party service providers have frequently been the target of threats of this nature and expect them to continue. Any data breach and/or unauthorized access or disclosure of our information or intellectual property could compromise our intellectual property and expose our sensitive business information or sensitive business information of our collaboration partners, which may lead to significant liability for us. A data security breach could also lead to public exposure of personal information of our clinical trial patients, employees or others and result in harm to our reputation and business, compel us to comply with federal and/or state breach notification laws and foreign law equivalents including the GDPR, subject us to investigations and mandatory corrective action, or otherwise subject us to liability under laws and regulations that protect the privacy and security of personal information, which could disrupt our business, result in increased costs or loss of revenue, and/or result in significant financial exposure. Furthermore, the costs of maintaining or upgrading our cybersecurity systems (including the recruitment and retention of experienced information technology professionals, who are in high demand) at the level necessary to keep up with our expanding operations and prevent against potential attacks are increasing, and despite our best efforts, our network security and data recovery measures and those of our third-party service providers may still not be adequate to protect against such security breaches and disruptions, which could cause material harm to our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property, third parties may be able to use our technology, which could adversely affect our ability to compete in the market.\nOur success will depend in part upon our ability to obtain patents and maintain adequate protection of the intellectual property related to our technologies and products. The patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies, including our patent position, are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions. We will be able to protect our intellectual property rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our technologies are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets. We will continue to apply for patents covering our technologies and products as, where and when we deem lawful and appropriate. However, these applications may be challenged or may fail to result in issued patents. Our issued patents have been and may in the future be challenged by third parties as invalid or unenforceable under U.S. or foreign laws, or they may be infringed by third parties, and we are from time to time involved in the defense and enforcement of our patents or other intellectual property rights in a court of law, U.S. Patent and Trademark Office inter partes review or reexamination proceeding, foreign opposition proceeding or related legal and administrative proceeding in the U.S. and elsewhere. The costs of defending our patents or enforcing our proprietary rights in post-issuance administrative proceedings and litigation can be substantial and the outcome can be uncertain. An adverse outcome may allow third parties to use our intellectual property without a license and/or allow third parties to introduce generic and other competing products, any of which would negatively impact our business. Third parties may also attempt to invalidate or design around our patents, or assert that they are invalid or otherwise unenforceable, and seek to introduce generic versions of cabozantinib. For example, we received Paragraph IV certification notice letters from MSN concerning the ANDA that it had filed with the FDA seeking approval to market a generic version of CABOMETYX tablets. Should MSN or any other third parties receive FDA approval of an ANDA or a 505(b)(2) NDA with respect to cabozantinib, it is possible that such company or companies could introduce generic versions of our marketed products before our patents expire if they do not infringe our patents or if it is determined that our patents are invalid or unenforceable, and the resulting generic competition could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, because patent applications can take many years to issue, third parties may have pending applications, unknown to us, which may later result in issued patents that cover the production, manufacture, commercialization or use of our product candidates. Our existing patents and any future patents we obtain may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from practicing our technologies or from developing competing products. Furthermore, others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or design around our patents. In addition, our patents may be challenged or invalidated or may fail to provide us with any competitive advantages, if, for example, others were the first to invent or to file patent applications for closely related inventions.\nThe laws of some foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the U.S., and many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting and defending such rights in foreign jurisdictions. Many countries, including certain countries in Europe, have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties (for example, the patent owner has failed to \u201cwork\u201d the invention in that country or the third party has patented improvements). In addition, many countries limit the enforceability of patents against government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, the patent owner may have limited remedies, which could materially diminish the value of the patent. Initiatives seeking compulsory licensing of life-saving drugs are also becoming increasingly prevalent in developing countries either through direct legislation or international initiatives. Governments in those developing countries could require that we grant compulsory licenses to allow competitors to manufacture and sell their own versions of our products or product candidates, thereby reducing our product sales. Moreover, the legal systems of certain countries, particularly certain developing countries, do not favor the aggressive enforcement of patent and other intellectual property protection, which makes it difficult to stop infringement. We rely on trade secret protection for some of our confidential and proprietary information. We have taken security measures to protect our proprietary information and trade secrets, but these measures may not provide adequate protection. While we seek to protect our proprietary information by entering into confidentiality agreements with employees, partners and consultants, we cannot provide assurance that our proprietary information will not be disclosed, or that we can meaningfully protect our trade secrets. In addition, our competitors may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or may otherwise gain access to our trade secrets.\nLitigation or third-party claims of intellectual property infringement could require us to spend substantial time and money and adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize products.\nOur commercial success depends in part upon our ability to avoid infringing patents and proprietary rights of third parties and not to breach any licenses that we have entered into with regard to our technologies and the technologies of third parties. Other parties have filed, and in the future are likely to file, patent applications covering products and technologies that we have developed or intend to develop. If patents covering technologies required by our operations are issued to others, we may have to obtain licenses from third parties, which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, and may require us to pay substantial royalties, grant a cross-license to some of our patents to another patent holder or redesign the formulation of a product candidate so that we do not infringe third-party patents, which may be impossible to accomplish or could require substantial time and expense. In addition, we may be subject to claims that our employees or independent contractors have inadvertently or otherwise used or disclosed trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers, or used or sought to use patent inventions belonging to their former employers. Furthermore, third parties may obtain patents that relate to our technologies and claim that use of such technologies infringes on their patents or otherwise employs their proprietary technology without authorization. Regardless of their merit, such claims could require us to incur substantial costs and divert the attention of management and key technical personnel in defending ourselves against any such claims or enforcing our own patents. In the event of any third party\u2019s successful claim of patent infringement or misappropriation of trade secrets, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel, which could impede or prevent the achievement of our product development goals, or we may be required to pay damages and obtain one or more licenses from these third parties, subjecting us to substantial royalty payment obligations. We may not be able to obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Defense of any lawsuit or failure to obtain any of these licenses could adversely affect our ability to develop and commercialize products.\nRisks Related to Our Operations, Managing Our Growth and Employee Matters\nIf the COVID-19 pandemic is further prolonged or becomes more severe, our business operations and corresponding financial results could suffer, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and prospects for growth.\nTo date, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a modest impact on our business operations, in particular on our clinical trial, drug discovery and commercial activities. For example, to varying degrees and at different rates across our clinical trials being conducted in regions impacted by COVID-19, we experienced declines in screening and enrollment activity, delays in new site activations, and restrictions on access to treatment sites that is necessary to monitor clinical study progress and initiation. However, as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to surge in various parts of the world, the impact on our clinical development operations could grow more severe. We anticipate that a further prolonged, or more severe, global public health crisis could limit our ability to identify and work with clinical investigators at clinical trial sites globally to enroll, initiate and maintain treatment per protocol of patients for our ongoing clinical trials. Disruptions to medical and administrative operations at clinical trial sites and the implementation of crisis management initiatives have and may\ncontinue to reduce personnel and other resources necessary to conduct our clinical trials, which could delay our clinical trial plans or require certain trials to be temporarily suspended. Moreover, quarantines and travel restrictions have impeded and may continue to impede patient movement or interrupt healthcare services, which we anticipate over time, could also interfere with and potentially negatively impact clinical trial execution, and ultimately results. In addition, increased costs connected with our efforts to mitigate the adverse impacts resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic on our clinical trials could cause the expenses we incur in conducting those clinical trials to increase considerably. Specifically, with respect to our clinical trials evaluating cabozantinib in combination with therapies that must be administered via professional intravenous infusion, such as COSMIC-312, COSMIC-313, COSMIC-021, CONTACT-01, CONTACT-02, CONTACT-03, or our early-stage trials evaluating XL092 and other product candidates to the extent they may incorporate additional therapies that must be administered via professional intravenous infusion, limited patient movement or interrupted healthcare services at medical institutions have delayed in some instances, and may continue to delay or prevent, on-site infusion of the therapies being evaluated in combination with cabozantinib. If a sizable portion of patients in our combination studies are unable or unwilling to receive all components of the combination therapy being tested in accordance with the applicable clinical trial protocol, it could cause those studies to be delayed, suspended or prevented from producing statistically significant results. Depending upon the duration and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic, we could also experience delays in the commencement of new clinical trials of cabozantinib, or our earlier-stage investigative product candidates. The COVID-19 pandemic could also impede clinical operations and delay our planning and preparation timelines for new clinical trials, as well as adversely affect our ability to obtain regulatory approval for clinical protocols and increase the operating expenses connected with these new clinical trials.\nIn addition, the COVID-19 pandemic caused us to suspend drug discovery work in our laboratories temporarily while we observed the shelter in place orders issued by the State of California and Alameda County. We also experienced some modest delays with respect to the portion of drug discovery work outsourced to third-party contractors in regions first impacted by COVID-19. While both drug discovery work in our laboratories and outsourced drug discovery activities have since partially resumed, we may be unable to maximize the potential of these programs due to reduced staffing and the imposition of increased safety protocols, and should the COVID-19 pandemic continue to grow in severity, we may have to further scale back or suspend activities in the future. For example, as a result of spikes or surges in infection, positivity or hospitalization rates, we may choose or be required to suspend work in our laboratories, which will once again impede our drug discovery efforts. With respect to the preclinical development work and drug discovery activities outsourced to third-party contractors, the COVID-19 pandemic could again impede these third parties from providing timely deliverables to us in the future. In addition, should we experience delays in the construction of new laboratory facilities due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our ability to expand our drug discovery activities may be impaired. As a result, should the COVID-19 pandemic be further prolonged or grow in severity, we may ultimately be unable to achieve our drug discovery and preclinical development objectives within the previously disclosed timelines, which could have a material adverse impact on our prospects for growth.\nWhile we believe that our commercial business has, to date, only experienced a modest impact related to the COVID-19 pandemic, it remains possible that over a longer period, changes to our standard sales and marketing practices, including the shift from in-person to primarily telephonic and virtual interactions with healthcare professionals, could negatively impact the flow of important information regarding our medicines, which along with obstacles to patient access to healthcare professionals, could diminish sales of our marketed products.\nAlthough as of the date of this Annual Report, we continue to maintain substantial safety stock inventories for our drug substance and drug products and have not experienced production delays or seen significant impairment to our supply chain as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our third-party contract manufacturers and suppliers could experience operational delays due to facility closures and other hardships as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which could impact our supply chain by potentially causing delays to or disruptions in the supply of our commercial or clinical products or product candidates. These delays or disruptions could be further exacerbated if the COVID-19 pandemic begins to impact essential distribution systems, which could substantially increase delivery times and costs, or otherwise adversely affect our ability to provide our products to customers and clinical trial sites and generate product revenues.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken numerous temporary precautions to help mitigate the risk of transmission of the virus, including: reducing the number of our employees working on-site at our Alameda headquarters under enhanced safety and social distancing protocols; suspending all non-essential business travel for our employees; and limiting the circumstances under which our field employees may engage in in-person promotional activities with healthcare professionals. Over a longer period, these measures could delay our research and development programs, reduce engagements with potential prescribers for our products, and impede our ability to execute on our long-term business\nplans. Further, extended periods of remote work could impede the focused attention of management or reduce the productivity of teams that would otherwise be working closely together.\nIn addition, as a result of broad economic shifts during and as a consequence of efforts to address unemployment and other negative economic effects the COVID-19 pandemic, we may experience further reductions in the net price of our products. For example, there may be a substantial shift from private health insurance coverage to government insurance coverage, or additional downward pressure on the prices government purchasers will pay for our products due to significant increases in government debt incurred in connection with relief efforts, as well as significant increases in demand for our patient assistance and/or free drug program or other impacts that may not be foreseeable, all or any of which would adversely affect our product revenues.\nWhile we expect the COVID-19 pandemic to continue to have varying degrees of adverse impact on our business operations and, potentially in the future, our financial results, the extent of such adverse impact will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence at this time, such as the ultimate duration of the pandemic, travel restrictions, quarantines, social distancing and business closure requirements in the U.S. and in other countries, and the effectiveness of actions taken globally to contain and treat the disease, including the rate at which vaccinations are made available and the percentage of the population that becomes vaccinated. These effects could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects, and exacerbate the other risks and uncertainties described elsewhere in this \u2018\u2018Risk Factors\u2019\u2019 section.\nIf we are unable to manage our growth, there could be a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and our prospects may be adversely affected.\nWe have experienced and expect to continue to experience growth in the number of our employees and in the scope of our operations, in particular as we continue to expand the cabozantinib franchise into new indications and grow our pipeline of product candidates. This growth places significant demands on our management and resources, and our current and planned personnel and operating practices may not be adequate to support our growth. To effectively manage our growth, we must continue to improve existing, and implement new, facilities, operational and financial systems, and procedures and controls, as well as expand, train and manage our growing employee base, and there can be no assurance that we will effectively manage our growth without experiencing operating inefficiencies or control deficiencies. We expect that we may need to increase our management personnel to oversee our expanding operations, and recruiting and retaining qualified individuals is difficult. If we are unable to manage our growth effectively, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, or we are unsuccessful in recruiting qualified management personnel, there could be a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe loss of key personnel or the inability to retain and, where necessary, attract additional personnel could impair our ability to operate and expand our operations.\nWe are highly dependent upon the principal members of our management, as well as clinical, commercial and scientific staff, the loss of whose services might adversely impact the achievement of our objectives. Also, we may not have sufficient personnel to execute our business plans. Retaining and, where necessary, recruiting qualified clinical, commercial, scientific and pharmaceutical operations personnel will be critical to support activities related to advancing the development program for the cabozantinib franchise and our other product candidates, successfully executing upon our commercialization plan for the cabozantinib franchise and our proprietary research and development efforts. Competition is intense for experienced clinical, commercial, scientific and pharmaceutical operations personnel, and we may be unable to retain or recruit such personnel with the expertise or experience necessary to allow us to successfully develop and commercialize our products. Similarly, the COVID-19 pandemic could negatively impact the health of key personnel or make it difficult to recruit qualified personnel for critical positions. Further, all of our employees are employed \u201cat will\u201d and, therefore, may leave our employment at any time.\nRisks Related to Environmental and Product Liability\nWe use hazardous chemicals and biological materials in our business. Any claims relating to improper handling, storage or disposal of these materials could be time consuming and costly.\nOur research and development processes involve the controlled use of hazardous materials, including chemicals and biological materials, and our operations can produce hazardous waste products. We cannot eliminate the risk of accidental contamination or discharge, or any resultant injury from these materials, and we may face liability under applicable laws for any injury or contamination that results from our use or the use by our collaboration partners or other\nthird parties of these materials, and such liability may exceed our insurance coverage and our total assets. In addition, we may be required to indemnify our collaboration partners against all damages and other liabilities arising out of our development activities or products produced in connection with our collaborations with them. Moreover, our continued compliance with environmental laws and regulations may be expensive, and current or future environmental regulations may impair our research, development and production efforts.\nWe face potential product liability exposure far in excess of our limited insurance coverage.\nWe may be held liable if any product we or our collaboration partners develop or commercialize causes injury or is found otherwise unsuitable during product testing, manufacturing, marketing or sale. Regardless of merit or eventual outcome, product liability claims could result in decreased demand for our products and product candidates, injury to our reputation, withdrawal of patients from our clinical trials, product recall, substantial monetary awards to third parties and the inability to commercialize any products that we may develop in the future. We maintain limited product liability insurance coverage for our clinical trials and commercial activities for cabozantinib. However, our insurance may not be sufficient to reimburse us for expenses or losses we may suffer. Moreover, if insurance coverage becomes more expensive, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts to protect us against losses due to liability.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock\nOur stock price has been and may in the future be highly volatile.\nThe trading price of our common stock has been highly volatile, and it may remain highly volatile or fluctuate substantially due to factors such as the following, many of which we cannot control:\n\u2022the announcement of FDA approval or non-approval, or delays in the FDA review process with respect to cabozantinib, our collaboration partners\u2019 product candidates being developed in combination with cabozantinib, or our competitors\u2019 product candidates;\n\u2022the commercial performance of both CABOMETYX and COMETRIQ and the revenues we generate from those approved products, including royalties paid under our collaboration and license agreements;\n\u2022adverse or inconclusive results or announcements related to our or our collaboration partners\u2019 clinical trials or delays in those clinical trials;\n\u2022the timing of achievement of our clinical, regulatory, partnering, commercial and other milestones for the cabozantinib franchise or any of our other programs or product candidates;\n\u2022our ability to make future investments in the expansion of our pipeline through drug discovery, including future research collaborations, in-licensing arrangements and other business development activities;\n\u2022our ability to obtain the materials and services, including an adequate product supply for any approved drug product, from our third-party vendors or do so at acceptable prices;\n\u2022the timing and amount of expenses incurred for clinical development and manufacturing of cabozantinib;\n\u2022actions taken by regulatory agencies, both in the U.S. and abroad, with respect to cabozantinib or our clinical trials for cabozantinib;\n\u2022unanticipated regulatory actions taken by the FDA as a result of changing FDA standards and practices concerning the review of product candidates, including approvals at earlier stages of clinical development or with lesser developed data sets and expedited reviews;\n\u2022the announcement of new products or clinical trial data by our competitors;\n\u2022the announcement of regulatory applications, such as MSN\u2019s ANDA, seeking approval of generic versions of our marketed products;\n\u2022quarterly variations in our or our competitors\u2019 results of operations;\n\u2022changes in our relationships with our collaboration partners, including the termination or modification of our agreements, or other events or conflicts that may affect our collaboration partners\u2019 timing and willingness to develop, or if approved, commercialize our products and product candidates out-licensed to them;\n\u2022the announcement of an in-licensed product candidate or strategic acquisition;\n\u2022litigation, including intellectual property infringement and product liability lawsuits, involving us;\n\u2022changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts, or financial guidance from our management team, and any failure to achieve the operating results projected by securities analysts or by our management team;\n\u2022the entry into new financing arrangements;\n\u2022developments in the biotechnology, biopharmaceutical or pharmaceutical industry;\n\u2022sales of large blocks of our common stock or sales of our common stock by our executive officers, directors and significant stockholders;\n\u2022additions and departures of key personnel or board members;\n\u2022the disposition of any of our technologies or compounds; and\n\u2022general market, economic and political conditions and other factors, including factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors, such as the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on financial markets.\nThese and other factors could have material adverse impact on the market price of our common stock. In addition, the stock markets in general, and the markets for biotechnology and pharmaceutical stocks in particular, have historically experienced significant volatility that has often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of particular companies. Likewise, as a result of significant changes in U.S. or global political and economic conditions, including the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, policies governing foreign trade and healthcare spending and delivery, or future potential U.S. federal government shutdowns, the financial markets could continue to experience significant volatility that could also continue to negatively impact the markets for biotechnology and pharmaceutical stocks. These broad market fluctuations have adversely affected, and may in the future adversely affect the trading price of our common stock. Excessive volatility may continue for an extended period of time following the date of this report.\nIn the past, following periods of volatility in the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted. A securities class action suit against us could result in substantial costs and divert the attention of management, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our charter documents and under Delaware law could make an acquisition of us, which may be beneficial to our stockholders, more difficult and may prevent or deter attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our current management, which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline.\nProvisions in our corporate charter and bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent an acquisition of us, a change in control, or attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove members of our current Board of Directors. Because our Board of Directors is responsible for appointing the members of our management team, these provisions could in turn affect any attempt by our stockholders to replace current members of our management team. These provisions include:\n\u2022a prohibition on actions by our stockholders by written consent;\n\u2022the ability of our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval, which could be used to institute a \u201cpoison pill\u201d that would work to dilute the stock ownership of a potential hostile acquirer, effectively preventing acquisitions that have not been approved by our Board of Directors; and\n\u2022advance notice requirements for director nominations and stockholder proposals.\nMoreover, because we are incorporated in Delaware, we are governed by the provisions of Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prohibits a person who owns in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person acquired in excess of 15% of our outstanding voting stock, unless the merger or combination is approved in a prescribed manner.", "PERMNO": 88159, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "EXEL"}
