{"cik": "796764", "company": "PREMIER EXHIBITIONS, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-05-29", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nIf any of the risks or uncertainties discussed below and elsewhere in this report, including, but not limited to, the section titled \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\u201d and in the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in this report, were to occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we presently deem to be immaterial could also seriously harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have recently announced a transaction (the \u201cMerger\u201d) with Dinoking Tech, Inc. (\u201cDK\u201d or \u201cDinoking\u201d), which is subject to conditions to closing that could result in the Merger being delayed, or not consummated, or can be terminated in certain circumstances, each of which could negatively impact our stock price and future business and operations. If our shareholders do not approve the Merger or if we are otherwise unable to close the Merger, we may not be able to continue operations as they are currently conducted.\nThe Merger is subject to conditions to closing as set forth in the Merger Agreement, including obtaining the requisite approval of our shareholders. In addition, each of the Company and DK has the right, in certain circumstances, to terminate the Merger Agreement. If the Merger Agreement is terminated or any of the conditions to the Merger are not satisfied and, where permissible, not waived, the Merger will not be consummated. Failure to consummate the Merger or any delay in the consummation of the Merger or any uncertainty about the consummation of the Merger may adversely affect our stock price or have an adverse impact on our future business operations.\nIf the Merger is not completed, our ongoing business may be adversely affected and, without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the Merger, we would be subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u00b7\nnegative reactions from the financial markets and from persons who have or may be considering business dealings with us;\n\u00b7\nfinancial difficulties that the Company may experience;\n\u00b7\nwe will be required to pay certain costs relating to the Merger, whether or not the Merger is completed. We expect to incur acquisition-related expenses of approximately $1,000,000, consisting of legal and accounting fees and printing and other related charges in connection with the Merger. These amounts are preliminary estimates and the actual amounts may be higher or lower; and\n\u00b7\nwe have agreed to pay a break-up fee of $1,000,000 if the Merger Agreement is terminated in certain circumstances.\nPursuant to the proposed Merger, DK assumed the $8 million loan that the Company had obtained on a short term basis from Pentwater Capital. If the Merger does not close, the Company will need to pay this amount to DK. The Company may be unable to borrow funds to pay these amounts on attractive terms, or at all, and would then be in default under the transaction agreements.\nIn addition to these amounts payable, the Company may have no funding to conduct its operations if the Merger does not close.\nWe could also be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the Merger or related to any proceeding commenced against us seeking to require us to perform our obligations under the Merger Agreement.\nThe Merger will present challenges associated with integrating operations, personnel, and other aspects of the companies and assumption of liabilities that may exist at Dinoking and which may be known or unknown by the Company.\nThe results of the combined company following the Merger will depend in part upon the Company\u2019s ability to integrate Dinoking\u2019s business with the Company\u2019s business in an efficient and effective manner. The Company\u2019s attempt to integrate two companies that have previously operated independently may result in significant challenges, and the Company may be unable to accomplish the integration smoothly or successfully. In particular, the necessity of coordinating geographically dispersed organizations and addressing possible differences in corporate cultures and management philosophies may increase the difficulties of integration. Dinoking has operated in Canada and exists under the laws of the province of British Columbia, with substantially all of its personnel and operations in Canada. The integration will require the dedication of significant management resources to become familiar with the Canadian operations and the culture of Dinoking, which may temporarily distract management\u2019s attention from the day-to-day operations of the businesses of the combined company. In addition, the combined company may adjust the way in which Dinoking has conducted its operations and utilized its assets, which may require retraining and development of new procedures and methodologies. The process of integrating operations and making such adjustments after the Merger could cause an interruption of, or loss of momentum in, the activities of one or more of the combined company's businesses and the loss of key personnel. Employee uncertainty, lack of focus, or turnover during the integration process may also disrupt the businesses of the combined company. Any inability of management to integrate the operations of the Company and Dinoking successfully could have a material adverse effect on the business and financial condition of the combined company.\nIn addition, the Merger will subject the Company to contractual or other obligations and liabilities of Dinoking, some of which may be unknown. Although the Company and its legal and financial advisors have conducted due diligence on Dinoking and its business, there can be no assurance that the Company is aware of all obligations and liabilities of Dinoking. These liabilities, and any additional risks and uncertainties related to Dinoking\u2019s business and to the Merger not currently known to the Company or that the Company may currently be aware of, but that prove to be more significant than assessed or estimated by the Company, could negatively impact the business, financial condition, and results of operations of the combined company following consummation of the Merger.\nCompletion of the Merger, including the conversion of the convertible note issued to the DK investor group (the \u201cConvertible Note\u201d), would result in the issuance of a significant amount of additional shares of our common stock, which would reduce the voting power of our current shareholders and may depress the trading price of our common stock.\nCompletion of the Merger would result in the issuance of a significant amount of shares our common stock. Upon completion of the Merger, assuming conversion of the Convertible Note, but prior to any potential issuance of shares of the Company\u2019s common stock in connection with future contingent payments, we expect that the DK investor group (comprised of the Dinoking shareholders and the lenders under the Convertible Note) (the \u201cDK Group\u201d) would together hold shares of the Company\u2019s common stock and Special Voting Shares that represent approximately 47% of the voting power of the Company. Our shareholders would experience further dilution in their voting power in the event we issue share of our common stock as future contingent payments to the Dinoking shareholders. As a result, our existing shareholders will not exert the same degree of voting power with respect to the combined company that they did before the consummation of the Merger. Further, the issuance of such a significant amount of common stock, and its potential sale in the public market from time to time, could depress the trading price of our common stock and you may lose all or a part of your investment.\nDinoking may be less valuable to us than expected.\nThe value of Dinoking to us is based in large part on the profitability of its existing dinosaur and other exhibitions, its plans for expansion into China, and its potential ability to extend the Company\u2019s exhibitions into China. This requires us to make assumptions regarding the valuation of Dinoking, the profitability and popularity of Dinoking\u2019s exhibitions, and the estimated capital needs of Dinoking as it works to expand into China. Dinoking\u2019s exhibitions may not remain profitable or Dinoking may be unable able to have profitable exhibitions in the future. In addition, expanding into a new territory such as China involves significant capital expenditures and we may be required to seek additional financing to fund Dinoking\u2019s, as well as the Company\u2019s, potential expansion into China. Furthermore, Dinoking\u2019s or the Company\u2019s exhibits may not be profitable in China. If, after our combination with Dinoking, we are unable to maintain the profitability of Dinoking\u2019s existing exhibitions, develop new exhibition concepts for Dinoking, or successfully expand into China, we may not achieve the desired return on our acquisition of Dinoking, and our results of operations could be harmed.\nAfter the closing of the Merger, the Dinoking shareholders and the DK Group will be our largest shareholder and may have interests that are different than other shareholders of the Company.\nUpon the closing of the Merger, and assuming conversion of the Convertible Note, but prior to payment of future contingent payments, we expect that the DK Group (comprised of the Dinoking shareholders and the lenders under the Convertible Note) would together hold shares of the Company\u2019s common stock and Special Voting Shares that represent approximately 47% of the voting power of the Company and would be the Company\u2019s largest shareholder. The DK Group may also potentially control our board of directors depending on whether they exercise their right under the Corporate Governance Agreement to appoint four members to our board of directors, which will be composed of seven members. The DK Group may influence the outcome of various actions that require shareholder approval, including the election of our directors, delaying or preventing a transaction in which shareholders might receive a premium over the prevailing market price for their shares, and preventing changes in control of management.\nThe Merger may be deemed to be a change of control that could cause the Company to reduce its net operating loss carryforwards.\nIn the event the Merger is deemed to constitute a \u201cchange in control\u201d (as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the \u201cCode\u201d)), our net operating loss carryforwards generated prior to the ownership change would be subject to annual limitations, which could reduce, eliminate, or defer the utilization of these losses. A \u201cchange in control\u201d includes a more than 50 percentage point increase in the ownership of our company by certain equity holders who are defined in Section 382 of the Code as \u201c5 percent shareholders.\u201d The Internal Revenue Service has viewed an acquisition of an ownership percentage in a company that is represented by certain equity instruments, including common shares, that are issued in connection with a change in the board of directors to include the holders of the equity instruments or their agents as indicative of a transfer of a beneficial ownership interest in a company under Section 382 of the Code. Accordingly, the DK Group\u2019s appointment of four directors to our board of directors pursuant to the Corporate Governance Agreement together with the issuance of shares of our common stock to the DK Group in connection with the Merger and in the transactions contemplated in the Merger Agreement could be viewed as contributing to a more than 50 percentage point change in control of the Company under Section 382 of the Code.\nThe Merger Agreement contains provisions that may discourage other companies from trying to acquire the Company.\nThe Merger Agreement contains provisions that may discourage a third-party from submitting an acquisition or business combination proposal (referred to in this paragraph as an \u201cacquisition proposal\u201d) to the Company prior to the closing of the Merger that might result in greater value to the Company\u2019s shareholders than the Merger. The Merger Agreement generally prohibits the Company from soliciting any alternative acquisition proposal, although the Company may terminate the Merger Agreement prior to the Special Meeting in order to accept an unsolicited acquisition proposal that the Company\u2019s board of directors determines is superior to the Merger. In addition, before the Company\u2019s board of directors may withdraw or modify its recommendation contained in this proxy statement or the Company may terminate the Merger Agreement to enter into a transaction that the Company\u2019s board of directors determines is superior to the Merger, Dinoking has the opportunity to negotiate with the Company to modify the terms of the Merger in response to any competing acquisition proposals that may be made. If the Company\u2019s board of directors determines that an unsolicited acquisition proposal is superior to the Merger and terminates the Merger Agreement, the Company is obligated to pay a $1,000,000 break-up fee to Dinoking, which would represent an additional cost for a potential third party seeking an acquisition of, or business combination with, the Company.\nOur cash flows from operations may not improve sufficiently to finance our ongoing operations or to make investments necessary for future growth without the need for additional financing.\nWe can provide no assurances that our cash flow from operations will improve sufficiently to finance our ongoing operations or to make investments necessary for future growth. During fiscal 2015, we had a net loss of approximately $10.5 million and our cash and marketable securities balance was approximately $4.8 million as of February 28, 2015. We currently do not have access to a revolving credit facility. There can be no assurance that our cash flows from operations will improve sufficiently during the next 12 months to fund our ongoing operations beyond that time.\nIf we are unable to sufficiently improve our financial performance or obtain financing, if and when we may need it, we may not be able to continue operations as they are currently anticipated or we may be unable to make capital investments needed for our existing exhibits or to develop new exhibits.\nOur limited access to capital may create a risk that the Company cannot continue as a going concern.\nThe Company\u2019s operations in the recent past have been financed primarily through cash flow from operations, existing cash and, in fiscal 2015, the Pentwater Capital Management L.P. loans. The Company has incurred net losses for the majority of the past several years. Moving forward, the Company expects to have significant cash outflows in the near term based on the New York City lease, leasehold improvements of the leased space and new content development.\nWhile the Company recently repaid its debt facility of $8.0 million, the Company will have to repay these amounts to DK if the merger transaction does not close. As a result, the Company must refinance the debt or obtain funds to repay the debt in full if that occurs. The Company could be capital constrained and unable to fulfill the terms of this and other agreements if its access to capital sources does not improve in the near term. Management believes that the Company\u2019s access to capital depends on near-term improvement to its operating results. See the section titled \u201cCapital Resources\u201d in this report for additional information.\nIf the Merger Agreement is not approved, or a public or private placement of equity securities or of convertible promissory notes, including potentially to some of the Company\u2019s existing shareholders, is not completed, the Company may be required to seek the protection of the U.S. bankruptcy laws and/or cease operating as a going concern.\nIn addition, if the Company does not meet its payment obligations to third parties as they come due, the Company may be subject to an involuntary bankruptcy proceeding or other litigation claims. Even if the Company were successful in defending against these potential claims and proceedings, such claims and proceedings could result in substantial costs and be a distraction to management, and may result in unfavorable results that could further adversely impact our financial condition.\nOur auditors have issued a going concern opinion. This means that there is substantial doubt that we can continue as an ongoing business, without additional financing, for the next twelve months. If the Company makes a bankruptcy filing, is subject to an involuntary bankruptcy filing, or is otherwise unable to continue as a going concern, the Company may be required to liquidate its assets and may receive less than the value at which those assets are carried on its financial statements, and it is likely that shareholders will lose all or a part of their investments. These financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.\nWe have recently entered into a long-term lease for exhibition space in New York City. If we are unable to achieve planned levels of attendance at this facility, our financial position could be negatively impacted.\nIn April 2014, we entered into a ten year lease for exhibition space in New York City, with total payments over the life of the lease totaling approximately $45.8 million. Our ability to satisfy these required payments and to add positive gross margin at this semi-permanent location depends on our ability to effectively prepare for the opening of the facility in a timely manner and effectively market the facility and generate ticket sales. If we are unable to achieve our targeted levels of attendance, our results of operation and financial position would be negatively and materially impacted.\nWe have recently made changes to key management positions and our failure to successfully adapt to changes in key management, and/or our inability to fill other vacant key positions, may adversely affect our business.\nDuring our fiscal year 2015 our Board of Directors appointed our Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer to the additional positions of Interim President and Chief Executive Officer. In addition, our former Chief Executive Officer and President was named the Company\u2019s Executive Chairman. After the fiscal year end 2015, our Executive Chairman resigned from the Company.\nThese changes in key management, including the appointment of an interim chief executive officer leading the Company, as well as the potential for additional appointments, could create uncertainty among our employees, customers, partners and promoters and could result in changes to the strategic direction of our business, which could negatively affect our business, operating results and financial position. Any failure of our management to work together to effectively manage our operations, our inability to hire other key management, and any failure to effectively integrate new management into our controls, systems and procedures may materially adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur current largest shareholder is an equity fund, and the plans of this fund could have an effect on our stock price and could result in changes to the strategic direction of the Company.\nThe largest shareholder of the Company is currently Sellers Capital Master Fund, Ltd. (\u201cSCF\u201d), which is controlled by Mark Sellers, Chairman of the Board of the Company and Managing Member of SCF\u2019s general partner. SCF purchased debt that was converted into shares of the Company\u2019s common stock in a financing transaction in fiscal year 2010. In addition, it has acquired common stock through open market purchases.\nIn June 2010, SCF informed the Company that at the request of the fund\u2019s investors it intended to return all capital to them. On October 7, 2010, Mr. Sellers informed the Company that SCF is no longer marketing its ownership stake in Premier, and further that SCF no longer has a specific time frame within which to sell its stake in Premier. Instead, Mr. Sellers indicated that SCF would retain its shares in the Company until such time as it could obtain what he believes to be a better value for the shares. Management does recognize, however, that if a suitable buyer is not identified at the appropriate time, Mr. Sellers may choose to take another course of action, including potentially selling the shares in the open market or in a privately negotiated transaction or distributing the SCF shares to the fund\u2019s limited partners.\nThe concentration of our equity ownership in an equity fund controlled by a Company director, and the potential that it could sell its block of common stock, could have an effect on our stock price and could result in changes to the strategic direction of the Company. In addition, a single purchaser of the SCF block of common stock could also acquire effective control of the Company. Such a shareholder may not agree with the present strategic direction of the board of directors and management, creating uncertainty that the current strategic focus of the Company will continue over the longer term.\nIf we pursue the sale of the artifacts that we have recovered from the Titanic wreck site, we may not be able to maximize the full value associated with title to these artifacts.\nIn August 2011, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, Norfolk Division issued an Order granting us an in-specie award to all of the artifacts we have recovered from the Titanic wreck since after the Company\u2019s first expedition in 1987. Together with the October 1993 Order from the French Maritime Tribunal granting us an in specie award to all of the artifacts recovered in our 1987 expedition, we now have title to all of the artifacts we have recovered from the Titanic wreck. Both of these in-specie awards come with certain limitations which govern how we care for the artifacts and how they may be sold.\nAs the Company is currently focused on completing the DK Merger, it is not actively pursuing a sale of the Titanic artifacts and related intellectual property at this time.\nWe have, however, previously announced our intent to pursue a sale of the artifacts. If we pursue the sale of the artifacts, we could fail to sell the artifacts at or above their appraised value, and if we cannot complete a sale on terms favorable to the Company, our ability to put the artifacts to good and profitable use in the future may be diminished, particularly in light of the uncertainty created by the sale process. The sale process also consumed significant management time and Company resources in the past and may do so in the future, which may impact our operations. In addition, our stock price may be negatively impacted if we are unable to sell the artifacts on favorable terms, which may reduce our ability to raise capital that may be necessary to fund ongoing operations. If we do sell the artifacts, we might lose the right to exhibit the artifacts or to use the associated intellectual property, which would reduce our revenues. Any of these factors could affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nIn addition, the announcement by the Company that we are not currently actively pursuing the sale of the artifacts or that the sale process, if pursued at a later time, will require more time than was originally anticipated may negatively impact our share price and/or our ability to complete a sale on favorable terms.\nIf we fail to comply with the continued listing requirements of the NASDAQ, our common stock may be delisted and the price of our common stock and our ability to access the capital markets could be negatively impacted.\nOur common stock is currently listed for trading on the NASDAQ. We must satisfy the NASDAQ\u2019s continued listing requirements, including, among other things, the requirement that our audit committee be composed of at least three independent directors, or risk delisting, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. A delisting of our common stock from the NASDAQ could materially reduce the liquidity of our common stock and result in a corresponding material reduction in the price of our common stock. In addition, delisting could harm our ability to raise capital through alternative financing sources on terms acceptable to us, or at all, and may result in the potential loss of confidence by investors, suppliers, customers and employees and fewer business development opportunities. During fiscal year 2015, Premier received notification from the NASDAQ that the Company was not in compliance with NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 5450(c)(2)(A), requiring the audit committee to be composed of three independent directors and have an audit committee financial expert. The Company\u2019s audit committee currently has only two members and does not currently have a member whom the Board has determined to be an audit committee financial expert. If the Company fails to add an additional director to the Board in the near term to satisfy the requirements under NASDAQ Marketplace Rule 5450(c)(2)(A), our common stock could be delisted. In addition, the Company will have to satisfy the NASDAQ listing standards in connection with the Merger.\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, and investors in our common stock could see the value of our common stock decline materially.\nThe stock market has recently experienced, and may experience in the future, extreme price and volume fluctuations. This volatility has had a significant impact on the market price of securities issued by many companies, including companies in our industry. Such changes may occur without regard to the operating performance of these companies. In addition, the uncertainty related to our efforts to monetize the Titanic artifact collection has and may continue to add to this price volatility. These fluctuations, both those related to our company and those related to factors that have little to nothing to do with our Company, have and could materially reduce our stock price in the future.\nMoreover, companies that have had volatile market prices for their securities have been subject to securities class action lawsuits. Any such lawsuit filed against us, regardless of the outcome, could result in substantial legal costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources, which in turn could seriously harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur inability to effectively and efficiently develop or acquire new exhibitions could seriously harm our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business depends on our ability to develop and present new exhibition concepts or acquire existing exhibition concepts to complement our current exhibitions. If we are unable to identify new exhibitions or if we do not have sufficient capital to develop new exhibitions, our results of operations and financial condition could be seriously harmed.\nIn addition, the development of new exhibitions often involves significant capital expenditure. If we are unable to effectively budget for new exhibition development, we may not achieve the desired return on new properties, and our results of operations could be harmed.\nIf our advertising, promotional and other marketing campaigns are not successful, our results of operations could be harmed.\nLike many other companies that make entertainment available to the public, we utilize significant resources to advertise, promote and provide marketing support for our exhibitions. For fiscal 2015 and 2014, we incurred marketing and advertising expenses of $4.2 million and $4.1 million, respectively. We are also party to agreements pursuant to which we engage third-parties to assist us in the production, design, promotion and marketing of our exhibitions. If our advertising, promotional and other marketing campaigns are not successful, or if we are not able to continue to secure on commercially reasonable terms the assistance of third-parties in our marketing and promotional activities, our results of operations will be harmed.\nGeneral economic weakness may have a negative impact on our revenues and make it difficult for us to obtain financing to operate our business.\nOur results of operations are sensitive to changes in general economic conditions that impact consumer spending, including discretionary spending for our exhibitions, both domestically and in international markets where we operate. Discretionary consumer spending is impacted by higher levels of unemployment, fuel prices, weakness in the housing markets, higher consumer debt levels, declines in consumer confidence in future economic conditions, higher tax rates, higher interest rates, and other adverse economic conditions. An economic slowdown, and other factors that cause consumers to reduce their discretionary spending to a point where attendance at our exhibitions declines, negatively affect our revenues and results of operations.\nIf the national or global economy or credit market conditions in general were to deteriorate in the future, it is possible that such changes could put additional negative pressure on discretionary consumer spending and other consumer purchasing habits, which would adversely affect our operating results and make it more difficult for us to obtain financing to operate our business.\nThe success of our businesses is dependent on the existence and maintenance of intellectual property rights in the products and services we create.\nThe value to us of our intellectual property is dependent on a number of factors, including the existence and application of laws in the U.S. and in jurisdictions around the world, the manner in which those laws are applied, and the efforts taken by the Company to protect and enforce its rights.\nThe unauthorized use of our intellectual property by others may reduce our revenues and increase the cost of protecting our intellectual property. The unauthorized use of intellectual property in the entertainment industry in general continues to pose significant challenges. Inadequate laws or weak enforcement mechanisms to protect intellectual property in one country can adversely affect the results of the Company\u2019s operations worldwide, despite the Company\u2019s efforts to protect its intellectual property. The international nature of our entertainment business requires us to devote substantial resources to protecting our intellectual property against unlicensed use.\nWith respect to intellectual property owned by the Company, the Company is subject to challenges by third parties. Successful challenges to the ownership of our intellectual property may result in increased costs or the loss of the opportunity to earn revenue derived from the intellectual property that is the subject of challenged rights.\nOur exhibition business is sensitive to public tastes. If we are unable to anticipate or respond to changes in consumer preferences, demand for our exhibitions could decrease.\nOur ability to generate revenue from our exhibitions is highly sensitive to changes in public tastes. Our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate the preferences of consumers and to offer appealing exhibitions. We typically book each exhibition venue several months in advance of an exhibition\u2019s opening and incur certain upfront costs prior to our receiving any operating income. Therefore, if the public is not receptive to a particular exhibition or location, we could incur a loss depending on the amount of the incurred costs. Moreover, if we are not able to anticipate, identify or react to changes in public tastes, reduced demand for our exhibitions will likely result. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business may be harmed as a result of litigation.\nWe have been a party to several ongoing material legal proceedings. These proceedings are described below in Item 3 of Part I of this report under the heading \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d and also in the \u201cLitigation and Other Legal Matters\u201d footnote to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 8 of Part II of this report. Should successful claims and other actions be brought against us in the future, our business, results of operations and financial condition could be seriously harmed. In addition, the professional cost associated with this litigation may consume the Company\u2019s limited capital, which may constrain the Company\u2019s ability to develop new content and pursue other opportunities.\nIf we are unable to maintain our salvor-in-possession rights to the Titanic wreck and wreck site, our Titanic exhibitions could face increased competition.\nWe are the exclusive salvor-in-possession of the Titanic wreck and wreck site. Our salvor-in-possession status enables us to prevent third parties from salvaging the Titanic wreck and wreck site and from interfering with our rights to salvage the wreck and wreck site. To maintain our salvor-in-possession rights, we must maintain a presence over the wreck site as interpreted by the courts. In addition, we may have to commence legal proceedings against third parties who attempt to violate our rights as salvor-in-possession, which may be expensive and time-consuming. Moreover, the court may not continue to recognize us as the sole and exclusive salvor-in-possession of the Titanic wreck and wreck site. If we were to lose our salvor-in-possession rights, our Titanic exhibitions could be exposed to competition, which could harm our operating results.\nWe may have a risk of collection of our revenue from exhibitions presented by third parties.\nWe rely upon third parties to present some of our exhibitions and in many cases those third parties operate the box office and control the sale of the tickets. As a result, we are subject to the risk that we will be unable to collect our portion of the revenue from the exhibitions presented by third party partners. Where we are unable to collect these revenues in accordance with the terms of the contract, we may incur the cost of litigation to recover the amounts owed to us and may ultimately not recover the full value of the receivable.\nOur exhibitions are becoming subject to increasing competition that could negatively impact our operating results and financial condition.\nTitanic exhibitions. Although we are currently the only entity that exhibits artifacts recovered from the wreck site of the Titanic, we currently encounter competition from other Titanic exhibitions that exhibit replicas of artifacts and memorabilia not obtained directly from the wreck site. In addition, in the future we may encounter competition from other Titanic exhibitions or events, as our Titanic exhibition business continues to change. We have recently settled litigation regarding Titanic exhibitions, as discussed in Item 3. \u201cLegal Proceedings\u201d in Part I of this report. Another example of this competition emanates from an adverse ruling in 1999 by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit which left us with non-exclusive rights to photograph and film the Titanic wreck site. As a result of this ruling, other companies can now photograph and film the Titanic wreck site, which exposes us to increased competition that could, for example, result in our loss of future exhibitions or other opportunities, such as documentary film rights. Moreover, it is possible that other companies may, albeit in violation of our Salvor-in-Possession rights, attempt to explore the Titanic wreck site in the future. If any of these companies were successful, we would face increased competition as well as increased costs necessary to defend and preserve our rights. The availability of remotely-operated vehicles for charter from third-parties to conduct expeditions may make it easier for others to gain access to the Titanic site in violation of our Salvor-in-Possession rights. Any of these developments could have an adverse impact on our financial performance.\nHuman anatomy exhibitions. Our human anatomy exhibitions face intense competition with other human anatomy exhibitions similar to ours offered by various companies in the U.S. and around the world. As a result, we may lose visitors to our exhibits based on competitors\u2019 claims, the proximity of competing exhibitions to ours, and our ability to advertise and otherwise entice visitors to our exhibits in the extremely competitive marketplace. In addition, if a significant number of new human anatomy exhibitions were to enter the same markets in which our exhibitions are offered or are planned to be offered, attendance at our human anatomy exhibitions could decline and our results of operations and financial condition could be harmed.\nThe Company\u2019s Titanic and Human anatomy exhibitions have been touring for a number of years. Our ability to locate venues to present these exhibitions is impacted by the number of venues that have previously presented each exhibition. As a result, each exhibition is subject to increasing competition from new properties in the market place.\nOther exhibitions. If we are successful in presenting our new exhibitions, competitors may bring similar exhibitions of their own to the market. To the extent competitors are successful at marketing and promoting competing exhibitions, our results of operations and financial condition could be harmed.\nEvents harming our reputation could adversely affect our business prospects, financial results and stock price.\nWe are dependent on our reputation. Events that can damage our reputation include, but are not limited to, legal violations, actual or perceived ethical problems, particularly related to our human anatomy exhibitions, actual or perceived poor employee relations, actual or perceived poor customer service, venue appearance or operational issues, or events outside of our control that generate negative publicity with respect to our company. Any event that has the potential to negatively impact our reputation could negatively affect our business prospects, financial results and stock price.\nWe are dependent upon our ability to locate effective venues for exhibitions, either in museums or in leased exhibition space. If we are unable to lease exhibition venues on acceptable terms or to partner with museums to present our exhibitions, our results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe require access to exhibition venues owned or leased by third parties to conduct our stationary exhibitions. Our long-term success depends, in part, on our ability to utilize such venues on commercially reasonable terms. We also present our exhibitions in museums. If we are unable to develop and maintain relationships with museums to present our exhibits, or if demand for our exhibits from the museum community declines, our results of operations and financial condition could be harmed.\nSevere weather may impact our operations at our stationary exhibitions, which contribute a significant portion of our revenue and income.\nSevere weather has significantly impacted our operations in New York City. Severe weather may impact our operations and prohibit us from presenting exhibitions. Particularly where such severe weather impacts our stationary exhibit operations in New York City, New York, Atlanta, Georgia, Las Vegas, Nevada or Orlando, Florida, the inability to operate may significantly impact our revenues and income. While the Company maintains property insurance and, where appropriate, business interruption coverage, insurance proceeds may not fully compensate the Company for its loss of revenue and business opportunity.\nThrough our co-promoters, we conduct exhibitions outside of the United States, which subjects us to additional business risks that could increase our costs and cause our profitability to decline.\nDuring fiscal 2015, we derived approximately $3.7 million or 13% of our total revenue from exhibitions located outside of the U.S. We intend to continue to pursue international exhibition opportunities. Our international exhibitions are subject to a number of risks, including the following:\n\u00a7\nchanges in foreign regulatory requirements;\n\u00a7\ndifficulties in staffing, training and managing foreign operations;\n\u00a7\nchanging and irregular enforcement of legal regulations;\n\u00a7\ndifficulties in collecting amounts due from foreign partners; and\n\u00a7\npolitical and economic instability.\nCertain aspects of our operations are subject to governmental regulation, and our failure to comply with any existing or future regulations could seriously harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur exhibitions are subject to federal, state and local laws, both domestically and internationally, governing various matters, such as:\n\u00a7\nlicensing and permitting;\n\u00a7\nhealth, safety, environmental and sanitation requirements;\n\u00a7\nworking conditions, labor, minimum wage and hour, citizenship and employment laws; and\n\u00a7\nsales, use and other taxes and withholding.\nWe cannot predict the extent to which existing or future laws or regulations could impact our operations. Although we generally contract with a third party for various services at our venues, we cannot provide assurances that we or our third-parties are in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations at all times, that we or our third-parties will be able to comply with any future laws and regulations or that we will not incur liabilities for violations by us or third-parties with which we maintain a relationship. Our failure or the failure of any of our third-parties with which we maintain a relationship to comply with laws and regulations could also cause us to be subject to investigations or governmental actions that could seriously harm our business.\nWe may be unable to hire and retain the personnel we need and, as a result, could lose our competitive position.\nTo meet our business objectives, we must continue to attract and retain skilled technical, operational, managerial and sales and marketing personnel. We face significant competition for these skilled professionals from other companies, research and academic institutions, government entities and other organizations. If we fail to attract and retain the necessary personnel, we may be unable to achieve our business objectives and may lose our competitive position, which could harm our business revenue. In addition, our recent efforts to reduce headcount and general and administrative expenses may harm our ability to attract or retain the personnel we need.\nData loss or other breaches of our network security could materially harm our business and results of operations, and the processing, storage, use and disclosure of personal data could give rise to liabilities as a result of governmental regulation, conflicting legal requirements or differing views of personal privacy rights.\nDue to the internet-based nature of a significant portion of our ticketing and other businesses, we process, store, use and disclose large amounts of data, including personal information, for our customers. Any penetration of network security or other misappropriation or misuse of personal consumer information and data, including credit card information could cause interruptions in our operations and subject us to increased costs, litigation and other liabilities. Network security issues could lead to claims against us for others\u2019 misuse of personal information, such as for credit card fraud or identity theft, which could result in litigation and financial liabilities, as well as administrative action from governmental authorities. In addition, security breaches or the inability to protect our data could lead to increased incidents of ticketing fraud and counterfeit tickets. Security breaches could also significantly damage our reputation with consumers, ticketing clients and other third parties and impose significant costs related to remediation efforts, such as credit or identity theft monitoring or repair costs for impacted customers. It is possible that advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries, undetected fraud, inadvertent violations of company policies or procedures or other developments could result in a compromise of information or a breach of the technology and security processes that are used to protect consumer transaction data. Recently, large retailers and website operators have been the victims of targeted security breaches resulting in the disclosure and/or misappropriation of large amounts of customer data, including credit card information. We have expended capital and other resources to protect against any such potential security breaches and their consequences and will be required to continue to do so in the future. We also face risks associated with security breaches affecting third parties with which we are affiliated or with which we otherwise conduct business. Consumers are generally concerned with security and privacy of the internet, and any publicized security problems affecting our businesses and/or those of third parties may discourage consumers from doing business with us, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition to the above concerns related to network and data security, the sharing, use, disclosure and protection of personally identifiable information and other user data are governed by federal, state and international laws. Specifically, personally identifiable information is increasingly subject to legislation and regulations in numerous jurisdictions around the world, the intent of which is to protect the privacy of personal information that is collected, processed and transmitted in or from the governing jurisdiction. We could be adversely affected if legislation or regulations are expanded to require changes in business practices or privacy policies, or if governing jurisdictions interpret or implement their legislation or regulations in ways that negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may also become exposed to potential liabilities as a result of differing views on the privacy of the consumer and other user data collected by us. Our failure or the failure of the various third-party vendors and service providers with which we do business to comply with applicable privacy policies or federal, state or similar international laws and regulations or any compromise of security that results in the unauthorized release of personally identifiable information or other user data could damage our reputation, discourage potential users from trying our products and services and/or result in fines and/or proceedings by governmental agencies and/or consumers, one or all of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.", "PERMNO": 91364, "SIC": 7990, "TIC": "PRXIQ"}
