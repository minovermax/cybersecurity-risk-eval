You should carefully consider each of the risks described below before deciding to invest in our common stock or other securities. If any of the following risks develops into actual events, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected, the market price of our common stock or other securities could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nInvestors should be particularly cautious regarding investments in our common stock or other securities at the present time in light of the net contraction of our receivables levels over the last few years, uncertainties as to our business model going forward and our inability to achieve consistent earnings from our operations in recent years.\nOur Cash Flows and Net Income Are Dependent Upon Payments from Our Loans and Fees Receivable and Other Credit Products\nThe collectibility of our loans and fees receivable is a function of many factors including the criteria used to select who is issued credit, the pricing of the credit products, the lengths of the relationships, general economic conditions, the rate at which customers repay their accounts or become delinquent, and the rate at which customers borrow funds from us. Deterioration in these factors, which we have experienced over the past few years, adversely impacts our business. In addition, to the extent we have over-estimated collectibility, in all likelihood we have over-estimated our financial performance. Some of these concerns are discussed more fully below.\nOur portfolio of receivables is not diversified and originates from customers whose creditworthiness is considered sub-prime. Historically, we have obtained receivables in one of two ways-we have either solicited for the origination of the receivables or purchased pools of receivables from other issuers. In either case, substantially all of our receivables are from financially underserved borrowers-borrowers represented by credit risks that regulators classify as \u201csub-prime.\u201d Our reliance on sub-prime receivables has negatively impacted and may in the future negatively impact, our performance. Our various past and current losses might have been mitigated had our portfolios consisted of higher-grade receivables in addition to our sub-prime receivables.\nWe may not successfully evaluate the creditworthiness of our customers and may not price our credit products in a profitable manner. The creditworthiness of our target market generally is considered \u201csub-prime\u201d based on guidance issued by the agencies that regulate the banking industry. Thus, our customers generally have a higher frequency of delinquencies, higher risks of nonpayment and, ultimately, higher credit losses than consumers who are served by more traditional providers of consumer credit. Some of the consumers included in our target market are consumers who are dependent upon finance companies, consumers with only retail store credit cards and/or lacking general purpose credit cards, consumers who are establishing or expanding their credit, and consumers who may have had a delinquency, a default or, in some instances, a bankruptcy in their credit histories, but who, in our view, have demonstrated creditworthiness. We price our credit products taking into account the perceived risk level of our customers. If our estimates are incorrect, customer default rates will be higher, we will receive less cash from the receivables and the value of our loans and fees receivable will decline, all of which will have a negative impact on performance. It also is unclear whether our current payment rates can be sustained given weakness in the employment outlook and economic environment at large.\nEconomic slowdowns increase our credit losses. During periods of economic slowdown or recession, we experience an increase in rates of delinquencies and frequency and severity of credit losses. Our actual rates of delinquencies and frequency and severity of credit losses may be comparatively higher during periods of economic slowdown or recession than those experienced by more traditional providers of consumer credit because of our focus on the financially underserved consumer market, which may be disproportionately impacted.\nWe are subject to foreign economic and exchange risks. Because of our operations in the U.K., we have exposure to fluctuations in the U.K. economy, and such fluctuations recently have been negative. We also have exposure to fluctuations in the relative values of the U.S. dollar and the British pound. Because the British pound has experienced a net decline in value relative to the U.S. dollar since we commenced our most significant operations in the U.K., we have experienced significant transaction and translation losses within our financial statements.\nBecause a significant portion of our reported income is based on management\u2019s estimates of the future performance of our loans and fees receivable, differences between actual and expected performance of the receivables may cause fluctuations in net income. Significant portions of our reported income (or losses) are based on management\u2019s estimates of cash flows we expect to receive on our loans and fees receivable, particularly for such assets that we report based on fair value. The expected cash flows are based on management\u2019s estimates of interest rates, default rates, payment rates, cardholder purchases, servicing costs, and discount rates. These estimates are based on a variety of factors, many of which are not within our control. Substantial differences between actual and expected performance of the receivables will occur and cause fluctuations in our net income. For instance, higher than expected rates of delinquencies and losses could cause our net income to be lower than expected. Similarly, as we have experienced for our credit card receivables portfolios with respect to financing agreements secured by our loans and fees receivable, levels of loss and delinquency can result in our being required to repay our lenders earlier than expected, thereby reducing funds available to us for future growth. Because all of our credit card receivables structured financing facilities are now in amortization status-which for us generally means that the only meaningful cash flows that we are receiving with respect to the credit card receivables that are encumbered by such structured financing facilities are those associated with our contractually specified fee for servicing the receivables-recent payment and default trends have substantially reduced the cash flows that we receive from these receivables.\nDue to our relative lack of historical experience with Internet customers, we may not be able to target successfully these customers or evaluate their creditworthiness. We have less historical experience with respect to the credit risk and performance of customers acquired over the Internet. As a result, we may not be able to target and evaluate successfully the creditworthiness of these potential customers should we engage in marketing efforts to acquire these customers. Therefore, we may encounter difficulties managing the expected delinquencies and losses and appropriately pricing our products.\nWe Are Substantially Dependent Upon Borrowed Funds to Fund the Receivables We Originate or Purchase\nWe finance our receivables in large part through financing facilities. All of our financing facilities are of finite duration (and ultimately will need to be extended or replaced) and contain financial covenants and other conditions that must be fulfilled in order for funding to be available. Moreover, some of our facilities currently are in amortization stages (and are not allowing for the funding of any new loans) based on their original terms. The cost and availability of equity and borrowed funds is dependent upon our financial performance, the performance of our industry generally and general economic and market conditions, and at times equity and borrowed funds have been both expensive and difficult to obtain.\nIf additional financing facilities are not available in the future on terms we consider acceptable-an issue that has been made even more acute in the U.S. given recent regulatory changes that have reduced asset-level returns on credit card lending-we will not be able to grow our credit card operations and it will continue to contract in size.\nOur Financial Performance Is, in Part, a Function of the Aggregate Amount of Receivables That Are Outstanding\nThe aggregate amount of outstanding receivables is a function of many factors including purchase rates, payment rates, interest rates, seasonality, general economic conditions, competition from credit card issuers and other sources of consumer financing, access to funding, and the timing, extent and success of our marketing efforts.\nOur credit card operation currently is contracting. Growth is a product of a combination of factors, many of which are not in our control. Factors include:\n\u2022\nthe availability of funding on favorable terms;\n\u2022\nthe level and success of our marketing efforts;\n\u2022\nthe degree to which we lose business to competitors;\n\u2022\nthe level of usage of our credit products by our customers;\n\u2022\nthe availability of portfolios for purchase on attractive terms;\n\u2022\nlevels of delinquencies and charge offs;\n\u2022\nthe level of costs of soliciting new customers;\n\u2022\nour ability to employ and train new personnel;\n\u2022\nour ability to maintain adequate management systems, collection procedures, internal controls and automated systems; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and other factors beyond our control.\nWe have curtailed our U.S. credit card marketing efforts and have aggressively reduced credit lines and closed credit card accounts. In addition, the general economic downturn experienced in 2008 and 2009 significantly impacted not just the level of usage of our credit products by our customers but also levels of payments and delinquencies and other performance metrics. As a result, our credit card operation currently is contracting.\nReliance upon relationships with a few large retailers in our point-of-sale finance operations may adversely affect our revenues and operating results from these operations. Our three largest retail partners accounted for over 78.0% of our point-of-sale finance and rental revenues in 2014. Although we are adding new retail partners on a regular basis, it is likely that we will continue to derive a significant portion of this operations\u2019 revenue from a relatively small number of partners in the future. If a significant partner reduces or terminates its relationship with us, these operations\u2019 revenue could decline significantly and our operating results and financial condition could be harmed.\nWe Operate in a Heavily Regulated Industry\nChanges in bankruptcy, privacy or other consumer protection laws, or to the prevailing interpretation thereof, may expose us to litigation, adversely affect our ability to collect our loans and fees receivable, or otherwise adversely affect our operations. Similarly, regulatory changes could adversely affect our ability or willingness to market credit cards and other products and services to our customers. Also, the accounting rules that govern our business are exceedingly complex, difficult to apply and in a state of flux. As a result, how we value our receivables and otherwise account for our business is subject to change depending upon the changes in, and, interpretation of, those rules. Some of these issues are discussed more fully below.\nReviews and enforcement actions by regulatory authorities under banking and consumer protection laws and regulations may result in changes to our business practices, may make collection of account balances more difficult or may expose us to the risk of fines, restitution and litigation. Our operations and the operations of the issuing banks through which we originate some of our credit products are subject to the jurisdiction of federal, state and local government authorities, including the CFPB, the SEC, the FDIC, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the FTC, U.K. banking authorities, state regulators having jurisdiction over financial institutions and debt origination and collection and state attorneys general. Our business practices, including the terms of our products and our marketing, servicing and collection practices, are subject to both periodic and special reviews by these regulatory and enforcement authorities. These reviews can range from investigations of specific consumer complaints or concerns to broader inquiries into our practices generally. If as part of these reviews the regulatory authorities conclude that we are not complying with applicable law, they could request or impose a wide range of remedies including requiring changes in advertising and collection practices, changes in the terms of our products (such as decreases in interest rates or fees), the imposition of fines or penalties, or the paying of restitution or the taking of other\nremedial action with respect to affected customers. They also could require us to stop offering some of our products, either nationally or in selected states. To the extent that these remedies are imposed on the issuing banks through which we originate credit products, under certain circumstances we are responsible for the remedies as a result of our indemnification obligations with those banks. We also may elect to change practices or products that we believe are compliant with law in order to respond to regulatory concerns. Furthermore, negative publicity relating to any specific inquiry or investigation could hurt our ability to conduct business with various industry participants or to attract new accounts and could negatively affect our stock price, which would adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital and would raise our costs of doing business.\nIf any deficiencies or violations of law or regulations are identified by us or asserted by any regulator, or if the CFPB, the FDIC, the FTC or any other regulator requires us to change any of our practices, the correction of such deficiencies or violations, or the making of such changes, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or business. In addition, whether or not we modify our practices when a regulatory or enforcement authority requests or requires that we do so, there is a risk that we or other industry participants may be named as defendants in litigation involving alleged violations of federal and state laws and regulations, including consumer protection laws. Any failure to comply with legal requirements by us or the issuing banks through which we originate credit products in connection with the issuance of those products, or by us or our agents as the servicer of our accounts, could significantly impair our ability to collect the full amount of the account balances. The institution of any litigation of this nature, or any judgment against us or any other industry participant in any litigation of this nature, could adversely affect our business and financial condition in a variety of ways.\nOur rent-to-own operations are regulated by and subject to the requirements of various federal and state laws and regulations. These laws and regulations which may be amended or supplemented or interpreted by the courts from time to time, could expose us to significant compliance costs or burdens or force us to change our business practices in a manner that may be materially adverse to our operations, prospects or financial condition. Currently, 47 states and the District of Columbia specifically regulate rent-to-own transactions such as those conducted in our rent-to-own programs. At the present time, no federal law specifically regulates the rent-to-own industry, although federal legislation to regulate the industry has been proposed from time to time. Any adverse changes in existing laws, or the passage of new adverse legislation by states or the federal government could materially increase both our costs of complying with laws and the risk that we could be sued or be subject to government sanctions if we are not in compliance. In addition, new burdensome legislation might force us to change our business model and might reduce the economic potential of our rent-to-own product offerings.\nMost of the states that regulate rent-to-own transactions have enacted disclosure laws that require rent-to-own companies to disclose to their customers the total number of payments, total amount and timing of all payments to acquire ownership of any item, any other charges that may be imposed by them and miscellaneous other items. The more restrictive state lease purchase laws limit the total amount that a customer may be charged for an item, or regulate the amount of deemed \u201cinterest\u201d that rent-to-own companies may charge on rent-to-own transactions, generally defining \u201cinterest\u201d as lease fees paid in excess of the \u201cretail\u201d price of the goods.\nThere has been increased attention in the United States, at both the state and federal levels, on consumer debt transactions in general, which may result in an increase in legislative and regulatory efforts directed at the rent-to-own industry. The federal government or states may enact additional or different legislation or regulation that would be disadvantageous or otherwise materially adverse to us.\nIn addition to the risk of lawsuits related to the laws that regulate rent-to-own and consumer lease transactions, we or our rent-to-own partners could be subject to lawsuits alleging violations of federal and state laws and regulations and consumer tort law, including fraud, consumer protection, information security and privacy laws, because of the consumer-oriented nature of the rent-to-own industry. A large judgment against us could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, an adverse outcome from a lawsuit, even one against one of our competitors, could result in changes in the way we and others in the industry do business, possibly leading to significant costs or decreased revenues or profitability.\nWe are dependent upon banks to issue credit cards and provide certain other credit products. Our credit card and some of our other credit product programs are dependent on our issuing bank relationships, and their regulators could at any time limit their ability to issue some or all products on our behalf, or that we service on their behalf, or to modify those products significantly. Any significant interruption of those relationships would result in our being unable to originate new receivables and other credit products. It is possible that a regulatory position or action taken with respect to any of the issuing banks through which we have originated credit products or for whom we service receivables might result in the bank\u2019s inability or unwillingness to originate future credit products on our behalf or in partnership with us. In the current state, such a disruption of our issuing bank relationships principally would adversely affect our ability to grow our point-of-sale and direct-to-consumer finance products and other consumer credit offerings and underlying receivables.\nChanges to consumer protection laws or changes in their interpretation may impede collection efforts or otherwise adversely impact our business practices. Federal and state consumer protection laws regulate the creation and enforcement of consumer credit card receivables and other loans. Many of these laws (and the related regulations) are focused on sub-prime lenders and are intended to prohibit or curtail industry-standard practices as well as non-standard practices. For instance, Congress enacted legislation that regulates loans to military personnel through imposing interest rate and other limitations and requiring new disclosures, all as regulated by the Department of Defense. Similarly, in 2009 Congress enacted legislation that required changes to a variety of marketing, billing and collection practices, and the Federal Reserve recently adopted significant changes to a number of practices through its issuance of regulations. Additionally, the CFPB is expected to be an active issuer of credit-related regulations in the near-term, and the scope and nature of those potential regulations are unknown. While our practices are in compliance with these changes, some of the changes (e.g., limitations on the ability to assess up-front fees) have significantly affected the viability of certain of our prior product offerings within the U.S. Changes in the consumer protection laws could result in the following:\n\u2022\nreceivables not originated in compliance with law (or revised interpretations) could become unenforceable and uncollectible under their terms against the obligors;\n\u2022\nwe may be required to credit or refund previously collected amounts;\n\u2022\ncertain fees and finance charges could be limited, prohibited or restricted, which would reduce the profitability of certain accounts;\n\u2022\ncertain of our collection methods could be prohibited, forcing us to revise our practices or adopt more costly or less effective practices;\n\u2022\nlimitations on the content of marketing materials could be imposed that would result in reduced success for our marketing efforts;\n\u2022\nlimitations on our ability to recover on charged-off receivables regardless of any act or omission on our part;\n\u2022\nsome of our products and services could be banned in certain states or at the federal level;\n\u2022\nfederal or state bankruptcy or debtor relief laws could offer additional protections to customers seeking bankruptcy protection, providing a court greater leeway to reduce or discharge amounts owed to us; and\n\u2022\na reduction in our ability or willingness to lend to certain individuals, such as military personnel.\nMaterial regulatory developments are likely to adversely impact our business and results from operations.\nOur Automobile Lending Activities Involve Risks in Addition to Others Described Herein\nAutomobile lending exposes us not only to most of the risks described above but also to additional risks, including the regulatory scheme that governs installment loans and those attendant to relying upon automobiles and their repossession and liquidation value as collateral. In addition, our most significant active Auto Finance segment operation acquires loans on a wholesale basis from used car dealers, for which we rely upon the legal compliance and credit determinations by those dealers.\nDeclines in automobile sales as we saw through 2012 can cause declines in the overall demand for automobile loans. While currently recovering fairly significantly, sales of both new and used cars declined through 2012. While the unavailability of funding may have had a greater impact on our business, the decline in demand in recent years was consequential as well because it adversely affected the volume of our lending transactions and our recoveries of repossessed vehicles at auction. Any such future declines in demand will adversely impact our business.\nFunding for automobile lending may become difficult to obtain and expensive. In the event we are unable to renew or replace any Auto Finance segment facilities that bear refunding or refinancing risks when they become due, our Auto Finance segment could experience significant liquidity constraints and diminution in reported asset values as lenders retain significant cash flows within underlying structured financings or otherwise under security arrangements for repayment of their loans. If we cannot renew or replace future facilities or otherwise are unduly constrained from a liquidity perspective, we may choose to sell part or all of our auto loan portfolios, possibly at less than favorable prices.\nOur automobile lending business is dependent upon referrals from dealers. Currently we provide substantially all of our automobile loans only to or through used car dealers. Providers of automobile financing have traditionally competed based on the interest rate charged, the quality of credit accepted and the flexibility of loan terms offered. In order to be successful, we not only need to be competitive in these areas, but also need to establish and maintain good relations with dealers and provide them with a level of service greater than what they can obtain from our competitors.\nThe financial performance of our automobile loan portfolio is in part dependent upon the liquidation of repossessed automobiles. In the event of certain defaults, we may repossess automobiles and sell repossessed automobiles at wholesale auction markets located throughout the U.S. Auction proceeds from these types of sales and other recoveries rarely\nare sufficient to cover the outstanding balances of the contracts; where we experience these shortfalls, we will experience credit losses. Decreased auction proceeds resulting from depressed prices at which used automobiles may be sold would result in higher credit losses for us. Additionally, higher gasoline prices (like those experienced during 2008) tend to decrease the auction value of certain types of vehicles, such as SUVs.\nRepossession of automobiles entails the risk of litigation and other claims. Although we have contracted with reputable repossession firms to repossess automobiles on defaulted loans, it is not uncommon for consumers to assert that we were not entitled to repossess an automobile or that the repossession was not conducted in accordance with applicable law. These claims increase the cost of our collection efforts and, if correct, can result in awards against us.\nWe Routinely Explore Various Opportunities to Grow Our Business, to Make Investments and to Purchase and Sell Assets\nWe routinely consider acquisitions of, or investments in, portfolios and other assets as well as the sale of portfolios and portions of our business. There are a number of risks attendant to any acquisition, including the possibility that we will overvalue the assets to be purchased and that we will not be able to produce the expected level of profitability from the acquired business or assets. Similarly, there are a number of risks attendant to sales, including the possibility that we will undervalue the assets to be sold. As a result, the impact of any acquisition or sale on our future performance may not be as favorable as expected and actually may be adverse.\nPortfolio purchases may cause fluctuations in our reported Credit and Other Investments segment\u2019s managed receivables data, which may reduce the usefulness of this data in evaluating our business. Our reported Credit and Other Investments segment managed receivables data may fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter as a result of recent and future credit card portfolio acquisitions. As of December 31, 2014, credit card portfolio acquisitions accounted for 26.8% of our total Credit and Other Investments segment managed receivables portfolio based on our ownership percentages.\nReceivables included in purchased portfolios are likely to have been originated using credit criteria different from the criteria of issuing bank partners that have originated accounts on our behalf. Receivables included in any particular purchased portfolio may have significantly different delinquency rates and charge-off rates than the receivables previously originated and purchased by us. These receivables also may earn different interest rates and fees as compared to other similar receivables in our receivables portfolio. These variables could cause our reported managed receivables data to fluctuate substantially in future periods making the evaluation of our business more difficult.\nAny acquisition or investment that we make will involve risks different from and in addition to the risks to which our business is currently exposed. These include the risks that we will not be able to integrate and operate successfully new businesses, that we will have to incur substantial indebtedness and increase our leverage in order to pay for the acquisitions, that we will be exposed to, and have to comply with, different regulatory regimes and that we will not be able to apply our traditional analytical framework (which is what we expect to be able to do) in a successful and value-enhancing manner.\nOther Risks of Our Business\nWe are a holding company with no operations of our own. As a result, our cash flow and ability to service our debt is dependent upon distributions from our subsidiaries. The distribution of subsidiary earnings, or advances or other distributions of funds by subsidiaries to us, all of which are subject to statutory and could be subject to contractual restrictions, are contingent upon the subsidiaries\u2019 cash flows and earnings and are subject to various business and debt covenant considerations.\nAlthough our point-of-sale and direct-to-consumer finance offerings are an important part of our strategic plan, we have limited operating history with these offerings. In late 2013, we expanded into our point-of-sale and direct-to-consumer finance offerings, including our rent-to-own offerings. As with many early stage endeavors, these product offerings may experience under-capitalization, delays, lack of funding, and many other problems, delays, and expenses, many of which are beyond our control. These include, but are not limited to:\n\u2022\ninability to establish profitable strategic relationships with merchants;\n\u2022\ninability to raise sufficient capital to fund our anticipated growth in this area; and\n\u2022\ncompetition from larger and more established competitors, such as banks and finance companies.\nUnless we obtain a bank charter, we cannot issue credit cards other than through agreements with banks. Because we do not have a bank charter, we currently cannot issue credit cards other than through agreements with banks. Unless we\nobtain a bank or credit card bank charter, we will continue to rely upon banking relationships to provide for the issuance of credit cards to our customers. Even if we obtain a bank charter, there may be restrictions on the types of credit that the bank may extend. Our various issuing bank agreements have scheduled expiration dates. If we are unable to extend or execute new agreements with our issuing banks at the expirations of our current agreements with them, or if our existing or new agreements with our issuing banks were terminated or otherwise disrupted, there is a risk that we would not be able to enter into agreements with an alternate provider on terms that we consider favorable or in a timely manner without disruption of our business.\nWe are party to litigation. We are defendants in certain legal proceedings. This includes litigation relating to our former retail micro-loan operations and other litigation customary for a business of our nature. In each case we believe that we have meritorious defenses or that the positions we are asserting otherwise are correct. However, adverse outcomes are possible in these matters, and we could decide to settle one or more of our litigation matters in order to avoid the ongoing cost of litigation or to obtain certainty of outcome. Adverse outcomes or settlements of these matters could require us to pay damages, make restitution, change our business practices or take other actions at a level, or in a manner, that would adversely impact our business.\nWe face heightened levels of economic risk associated with new investment activities. We recently have made a number of investments in businesses that are not directly allied to our traditional lending activities to, or associated with, the underserved consumer credit market. In addition, some of these investments that we have made and may make in the future are or will be in debt or equity securities of businesses over which we exert little or no control, which likely exposes us to greater risks of loss than investments in activities and operations that we control. While we make only those investments we believe have the potential to provide a favorable return, because some of the investments are outside of our core areas of expertise, they entail risks beyond those described elsewhere in this Report. As occurred with respect to certain such investments in 2012 and 2011, these risks could result in the loss of part or all of our investments.\nBecause we outsource account-processing functions that are integral to our business, any disruption or termination of that outsourcing relationship could harm our business. We generally outsource account and payment processing, and in 2014, we paid Total System Services, Inc. $7.9 million for these services. If these agreements were not renewed or were terminated or the services provided to us were otherwise disrupted, we would have to obtain these services from an alternative provider. There is a risk that we would not be able to enter into a similar agreement with an alternate provider on terms that we consider favorable or in a timely manner without disruption of our business.\nUnauthorized or unintentional disclosure of sensitive or confidential customer data could expose us to protracted and costly litigation, and civil and criminal penalties. To conduct our business, we are required to manage, use, and store large amounts of personally identifiable information, consisting primarily of confidential personal and financial data regarding our customers across all operations areas. We also depend on our IT networks and systems, and those of third parties, to process, store, and transmit this information. As a result, we are subject to numerous U.S. federal and state laws designed to protect this information. Security breaches involving our files and infrastructure could lead to unauthorized disclosure of confidential information.\nWe take a number of measures to ensure the security of our hardware and software systems and customer information. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments may result in the technology used by us to protect data being breached or compromised. In the past, consumer finance companies have been the subject of sophisticated and highly targeted attacks on their information technology. An increasing number of websites have reported breaches of their security.\nIf any person, including our employees or those of third-party vendors, negligently disregards or intentionally breaches our established controls with respect to such data or otherwise mismanages or misappropriates that data, we could be subject to costly litigation, monetary damages, fines, and/or criminal prosecution. We do not maintain cyber-security insurance liability coverage and as such we are exposed to the financial risk and losses associated with such incidents. Any unauthorized disclosure of personally identifiable information could subject us to liability under data privacy laws. Further, under credit card rules and our contracts with our card processors, if there is a breach of credit card information that we store, we could be liable to the credit card issuing banks for their cost of issuing new cards and related expenses. In addition, if we fail to follow credit card industry security standards, even if there is no compromise of customer information, we could incur significant fines. Security breaches could also harm our reputation with our customers, which could potentially cause decreased revenues, the loss of existing merchant credit partners, or difficulty in adding new merchant credit partners.\nInternet and data security breaches also could impede us from originating loans over the Internet, cause us to lose customers or otherwise damage our reputation or business. Consumers generally are concerned with security and privacy,\nparticularly on the Internet. As part of our growth strategy, we have originated loans over the Internet. The secure transmission of confidential information over the Internet is essential to maintaining customer confidence in our products and services offered online.\nAdvances in computer capabilities, new discoveries or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the technology used by us to protect customer application and transaction data transmitted over the Internet. In addition to the potential for litigation and civil penalties described above, security breaches could damage our reputation and cause customers to become unwilling to do business with us, particularly over the Internet. Any publicized security problems could inhibit the growth of the Internet as a means of conducting commercial transactions. Our ability to solicit new loans over the Internet would be severely impeded if consumers become unwilling to transmit confidential information online.\nAlso, a party that is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate proprietary information, cause interruption in our operations, damage our computers or those of our users, or otherwise damage our reputation and business.\nRegulation in the areas of privacy and data security could increase our costs. We are subject to various regulations related to privacy and data security/breach, and we could be negatively impacted by these regulations. For example, we are subject to the safeguards guidelines under the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. The safeguards guidelines require that each financial institution develop, implement and maintain a written, comprehensive information security program containing safeguards that are appropriate to the financial institution\u2019s size and complexity, the nature and scope of the financial institution\u2019s activities and the sensitivity of any customer information at issue. Broad-ranging data security laws that affect our business also have been adopted by various states. Compliance with these laws regarding the protection of customer and employee data could result in higher compliance and technology costs for us, as well as potentially significant fines and penalties for non-compliance.\nIn addition to the foregoing enhanced data security requirements, various federal banking regulatory agencies, and as many as 46 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, have enacted data security regulations and laws requiring varying levels of customer notification in the event of a security breach.\nAlso, federal legislators and regulators are increasingly pursuing new guidelines, laws and regulations that, if adopted, could further restrict how we collect, use, share and secure customer information, which could impact some of our current or planned business initiatives.\nUnplanned system interruptions or system failures could harm our business and reputation. Any interruption in the availability of our transactional processing services due to hardware and operating system failures will reduce our revenues and profits. Any unscheduled interruption in our services results in an immediate, and possibly substantial, loss of revenues. Frequent or persistent interruptions in our services could cause current or potential members to believe that our systems are unreliable, leading them to switch to our competitors or to avoid our websites or services, and could permanently harm our reputation.\nAlthough our systems have been designed around industry-standard architectures to reduce downtime in the event of outages or catastrophic occurrences, they remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunication failures, computer viruses, computer denial-of-service attacks, and similar events or disruptions. Some of our systems are not fully redundant, and our disaster recovery planning may not be sufficient for all eventualities. Our systems also are subject to break-ins, sabotage, and intentional acts of vandalism. Despite any precautions we may take, the occurrence of a natural disaster, a decision by any of our third-party hosting providers to close a facility we use without adequate notice for financial or other reasons, or other unanticipated problems at our hosting facilities could cause system interruptions, delays, and loss of critical data, and result in lengthy interruptions in our services. Our business interruption insurance may not be sufficient to compensate us for losses that may result from interruptions in our service as a result of system failures.\nBecause of our loan to a small surface coal mining operation (which, due to loan agreement modifications, we were required to consolidate into our financial statements in 2011, but which has since ceased mining operations), we could be subject to (i) significant administrative, civil, and criminal financial and other penalties if this operation does not comply with environmental, health and safety regulations and (ii) liability to third parties for environmental contamination. The coal mining industry is subject to strict regulation by federal, state and local authorities with respect to matters such as employee health and safety, permitting and licensing requirements, the protection of the environment, the protection of historic and natural resources, plants and wildlife, reclamation and restoration of mining properties after mining is completed, and the effects that mining has on groundwater quality and availability. Federal and state authorities inspect coal mines, and in the aftermath of the April 5, 2010 accident at an underground mine in Central Appalachia, mining operations have experienced, and may in the future continue to experience, a significant increase in the frequency and scope of these inspections. Numerous\ngovernmental permits and approvals are required for mining operations. Mining operations are required to prepare and present to federal, state and/or local authorities data pertaining to the effect or impact that any proposed exploration for or production of coal may have upon the environment.\nThe costs, liabilities and requirements associated with the laws and regulations related to these and other environmental matters may be costly and time-consuming. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative, civil, and criminal financial and other penalties, the imposition of cleanup and site restoration costs and liens and other enforcement measures.\nWe also could be subject to claims by third parties under federal and state statutes and/or common law doctrines resulting from damage to the environment or historic or natural resources or exposure to hazardous substances on the mine property or elsewhere. Liability for environmental contamination may be without regard to fault and may be strict, joint and several, so that we may be held responsible for the entire amount of the contamination or related damages. These and other similar unforeseen impacts that the former mining operation may have on the environment, as well as exposures to hazardous substances or wastes associated with the former mining operation, could result in costs and liabilities that could adversely affect us.\nEven though this former coal mining operation ceased mining operations as of December 31, 2012 and has always been owned and primarily operated by third parties, our financial relationship with this former coal mining operation could subject us to these types of claims and penalties, particularly if these matters were not properly addressed by the owners and operators of the operation. If we are held responsible for sanctions, costs and liabilities in respect of these matters, our profitability could be materially and adversely affected.\nClimate change and related regulatory responses may impact our business. Climate change as a result of emissions of greenhouse gases is a significant topic of discussion and may generate federal and other regulatory responses. It is impracticable to predict with any certainty the impact on our business of climate change or the regulatory responses to it, although we recognize that they could be significant. The most direct impact is likely to be an increase in energy costs, which would adversely impact consumers and their ability to incur and repay indebtedness. However, we are uncertain of the ultimate impact, either directionally or quantitatively, of climate change and related regulatory responses on our business.\nRisks Relating to an Investment in Our Securities\nThe price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly, and this may make it difficult for you to resell your shares of our common stock when you want or at prices you find attractive. The price of our common stock on the NASDAQ Global Select Market constantly changes. We expect that the market price of our common stock will continue to fluctuate. The market price of our common stock may fluctuate in response to numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include the following:\n\u2022\nactual or anticipated fluctuations in our operating results;\n\u2022\nchanges in expectations as to our future financial performance, including financial estimates by securities analysts and investors;\n\u2022\nthe overall financing environment, which is critical to our value;\n\u2022\nthe operating and stock performance of our competitors and other sub-prime lenders;\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of new products or services or significant contracts, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments;\n\u2022\nchanges in interest rates;\n\u2022\nthe announcement of enforcement actions or investigations against us or our competitors or other negative publicity relating to us or our industry;\n\u2022\nchanges in GAAP, laws, regulations or the interpretations thereof that affect our various business activities and segments;\n\u2022\ngeneral domestic or international economic, market and political conditions;\n\u2022\nchanges in ownership by executive officers, directors and parties related to them who control a majority of our common stock;\n\u2022\nadditions or departures of key personnel; and\n\u2022\nfuture sales of our common stock and the transfer or cancellation of shares of common stock pursuant to a share lending agreement.\nIn addition, the stock markets from time to time experience extreme price and volume fluctuations that may be unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of companies. These broad fluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock, regardless of our actual operating performance.\nFuture sales of our common stock or equity-related securities in the public market, including sales of our common stock pursuant to share lending agreements or short sale transactions by purchasers of convertible senior notes, could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock and our ability to raise funds in new stock offerings. Sales of significant amounts of our common stock or equity-related securities in the public market, including sales pursuant to share lending agreements, or the perception that such sales will occur, could adversely affect prevailing trading prices of our common stock and could impair our ability to raise capital through future offerings of equity or equity-related securities. Future sales of shares of common stock or the availability of shares of common stock for future sale, including sales of our common stock in short sale transactions by purchasers of our convertible senior notes, may have a material adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock.\nWe have the ability to issue preferred stock, warrants, convertible debt and other securities without shareholder approval. Our common stock may be subordinate to classes of preferred stock issued in the future in the payment of dividends and other distributions made with respect to common stock, including distributions upon liquidation or dissolution. Our articles of incorporation permit our Board of Directors to issue preferred stock without first obtaining shareholder approval. If we issued preferred stock, these additional securities may have dividend or liquidation preferences senior to the common stock. If we issue convertible preferred stock, a subsequent conversion may dilute the current common shareholders\u2019 interest. We have similar abilities to issue convertible debt, warrants and other equity securities.\nOur executive officers, directors and parties related to them, in the aggregate, control a majority of our common stock and may have the ability to control matters requiring shareholder approval. Our executive officers, directors and parties related to them own a large enough share of our common stock to have an influence on, if not control of, the matters presented to shareholders. As a result, these shareholders may have the ability to control matters requiring shareholder approval, including the election and removal of directors, the approval of significant corporate transactions, such as any reclassification, reorganization, merger, consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets and the control of our management and affairs. Accordingly, this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying, deferring or preventing a change of control of us, impede a merger, consolidation, takeover or other business combination involving us or discourage a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us, which in turn could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nThe right to receive payments on our convertible senior notes is subordinated to the rights of our existing and future secured creditors. Our convertible senior notes are unsecured and are subordinate to existing and future secured obligations to the extent of the value of the assets securing such obligations. As a result, in the event of a bankruptcy, liquidation, dissolution, reorganization or similar proceeding of our company, our assets generally would be available to satisfy obligations of our secured debt before any payment may be made on the convertible senior notes. To the extent that such assets cannot satisfy in full our secured debt, the holders of such debt would have a claim for any shortfall that would rank equally in right of payment (or effectively senior if the debt were issued by a subsidiary) with the convertible senior notes. In such an event, we may not have sufficient assets remaining to pay amounts on any or all of the convertible senior notes.\nAs of December 31, 2014, Atlanticus Holdings Corporation had outstanding: $50.1 million of secured indebtedness, which would rank senior in right of payment to the convertible senior notes; $11.9 million of senior unsecured indebtedness in addition to the convertible senior notes that would rank equal in right of payment to the convertible senior notes; and no subordinated indebtedness. Included in senior secured indebtedness are certain guarantees we have executed in favor of our subsidiaries. For more information on our outstanding indebtedness, See Note 9, \"Notes Payable,\" and Note 16, \"Related Party Transactions,\" to our consolidated financial statements included herein.\nOur convertible senior notes are junior to the indebtedness of our subsidiaries. Our convertible senior notes are structurally subordinated to the existing and future claims of our subsidiaries\u2019 creditors. Holders of the convertible senior notes are not creditors of our subsidiaries. Any claims of holders of the convertible senior notes to the assets of our subsidiaries derive from our own equity interests in those subsidiaries. Claims of our subsidiaries\u2019 creditors will generally have priority as to the assets of our subsidiaries over our own equity interest claims and will therefore have priority over the holders of the convertible senior notes. Consequently, the convertible senior notes are effectively subordinate to all liabilities, whether or not secured, of any of our subsidiaries and any subsidiaries that we may in the future acquire or establish. Our subsidiaries\u2019 creditors also may include general creditors and taxing authorities. As of December 31, 2014, our subsidiaries had total liabilities of approximately $156.1 million (including the $50.1 million of senior secured indebtedness mentioned above),\nexcluding intercompany indebtedness. In addition, in the future, we may decide to increase the portion of our activities that we conduct through subsidiaries.\nNote Regarding Risk Factors\nThe risk factors presented above are all of the ones that we currently consider material. However, they are not the only ones facing our company. Additional risks not presently known to us, or which we currently consider immaterial, may also adversely affect us. There may be risks that a particular investor views differently from us, and our analysis might be wrong. If any of the risks that we face actually occurs, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected and could differ materially from any possible results suggested by any forward-looking statements that we have made or might make. In such case, the trading price of our common stock or other securities could decline, and you could lose part or all of your investment. We expressly disclaim any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise, except as required by law.", "PERMNO": 86819, "SIC": 6141, "TIC": "ATLC"}
