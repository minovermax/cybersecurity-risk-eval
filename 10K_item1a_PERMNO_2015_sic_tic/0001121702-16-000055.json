{"cik": "1121702", "company": "METABOLIX, INC.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-03-29", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the following information about risks, together with the other information contained in this report. If any of the circumstances or events described below actually arises or occurs, our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition could be harmed. In any such case, the market price of our common stock could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Relating to our Financial Position\nWe will need to secure additional funding and may be unable to raise additional capital on favorable terms, if at all.\nThe company held unrestricted cash and cash equivalents of approximately $12.3 million at December 31, 2015. Our present capital resources are not sufficient to fund our planned operations for a twelve month period, and therefore, raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our independent registered public accounting firm included an explanatory paragraph in its report on our financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015 with respect to this uncertainty.\nWe were successful during 2015 in raising $14.7 million, net of offering costs, through a private placement of equity securities and on October 7, 2015, we entered into a common stock purchase agreement with Aspire Capital Fund, LLC, (\u201cAspire\u201d) under which Aspire is committed to purchase, at our direction, up to an aggregate of $20.0 million of shares of our common stock over a 30 month period that began on November 9, 2015. Even if we sell shares under the Aspire agreement, we likely will require additional funding during the next twelve months, to continue our operations and support our capital needs. The timing, structure and vehicles for obtaining future financing are under consideration, but there can be no assurance that such financing efforts will be successful. The current economic environment and recent uncertainty and volatility in financial markets may make it difficult to obtain additional financing. Failure to receive additional funding in 2016 may force the Company to delay, scale back or otherwise modify its business and manufacturing plans, sales and marketing efforts, research and development activities and other operations, and/or seek strategic alternatives.\nWe continue to face significant challenges and uncertainties and, as a result, our available capital resources may be consumed more rapidly than currently expected due to (i) lower than expected sales of our biopolymer products as a result of slow market adoption; (ii) increases in capital costs and operating expenses related to the establishment and start-up of biopolymer manufacturing on our own or with third parties; (iii) changes we may make to the business that affect ongoing operating expenses; (iv) changes we may make to our business strategy; (v) changes in our research and development spending plans; (vi) higher than expected costs in connection with the relocation of our Massachusetts facilities, and (vii) other items affecting our forecasted level of expenditures and use of cash resources.\nIf we issue equity or debt securities to raise additional funds, (i) we may incur fees associated with such issuance, (ii) our existing stockholders may experience dilution from the issuance of new equity securities, (iii) we may incur ongoing interest expense and be required to grant a security interest in our assets in connection with any debt issuance, and (iv) the new equity or debt securities may have rights, preferences and privileges senior to those of our existing stockholders. In addition, utilization of our net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards may be subject to significant annual limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 due to ownership changes resulting from future equity financing transactions. If we raise additional funds through collaboration, licensing or other similar arrangements, it may be necessary to relinquish valuable rights to our potential products or proprietary technologies, or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us.\nThe extent to which we utilize the facility with Aspire as a source of funding will depend on a number of factors, including the prevailing market price of our common stock, the volume of trading in our common stock and the extent to which we are able to secure funds from other sources. The purchase agreement contains limitations on the number of shares\nthat we may sell to Aspire. Additionally, we and Aspire may not effect any sales of shares of our common stock under the purchase agreement during the continuance of an event of default or on any trading day that the closing sale price of our common stock is less than $0.50 per share. Even if we are able to access the full $20.0 million under the purchase agreement, we may still need additional capital to fully implement our business, operating and development plans.\nWe have a history of net losses and our future profitability is uncertain.\nWith the exception of 2012, when the Company recognized $38.9 million of deferred revenue from the terminated joint venture with Archer Daniels Midland, we have recorded losses since our inception, including our fiscal year ended December 31, 2015. At December 31, 2015, our accumulated deficit was approximately $326 million. Our operating losses since inception and the insufficiency of our existing capital resources to fund our planned operations for a twelve month period raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern. Our independent registered public accounting firm included an explanatory paragraph in its report on our financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2015 with respect to this uncertainty. Since 1992, we have been engaged primarily in research and development and early-stage commercial activities. Because we have a limited history of commercial operations and we operate in a rapidly evolving industry, we cannot be certain that we will generate sufficient revenue to operate our business and become profitable.\nOur ability to generate revenues in the near-term is highly dependent on the successful commercialization of our biopolymer products, which is subject to many risks and uncertainties as described below. This is our first and only product family in the market. We expect that it will take time for our production to ramp up to an economical scale while the market for our products expands. As a result, we expect to have significant losses and negative cash flow for at least the next several years, as we incur additional costs and expenses for the continued development and expansion of our business, including the costs of establishing manufacturing capacity and ongoing expenses of research and product development. The amount we spend will impact our ability to become profitable and this will depend, in part, on the number of new products that we attempt to develop. We may not achieve any or all of these goals and, thus, we cannot provide assurances that we will ever be profitable or achieve significant revenues.\nEven if we can successfully manufacture and sell our products, whether we will be able to generate a profit on any of these products is highly uncertain and depends on a number of factors including the cost of production, the price we are able to charge for these products, and the emergence of competing products.\nRisks Relating to our Biopolymers Business\nOur biopolymer products may not achieve market success.\nImplementation of our strategy for building a commercially successful specialty biopolymers business is at an early stage. We currently have limited customer commitments for commercial quantities of our biopolymer products. Some prospective customers are currently evaluating and testing our products prior to making larger-scale purchase decisions, but the time required for conversion of customers to commercial purchases is often long. The successful commercialization of our biopolymers is also dependent on our customers\u2019 ability to commercialize the end-products that they make with our biopolymers, which may never gain market acceptance.\nMarket acceptance of our products will depend on numerous factors, many of which are outside of our control, including among others:\n\u2022\npublic acceptance of such products;\n\u2022\nour ability to produce products of consistent quality that offer functionality comparable or superior to existing or new polymer products;\n\u2022\nour ability to produce products fit for their intended purpose;\n\u2022\nour ability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals for our products;\n\u2022\nthe speed at which potential customers qualify our biopolymers for use in their products;\n\u2022\nthe pricing of our products compared to competitive products, including petroleum-based plastics;\n\u2022\nthe strategic reaction of companies that market competitive products;\n\u2022\nour reliance on third parties who support or control production or distribution channels; and\n\u2022\ngeneral market conditions.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully produce biopolymers in a timely or economical manner, or at all.\nWe do not currently have a facility for commercial scale production of biopolymers. We have expanded our pilot scale production facility for biopolymers while we continue to evaluate various larger scale manufacturing options. However, our biopolymer manufacturing technology is highly complex. Construction of a new manufacturing facility or modification of an existing facility to make it suitable for our manufacturing process is likely to be time-consuming and expensive. We cannot assure you that we will have the necessary funds to finance the construction or modification of a commercial\nmanufacturing facility, or that we will be able to develop a manufacturing infrastructure in a timely or economical manner, or at all.\nWe may depend on obtaining commercial partners, production partners or government funding to finance and/or construct commercial manufacturing facilities for biopolymer production. In late 2015, we began accelerating our efforts to secure commercial production capacity of up to 10 KT or approximately 22 million pounds per year. Operating at the commercial level is a critical milestone in establishing a successful specialty biopolymers business. Our goal is to leverage existing industry assets and capabilities where possible and to secure this capacity in a capital-efficient manner with a manufacturing partner. There can be no assurance that we will be successful in establishing such a manufacturing partnership. Further, if we do succeed in establishing such a partnership, the terms of such an arrangement may require us to relinquish valuable rights or subject us to other terms that are not favorable to us.\nOur future biopolymer production costs are uncertain and may ultimately be higher than we expect. Further, because of the lead-time required for construction of a manufacturing facility, we may have to make capital investments before we have proven the market demand for our products. If the commercial manufacturing capacity that we build or otherwise obtain is not appropriate to the level of market demand, manufacturing costs may not be economical. If we fail to develop adequate manufacturing capacity and expertise or fail to manufacture biopolymers economically at large scale or in commercial volumes, the commercialization of our biopolymers and our business, financial condition and results of operations will be materially adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to obtain raw materials in sufficient quantities or in a timely manner.\nWe expect that the production of our PHA biopolymer products will require large volumes of feedstock. We cannot predict the future availability of any particular feedstock or be sure that we will be able to purchase it in sufficient quantities, at acceptable prices, or in a timely manner. If these materials cannot be obtained in sufficient quantities or at acceptable prices, our ability to produce our products may be impaired, the cost of our products may increase, and our business will be adversely affected.\nWe may rely heavily on future collaborative partners.\nWe may enter into strategic partnerships to develop and commercialize our current and future products or research and development programs with other companies to accomplish one or more of the following:\n\u2022\nobtain capital, equipment and facilities,\n\u2022\nobtain funding for research and development programs, product development programs and commercialization activities,\n\u2022\nobtain expertise in relevant markets,\n\u2022\nobtain access to raw materials, and/or\n\u2022\nobtain sales and marketing services or support.\nWe may not be successful in establishing or maintaining suitable partnerships, and we may not be able to negotiate collaboration agreements having terms satisfactory to us or at all. Failure to make or maintain these arrangements or a delay or failure in a collaborative partner\u2019s performance under any such arrangements could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nWe face and will face substantial competition.\nWe face and will face substantial competition from a variety of companies in the biodegradable, renewable resource-based plastic segment, as well as from companies in the conventional, non-biodegradable petroleum-based industry segment. Some of their products are suitable for use in a range of products at a price which may be lower than our premium priced product offerings. Many of these companies have longer operating histories, greater name recognition, larger customer bases and significantly greater financial, sales and marketing, manufacturing, distribution, technical and other resources than us. Our competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements. In addition, current and potential competitors have established or may establish financial or strategic relationships among themselves or with existing or potential customers or other third parties. Accordingly, new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share. We cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current or new competitors.\nOur products are made using genetically-engineered systems and may be, or may be perceived as being, harmful to human health or the environment.\nOur PHA biopolymers have been produced by genetically engineered microbes using sugar derived from genetically engineered corn as a feedstock. Our future products may be produced from genetically engineered feedstocks through fermentation using genetically engineered microbes. Some countries have adopted regulations prohibiting or limiting the\nproduction of genetically-engineered crops and the sale of products made using genetically engineered organisms or genetically engineered feedstocks. Such regulations could harm our business and impair our ability to produce biobased polymers in that manner. The subject of genetic engineering of crops and other species has received negative publicity and has aroused public debate. Government authorities could, for social or other purposes, prohibit or regulate the development and use of genetically-engineered organisms or products made from such organisms. Social concerns relating to genetically-engineered organisms could adversely affect acceptance of our products.\nOur success will be influenced by the price of petroleum relative to the price of biobased feedstocks.\nOur success may be influenced by the cost of our products relative to petroleum-based polymers. The cost of petroleum-based polymers is in part based on the price of petroleum. To date, our PHA biopolymers have been primarily manufactured using corn sugar, an agricultural feedstock. As the price of plant sugar feedstocks increases and/or the price of petroleum decreases, our biobased products may be less competitive relative to petroleum-based polymers. A material decrease in the cost of conventional petroleum-based polymers may require a reduction in the prices of our products for them to remain attractive in the marketplace and/or reduce the size of our addressable market.\nWe are subject to significant foreign and domestic government regulations which are subject to change, and compliance or failure to comply with these regulations could harm our business.\nThe manufacture, use, sale and marketing of PHA biopolymers is subject to government regulations in the U.S. and other countries, including requirements for government approval of food contact applications, hazardous materials regulations, regulations relating to marketing claims, and environmental, health and safety laws. Failure to comply with governmental regulations or to obtain government approval for our products could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Further, our compliance with governmental regulations that are not enforced against our competitors could put us at a competitive disadvantage. One of the key markets for our biopolymer products is as biobased, compostable or biodegradable substitutes for non-biodegradable petroleum-based plastics. This market is driven in part by laws, regulations and policies designed to encourage or mandate the increased use of biobased and/or biodegradable alternatives to petroleum-based plastics. However, the regulatory framework governing biopolymers is complex, difficult to predict and largely beyond our control. The phasing out or elimination of these or similar laws and regulations, or the adoption of laws and regulations that are so broadly written as to ban our products along with the targeted non-biodegradable or petroleum-based plastic materials, could adversely affect our business.\nWe may not have adequate insurance and may have substantial exposure to payment of product liability claims.\nThe testing, manufacture, marketing, and sale of our products may involve product liability risks. Although we currently have insurance covering product liability claims up to $5 million per occurrence and in the aggregate, we may not be able to maintain this insurance at an acceptable cost, if at all. In addition, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential losses. If claims or losses exceed our liability insurance coverage, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and our financial condition.\nRisks Relating to our Crop Science Program\nWe may not be successful in spinning out our crop science program.\nIn order to focus our efforts on our biopolymers business, we are planning to spin out our crop science program, which we call \u201cYield10 Bioscience,\u201d into a separately funded venture focused on the development and commercialization of our crop science technologies. However, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in identifying third parties interested in funding or otherwise participating in Yield10 Bioscience on acceptable terms, if at all. The risks described below may impact our ability to spin out the crop science program. If we are not successful in spinning out the crop science program, we may incur substantial costs to either continue or wind down the program.\nOur crop science product development cycle is lengthy and uncertain and will depend heavily on future collaborative partners.\nThe technology and processes used in our crop science program and the application of our technology to enhance photosynthetic efficiency of crops are at an early stage of development. Research and development in the seed, agricultural biotechnology, and larger agriculture industries is expensive and prolonged and entails considerable uncertainty. Completion of our development work will require a significant investment of both time and money, if it can be completed at all. To successfully develop and commercialize our innovations, we expect that Metabolix and/or Yield10 Bioscience will need to form collaborations with established agricultural industry companies. The industry is highly concentrated and dominated by a small number of large players, which could impact efforts to form such collaborations. Metabolix and/or Yield10 Bioscience may not be successful in establishing or maintaining suitable partnerships, and may not be able to negotiate\ncollaboration agreements having terms satisfactory to us or at all. In addition, industry collaborators have significant resources and development capabilities and may develop products and technologies that compete with or negatively impact the development and commercialization of our technologies.\nOur crop science program may not be successful in developing commercial products.\nWe and our potential future collaborators may spend many years and dedicate significant financial and other resources developing traits that will never be commercialized. Seeds containing the traits that we develop may never become commercialized for any of the following reasons:\n\u2022\nour traits may not be successfully validated in the target crops;\n\u2022\nour traits may not have the desired effect sought by future collaborators for the relevant crops;\n\u2022\ndevelopment and validation of traits, particularly during field trials, may be adversely affected by environmental or other circumstances beyond our control;\n\u2022\nwe or our future collaborators may be unable to obtain the requisite regulatory approvals for the seeds containing our traits;\n\u2022\ncompetitors may launch competing or more effective seed traits or seeds;\n\u2022\na market may not exist for seeds containing our traits or such seeds may not be commercially successful;\n\u2022\nfuture collaborators may be unable to fully develop and commercialize products containing our seed traits or may decide, for whatever reason, not to commercialize such products; and\n\u2022\nwe may be unable to patent our traits in the necessary jurisdictions.\nConsumer and government resistance to genetically modified organisms may negatively affect the ability to commercialize crops containing our traits.\nFood and feed made from genetically modified seeds are not accepted by many consumers and in certain countries production of certain genetically modified crops is effectively prohibited, including throughout the European Union, due to concerns over such products\u2019 effects on food safety and the environment. The high public profile of biotechnology in food and feed production and lack of consumer acceptance of products to which we have devoted substantial resources could have a negative impact on the commercial success of products that incorporate our traits and could materially and adversely affect our ability to obtain collaborations and to finance our crop science program. Metabolix and/or Yield10 Bioscience may incur liability and/or legal expenses if there are claims that our genetically-engineered crops damage the environment or contaminate other farm crops.\nRisks Relating to Intellectual Property\nPatent protection for our products is important and uncertain.\nOur commercial success may depend in part on our obtaining and maintaining patent protection for our technologies in the United States and other jurisdictions, as well as successfully enforcing and defending this intellectual property against third-party challenges. If we are not able to obtain or defend patent protection for our technologies, then we will not be able to exclude competitors from developing or marketing such technologies, and this could negatively impact our ability to generate sufficient revenues or profits from product sales to justify the cost of development of our technologies and to achieve or maintain profitability. Our issued patents have expiration dates ranging from 2016 through 2032.\nOur patent position involves complex legal and factual questions. Accordingly, we cannot predict the breadth of claims that may be allowed or enforced in our patents or in third-party patents. Patents may not be issued for any pending or future pending patent applications owned by or licensed to us, and claims allowed under any issued patent or future issued patent owned or licensed by us may not be valid or sufficiently broad to protect our technologies. Moreover, we may be unable to protect certain of our intellectual property in the United States or in foreign countries. Foreign jurisdictions may not afford the same protections as U.S. law, and we cannot ensure that foreign patent applications will have the same scope as the U.S. patents. There will be many countries in which we will choose not to file or maintain patents because of the costs involved. Competitors may also design around our patents or develop competing technologies.\nAdditionally, any issued patents owned by or licensed to us now or in the future may be challenged, invalidated, or circumvented. We could incur substantial costs to bring suits or other proceedings in which we may assert or defend our patent rights or challenge the patent rights of third parties. An unfavorable outcome of any such litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nThird parties may claim that we infringe their intellectual property, and we could suffer significant litigation or licensing expense as a result.\nVarious U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications owned by third parties exist in areas relevant to our products and processes. We could incur substantial costs to challenge third party patents. If third parties assert claims against us or our customers alleging infringement of their patents or other intellectual property rights, we could incur substantial costs and diversion of management resources in defending these claims, and the defense of these claims could have a material adverse effect on our business. In addition, if we are unsuccessful in defending against these claims, these third parties may be awarded substantial damages, as well as injunctive or other equitable relief against us, which could effectively block our ability to make, use, sell, distribute, or market our products and services in the United States or abroad. Alternatively, we may seek licenses to such third party intellectual property. However, we may be unable to obtain these licenses on acceptable terms, if at all. Our failure to obtain the necessary licenses or other rights could prevent the sale, manufacture, or distribution of some of our products and, therefore, could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely in part on trade secrets to protect our technology, and our failure to obtain or maintain trade secret protection could limit our ability to compete.\nWe rely on trade secrets to protect some of our technology and proprietary information, especially where we believe patent protection is not appropriate or obtainable. However, trade secrets are difficult to protect. Litigating a claim that a third party had illegally obtained and was using our trade secrets would be expensive and time consuming, and the outcome would be unpredictable. Moreover, if our competitors independently develop similar knowledge, methods and know-how, it will be difficult for us to enforce our rights and our business could be harmed.\nRisks Relating to Owning our Common Stock\nRaising additional funds may cause dilution to our existing stockholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies.\nIf we raise additional funds through equity offerings or offerings of equity-linked securities, including warrants or convertible debt securities, we expect that our existing stockholders will experience significant dilution, and the terms of such securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect your rights as a stockholder. Debt financing, if available, may subject us to restrictive covenants that could limit our flexibility in conducting future business activities, including covenants limiting or restricting our ability to incur additional debt, dispose of assets or make capital expenditures. The Company may also incur ongoing interest expense and be required to grant a security interest in Company assets in connection with any debt issuance. If we raise additional funds through strategic partnerships or licensing agreements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to our technologies or grant licenses on terms that are not favorable to us. In addition, the interests of our existing stockholders in our crop science program and related technologies may be significantly diluted in connection with our efforts to spin out Yield10 Bioscience.\nTrading volume in our stock is low and an active trading market for our common stock may not be available on a consistent basis to provide stockholders with adequate liquidity. Our stock price may be extremely volatile, and our stockholders could lose a significant part of their investment.\nTrading volume in our stock is low and an active trading market for shares of our common stock may not be sustained on a consistent basis. The public trading price for our common stock will be affected by a number of factors, including:\n\u2022\nreported progress in our biopolymers business or with respect to our efforts to spin out Yield10 Bioscience or develop crop related technologies, relative to investor expectations;\n\u2022\nchanges in earnings estimates, investors\u2019 perceptions, recommendations by securities analysts or our failure to achieve analysts\u2019 earnings estimates;\n\u2022\nquarterly variations in our or our competitors\u2019 results of operations;\n\u2022\ngeneral market conditions and other factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors;\n\u2022\nfuture issuances and/or sales of our common stock or preferred stock;\n\u2022\nannouncements or the absence of announcements by us, or our competitors, regarding acquisitions, new products, significant contracts, commercial relationships or capital commitments;\n\u2022\ncommencement of, or involvement in, litigation;\n\u2022\nany major change in our board of directors or management;\n\u2022\nchanges in governmental regulations or in the status of our regulatory approvals;\n\u2022\nannouncements related to patents issued to us or our competitors and to litigation involving our intellectual property;\n\u2022\na lack of, or limited, or negative industry or security analyst coverage;\n\u2022\ndevelopments in our industry and general economic conditions;\n\u2022\nshort-selling or similar activities by third parties; and\n\u2022\nother factors described elsewhere in these \u201cRisk Factors.\u201d\nAs a result of these factors, our stockholders may not be able to resell their shares at, or above, their purchase price. In addition, the stock prices of many technology companies have experienced wide fluctuations that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of those companies. Any negative change in the public\u2019s perception of the prospects of industrial or agricultural biotechnology or \u201cclean technology\u201d companies could depress our stock price regardless of our results of operations. These factors may have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock.\nProvisions in our certificate of incorporation and by-laws and Delaware law might discourage, delay or prevent a change of control of our company or changes in our management and, therefore, depress the trading price of our common stock.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation and by-laws and Delaware law may discourage, delay or prevent a merger, acquisition or other change in control that stockholders may consider favorable, including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares of our common stock. These provisions may also prevent or frustrate attempts by our stockholders to replace or remove our management.\nIn addition, Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law prohibits a publicly-held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder, generally a person which together with its affiliates owns, or within the last three years has owned, 15% or more of our voting stock, for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder, unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner.\nThe existence of the foregoing provisions and anti-takeover measures could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock. They could also deter potential acquirers of our Company, thereby reducing the likelihood that our stockholders could receive a premium for their common stock in an acquisition.\nConcentration of ownership among our existing officers, directors and principal stockholders may prevent other stockholders from influencing significant corporate decisions and depress our stock price.\nBased on the number of shares outstanding as of December 31, 2015, our officers, directors and stockholders who hold at least 5% of our stock beneficially own a combined total of approximately 73.4% of our outstanding common stock, including shares of common stock subject to stock options and warrants that are currently exercisable or are exercisable within 60 days after December 31, 2015. If these officers, directors, and principal stockholders or a group of our principal stockholders act together, they will be able to exert a significant degree of influence over our management and affairs and control matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and approval of mergers, business combination or other significant transactions. The interests of one or more of these stockholders may not always coincide with our interests or the interests of other stockholders. For instance, officers, directors, and principal stockholders, acting together, could cause us to enter into transactions or agreements that we would not otherwise consider. Similarly, this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company otherwise favored by our other stockholders. As of December 31, 2015, Jack W. Schuler and William P. Scully beneficially owned approximately 49.3% and approximately 11.6% of our common stock, respectively.", "PERMNO": 91615, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "YTEN"}
