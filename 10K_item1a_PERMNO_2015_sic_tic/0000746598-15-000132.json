{"cik": "746598", "company": "BRADY CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2015-09-21", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nInvestors should carefully consider the risks set forth below and all other information contained in this report and other documents we file with the SEC. The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we have identified as material, but are not the only risks and uncertainties facing us. Our business is also subject to general risk and uncertainties that affect many other companies, such as market conditions, geopolitical events, changes in laws or accounting rules, fluctuations in interest rates, terrorism, wars or conflicts, major health concerns, natural disasters or other disruptions of expected economic or business conditions. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial also may impair our business, including our results of operations, liquidity and financial conditions.\nBusiness Risks\nFailure to successfully implement our Workplace Safety strategy, or if successfully implemented, failure to realize the benefits expected from the strategy, may adversely affect our business, sales, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity.\nIn fiscal 2015, the Workplace Safety segment represented 31.2% of our total sales. Organic sales in the WPS segment declined 0.4% in fiscal 2015, 4.6% in fiscal 2014, and 7.0% in fiscal 2013, all compared to the same periods in the prior year. During fiscal 2015, we recorded impairment charges of $46.9 million primarily related to the goodwill and other intangible assets in the WPS Americas and WPS Asia-Pacific (\"WPS APAC\") reporting units. The WPS segment has experienced a deterioration in sales and profits due to a reduction in direct catalog mailings, increased digital competition, and pricing adjustments. While traditional direct marketing channels such as catalogs are important means of selling WPS products, an increasing number of customers are purchasing products on the Internet. The Company's strategy to grow this business includes: a focus on workplace safety critical industries, expansion of our product offerings, further developed pricing capabilities, and increased investment in digital. There is a risk that the Company may not continue to successfully implement this strategy, or if successfully implemented, not realize its expected benefits, due to the continued levels of increased competition and pricing pressure brought about by the Internet. Although the rate of sales decline has slowed over the past three years, there is also a risk that the Company may not be able to permanently reverse the downward trends in this business and return the segment to historic levels of sales and profits. If these risks materialize, their effects could adversely impact our business, sales, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity.\nFailure to develop technologically advanced products that meet customer demands (including price expectations) and expand into adjacent product categories and markets could adversely impact our business, sales, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity.\nDevelopment of technologically advanced new products is targeted as a driver of our organic growth and profitability. Technology is changing rapidly and our competitors are innovating quickly. If we do not keep pace with developing technologically advanced products, we risk product commoditization, deterioration of the value of our brand, and reduced ability to effectively compete. We must continue to develop innovative products, as well as acquire and retain the necessary intellectual property rights in these products. If we fail to make innovations, or we launch products with quality problems, or if customers do not accept our products, then our business, sales, results of operations, cash flow, and liquidity could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, our strategy is to expand into higher-growth adjacent product categories and markets with technologically advanced new products. New product development and marketing efforts, including entry in markets where we have limited or no prior experience, such as healthcare and leisure and entertainment, have inherent risks. There can be no assurance that we will successfully execute these strategies. If we are unable to gain market share or successfully expand into adjacent markets with innovative new products, our business, sales, results of operations, cash flow, and liquidity could be adversely affected.\nFailure to execute facility consolidations and maintain acceptable operational service metrics may adversely impact our business, sales, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity.\nDuring fiscal years 2014 and 2015, we incurred unplanned operating costs related to consolidation of certain facilities and experienced deterioration of key service metrics. We remain challenged by operating inefficiencies stemming from these actions, but we are focused on improvements and returning to prior service metrics. We continually assess our global footprint and expect to implement additional measures to reduce our cost structure, simplify our business, and standardize our processes, and these actions could result in unplanned operating costs and business disruptions in the future. If these risks materialize, or if we fail to successfully address these inefficiencies, their effects could adversely impact our business, sales, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity.\nOur failure or the failure of third-party service providers to protect our sites, networks and systems against security breaches, or otherwise to protect our confidential information, may substantially harm our business, sales, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity.\nOur business systems collect, maintain, transmit and store data about our customers, vendors and others, including credit card information and personally identifiable information, as well as other confidential and proprietary information. We also employ third-party service providers that store, process and transmit proprietary, personal and confidential information on our behalf. We rely on encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties in an effort to securely transmit confidential and sensitive information, including credit card numbers. Our security measures, and those of our third-party service providers, may not detect or prevent all attempts to hack our systems, denial-of-service attacks, viruses, malicious software, break-ins, phishing attacks, social engineering, security breaches or other attacks and similar disruptions that may jeopardize the security of information stored in or transmitted by our sites, networks and systems or that we or our third-party service providers otherwise maintain. We and our service providers may not have the resources or technical sophistication to anticipate or prevent all types of attacks, and techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to or sabotage systems change frequently and may not be known until launched against us or our third-party service providers. In addition, security breaches can also occur as a result of non-technical issues, including intentional or inadvertent breaches by our employees or by persons with whom we have commercial relationships. Although we maintain privacy, data breach and network security liability insurance, we cannot be certain that our coverage will be adequate or cover liabilities actually incurred, or that insurance will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all. Any compromise or breach of our security measures, or those of our third-party service providers, could adversely impact our ability to conduct business, violate applicable privacy, data security and other laws, and cause significant legal and financial exposure, adverse publicity, and a loss of confidence in our security measures, which could have an adverse and material effect on our business, sales, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity.\nFailure to compete effectively or remain competitive may have a negative impact on our business, sales, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity.\nWe actively compete with companies that produce and market the same or similar products, and in some instances, with companies that sell different products that are designed for the same end user. Additionally, we continue to face competition through the Internet in our entire business. Competition may force us to reduce prices or incur additional costs to remain competitive. We compete on the basis of price, customer support, product innovation, product offering, product quality, expertise, production capabilities, and for multinational customers, our global footprint. Present or future competitors may develop and introduce new and enhanced products, offer products based on alternative technologies and processes, accept lower profit, have greater financial, technical or other resources, or lower production costs or have other pricing advantages. Any of these could put us at a disadvantage by threatening our share of sales or reducing our profit margins, which could adversely impact our results of operations, cash flow and liquidity. Additionally, throughout our global business, distributors and customers may seek lower cost sourcing opportunities, which could result in a loss of business that may adversely impact our business, sales, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity.\nDeterioration of or instability in the global economy and financial markets may adversely affect our business, sales, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity.\nOur business and operating results could be affected by global economic conditions. In fiscal 2015, our business was negatively impacted by the weak economy in Australia and Brazil. When global economic conditions deteriorate or economic uncertainty continues, customers and potential customers may experience deterioration of their businesses, which may result in the delay or cancellation of plans to purchase our products. Our sensitivity to economic cycles and any related fluctuations in the businesses of our customers or potential customers could have a material adverse impact on our business, sales, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity.\nThe global nature of our business exposes us to foreign currency fluctuations that could adversely affect our business, sales, results of operations, cash flow, and liquidity.\nNearly 45% of our sales are derived outside the United States. Sales and purchases in currencies other than the U.S. dollar expose us to fluctuations in foreign currencies relative to the U.S. dollar, and may adversely affect our financial statements. Increased strength of the U.S. dollar will increase the effective price of our products sold in currencies other than U.S. dollars into other countries. Decreased strength of the U.S. dollar could adversely affect the cost of materials, products, and services purchased overseas. Our sales and expenses are translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes, and the strengthening or weakening of the U.S. dollar could result in unfavorable translation effects, which occurred in fiscal 2015. In addition, certain of our subsidiaries may invoice customers in a currency other than its functional currency, which could result in unfavorable translation effects on our business, sales, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity.\nDemand for our products may be adversely affected by numerous factors, some of which we cannot predict or control. This could adversely affect our business, sales, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity.\nNumerous factors may affect the demand for our products, including:\n\u2022Future financial performance of major markets served.\n\u2022Consolidation in the marketplace, allowing competitors and customers to be more efficient and more price competitive.\n\u2022Future competitors entering the marketplace.\n\u2022\nDecreasing product life cycles.\n\u2022\nChanges in customer preferences.\nIf any of these factors occur, the demand for our products could suffer, and this could adversely impact our business, sales, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nA large customer loss could significantly affect our business, sales, results of operations, cash flow, and liquidity.\nWhile we have a broad customer base and no individual customer represents 5% or more of total sales, we conduct business with several large customers and distribution companies. Our dependence on these customers makes relationships with them important. We cannot guarantee that these relationships will be retained in the future. Because these large customers account for a significant portion of sales, they may possess a greater capacity to negotiate reduced prices. If we are unable to provide products to our customers at the quality and prices acceptable to them, some of our customers may shift their business to competitors or may substitute another manufacturer's products. If one of the large customers consolidates, is acquired, or loses market share, the result of that event may have an adverse impact on our business. The loss of or reduction of business from one or more of these large customers could have a material adverse impact on our business, sales, results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity.\nWe depend on key employees and the loss of these individuals could have an adverse effect on our operations.\nOur success depends to a large extent upon the continued services of our key executives, managers and other skilled employees. We cannot ensure that we will be able to retain our key executives, managers and employees. The departure of key personnel without adequate replacement could disrupt our business operations. Additionally, we need qualified managers and skilled employees with technical and industry experience to operate our business successfully. If we are unable to attract and retain qualified individuals or our costs to do so increase significantly, our operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe are a global company headquartered in the United States. We are subject to extensive regulations by U.S. and non-U.S. governmental and self-regulatory entities at various levels of the governing bodies. Failure to comply with laws and regulations could adversely affect our business, sales, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity.\nOur operations are subject to the risks of doing business domestically and globally, including the following:\n\u2022\nDelays or disruptions in product deliveries and payments in connection with international manufacturing and sales.\n\u2022\nPolitical and economic instability and disruptions.\n\u2022\nImposition of duties and tariffs.\n\u2022\nImport, export and economic sanction laws.\n\u2022\nCurrent and changing governmental policies, regulatory, and business environments.\n\u2022\nDisadvantages from competing against companies from countries that are not subject to U.S. laws and regulations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.\n\u2022\nLocal labor market conditions.\n\u2022\nRegulations relating to climate change, air emissions, wastewater discharges, handling and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes.\n\u2022\nRegulations relating to health, safety and the protection of the environment.\n\u2022\nSpecific country regulations where our products are manufactured or sold.\n\u2022\nLaws and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government, including audit requirements of government contracts related to procurement integrity, export control, employment practices, and the accuracy of records and recording of costs.\nFurther, these laws and regulations are constantly evolving and it is impossible to accurately predict the effect they may have upon our sales, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.\nWe cannot provide assurance that our internal controls and compliance systems will always protect us from acts committed by employees, agents or business partners that would violate U.S. and/or non-U.S. laws, including the laws governing payments to government officials, bribery, fraud, anti-kickback and false claims rules, competition, export and import compliance, money laundering and data privacy. Any such improper actions could subject us to civil or criminal investigations in the U.S. and in other jurisdictions, could lead to substantial civil or criminal, monetary and non-monetary penalties and related shareholder lawsuits, could damage our reputation, and could adversely impact our business, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity.\nProduct liability claims could adversely impact our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and reputation.\nOur business exposes us to potential product liability risk, as well as warranty and recall claims that are inherent in the design, manufacture, sale and use of our products. We sell products in industries such as aerospace, defense, healthcare, chemical, and energy where the impact of product liability risk is high. To date, we have not incurred material costs related to these types of claims. However, in the event our products actually or allegedly fail to perform as expected and we are subject to such claims above the amount of insurance coverage, outside the scope of our coverage, or for which we do not have coverage, our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, as well as our reputation, could be materially and adversely affected.\nDivestitures could negatively impact our business and contingent liabilities from divested businesses could adversely affect our results of operations, cash flow and liquidity.\nWe continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest businesses that we determine do not align with our strategic plan, or that are not achieving the desired return on investment. For example, over the last three fiscal years, we have divested our Brady Medical and Varitronics businesses, and our Asia Die-Cut and European Die-Cut businesses. Divestitures pose risks and challenges that could negatively impact our business. For example, when we decide to sell a business or assets, we may be unable to do so on satisfactory terms and within our anticipated time-frame, and even after reaching a definitive agreement to sell a business, the sale is typically subject to satisfaction of pre-closing conditions which may not be satisfied. In addition, the impact of the divestiture on our revenue and net earnings may be larger than projected, which could distract management, and disputes may arise with buyers. Also, we have retained responsibility for and have agreed to indemnify buyers against some contingent liabilities related to a number of businesses that we have recently sold. The resolution of these contingencies has not had a material adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flow and liquidity, but we cannot be certain that this favorable pattern will continue.\nInability to identify, complete, and integrate acquisitions and grow acquired companies, may adversely impact our sales, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity.\nOur historical growth has included acquisitions, and our future growth strategy may include acquisition opportunities. For example, in fiscal 2013 the Company acquired Precision Dynamics Corporation (\"PDC\"), a manufacturer of identification products primarily for the healthcare sector, for $301.2 million. We have not met the sales growth synergies identified at the time of the PDC acquisition, which, in addition to other factors, resulted in the Company recording impairment charges of $148.6 million during fiscal 2014, primarily related to the goodwill and other intangible assets in the PeopleID reporting unit, which consists primarily of the PDC business. Failure to achieve these synergies for PDC or other acquired companies may adversely impact our sales, results of operations, cash flow and liquidity. We may not focus on acquisitions as part of our growth strategy, or if we do, we may not be able to identify acquisition targets or successfully complete acquisitions in the future due to the absence of quality companies in our target markets, economic conditions, or price expectations from sellers. If we do not complete additional acquisitions, our growth may be limited.\nAcquisitions place significant demands on management, operational, and financial resources. Recent and future acquisitions will require integration of operations, sales and marketing, information technology, and administrative operations, which could decrease the time available to focus on our other growth strategies. We cannot assure that we will be able to successfully integrate acquisitions, that these acquisitions will operate profitably, or that we will be able to achieve the desired sales growth or operational success. Our sales, results of operations, cash flow, and liquidity could be adversely affected if we do not successfully integrate the newly acquired businesses, or if our other businesses suffer due to the increased focus on the acquired businesses.\nFinancial/Ownership Risks\nFailure to execute our strategies could result in impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets, which may negatively impact earnings and profitability.\nWe have goodwill of $433.2 million and other intangible assets of $68.9 million as of July 31, 2015, which represents 47.2% of our total assets. Over the past three years, the Company has recorded impairment charges of approximately $400 million related to the goodwill and other intangible assets of multiple reporting units. We evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if impairment indicators are present, based upon the fair value of each reporting unit. We assess the impairment of other intangible assets on an annual basis, or more frequently if impairment indicators are present, based upon the expected future cash flows of the respective assets. These valuations include management's estimates of sales, profitability, cash flow generation, capital structure, cost of debt, interest rates, capital expenditures, and other assumptions. Significant negative industry or economic trends, disruptions to our business, inability to achieve sales projections or cost savings, inability to effectively integrate acquired businesses, unexpected significant changes or planned changes in use of the assets or in entity structure, and divestitures may adversely impact the assumptions used in the valuations. If the estimated fair value of our reporting units changes in future periods, we may be required to record an impairment charge related to goodwill or other intangible assets, which would reduce earnings in such period.\nChanges in tax legislation or tax rates could adversely affect results of operations and financial statements. Additionally, audits by taxing authorities could result in tax payments for prior periods.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and in many non-U.S. jurisdictions. As such, our earnings are subject to risk due to changing tax laws and tax rates around the world. At any point in time, there are a number of tax proposals at various stages of legislation throughout the globe. While it is impossible for us to predict whether some or all of these proposals will be enacted, it likely would have an impact on our earnings.\nOur tax filings are subject to audit by U.S. federal, state and local tax authorities and by non-U.S. tax authorities. If these audits result in payments or assessments that differ from our reserves, our future net earnings may be adversely impacted.\nWe review the probability of the realization of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis based on forecasts of taxable income in both the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. As part of this review, we utilize historical results, projected future operating results, eligible carry-forward periods, tax planning opportunities, and other relevant considerations. Adverse changes in profitability and financial outlook in both the U.S. and/or foreign jurisdictions, or changes in our geographic footprint may require changes in the valuation allowances in order to reduce our deferred tax assets. Such changes could result in a material impact on earnings.\nOur annual cash needs could require us to repatriate cash to the U.S. from foreign jurisdictions, which may result in tax charges. We had no such tax charges in fiscal 2015. However, in fiscal 2014, we repatriated cash to the U.S. in connection with the sale of the Die Cut businesses, which resulted in a tax charge of $4.0 million in continuing operations and in fiscal 2013, we repatriated cash to the U.S. in connection with the acquisition of PDC, which resulted in a tax charge of $26.6 million.\nSubstantially all of our voting stock is controlled by members of the Brady family, while our public investors hold non-voting stock. The interests of the voting and non-voting shareholders could differ, potentially resulting in decisions that unfavorably affect the value of the non-voting shares.\nSubstantially all of our voting stock is controlled by Elizabeth P. Bruno, one of the Directors, and William H. Brady III, both of whom are descendants of the Company's founder. All of our publicly traded shares are non-voting. Therefore, Ms. Bruno and Mr. Brady have control in most matters requiring approval or acquiescence by shareholders, including the composition of our Board of Directors and many corporate actions. Such concentration of ownership may discourage a potential acquirer from making a purchase offer that our public shareholders may find favorable, which in turn could adversely affect the market price of our common stock or prevent our shareholders from realizing a premium over our stock price. Furthermore, this concentration of voting share ownership may adversely affect the trading price for our non-voting common stock because investors may perceive disadvantages in owning stock in companies whose voting stock is controlled by a limited number of shareholders.\nFailure to meet certain financial covenants required by our debt agreements may adversely affect our assets, results of operations, cash flows, and liquidity.\nAs of July 31, 2015, we had $253.7 million in outstanding indebtedness. In addition, based on the availability under our credit facilities as of July 31, 2015, we had the ability to incur an additional $194.7 million under our revolving credit agreement. Our current revolving credit agreement and long-term debt obligations also impose certain restrictions on us. Refer to Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (\"MD&A\") within Item 7 for more information regarding our credit agreement and long-term debt obligations. If we breach any of these restrictions or covenants and do not obtain a waiver from the lenders, then subject to applicable cure periods, the outstanding indebtedness (and any other indebtedness with cross-default provisions) could be declared immediately due and payable, which could adversely affect our assets, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity.", "PERMNO": 18973, "SIC": 3990, "TIC": "BRC"}
