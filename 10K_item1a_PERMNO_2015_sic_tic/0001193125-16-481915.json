{"cik": "1305294", "company": "QLIK TECHNOLOGIES INC", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-26", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nOur business is subject to numerous risks. You should carefully consider the risks described below together with the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and other documents we file with the SEC, which could materially affect our business, financial condition, and operating results. Past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance. The risks described below are not the only risks facing our company. Risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results and the price of our common stock.\nWe target a global marketplace and compete in a rapidly evolving and highly competitive industry which makes our future operating results difficult to predict. If we are unable to enhance products or acquire new products that respond to rapidly changing customer requirements, technological developments or evolving industry standards, our long-term revenue growth will be harmed.\nWe target the global business intelligence, or BI, marketplace, which is an industry characterized by rapid technological innovation, changing customer needs, substantial competition, evolving industry standards and frequent introductions of new products, enhancements and services. Any of these factors can render our existing software products and services obsolete or unmarketable. We believe that our future success will depend in large part on our ability to successfully:\n\u2022\nsupport current and future releases of popular hardware, operating systems, computer programming languages, databases and software applications\n\u2022\ndevelop new products and product enhancements that achieve market acceptance in a timely manner\n\u2022\nmaintain technological competiveness and meet an expanding range of customer requirements.\nAs we encounter increasing competitive pressures, we will likely be required to modify, enhance, reposition or introduce new products and service offerings. We may not be successful in doing so in a timely, cost-effective and appropriately responsive manner, or at all, which may have an adverse effect on our business, quarterly operating results and financial condition. All of these factors make it difficult to predict our future operating results which may impair our ability to manage our business.\nWe may experience quarterly fluctuations in our operating results due to a number of factors which make our future results difficult to predict and could cause our operating results to fall below expectations or our guidance.\nOur operating results may fluctuate due to a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. As a result, comparing our operating results on a period-to-period basis may not be meaningful. Our past results should not be relied on as an indication of our future performance. If our revenue or operating results fall below the expectations of investors or securities analysts or below any guidance we may provide to the market, the price of our common stock could decline substantially.\nOur operating results have varied in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future. In addition to other risk factors listed in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, factors that may affect our quarterly operating results, business and financial condition include the following:\n\u2022\ndemand for our software products and services and the size and timing of orders\n\u2022\nmarket acceptance of our current products, such as QlikView\u00ae and Qlik Sense\u00ae, and future products\n\u2022\na slowdown in spending on information technology, or IT, and software by our current and/or prospective customers\n\u2022\nsales cycles and performance of our indirect channel partners and original equipment manufacturers (known as OEMs)\n\u2022\nbudgeting cycles of our current or potential customers\n\u2022\nforeign currency exchange rate fluctuations\n\u2022\nthe management, performance and expansion of our domestic and international operations\n\u2022\nthe rate of renewals of our maintenance agreements\n\u2022\nchanges in the competitive dynamics of our markets\n\u2022\nour ability to control and predict costs, including our operating expenses\n\u2022\ncustomers delaying purchasing decisions in anticipation of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors\n\u2022\nthe timing of recognizing revenue in any given quarter as a result of revenue recognition rules\n\u2022\nthe timing and amount of our tax benefits or tax expenses as a result of, among other things, complex tax laws and any changes to such tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate\n\u2022\nthe seasonality of our business\n\u2022\nfailure to successfully manage or integrate any acquisitions\n\u2022\nan increase in the rate of product returns\n\u2022\nthe outcome or publicity surrounding any pending or threatened lawsuits\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and political conditions in our domestic and international markets.\nIn addition, we may in the future experience fluctuations in our gross and operating margins due to changes in the mix of our direct and indirect sales, domestic and international revenues and expenses, and license, maintenance and professional services revenues.\nWe have introduced a new licensing model with Qlik Sense through the use of tokens and may implement future changes to our license pricing and licensing model structure for any or all of our products, including increased prices, changes to the types and terms of our licensing structure and maintenance parameters. If these changes are not accepted by our current or future customers, our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.\nBased upon the factors described above and those described elsewhere in this section entitled \u201cRisk Factors\u201d, we have a limited ability to forecast the amount and mix of future revenues and expenses, which may cause our operating results to fall below our estimates or the expectations of public market analysts and investors.\nProduct enhancement and new product introductions involve inherent risks.\nWe compete in a market characterized by rapid technological advances in software development, evolving standards in software technology and frequent new product introductions and enhancements. To succeed, we must continually expand and refresh our product offerings to include newer features or products, such as the launch of our new product in September 2014 of Qlik Sense, and enter into agreements allowing integration of third-party technology into our products. The introduction of new products or updated versions of continuing products has inherent risks, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nproduct quality, including the possibility of software defects\n\u2022\ndelays in releasing new products\n\u2022\ncustomers delaying purchase decisions in anticipation of new products to be released\n\u2022\ncustomer confusion and extended evaluation and negotiation time\n\u2022\nthe fit of the new products and features with the customer\u2019s needs\n\u2022\nthe successful adaptation of third-party technology into our products\n\u2022\neducating our sales, marketing and consulting personnel to work with new products and features\n\u2022\ncompetition from earlier and more established entrants\n\u2022\nmarket acceptance of initial product releases\n\u2022\nmarketing effectiveness, including challenges in distribution\n\u2022\nhigher than expected research and development costs\n\u2022\nthe accuracy of assumptions about the nature of customer demand.\nIf we are unable to successfully introduce, market, and sell new products and technologies, enhance and improve existing products in accordance with our stated release cadence in a timely and cost-effective manner, and properly position and/or price our products, our business, results of operations, or financial position could be materially impacted.\nIf new industry standards emerge or if we are unable to respond to rapid technological changes, demand for our software products may be adversely affected.\nWe believe that our future success is dependent in large part on our ability:\n\u2022\nto support current and future industry standards, including databases and operating systems\n\u2022\nto maintain technological competiveness\n\u2022\nmeet an expanding range of customer requirements, including cloud-based programming or software-as-a-service licensing structures\n\u2022\nto introduce new products and features for our customers.\nThe emergence of new industry standards in related fields may adversely affect the demand for our existing software products. Our business and results of operations may be adversely affected if new technologies emerged that were incompatible with customer deployments of our software products. We currently support Open Database Connectivity, or ODBC, and Object Linking and Embedding Database, or OLEDB, standards in database access technology. If we are unable to adapt our software products on a timely basis to new standards in database access technology, the ability of our software products to access customer databases could be impaired. In addition, the emergence of new server operating systems standards could adversely affect the demand for our existing software products. Our software products currently require the Windows Server operating system when deployed on a server, as used in most multi-user deployments. If customers are unwilling to use a Windows Server, we may not be able to achieve compatibility on a timely basis or without substantial research and development and support expense. We currently support all generally available client operating systems that run industry standard web browsers, but we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to support future client operating systems and web browsers in a timely and cost-effective manner, if at all.\nThe markets for our software products and services are also characterized by rapid technological and customer requirement changes. In particular, our technology is optimized for servers utilizing the x86 and x64 families of microprocessors. If the speed and performance of these microprocessor families do not continue to increase at the rates we anticipate, our software may not attain the performance speed and capabilities that we expect. Also, if different microprocessor architecture were to gain widespread acceptance in server applications, we may not be able to achieve compatibility on a timely basis or without substantial research and development and support expense. Our delay or inability to achieve compatibility with different microprocessor architecture or other technological change or in satisfying changing customer requirements could render our existing and future\nproducts obsolete and unmarketable. As a result, we may not be able to accurately predict the lifecycle of our software products and services, and they may become obsolete before we receive the amount of revenues that we anticipate from them.\nOur long-term growth depends on our ability to enhance and improve our existing products and to introduce or acquire new products that respond to these demands. The creation of BI software is inherently complex. The development and testing of new products and product enhancements can require significant research and development expenditures. As a result, substantial delays in the general availability of such new releases or significant problems in the installation or implementation of such new releases could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. We may not successfully develop and market product enhancements or new products that respond to technological change or new customer requirements. Even if we introduce a new product, we may experience a decline in revenues of our existing products that is not fully matched by the new product\u2019s revenue. For example, customers may delay making purchases of a new product to make a more thorough evaluation of the product, or until industry and marketplace reviews become widely available. In addition, we may lose existing customers who choose a competitor\u2019s product rather than to migrate to our new product. This could result in a temporary or permanent revenue shortfall and harm our business, operating results and financial condition. If we are unable to develop or acquire enhancements to, and new features for, our existing products or acceptable new products that keep pace with rapid technological developments and customer requirements, our products may become obsolete, less marketable and less competitive, and our business, operating results and financial condition will be harmed.\nWe depend on revenue from a single software product.\nDespite our release of Qlik Sense in September 2014, and the incremental revenue derived from Qlik Sense during the year ended December 31, 2015 and expected to be derived in the future, we have and continue to be heavily dependent on our QlikView product. Our business would be harmed by a decline in demand for, or in the price of, our software products as a result of, among other factors:\n\u2022\nany change in our pricing model\n\u2022\nany change in our licensing model\n\u2022\nany change in our go to market model\n\u2022\nincreased competition\n\u2022\nsupport, research and development or other expenditures undertaken in attempts, whether or not successful, to develop new products\n\u2022\nmaturation in the markets for our products.\nOur financial results would suffer if the market for BI software does not continue to grow or if we are unable to further penetrate this market.\nNearly all of our revenues to date have come from sales of BI software and related maintenance and professional services. We expect these sales to account for substantially all of our revenues for the foreseeable future. Although demand for BI software has grown in recent years, the market for BI software applications is still evolving. Resistance from consumer and privacy groups to increased commercial collection and use of data on spending patterns and other personal behavior and governmental restrictions on the collection and use of personal data may impair the further growth of this market, as may other developments. We cannot be sure that this market will continue to grow or, even if it does grow, that customers will purchase our software products or services. We have spent, and intend to keep spending, considerable resources to educate potential customers about BI software in general and our software products and services in particular. However, we cannot be sure that these expenditures will help our software products achieve any additional market acceptance or enable us to attract new customers or new users at existing customers. A reduction in the demand for our software products\nand services could be caused by, among other things, lack of customer acceptance, weakening economic conditions, competing technologies and services or decreases in software spending. If the market and our market share fail to grow or grow more slowly than we currently expect, our business, operating results and financial condition would be harmed.\nOur operating income (loss) could fluctuate as we make further expenditures to expand our operations in order to support additional growth in our business.\nWe have continued to make significant investments in our operations to support additional growth, such as hiring substantial numbers of new personnel, investing in research and development, investing in new facilities, acquiring other companies or their assets and establishing and broadening our international operations in order to expand our business. We intend to make additional investments in research and development, systems, infrastructure, marketing and sales personnel and to continue to expand our operations to support anticipated future growth in our business. As a result of these investments, our operating income (loss) could fluctuate.\nWe rely on third-party channel partners to sell a substantial portion of our products, and if these partners fail to perform, our ability to sell and distribute our products and services will be limited, and our operating results and financial condition will be harmed.\nIn addition to our direct sales force, we use indirect channel partners, such as distribution partners, value-added resellers, system integrators and OEMs to license and support our software products. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, transactions by indirect channel partners accounted for more than 50% of our total product licenses and first year maintenance billings. We expect to continue to rely substantially on our channel partners in the future.\nOur channel partners may offer customers the products of several different companies, including products that compete with ours. Our channel partners may be unsuccessful in marketing, selling, and supporting our products and services. If we are unable to develop and maintain effective sales incentive programs for our channel partners, we may not be able to incentivize these partners to sell our products to end-customers and, in particular, to large enterprises. These partners may also market, sell, and support products and services that are competitive with ours and may devote more resources to the marketing, sales, and support of such competitive products. In order to develop and expand our distribution channel, we must continue to scale and improve our processes and procedures that support our channel partners, including investment in systems and training. These processes and procedures may become increasingly complex and difficult to manage as we grow our organization.\nOur ability to achieve revenue growth and operating profit in the future will depend in part on our success in maintaining successful relationships with our current and future channel partners and their ability to license and support our software products. There can be no assurance that our channel partners will continue to cooperate with us when our distribution agreements expire, change or are up for renewal. If we are unable to maintain our relationships with these channel partners, our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed. Also, in a number of regions we rely on a limited number of resellers, and our business may be harmed if any of these resellers were to fail to effectively sell our software in their specified geographic territories.\nIn addition, we rely on our channel partners to operate in accordance with the terms of their contractual agreements with us which we may change from time to time. For example, our agreements with our channel partners limit the terms and conditions pursuant to which they are authorized to resell or distribute our software products and offer technical support and related services. We also typically require our channel partners to provide us with the dates and details of product license transactions sold to end user customers. If our channel partners do not comply with their contractual obligations to us or if our channel partners do not agree with changes we may make to our contractual agreements, our business, results of operations and financial condition may be harmed.\nOur channel partner sales structure could subject us to lawsuits, potential liability, and reputational harm if, for example, any of our channel partners misrepresent the functionality of our products or services to end-customers or violate laws or our corporate policies.\nIf we are unable to expand our direct sales capabilities and increase sales productivity, we may not be able to generate increased revenues.\nWe may be required to expand our direct sales force in order to generate increased revenue from new and existing customers. We have and intend to continue to increase our number of direct sales professionals. New hires require training and take time to achieve full productivity. We cannot be certain that recent and future new hires will become as productive as necessary or that we will be able to hire enough qualified individuals in the future. Failure to hire qualified direct sales personnel and increase sales productivity will preclude us from expanding our business and growing our revenue, which may harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nAs we continue to pursue new enterprise customers, additional OEM opportunities or more complicated deployments, our sales cycle, forecasting processes and deployment processes may become more unpredictable and require greater time and expense.\nOur sales cycle may lengthen as we continue to pursue new enterprise customers. Enterprise customers may undertake a significant evaluation process in regard to enterprise software which can last from several months to a year or longer. If our sales cycle were to lengthen in this manner, events may occur during this period that affect the size or timing of a purchase or even cause cancellations, and this may lead to more unpredictability in our business and operating results. Additionally, sales cycles for sales of our software products tend to be longer, ranging from three to 12 months or more which may make forecasting more complex and uncertain. We may spend substantial time, effort and money on our sales efforts without any assurance that our efforts will produce any sales. In addition, product purchases by large enterprises are frequently subject to budget constraints, multiple approvals, and unplanned administrative, processing, and other delays. Finally, large enterprises typically have longer implementation cycles, require greater product functionality and scalability and a broader range of services, demand that vendors take on a larger share of risks, sometimes require acceptance provisions that can lead to a delay in revenue recognition, and expect greater payment flexibility from vendors. All of these factors can add further risk to business conducted with these end-customers. If we fail to realize an expected sale from a large end-customer in a particular quarter or at all, our business, operating results, and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected.\nIn addition, we may face unexpected deployment challenges with enterprise customers or more complicated installations of our software products. It may be difficult to deploy our software products if the customer has unexpected database, hardware or software technology issues. Additional deployment complexities may occur if a customer hires a third party to deploy our software products or if one of our indirect channel partners leads the implementation of our solution. Any difficulties or delays in the initial implementation could cause customers to reject our software or lead to the delay or non-receipt of future orders, in which case our business, operating results and financial condition would be harmed.\nFluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may adversely affect our financial results.\nWe have operations in many areas of the world and are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations that could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. A significant portion of our revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities are, and are expected to continue to be, denominated in foreign currencies, which exposes us to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates. To the extent such denomination in foreign currencies does occur, transactional gains and losses, as well as translational gains and losses, have and may continue to contribute to fluctuations in our results of operations and adjustments to our financial guidance. For example, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies in which we operate negatively impacted our reported total revenue and loss from operations during the years ended\nDecember 31, 2015 and 2014. These exposures may change over time as our business and business practices evolve, and they could harm our financial results and cash flows.\nAlthough we continue to utilize short-term foreign currency forward contracts to cover a portion of our foreign currency transaction exposure related to certain intercompany borrowings, our policies do not allow speculation in derivative instruments for profit or execution of derivative instrument contracts for which there are no underlying exposures. We do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and we are not a party to any leveraged derivatives. We monitor underlying market risk exposures on an ongoing basis and believe that we can modify or adapt our hedging strategies as needed. Our decisions and hedging strategy with respect to currency risks may not be successful, which could harm our operating results. In addition, if we do not successfully manage our hedging program in accordance with accounting guidelines, we may be subject to adverse accounting treatment, which could harm our operating results. There can be no assurance that this hedging program will be economically beneficial to us for numerous reasons; for example, hedging may reduce volatility, but prevent us from benefiting from a favorable rate change. If we are not effective in any future foreign exchange hedging transactions in which we engage, our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.\nFor additional information on our foreign currency exchange rate risk, refer to \u201c- Foreign Exchange Risk\u201d in Item 7A - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, which is included in this Annual Report.\nManaging our international operations is complex and our failure to do so successfully could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe receive a significant portion of our total revenue from international sales from foreign direct and indirect operations. International revenues accounted for approximately 68% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2015, approximately 71% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2014 and approximately 70% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2013. We have facilities located in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Iceland, India, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom. We expect to continue to add personnel in these and additional countries. Our international operations require significant management attention and financial resources.\nThere are certain risks inherent in our international business activities including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nmanaging and staffing international offices and the increased costs associated with multiple international locations\n\u2022\nmaintaining relationships with indirect channel partners outside the U.S., whose sales and lead generation activities are very important to our international operations\n\u2022\nforeign currency exchange rate fluctuations\n\u2022\nmultiple legal systems and unexpected changes in legal requirements\n\u2022\nthe burden of complying with a wide variety of laws, including those relating to labor matters, consumer and data protection, privacy, network security, and encryption\n\u2022\ntariffs, export restrictions, trade barriers and other regulatory or contractual limitations on our ability to sell or develop our products in certain foreign markets\n\u2022\ntrade laws and business practices favoring local competition\n\u2022\ncosts of localizing products and potential lack of acceptance of localized versions\n\u2022\npotential tax issues, including restrictions on repatriating earnings or the adoption of a minimum tax on adjusted unrepatriated foreign earnings and multiple, conflicting, changing and complex tax laws and regulations\n\u2022\nemployer payroll tax withholdings with respect to exercises by employees or vesting of our equity awards\n\u2022\nweaker intellectual property protection in some countries\n\u2022\ndifficulties in enforcing contracts and collecting accounts receivable, longer sales cycles and longer payment cycles, especially in emerging markets\n\u2022\nthe significant presence of some of our competitors in certain international markets\n\u2022\nour ability to adapt to sales practices and customer requirements in different cultures\n\u2022\npolitical instability, including war and terrorism or the threat of war and terrorism\n\u2022\nadverse economic conditions, including the stability and solvency of business financial markets, financial institutions and sovereign nations.\nIn addition, compliance with foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that are applicable to our international operations is complex and may increase our cost of doing business in international jurisdictions, and our international operations could expose us to fines and penalties if we fail to comply with these regulations. These laws and regulations include import and export requirements, U.S. laws such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and anti-money laundering regulations, and local laws prohibiting corrupt payments. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to help ensure compliance with these laws, there can be no assurance that our employees, partners and other persons with whom we do business will not take actions in violation of our policies or these laws. Any violations of these laws could subject us to civil or criminal penalties, including substantial fines or prohibitions on our ability to offer our products and services in one or more countries, and could also materially damage our reputation, our brand and our international business.\nOur failure to manage any of these risks successfully could harm our international operations, business operating results and financial condition and reduce our international sales.\nWe are required to comply with U.S. export control laws and regulations. Noncompliance with those laws and regulations could materially harm our business.\nOur solutions are subject to U.S. and European Union export controls. U.S. export control laws and economic sanctions prohibit the shipment of certain solutions and services to U.S. embargoed or sanctioned countries, governments and persons and complying with export control and sanctions regulations for a particular sale may be time-consuming and may result in the delay or loss of sales opportunities. Penalties for violations of the U.S. export control laws include substantial fines and the possible loss of export or import privileges and criminal action for knowing or willful violations.\nFurther, if our operating partners fail to obtain appropriate import, export or re-export licenses or permits, we may also be harmed, become the subject of government investigations or penalties, and incur reputational harm. Changes in our solutions or changes in export and import regulations may create delays in the introduction of our solutions in international markets, prevent our customers with international operations from deploying our solutions globally or, in some cases, prevent the export or import of our solutions to certain countries, governments or persons altogether. Any change in export or import regulations, economic sanctions or related legislation, shift in the enforcement or scope of existing regulations, or change in the countries, governments, persons or technologies targeted by such regulations, could result in decreased use of our solutions by, or in our decreased ability to export or sell our solutions to, existing or potential customers with international operations. Any decreased use of our solutions or limitation on our ability to export or sell our solutions would likely harm our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nGovernment regulation of the Internet and e-commerce and of the international exchange of certain technologies is subject to possible unfavorable changes, and our failure to comply with applicable regulations could harm our business and operating results.\nAs Internet commerce continues to evolve, increasing regulation by federal, state or foreign governments becomes more likely. For example, we believe increased regulation is likely in the area of data privacy, and laws and regulations applying to the solicitation, collection, processing or use of personal or consumer information could affect our customers\u2019 ability to use and share data, potentially reducing demand for our products and services. In addition, taxation of products and services provided over the Internet or other charges imposed by government agencies or by private organizations for accessing the Internet may also be imposed. Any regulation imposing greater fees for Internet use or restricting the exchange of information over the Internet could result in reduced growth or a decline in the use of the Internet and could diminish the viability of our Internet-based services, which could harm our business and operating results.\nOur business depends on customers renewing their annual maintenance contracts and our ability to collect renewal fees.\nAny decline in maintenance renewals could harm our future operating results. The majority of our software licenses are sold pursuant to a perpetual license with a fixed upfront fee which ordinarily includes one year of maintenance as part of the initial price. Our customers have no obligation to renew their maintenance agreements after the expiration of this initial period, and they may not renew these agreements. We may be unable to predict future customer renewal rates accurately. Our customers\u2019 renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including their level of satisfaction with our software products, the prices of our software products, the prices of products and services offered by our competitors, reductions in our customers\u2019 spending levels or general, industry-specific or local economic conditions. If our customers do not renew their maintenance arrangements or if they renew them on less favorable terms, our revenues may decline, our operating and financial condition will be harmed and our business will suffer. A substantial portion of our quarterly maintenance revenue is attributable to maintenance agreements entered into during previous quarters. As a result, if there is a decline in renewed maintenance agreements in any one quarter, only a small portion of the decline will be reflected in our maintenance revenue recognized in that quarter and the rest will be reflected in our maintenance revenue recognized in the following four quarters or more. In addition, we may have difficulties collecting renewal fees from our customers, especially in regards to customers located in emerging international markets or markets experiencing slowed growth, recessions or other adverse economic conditions. If we are unable to collect renewal fees from customers, our business, results of operations and financial condition will be harmed.\nOur software products could contain undetected errors, or bugs, which could cause problems with product performance and which could in turn reduce demand for our software products, reduce our revenue and lead to product liability claims against us.\nSoftware products like ours, which consist of hundreds of thousands of lines of code and incorporate licensed software from third parties, may contain errors and/or defects. Although we test our software, we have in the past discovered software errors in our products after their introduction. Despite testing by us and by our current and potential customers, errors may be found in new products or releases after deployment begins. This could result in lost revenue, damage to our reputation or delays in market acceptance which could harm our business, operating results and financial condition. We may also have to expend resources to correct these defects and the resulting effects of these defects.\nOur license agreements with customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to product liability, warranty and other claims. It is possible, however, that these provisions may not be effective as a result of existing or future laws of certain domestic or international jurisdictions or unfavorable judicial decisions in such jurisdictions, and we may be exposed to product liability, warranty and other claims. If these claims are made, our potential exposure may be substantial given the use of our products in business-critical\napplications. A successful product liability claim against us could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nWe face intense competition which may lead to reduced revenue and loss of market share.\nThe markets for BI software, analytical applications and information management are highly competitive and subject to rapidly changing technology and evolving standards. In addition, many companies in these markets are offering, or may soon offer, products and services that may compete with our software products.\nWe face competitors in several broad categories, including BI software, analytical processes, query, search and reporting tools. We compete with large technology corporations that provide one or more capabilities that are competitive with our software products, such as Amazon, IBM, Microsoft, Oracle and SAP AG, and with open source BI vendors, including Pentaho and JasperSoft. Open source software is software that is made widely available by its authors and is licensed \u201cas is\u201d for a nominal fee or, in some cases, at no charge. As the use of open source software becomes more widespread, certain open source technology could become competitive with our proprietary technology, which could cause sales of our products to decline or force us to reduce the fees we charge for our products. We also compete, or may increasingly in the future compete, with various independent competitors that are primarily focused on BI products, such as Birst, MicroStrategy, the SAS Institute, Tableau and TIBCO. We expect additional competition as other established and emerging companies or open source vendors enter the BI software market and new products and technologies are introduced. We expect this to be particularly true with respect to our cloud-based initiatives as we and our competitors seek to provide business analytics products based on a software-as-a-service, or SaaS, platform. This is an evolving area of business analytics solutions, and we anticipate competition to increase based on customer demand for these types of products.\nMany of our competitors have longer operating histories, significantly greater financial, technical, marketing or other resources and greater name recognition than we do. In addition, many of our competitors have strong relationships with current and potential customers and extensive knowledge of the BI industry. As a result, they may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or devote greater resources to the development, promotion and sale of their products than us. Increased competition may lead to price cuts, fewer customer orders, reduced gross margins, longer sales cycles and loss of market share. We may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors, and our business, operating results and financial condition will be harmed if we fail to meet these competitive pressures.\nCurrent and future competitors may also make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with others. By doing so, these competitors may increase their ability to meet the needs of our current or potential customers. Our current or prospective indirect channel partners may establish cooperative relationships with our current or future competitors. These relationships may limit our ability to sell our software products through specific distribution channels. Accordingly, new competitors or alliances among current and future competitors may emerge and rapidly gain significant market share. These developments could limit our ability to obtain revenues from new customers and to sustain maintenance revenues from our installed customer base. If we are unable to compete successfully against current and future competitors, our business, operating results and financial condition would be harmed.\nThe forecasts of market growth we have publicly provided may prove to be inaccurate, and even if the markets in which we compete achieve the forecasted growth, we cannot assure our business will grow at similar rates, if at all.\nGrowth forecasts are subject to significant uncertainty and are based on assumptions and estimates that may not prove to be accurate, including fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. The forecasts we have publicly provided relating to the expected growth in the BI marketplace, cloud computing markets and\ntechnology market may prove to be inaccurate. Even if these markets experience the forecasted growth we have publicly provided, we may not grow our business at similar rates, or at all. Our growth is subject to many factors, including our success in implementing our business strategy, which is subject to many risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, the forecasts of market growth we have publicly provided should not be taken as indicative of our future growth.\nOur estimate of the market size for our solutions we have publicly provided may prove to be inaccurate, and even if the market size is accurate, we cannot assure our business will serve a significant portion of the market.\nOur estimate of the market size for our solutions we have publicly provided is subject to significant uncertainty and is based on assumptions and estimates, including our internal analysis and industry experience, which may not prove to be accurate. Our ability to serve a significant portion of this estimated market is subject to many factors, including our success in implementing our business strategy, which is subject to many risks and uncertainties. Accordingly, even if our estimate of the market size is accurate, we cannot assure you that our business will serve a significant portion of this estimated market for our solutions.\nA substantial customer shift from the deployment of our software products based on a perpetual software license to our cloud services offerings could affect the timing of revenue recognition and materially adversely affect our operating results.\nSaaS is a model of software deployment where a software provider typically licenses an application to customers for use as a service on demand through web browser technologies. We believe that companies have begun to expect that key software be provided through a SaaS model. We offer our software products in the form of a perpetual software license and a SaaS subscription. Expanding our SaaS business model will require us to undertake additional substantial capital investments and related sales and support resources and personnel. If more customers were to shift to a SaaS deployment or if customers demand a SaaS-based BI software platform sooner than we currently anticipate, we would need to undertake significant investments in order to further implement this alternative business model. If the prevalence of cloud-based data increases, current and prospective customers may increasingly demand SaaS-based BI software platforms. Even if we undertook these investments, we may be unsuccessful in implementing a SaaS business model. Moreover, sales of a potential future SaaS offering by our competitors could adversely affect sales of all of our existing products. In addition, increasing sales of our SaaS offering could cannibalize license sales of our on-premise desktop and server products to our existing and prospective customers, which could negatively impact our overall sales growth. These factors could harm our business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe payment streams and revenue recognition timing for our perpetual software licenses are different from those for our subscription services. For perpetual software licenses, customers typically pay us a lump sum soon after entering into a software license agreement and revenue is typically recognized upon delivery of the software to the customer. For subscription services, customers typically make periodic payments over the subscription period and revenue is typically recognized ratably over the subscription period. As a result, if a substantial number of current or new customers shift to subscribing to our cloud services offerings instead of purchasing perpetual software licenses for our software products, the resulting change in payment terms and revenue recognition may materially adversely affect our operating results and cash flows for the reporting periods during which such a shift occurs.\nIf we fail to develop and maintain our brand cost-effectively, our business may be harmed.\nWe believe that developing and maintaining awareness and integrity of our brand in a cost-effective manner are important to achieving widespread acceptance of our software products and our existing and future products and are important elements in attracting new customers and maintaining existing customers. We believe that the importance of brand recognition will increase as competition in our market further intensifies. In 2014, we rebranded our company under the name \u201cQlik.\u201d Successful promotion of our brand will depend on the\neffectiveness of our marketing efforts and on our ability to provide reliable and useful products and services at competitive prices. Brand promotion activities may not yield increased revenue, and even if they do, the increased revenue may not offset the expenses we incur in building and maintaining our brand. We also rely on our customer base and community of end-users in a variety of ways, including to give us feedback on our products and to provide user-based support to our other customers. If we fail to promote and maintain our brand successfully or to maintain loyalty among our customers and Qlik Community, our user community, or if we incur substantial expenses in an unsuccessful attempt to promote and maintain our brand, we may fail to attract new customers or retain our existing customers and our business may be harmed.\nIf we are unable to manage our growth effectively, our revenues and profits could be adversely affected.\nWe plan to continue to expand our operations and employee headcount significantly, and we anticipate that further significant expansion will be required. Our future operating results depend to a large extent on our ability to manage this expansion and growth successfully. Sustaining our growth will place significant demands on our management as well as on our administrative, operational and financial resources. To manage our growth, we must continue to improve our operational, financial and management information systems and expand, motivate and manage our workforce. If we are unable to manage our growth successfully without compromising our quality of service or our profit margins, or if new systems that we implement to assist in managing our growth do not produce the expected benefits, our revenues and profits could be harmed. Risks that we face in undertaking future expansion include:\n\u2022\ntraining new personnel to become productive and generate revenue\n\u2022\nenabling partners to sell our software products\n\u2022\ncontrolling expenses and investments in anticipation of expanded operations\n\u2022\nimplementing and enhancing our administrative, operational and financial infrastructure, systems and processes\n\u2022\naddressing new markets\n\u2022\nexpanding operations in the U.S. and international regions.\nA failure to manage our growth effectively could harm our business, operating results, financial condition and ability to market and sell our software products and services.\nIf we are unable to recruit or retain skilled personnel, or if we lose the services of any of our key personnel, our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.\nOur future success depends on our continuing ability to attract, train and retain highly skilled personnel, and we face intense competition for these employees. We may not be able to retain our current key employees or attract, train or retain other highly skilled personnel in the future. If we lose the services of one or all of our key employees, or if we are unable to attract, train and retain the highly skilled personnel we need, our business, operating results and financial condition could be harmed.\nIn addition, we must successfully integrate new employees into our operations and generate sufficient revenues to justify the costs associated with these employees. If we fail to successfully integrate employees or to generate the revenue necessary to offset employee-related expenses, our business and financial results could be adversely affected.\nThe success of our business is heavily dependent on the leadership of key management personnel, including Lars Bj\u00f6rk, Chief Executive Officer, and other members of our senior management team. The loss of one or more key management personnel could adversely affect our continued operations.\nOur future success depends in a large part upon the continued service of key members of our senior management team. In particular, Lars Bj\u00f6rk, our Chief Executive Officer, is critical to the overall management of our organization, as well as the development of our brand, our technology, our culture and our strategic direction.\nWe have experienced significant changes, and may experience additional changes in the future, to our senior management team. For us to compete successfully and grow, we must retain, recruit and develop key personnel who can provide the needed expertise for our industry and products. However, the market for qualified personnel is competitive and we may not succeed in recruiting additional senior management personnel or may fail to replace current senior management personnel effectively who depart without qualified or effective successors. Any successors that we hire from outside of our company would likely be unfamiliar with our business model and industry and may therefore require significant time to understand and appreciate the important aspects of our business or fail to do so altogether. For instance, in September 2015, Mark Thurmond joined us as our Executive Vice President, Worldwide Sales and Services and we believe our future performance will depend significantly on our ability to successfully integrate him and other recently and subsequently hired executive officers into our management team and on those officers\u2019 ability to develop and maintain an effective working relationship. Our failure to integrate recently and subsequently hired executive officers, including Mr. Thurmond, with other members of management and key employees could result in inefficiencies or disruptions in our sales and marketing, which would harm the sales of our products and our results of operations. Our effort to retain and develop personnel may also result in significant additional expenses, which could adversely affect our profitability. The loss of any of our management or key personnel could seriously harm our business.\nFuture product development is dependent on adequate research and development resources.\nIn order to remain competitive, we must continue to develop new products, applications and enhancements to our existing software products. This is particularly true as we strive to further expand our software products and product capabilities. Maintaining adequate research and development resources, such as the appropriate personnel, talent and development technology, to meet the demands of the market is essential. Our research and development organization are principally located in Lund, Sweden, Boston, Massachusetts, Ottawa, Canada, Reykjavik, Iceland, Vicenza, Italy and London, United Kingdom with the vast majority of our research and development organization located in Lund, Sweden. We may have difficulty hiring suitably skilled personnel in these regions or expanding our research and development organization to facilities located in other geographic locations. In addition, many of our competitors expend a considerably greater amount of resources on their respective research and development programs. Our failure to maintain adequate research and development resources or to compete effectively with the research and development programs of our competitors would present an advantage to such competitors.\nIf we fail to offer high quality customer support, our business would suffer.\nOnce our software products are deployed to our customers, our customers rely on our support services to resolve any related issues. High quality customer support is important for the successful marketing and sale of our software products and services and for the renewal of existing customers. The importance of high quality customer support will increase as we expand our business and pursue new enterprise customers. If we do not help our customers quickly resolve post-deployment issues and provide effective ongoing support, our ability to sell our software products and professional services to existing customers would suffer and our reputation with existing or potential customers would be harmed.\nWe currently utilize a combination of internal support personnel and third party support organizations, and we cannot provide assurance that actions taken or not taken by our third party support organization will not harm our reputation or business. As we expand our sales infrastructure, we will be required to engage and train additional support personnel and resources. Further, our support organization will face additional challenges as we enter new international markets, including challenges associated with delivering support, training and documentation in languages required by new customers. If we fail to maintain high quality customer support or to grow our internal and external support organization to match any future sales growth, our business will suffer.\nIf we do not meet our revenue forecasts, we may be unable to reduce our expenses to avoid or minimize harm to our results of operations.\nOur revenues are difficult to forecast and are likely to fluctuate significantly from period to period. We base our operating expense budgets on expected revenue trends and our strategic objectives, and many of our expenses, such as office and equipment leases and personnel costs, will be relatively fixed in the short term and will increase as we continue to make investments in our business and hire additional personnel. In the event we alter our licensing model, our ability to forecast revenue and expenses may be further hampered. Our estimates of sales trends may not correlate with actual revenues in a particular quarter or over a longer period of time. Variations in the rate and timing of conversion of our sales prospects into actual licensing revenues could cause us to plan or budget inaccurately and those variations could adversely affect our financial results. In particular, delays or reductions in amount or cancellation of customers\u2019 purchases of our software products would adversely affect the overall level and timing of our revenues, and our business, results of operations and financial condition could be harmed. Due to the relatively fixed nature of many of our expenses, we may be unable to adjust spending quickly enough to offset any unexpected revenue shortfall.\nIn the course of our sales to customers, we may encounter difficulty collecting accounts receivable and could be exposed to risks associated with uncollectible accounts receivable. In the event we are unable to collect on our accounts receivable, it could negatively affect our cash flows, operating results and business.\nOur methodologies and software products may infringe the intellectual property rights of third parties or be found to contain unexpected open source software, and this may create liability for us or otherwise harm our business.\nThird parties may claim that our current or future products infringe their intellectual property rights, and such claims may result in legal claims against our customers and us. These claims may damage our reputation, harm our customer relationships and create liability for us. We expect the number of such claims will increase as the number of products and the level of competition in our industry segments grow, the functionality of products overlap and the volume of issued software patents and patent applications continues to increase. We generally agree in our customer contracts to indemnify customers for expenses or liabilities they incur as a result of third party intellectual property infringement claims associated with our products or services. To the extent that any claim arises as a result of third party technology we have licensed for use in our product, we may be unable to recover from the appropriate third party any expenses or other liabilities that we incur.\nIn addition, software products like ours that contain hundreds of thousands of lines of software code at times incorporate open source software code. The use of open source software code is typically subject to varying forms of software licenses, called copyleft or open source licenses. These types of licenses may require that any person who creates a software product that redistributes or modifies open source software that was subject to an open source license must also make their own software product subject to the same open source license. This can lead to a requirement that the newly created software product be provided free of charge or be made available or distributed in source code form. Although we do not believe our software includes any open source software that would result in the imposition of any such requirement on portions of our software products, our software could be found to contain this type of open source software.\nMoreover, we cannot assure you that our processes for controlling our use of open source software in our products will be effective. If we are held to have breached the terms of an open source software license, we could be required to seek licenses from third parties to continue offering our products on terms that are not economically feasible, to re-engineer our products, to discontinue the sale of our products if re-engineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis, or to make generally available, in source code form, our proprietary code, any of which could adversely affect our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nIn addition to risks related to license requirements, usage of open source software can lead to greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or\nassurance of title, non-infringement or controls on origin of the software. In addition, many of the risks associated with usage of open source software, such as the lack of warranties or assurances of title, cannot be eliminated, and could, if not properly addressed, negatively affect our business. We have established processes to help alleviate these risks, including a review process for screening requests from our development organizations for the use of open source software, but we cannot be sure that all open source software is submitted for approval prior to use in our products.\nResponding to any infringement claim, regardless of its validity, or discovering open source software code in our products could harm our business, operating results and financial condition, by, among other things:\n\u2022\nresulting in time-consuming and costly litigation\n\u2022\ndiverting management\u2019s time and attention from developing our business\n\u2022\nrequiring us to pay monetary damages or enter into royalty and licensing agreements that we would not normally find acceptable\n\u2022\ncausing product shipment or deployment delays\n\u2022\nrequiring us to stop selling certain of our products\n\u2022\nrequiring us to redesign certain of our products using alternative non-infringing or non-open source technology or practices, which could require significant effort and expense\n\u2022\nrequiring us to disclose our software source code, the detailed program commands for our software\n\u2022\nrequiring us to satisfy indemnification obligations to our customers.\nOur intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability to protect them could reduce the value of our software products, services and brand.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we had eight issued U.S. patents and nine pending applications for U.S. patents expiring at various times ranging from 2017 through 2032 and six issued and 22 pending applications for foreign patents expiring at various times ranging from 2017 through 2031. In September 2015, our early patent, Method And Device For Extracting Information From A Database, which was filed in September 1995 in the U.S. and multiple European territories, expired. We do not expect the expiration of these patents to materially affect our business, operations or products. We rely on a combination of copyright, trademark, patent, trade secrets, confidentiality procedures and contractual commitments to protect our proprietary information. For example, we license our software products pursuant to click-wrap or signed license agreements that impose certain restrictions on a licensee\u2019s ability to utilize the software. We also seek to avoid disclosure of our intellectual property, including by requiring those persons with access to our proprietary information to execute confidentiality agreements with us and by restricting access to our source code.\nDespite our efforts, these measures can only provide limited protection. Unauthorized third parties may try to copy or reverse engineer portions of our software products or may otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property. Any patents owned by us may be invalidated, circumvented or challenged. Any of our pending or future patent applications, whether or not being currently challenged, may not be issued with the scope of the claims we seek, if at all. Legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights in other countries are uncertain and may afford little or no effective protection for our services, software, methodology and other proprietary rights. Consequently, we may be unable to prevent our intellectual property rights from being exploited abroad, which could require costly efforts to protect them. Policing the unauthorized use of our proprietary rights is expensive, difficult and, in some cases, impossible. Litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce or defend our intellectual property rights, to protect our trade secrets or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of management resources, either of which could harm our business. Accordingly, despite our efforts, we may not be able to prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating our intellectual property. If we cannot protect our proprietary technology against unauthorized copying or use, we may not remain competitive.\nFurthermore, many of our current and potential competitors have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to developing and protecting their technology or intellectual property rights than we do. In addition, our attempts to protect our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights may be further limited as our employees may be recruited by our current or future competitors and may take with them significant knowledge of our proprietary information. Consequently, others may develop services and methodologies that are similar or superior to our services and methodologies or may design around our intellectual property.\nChanges in laws or regulations relating to privacy or the protection or transfer of personal data, or any actual or perceived failure by us or our third-party service providers to comply with such laws and regulations or applicable privacy policies, could materially adversely affect our business.\nAspects of our business, including our current or future cloud services offerings, involve processing, storing, and transmitting personal data, which is subject to certain privacy policies, and certain federal, state, and foreign laws and regulations relating to privacy and data protection. The amount of customer and employee data that we store through our cloud services offerings, networks, and other systems, including personal data, is increasing. In recent years, the collection and use of personal data by companies have come under increased regulatory and public scrutiny. For example, in the United States, protected health information is subject to the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (\u201cHIPAA\u201d). HIPAA has been supplemented by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act with the result of increased civil and criminal penalties for noncompliance. Under HIPAA, entities performing certain functions and creating, receiving, maintaining, or transmitting protected health information provided by covered entities and other business associates are directly subject to HIPAA. Our access to protected health information through our cloud services offerings triggers obligations to comply with certain privacy rules and data security requirements under HIPAA. Any systems failure or security breach that results in the release of, or unauthorized access to, personal data, or any failure or perceived failure by us or our third-party service providers to comply with applicable privacy policies or any applicable laws or regulations relating to privacy or data protection, could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others. Such proceedings could result in the imposition of sanctions, fines, penalties, liabilities, and/or governmental orders requiring that we change our data practices, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results, and financial condition.\nVarious federal, state, and foreign legislative, regulatory, or other governmental bodies may enact new or additional laws or regulations, or issue rulings that invalidate prior laws or regulations (such as the recent ruling by the European Court of Justice invalidating the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework), concerning privacy and data protection that could materially adversely impact our business. Complying with these varying and changing requirements could cause us to incur substantial costs, require us to change our business practices, or limit our ability to provide certain products in certain jurisdictions, any of which could materially adversely affect our business and operating results. Additionally, the legislation and regulation regarding mobile data collection continue to evolve and if laws or regulations restricting or limiting the collection or use of mobile data are enacted, they may reduce demand for certain of our services or require changes to our business practices, which could materially adversely affect our business and operating results.\nIf we or our third-party service providers experience a security breach and unauthorized parties obtain access to our customers\u2019 data, our data, or our cloud services offerings, networks, or other systems, our offerings may be perceived as not being secure, our reputation may be harmed, demand for our offerings may be reduced, our operations may be disrupted, we may incur significant legal liabilities, and our business could be materially adversely affected.\nAs part of our business, we process, store, and transmit our customers\u2019 information and data as well as our own, including in our cloud services offerings, networks, and other systems. There can be no assurance that any security measures that have been implemented will be effective against all security threats. For example, security measures may be breached as a result of third-party action, including intentional misconduct by computer hackers, fraudulent inducement of employees or customers to disclose sensitive information such as user names or passwords, and employee error or malfeasance. Such breach could result in someone obtaining unauthorized\naccess to our customers\u2019 data, our data (including our proprietary information or trade secrets), or our cloud services offerings, networks, or other systems. Because there are many different security breach techniques and such techniques continue to evolve, we may be unable to anticipate attempted security breaches and implement adequate preventative measures. Third parties may also conduct attacks designed to temporarily deny customers access to our services. Any security breach or successful denial of service attack could result in a loss of customer confidence in the security of our offerings and damage to our brand, reducing the demand for our offerings and our revenue, disrupt our normal business operations, require us to spend material resources to correct the breach, expose us to legal liabilities including litigation and indemnity obligations, and materially adversely affect our operating results. These risks will increase as we continue to grow the number and scale of our cloud-based offerings and process, store, and transmit increasingly large amounts of our customers\u2019 information and data, which may include proprietary or confidential data or personal or identifying information.\nOur failure to adequately protect personal information could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nA wide variety of local, state, national, and international laws, directives and regulations apply to the collection, use, retention, protection, disclosure, transfer, and other processing of personal data. These data protection and privacy-related laws and regulations continue to evolve and may result in ever-increasing regulatory and public scrutiny and escalating levels of enforcement and sanctions and increased costs of compliance. Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations, or to protect such data, could result in enforcement action against us, including fines, imprisonment of company officials and public censure, claims for damages by end-customers and other affected individuals, damage to our reputation and loss of goodwill (both in relation to existing end-customers and prospective end-customers), any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial performance, and business. Changing definitions of personal data and personal information, within the European Union, the United States, and elsewhere, especially relating to classification of IP addresses, machine identification, location data, and other information, may limit or inhibit our ability to operate or expand our business, including limiting strategic partnerships that may involve the sharing of data.\nEconomic uncertainties or downturns could materially harm our business.\nWe are subject to risks arising from changes and uncertainty in domestic and global economies. Our operations and performance depend significantly on worldwide economic conditions. Current or future economic downturns could harm our business and results of operations. Negative conditions in the general economies of the countries in which we do business, such as actual or threatened military action, terrorist attacks, financial credit market fluctuations and changes in tax laws, could cause a decrease in corporate spending on BI software in general and negatively affect the rate of growth of our business and our results of operations.\nThe macroeconomic condition of some countries in which we operate has been hindered by unemployment, budget deficits, high public debt, the risk of defaults on sovereign debt and potential or actual private bank failures. In recent years, policies undertaken by certain central banks, such as the U.S. Federal Reserve, the European Central Bank and the Bank of England, have involved quantitative easing and the impact of these policies on macroeconomic trends and our customers is difficult to predict. These conditions make it extremely difficult for our customers and us to accurately forecast and plan future business activities, and they could cause our customers to slow spending on our products and services which would delay and lengthen sales cycles. Furthermore, during challenging economic times our customers may face issues in gaining timely access to sufficient credit which could result in an impairment of their ability to make timely payments to us. If that were to occur, we may be required to increase our allowance for doubtful accounts and our operating results would be harmed.\nWe maintain operating or other bank accounts at financial institutions in the U.S., Sweden and other regions. In particular, a significant amount of our cash balances in the U.S. and Sweden are in excess of the insurance limits of the U.S. government\u2019s Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or FDIC, and Swedish government\u2019s Swedish Deposit Insurance Scheme, or Ins\u00e4ttningsgarantin. The FDIC insures deposits in most banks and savings associations located in the U.S. and protects depositors against the loss of their deposits if an\nFDIC-insured bank or savings association fails, subject to specified monetary ceilings. Similarly, the Swedish Deposit Insurance Scheme is a state-provided guarantee of deposits in accounts at Swedish banks, subject to specified monetary ceilings. We could incur substantial losses if the underlying financial institutions in these or other regions fail or are otherwise unable to return our deposits.\nWe have a significant number of customers in the consumer products and services, healthcare, retail, manufacturing and financial services industries. A substantial downturn in these industries may cause organizations to react to worsening conditions by reducing their capital expenditures in general or by specifically reducing their spending on IT. Customers in these industries may delay or cancel IT projects or seek to lower their costs by renegotiating vendor contracts. Also, customers with excess IT resources may choose to develop in-house software solutions rather than obtain those solutions from us. Moreover, competitors may respond to market conditions by lowering prices and attempting to lure away our customers. In addition, the increased pace of consolidation in certain industries may result in reduced overall spending on our products.\nWe cannot predict the timing, strength or duration of any economic slowdown or recovery, generally or in the consumer products and services, manufacturing and financial services industries. During challenging and uncertain economic times and in tight credit markets, many customers delay or reduce technology purchases. Contract negotiations may become more protracted or difficult if customers institute additional internal approvals for technology purchases or require more negotiation of contract terms and conditions. These economic conditions, and uncertainty as to the general direction of the macroeconomic environment, are beyond our control and could result in reductions in sales of our products, longer sales cycles, difficulties in collection of accounts receivable or delayed payments, slower adoption of new technologies, increased price competition and reductions in the rate at which our customers renew their maintenance agreements and procure consulting services.\nOur business could be harmed as a result of the risks associated with our acquisitions.\nAs part of our business strategy, we may from time to time seek to acquire businesses or assets that provide us with additional intellectual property, customer relationships and geographic coverage. We can provide no assurances that we will be able to find and identify desirable acquisition targets or that we will be successful in entering into a definitive agreement with any one target. In addition, even if we reach a definitive agreement with a target, there is no assurance that we will complete any future acquisition.\nAny acquisitions we undertake or have recently completed will likely be accompanied by business risks which may include, among other things:\n\u2022\nthe effect of the acquisition on our financial and strategic position and reputation\n\u2022\nthe failure of an acquisition to result in expected benefits, which may include benefits relating to enhanced revenues, technology, human resources, costs savings, operating efficiencies, goodwill and other synergies\n\u2022\nthe difficulty, cost and management effort required to integrate the acquired businesses, including costs and delays in implementing common systems and procedures and costs and delays caused by communication difficulties\n\u2022\nthe assumption of certain known or unknown liabilities of the acquired business, including litigation-related liabilities\n\u2022\nthe reduction of our cash available for operations and other uses, the increase in amortization expense related to identifiable assets acquired, potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities or the incurrence of debt\n\u2022\na lack of experience in new markets, new business culture, products or technologies or an initial dependence on unfamiliar distribution partners\n\u2022\nthe possibility that we will pay more than the value we derive from the acquisition\n\u2022\nthe impairment of relationships with our customers, partners or suppliers or those of the acquired business\n\u2022\nthe potential loss of key employees of the acquired business.\nThese factors could harm our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nIn addition to the risks commonly encountered in the acquisition of a business or assets as described above, we may also experience risks relating to the challenges and costs of closing a transaction. The risks described above may be exacerbated as a result of managing multiple acquisitions at once.\nBusiness disruptions, including interruptions, delays, or failures in service from our third-party data center hosting facilities and other third-party services, could materially adversely affect our operating results or result in a material weakness in our internal controls that could adversely affect the market price of our stock.\nA significant portion of our research and development activities or certain other critical business operations are concentrated at a single facility in Sweden and a significant amount of our management operations are concentrated in a single facility in Radnor, Pennsylvania. In addition, we serve our customers, and manage certain critical internal processes, using third-party data center hosting facilities located in the U.S. and Sweden and other third-party services, including Amazon Web Services and other cloud services. We are also a highly automated business and a disruption or failure of our systems, or the third-party hosting facilities or other services that we use, could cause delays in completing sales and providing services. Such disruptions or failures could include a major earthquake, fire, cyber-attack, act of terrorism or other catastrophic event or a decision by one of our third-party service providers to close facilities that we use without adequate notice or other unanticipated problems with the third-party services that we use, including a failure to meet service standards. Any such disruptions or failures could (i) result that results in the destruction or disruption of any of our critical business operations, controls, or procedures or IT systems, (ii) severely affect our ability to conduct normal business operations, (iii) result in a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting, (iv) cause our customers to terminate their subscriptions, (v) result in our issuing credits or paying penalties or fines, (vi) harm our reputation, (vii) adversely affect our attrition rates or our ability to attract new customers, or (viii) cause our offerings to be perceived as not being secure, any of which could materially adversely affect our future operating results.\nFuture litigation could harm our results of operation and financial condition.\nIn addition to intellectual property litigation, from time to time, we may be subject to other litigation. We record a related liability when we can make a reasonable estimate of the liability relating to pending litigation and determine that it is probable. As additional information becomes available, we assess the potential liability and revise estimates as appropriate. However, because of uncertainties relating to litigation, the amount of our estimates could be wrong. In addition to the related cost and use of cash, pending or future litigation could cause the diversion of management\u2019s attention and resources.\nWe are incurring significant costs and demands upon management as a result of complying with the laws and regulations affecting public companies, which could harm our operating results.\nAs a public company, we are incurring significant legal, accounting and other expenses that we did not incur as a private company. In addition, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as well as rules subsequently implemented by the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (\u201cFINRA\u201d) and The NASDAQ Stock Exchange Global Select Market (\u201cNASDAQ\u201d) imposes various requirements on public companies, including requirements with respect to corporate governance practices. Our management and other personnel devote a substantial amount of time to these compliance initiatives. Moreover, these rules and regulations have substantially increased our\nlegal and financial compliance costs and made some activities more time-consuming and costly. We also expect these rules and regulations may make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance, and we may be required to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantial costs to maintain the same or similar coverage. These rules and regulations could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on our board of directors, our board committees or as executive officers.\nIf we do not adequately manage and evolve our financial reporting and managerial systems and processes, our ability to manage and grow our business may be harmed. A failure or disruption in these services would materially and adversely affect our ability to manage our business effectively.\nWe have experienced rapid growth over the last several years. We rely heavily on information technology systems to help manage critical functions, such as order processing, sales forecasts and employee data. Our ability to successfully implement our business plan and comply with regulations, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, requires an effective planning and management process. We expect that we will need to continue to improve existing, and implement new, operational and financial systems, procedures and controls to manage our business effectively in the future. In 2014, we implemented a new ERP system. If we experience a breakdown in our procedures or controls, our ability to record and report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis could be impaired. In addition, if one or more of our technology-related hardware or software providers suffer an interruption in their business, or experience delays, disruptions or quality control problems in their operations, or we have to change or add additional systems and services, our ability to manage our business would suffer.\nMany of our key financial systems used for internal purposes are cloud based solutions provided by third parties\nOur ERP system along with certain other internal financial systems are cloud based solutions provided by third parties. The use of cloud based systems provided by third parties exposes us to certain risks of those third parties. If a disruption of services by third party cloud financial system providers were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on our ability to record and report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis.\nIf we fail to maintain proper and effective internal control over financial reporting, our operating results and our ability to operate our business could be harmed.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act requires, among other things, that we establish and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls and procedures. Under the SEC\u2019s current rules, we are required to perform system and process evaluation and testing of our internal control over financial reporting to allow management to report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting, as required by Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Our independent registered public accounting firm is also required to report on our internal control over financial reporting. Our testing and our independent registered public accounting firm\u2019s testing may reveal deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses and render our internal control over financial reporting ineffective. Due to the extent of our international operations, our financial reporting requires substantial international activities, resources and reporting consolidation. We are also subject to complex tax laws, regulations, accounting principles and interpretations thereof. We have and expect to continue to incur substantial accounting and auditing expense and to expend significant management time in complying with the requirements of Section 404. If we are not able to maintain compliance with the requirements of Section 404 in a timely manner, or if we or our independent registered public accounting firm identify deficiencies in our internal control over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses, the market price of our stock could decline and we could be subject to investigations or sanctions by the SEC, FINRA, NASDAQ or other regulatory authorities. In addition, we could be required to expend significant management time and financial resources to correct any material weaknesses that may be identified or to respond to any regulatory investigations or proceedings.\nOur results of operations may be adversely affected by changes in or interpretations of accounting standards.\nWe prepare our unaudited consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\u201cU.S. GAAP\u201d). These principles are subject to interpretation by the SEC and various bodies formed to interpret and create appropriate accounting standards. It is possible that future requirements, including the recently released new guidance related to revenue recognition (ASU 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Topic 606), could change our current application of U.S. GAAP, resulting in a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations. Our accounting policies that recently have been or may be affected by changes in the accounting rules are as follows:\n\u2022\nsoftware revenue recognition\n\u2022\naccounting for income taxes\n\u2022\naccounting for leases\n\u2022\naccounting for business combinations and related goodwill\n\u2022\naccounting for stock-based awards issued to employees\n\u2022\nassessing fair value of financial and non-financial assets\n\u2022\napplication, if any of IFRS.\nWe continuously review our compliance with all applicable new and existing revenue recognition accounting pronouncements. In May 2014, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Topic 606 (ASU 2014-09), to supersede nearly all existing revenue recognition guidance under U.S. GAAP. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting ASU 2014-09 on our consolidated financial statements and have not yet selected a transition method, nor have we determined the effect of the standard on our ongoing financial reporting. Depending upon the outcome of these ongoing reviews and the potential issuance of further accounting pronouncements, implementation guidelines and interpretations, we may be required to modify our reported results, revenue recognition policies or business practices which could harm our results of operations.\nWe may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities.\nWe are subject to complex taxes in the U.S. and a variety of foreign jurisdictions. All of these jurisdictions have in the past and may in the future make changes to their corporate income tax rates and other income tax laws which could increase our future income tax provision.\nOur future income tax obligations could be adversely affected by earnings that are lower than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have lower statutory rates and by earnings that are higher than anticipated in jurisdictions where we have higher statutory rates, by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes in the amount of unrecognized tax benefits or by changes in tax laws (such as the Base Erosion Profit Shifting (\u201cBEPS\u201d) project initiated by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (\u201cOECD\u201d)), regulations, accounting principles or interpretations thereof.\nFurther changes in the tax laws of foreign jurisdictions could arise, whether as a result of BEPS or otherwise. The OECD, which represents a coalition of member countries, has issued recommendations that, in some cases, would make substantial changes to numerous long-standing tax positions and principles. These contemplated changes, to the extent adopted by OECD members and/or other countries, could increase tax uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes. In addition, in the United States, various proposals for broad reform of the existing U.S. corporate tax system are under evaluation by various legislative and administrative bodies, but it is not possible to accurately determine the overall impact of such proposals on our effective tax rate at this time.\nOur determination of our tax liability is subject to review by applicable U.S. and foreign tax authorities. Any adverse outcome of such a review could have an adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition. The determination of our worldwide income tax provision and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment and, in the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is complex and uncertain. Moreover, as a multinational business, we have subsidiaries that engage in many intercompany transactions in a variety of tax jurisdictions where the ultimate tax determination is complex and uncertain.\nWe also have contingent tax liabilities that, in management\u2019s judgment, are not probable of assertion. If such unasserted contingent liabilities were to be asserted, or become probable of assertion, we may be required to record significant expenses and liabilities in the period in which these liabilities are asserted or become probable of assertion.\nWe are also subject to non-income taxes, such as payroll, sales, use, value-added, net worth, property and goods and services taxes in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. We are regularly audited by tax authorities with respect to these non-income taxes and may have exposure to additional non-income tax liabilities which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, our future effective tax rates could be favorably or unfavorably affected by changes in tax rates, changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities, or changes in tax laws or their interpretation. Such changes could have an adverse impact on our financial results.\nAs a result of these and other factors, the ultimate amount of tax obligations owed may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and any such difference may harm our financial results in future periods in which we change our estimates of our tax obligations or in which the ultimate tax outcome is determined.\nWe may be subject to increased income taxes, and other restrictions and limitations, if we were to decide to repatriate any of our foreign cash balances to the U.S.\nAs of December 31, 2015, we held approximately $110.8 million, or approximately 35%, of our cash and cash equivalents outside of the U.S. We use our foreign held cash by reinvesting it in our foreign operations. Our current intention is to continue to reinvest our foreign earnings in our foreign operations. Our current plans do not anticipate a need to repatriate cash to fund our domestic operations. In the event cash from foreign operations is needed to fund operations in the U.S. or our foreign cash balance continues to grow such that we are unable to reinvest such cash outside of the U.S., it may become increasingly likely that we would repatriate some of our foreign cash balances to the U.S. In such event, we would be subject to additional income taxes in the U.S.\nAdditionally, if we were to repatriate foreign held cash to the U.S., we would use a portion of our domestic net operating loss carryforward which could result in us being subject to cash income taxes on the earnings of our domestic business sooner than would otherwise have been the case.\nVarious corporate tax reform bills and other proposals at various times are under consideration by Congress. It is not clear whether, or to what extent, these proposals may be enacted. Although the overall impact that any proposals may have on our future effective tax rate is unclear at this time, significant changes to the U.S. taxation of our international income could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nIf securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports or publish unfavorable research or reports about our business, our stock price and trading volume could decline.\nThe trading market for our common stock may be influenced by the research and reports that securities or industry analysts may publish about us, our business, our market or our competitors. If any of the analysts who may cover us adversely change their recommendation regarding our stock or products, or provide more favorable\nrelative recommendations about our competitors, our stock price would likely decline. If any analyst who may cover us were to cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly publish reports on us, interest in our stock could decrease, which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.\nThe price of our common stock may be volatile and fluctuate substantially.\nThe market price of our common stock could be highly volatile and may fluctuate substantially due to the following factors (in addition to the other risk factors described in this section):\n\u2022\nquarterly variations in our results of operations or those of our competitors\n\u2022\nannouncements by us or our competitors of acquisitions, new products, significant contracts or commercial relationships\n\u2022\nour ability to respond to changing industry standards, technological developments or customer requirements on a timely basis\n\u2022\ncommencement of, or our involvement in, litigation\n\u2022\nany major change in our board of directors or management\n\u2022\nfinancial guidance or business updates we may provide\n\u2022\nforeign currency exchange rate fluctuations\n\u2022\nrecommendations by securities analysts or changes in earnings estimates\n\u2022\nannouncements about our earnings that are not in line with analyst expectations or guidance we may provide\n\u2022\nchanges in our licensing or go to business models\n\u2022\nannouncements by our competitors of their earnings that are not in line with analyst expectations\n\u2022\nthe volume of shares of our common stock available for public sale\n\u2022\nsales of stock by us or by our stockholders\n\u2022\nshort sales, hedging and other derivative transactions involving shares of our common stock\n\u2022\nadoption of new accounting standards or tax laws or regulations\n\u2022\ngeneral economic conditions in the U.S. and abroad and slow or negative growth of related markets\n\u2022\ngeneral political conditions in the U.S. and abroad including terrorist attacks, war or threat of terrorist attacks or war.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, NASDAQ and the market for technology companies in particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the particular companies affected. These broad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price irrespective of our operating performance. As a result of these factors, an investor might be unable to resell their shares at or above the price paid. In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market or the market price of a company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against the affected company. This type of litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and resources.\nFuture sales of our common stock in the public market, including sales by our stockholders with significant holdings, may depress our stock price.\nThe market price of our common stock could drop due to sales of a large number of shares or the perception that such sales could occur, including sales or perceived sales by our directors, officers or large stockholders.\nThese sales could also make it more difficult or impossible for us to sell equity securities in the future at a time and price that we deem appropriate to raise funds through future offerings of equity securities.\nOur management has broad discretion over the use of our cash reserves, if any, and might not apply this cash in ways that increase the value of an investment.\nOur management has broad discretion to use our cash reserves, if any, and you will be relying on the judgment of our management regarding the application of this cash. They might not apply our cash in ways that increase the value of an investment. We expect to use our cash reserves for general corporate purposes, including working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions and further development of our products, services and solutions. We have not allocated this cash for any specific purposes. Our management might not be able to yield any return on the investment and use of this cash.\nWe currently do not intend to pay dividends on our common stock, and consequently, your only opportunity to achieve a return on investment is if the price of our common stock appreciates and you sell your shares at a price above your cost.\nWe currently do not intend to declare or pay dividends on shares of our common stock in the foreseeable future. See the section entitled \u201cDividend Policy\u201d included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for more information. Consequently, your only opportunity to achieve a return on your investment in our company will be if the market price of our common stock appreciates and you sell your shares at a price above your cost. There is no guarantee that the price of our common stock will ever exceed the price that you pay. Investors seeking cash dividends should not purchase our common stock.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and in Delaware law could prevent or delay a change in control of our company.\nWe are a Delaware corporation, and the anti-takeover provisions of the Delaware General Corporation Law may discourage, delay or prevent a change in control by prohibiting us from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the person becomes an interested stockholder even if a change of control would be beneficial to our existing stockholders. In addition, our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws may discourage, delay or prevent a change in our management or control over us that stockholders may consider favorable. Our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws:\n\u2022\nauthorize the issuance of \u201cblank check\u201d preferred stock that could be issued by our board of directors to thwart a takeover attempt\n\u2022\ndo not provide for cumulative voting in the election of directors which would allow holders of less than a majority of the stock to elect some directors\n\u2022\nestablish a classified board of directors, as a result of which the successors to the directors whose terms have expired will be elected to serve from the time of election and qualification until the third annual meeting following their election\n\u2022\nrequire that directors only be removed from office for cause\n\u2022\nprovide that vacancies on the board of directors, including newly-created directorships, may be filled only by a majority vote of directors then in office\n\u2022\nlimit who may call special meetings of stockholders\n\u2022\nprohibit stockholder action by written consent, requiring all actions to be taken at a meeting of the stockholders\n\u2022\nestablish advance notice requirements for nominating candidates for election to the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings.", "PERMNO": 12026, "SIC": 7372, "TIC": "QLIK"}
