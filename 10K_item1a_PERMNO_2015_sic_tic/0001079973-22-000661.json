{"cik": "1282224", "company": "Dolphin Entertainment, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-05-26", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nRisks Related to our Business and Financial Condition\nThe COVID-19 outbreak has adversely impacted the global economy, the entertainment industry, our business, financial condition and results of operations and the extent of the continuing impact is highly uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nThe global spread of COVID-19 has created significant operational volatility, uncertainty and disruption, both in the global economy, in general, and in the hospitality and entertainment industries, in particular. The extent to which COVID-19 will continue to adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations will depend on numerous evolving factors, which are highly uncertain, rapidly changing and cannot be predicted, including:\n\u00b7 the duration and scope of the outbreak;\n\u00b7 governmental, business and individual actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the outbreak, including travel restrictions, quarantines, social distancing, work-at-home and shut-downs;\n\u00b7 the effectiveness and timing of COVID-19 vaccination campaigns, or any perceived limitations of or setbacks in these efforts;\n\u00b7 the impact of the outbreak on the financial markets and economic activity generally;\n\u00b7 the effect of the outbreak on our clients and other business partners;\n\u00b7 our ability to access the capital markets and sources of liquidity on reasonable terms;\n\u00b7 potential goodwill or other impairment charges;\n\u00b7 increased cybersecurity risks as a result of remote working conditions;\n\u00b7 our ability during the outbreak to provide our services, including the health and wellbeing of our employees; and\n\u00b7 the ability of our clients to pay for our services during and following the outbreak.\nThe potential effects of COVID-19 could also heighten the risks disclosed in many of our other risk factors that are included below, including as a result of, but not limited to, the factors listed above.\nOur results of operations are highly susceptible to unfavorable economic conditions.\nWe are exposed to risks associated with weak or uncertain regional economic conditions and disruptions in the financial markets. Following the severe downturn in most markets following the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the global economy continues to be challenging. Economic downturns or uncertainty about the strength of the global economy in general, or economic conditions in certain regions or market sectors, and caution on the part of marketers, can have an effect on the demand for advertising and marketing communication services. In addition, market conditions can be and have been adversely affected by natural and human disruptions, such as natural disasters, public health crises, severe weather events, military conflict or civil unrest. Our industry can be affected more severely than other sectors by an economic downturn and can recover more slowly than the economy in general. In the past, including in connection with the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, some clients have responded to weak economic and financial conditions by reducing their marketing budgets, which include discretionary components that are easier to reduce in the short term than other operating expenses. This pattern may recur in the future. Furthermore, unexpected revenue shortfalls can result in misalignments of costs and revenues, resulting in a negative impact to our operating margins. If our business is significantly adversely affected by unfavorable economic conditions or other market disruptions that adversely affect client spending, the negative impact on our revenue could pose a challenge to our operating income and cash generation from operations.\nWe have a history of net losses and may continue to incur net losses.\nWe have a history of net losses and may be unable to generate sufficient revenue to achieve profitability in the future. For the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, our net loss was $6,462,303 and $1,939,192. Our accumulated deficit was $104,434,344 and $97,972,041 at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our ability to generate net profit in the future will depend on our ability to realize the financial benefits from the operations of 42West, The Door, Shore Fire, Viewpoint and Be Social and the success of our Dolphin 2.0 initiatives, as no single project is likely to generate sufficient revenue to cover our operating expenses. If we are unable to generate net profit at some point, we will not be able to meet our debt service or working capital requirements. As a result, we may need to (i) issue additional equity, which could substantially dilute the value of your share holdings, (ii) sell a portion or all of our assets, including any project rights which might have otherwise generated revenue, or (iii) cease operations.\nWe currently have substantial indebtedness which may adversely affect our cash flow and business operations and may affect our ability to continue to operate as a going concern.\nThe table below sets forth our total principal amount of debt as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nOur indebtedness could have important negative consequences, including:\n\u00b7 our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, capital expenditures, future productions or other purposes may be impaired or such financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all;\n\u00b7 we may have to pay higher interest rates upon obtaining future financing, thereby reducing our cash flows; and\n\u00b7 we may need a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make principal and interest payments on our indebtedness, reducing the funds that would otherwise be available for operations and future business opportunities.\nOur ability to service our indebtedness will depend upon, among other things, our future financial and operating performance and our ability to obtain additional financing, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions, the profitability of our content production and entertainment publicity and marketing businesses and other factors contained in these Risk Factors, some of which are beyond our control.\nIf we are not able to generate sufficient cash to service our current or future indebtedness, we will be forced to take actions such as reducing or delaying digital or film productions, delaying or abandoning potential acquisitions, delaying Dolphin 2.0 initiatives, selling assets, restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness or seeking additional debt or equity capital or bankruptcy protection. We may not be able to effect any of these remedies on satisfactory terms or at all and our indebtedness may affect our ability to continue to operate as a going concern.\nOur stock price has recently been volatile and may be volatile in the future, and as a result, investors in our common stock could incur substantial losses.\nOur stock price has recently been volatile and may be volatile in the future. For example, on March 22, 2021, the price of our common stock closed at $5.45 per share while on March 23, 2021, the price of our common stock closed at $18.33 after a press release announced the formation of our NFT division. We may incur rapid and substantial increases or decreases in our stock price in the foreseeable future that may or may not coincide in timing with the disclosure of news or developments by us. The stock market in general, and the market for entertainment companies in particular, has experienced extreme volatility that has often been unrelated to the operating performance of particular companies. As a result of this volatility, investors may experience losses on their investment in our common stock. The market price for our common stock may be influenced by many factors, including the following:\n\u00b7 announcements of state-of-the-art means of content production and entertainment publicity and marketing, or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u00b7 announcements related to any delays in production or rollout of entertainment content;\n\u00b7 our ability to meet or exceed the rapidly-changing expectations of our clients;\n\u00b7 news that audience acceptance of and interest in our digital media productions, and therefore the commercial success of our content production business, is lower or higher than we expected;\n\u00b7 our ability to adapt to rapid change in technology, forms of delivery, storage, and consumer preferences related to digital content;\n\u00b7 announcements of significant acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures or capital commitments by us, our strategic collaboration partners or our competitors;\n\u00b7 variations in our financial results or those of companies that are perceived to be similar to us;\n\u00b7 trading volume of our common stock;\n\u00b7 developments concerning our collaborations or partners;\n\u00b7 the impact of the COVID-19 outbreak and its effect on us;\n\u00b7 the perception of the entertainment publicity and marketing or digital content production by the public, legislatures, regulators and the investment community;\n\u00b7 developments or disputes concerning intellectual property rights;\n\u00b7 significant lawsuits, including patent or stockholder litigation;\n\u00b7 our ability or inability to raise additional capital and the terms on which we raise it;\n\u00b7 sales of our common stock by us or our stockholders;\n\u00b7 declines in the market prices of stocks generally or of companies that are perceived to be similar to us; and\n\u00b7 general economic, industry and market conditions.\nOur management has determined that our disclosure controls and procedures and our internal controls over financial reporting are not effective as we have identified material weaknesses in our internal controls.\nAs disclosed in Part II, Item 9A. Controls and Procedures of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, management concluded that for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, our internal control over financial reporting was not effective and we identified several material weaknesses. Our management concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective due to material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nWe have commenced our remediation efforts as discussed in Part II, 9A. Controls and Procedures of this Annual Report on Form 10-K to address the material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting and ineffective disclosure controls and procedures. If our remedial measures are insufficient, or if additional material weaknesses or significant deficiencies in our internal controls occur in the future, we could be required to restate our financial results, which could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition, restrict our ability to access the capital markets, require us to expend significant resources to correct the weakness or deficiencies, harm our reputation and otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence. In addition, we could be subject to, among other things, regulatory or enforcement actions by the Securities and Exchange Commission, (the \u201cSEC\u201d or the \u201cCommission\u201d).\nWe rely on information technology systems that are susceptible to cybersecurity risks. In the event of a cybersecurity incident, we could experience operational interruptions, incur substantial additional costs, become subject to legal or regulatory proceedings or suffer damage to our reputation.\nWe rely on information technologies and infrastructure to manage our businesses, including digital storage of marketing strategies and client information, films and digital programming and delivery of digital marketing services for our businesses. Data maintained in digital form is subject to the risk of intrusion, tampering and theft. The incidence of malicious technology-related events, such as cyberattacks, computer hacking, computer viruses, worms or other destructive or disruptive software, denial of service attacks or other malicious activities is on the rise worldwide. Power outages, equipment failure, natural disasters (including extreme weather), terrorist activities or human error may also affect our systems and result in disruption of our services or loss or improper disclosure of personal data, business information or other confidential information.\nLikewise, data privacy breaches, as well as improper use of social media, by employees and others may pose a risk that sensitive data, such as personally identifiable information, strategic plans and trade secrets, could be exposed to third parties or to the general public. We also utilize third parties, including third-party \u201ccloud\u201d computing services, to store, transfer or process data, and system failures or network disruptions or breaches in the systems of such third parties could adversely affect our reputation or business. Any such breaches or breakdowns could lead to business interruption, exposure of our or our clients\u2019 proprietary or confidential information, data corruption, damage to our reputation, exposure to legal and regulatory proceedings and other costs. Such events could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, we could be adversely affected if any of our significant customers or suppliers experience any similar events that disrupt their business operations or damage their reputation. Efforts to develop, implement and maintain security measures are costly, may not be successful in preventing these events from occurring and require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated. Although we maintain monitoring practices and protections of our information technology to reduce these risks, there can be no assurance that our efforts will prevent the risk of a security breach of our databases or systems that could adversely affect our business.\nThe profitability of our investments is uncertain.\nDuring 2021, we acquired an ownership stake in Midnight Theatre, a contemporary variety theater and restaurant in Manhattan and in Crafthouse Cocktails, a brand of ready-to-drink, all-natural classic cocktails. We also started an NFT studio to produce and market NFTs. Investments in these new ventures entail risks those businesses will fail to perform in accordance with expectations. In undertaking these investments, we will incur certain risks, including the expenditure of funds on, and the devotion of management\u2019s time to, synergies that may not come to fruition. Additional risks inherent in these investments include risks that the ventures will not achieve anticipated success and that estimates of the costs of bringing these ventures to profitability may prove inaccurate. Expenses may also be greater than anticipated.\nRisks Related to Our Entertainment Publicity and Marketing Business\nOur business could be adversely affected if we fail to retain the principal sellers, and other key employees of 42West, The Door, Shore Fire and Be Social and the clients they serve.\nThe success of our entertainment publicity and marketing business operated by 42West, The Door, Shore Fire and Be Social substantially depends on our ability to retain the services of the former owners and certain key employees of 42West, The Door, Shore Fire and Be Social. If we lose the services of one or more of these individuals, our ability to successfully implement our business plan with respect to our entertainment publicity and marketing business and the value of our common stock could be materially adversely affected. Although we entered into employment agreements with each of the principal sellers, there can be no assurance that they will serve the terms of their respective employment agreements or choose to remain with us following the expiration of such terms. In addition, the employees of 42West, The Door, Shore Fire and Be Social, and their skills and relationships with clients, are among our most valuable assets. An important aspect of the business\u2019 competitiveness is its ability to retain such key employees. If 42West, The Door, Shore Fire or Be Social fail to hire and retain a sufficient number of these key employees, it may have a material adverse effect on our overall business and results of operations.\n42West, The Door, Shore Fire and Be Social\u2019s talent rosters currently include some of the best known and most highly respected members of the entertainment, hospitality, and musical communities. These include major studios and networks, corporations, well-known consumer brands, celebrity chefs, leading restaurant and hotel brands, recording artists and social media influencers. These clients often form highly loyal relationships with certain public relations and marketing professionals rather than with a particular firm. The employment agreements with the principal sellers currently contain non-competition provisions that prohibit the principal sellers from continuing to provide services to such clients should they leave our company, however, clients are free to engage other public relations and marketing professionals and there can be no assurance that they will choose to remain with our company. The success of 42West, The Door, Shore Fire and Be Social, therefore, depend on our ability to continue to successfully maintain such client relationships should the principal sellers or other key employees leave our company. If we are unable to retain the current 42West, The Door, Shore Fire and Be Social clients or attract new clients, then we could suffer a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry.\nThe entertainment publicity and marketing business is highly competitive. Through 42West, The Door, Shore Fire and Be Social, we must compete with other agencies, and with other providers of marketing and publicity services, in order to maintain existing client relationships and to win new clients. Through Viewpoint, we compete against other creative branding agencies, as well as in-house creative teams at many of our clients. The client\u2019s perception of the quality of an agency\u2019s creative work and the agency\u2019s reputation are critical factors in determining its competitive position.\nThe success of our entertainment publicity and marketing business depends on its ability to consistently and effectively deliver marketing and public relations services to its clients.\n42West, The Door, Shore Fire and Be Social\u2019s success depends on its ability to effectively and consistently staff and execute client engagements to achieve the clients\u2019 unique personal or professional goals. 42West, The Door, Shore Fire and Be Social, work to design customized communications or publicity campaigns tailored to the particular needs and objectives of particular projects. In some of its engagements, 42West, The Door, Shore Fire and Be Social rely on other third parties to provide some of the services to its clients, and we cannot guarantee that these third parties will effectively deliver their services or that we will have adequate recourse against these third parties in the event they fail to effectively deliver their services. Other contingencies and events outside of our control may also impact 42West, The Door, Shore Fire and Be Social\u2019s ability to provide its services. 42West, The Door, Shore Fire and Be Social\u2019s failure to effectively and timely staff, coordinate and execute its client engagements may adversely impact existing client relationships, the amount or timing of payments from clients, its reputation in the marketplace and ability to secure additional business and our resulting financial performance. In addition, our contractual arrangements with our clients may not provide us with sufficient protections against claims for lost profits or other claims for damages.\nIf we are unable to adapt to changing client demands, social and cultural trends or emerging technologies, we may not remain competitive and our business, revenues and operating results could suffer.\nWe operate in an industry characterized by rapidly changing client expectations, marketing technologies, and social mores and cultural trends that impact our target audiences. The entertainment industry continues to undergo significant developments as advances in technologies and new methods of message delivery and consumption emerge. These developments drive changes in our target audiences\u2019 behavior to which we must adapt in order to reach our target audiences. In addition, our success depends on our ability to anticipate and respond to changing social mores and cultural trends that impact the entertainment industry and our target audiences. We must adapt our business to these trends, as well as shifting patterns of content consumption and changing behaviors and preferences of our target audiences, through the adoption and exploitation of new technologies. If we cannot successfully exploit emerging technologies or if the marketing strategies we choose misinterpret cultural or social trends and prove to be incorrect or ineffective, any of these could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, liquidity and prospects.\nA significant labor dispute in our clients\u2019 industries could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nAn industry-wide strike or other job action by or affecting the Writers Guild, Screen Actors Guild or other major entertainment industry union could reduce the supply of original entertainment content, which would in turn reduce the demand for our talent and entertainment marketing services. An extensive work stoppage would affect feature film production as well as television and commercial production and could have a material adverse effect on our clients and the motion picture production industry in general. Contracts between entertainment industry unions and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers, which we refer to as AMPTP, expire from time to time. The failure to finalize and ratify a new agreement with the AMPTP or the failure to enter into new commercial contracts upon expiration of the current contracts could lead to a strike or other job action. Any such severe or prolonged work stoppage could have an adverse effect on the television and/or motion picture production industries and could severely impair our clients\u2019 prospects. Any resulting decrease in demand for our talent and entertainment marketing and other public relations services would have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and results of operations.\nClients may terminate or reduce their relationships with us on short notice.\nAs is customary in the industry, 42West, The Door, Shore Fire and Be Social\u2019s agreements with their respective clients generally provide for termination by either party on relatively short notice, usually 30 days. Consequently, these clients may choose to reduce or terminate their relationships with us, on a relatively short time frame and for any reason. If a significant number of the 42West, The Door, Shore Fire or Be Social clients were to reduce the volume of business they conducted with us or terminate their relationships with us completely, this could have a material adverse effect upon our business and results of operations. Viewpoint\u2019s revenue is derived on a project-by-project basis. Clients may decide to use other creative branding and production companies for their projects which would have an adverse effect upon our business and results of operations.\nRevenues from our Entertainment Publicity and Marketing segment are susceptible to declines as a result of unfavorable economic conditions.\nEconomic downturns often severely affect the marketing services industry. Some of our corporate clients may respond to weak economic performance by reducing their marketing budgets, which are generally discretionary in nature and easier to reduce in the short-term than other expenses related to operations. In addition, economic downturns could lead to reduced public demand for varying forms of entertainment for which we are engaged to provide public relations and media strategy and promotional services. Such reduced demand for our services could have a material adverse effect on our revenues and results of operations.\nIf our clients experience financial distress, or seek to change or delay payment terms, it could negatively affect our own financial position and results.\nWe have a large and diverse client base, and at any given time, one or more of our clients may experience financial difficulty, file for bankruptcy protection or go out of business. Unfavorable economic and financial conditions, such as the current events surrounding the COVID-19 global outbreak, could result in an increase in client financial difficulties that affect us. The direct impact on us included reduced revenues, write-offs of accounts receivable and expenditures billable to clients, and negatively impacted our operating cash flow.\nRisks Related to Acquisitions\nWe are subject to risks associated with acquisitions and we may not realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions.\nWe regularly undertake acquisitions that we believe will enhance our service offering to our clients. These transactions can involve significant challenges and risks, including that the transaction does not advance our business strategy or fails to produce a satisfactory return on our investment. Our customary business, legal and financial due diligence with the goal of identifying and evaluating the material risks involved may be unsuccessful in ascertaining or evaluating all such risks. Though we typically structure our acquisitions to provide for future contingent purchase payments that are based on the future performance of the acquired entity, our forecasts of the investment\u2019s future performance also factor into the initial consideration. When actual financial results differ, our returns on the investment could be adversely affected. Identifying suitable acquisition candidates can be difficult, time-consuming and costly, and we may not be able to identify suitable candidates or complete acquisitions in a timely manner, on a cost-effective basis or at all.\nEven if we complete an acquisition, we may not realize the anticipated benefits of such transaction. Our recent acquisitions have required, and any similar future transactions may also require, significant efforts and expenditures, including with respect to integrating the acquired business with our historical business. We may encounter unexpected difficulties, or incur unexpected costs, in connection with acquisition activities and integration efforts, including, without limitation:\n\u00b7 diversion of management attention from managing our historical core business;\n\u00b7 potential disruption of our historical core business or of the acquired business;\n\u00b7 the strain on, and need to continue to expand, our existing operational, technical, financial and administrative infrastructure;\n\u00b7 inability to achieve synergies as planned;\n\u00b7 challenges in controlling additional costs and expenses in connection with and as a result of the acquisition;\n\u00b7 dilution to existing shareholders from the issuance of equity securities;\n\u00b7 becoming subject to adverse tax consequences or substantial depreciation;\n\u00b7 difficulties in assimilating employees and corporate cultures or in integrating systems and controls;\n\u00b7 difficulties in anticipating and responding to actions that may be taken by competitors;\n\u00b7 difficulties in realizing the anticipated benefits of the transaction;\n\u00b7 inability to generate sufficient revenue from acquisitions to offset the associated acquisition costs;\n\u00b7 potential loss of key employees, key clients or other partners of the acquired business as a result of the change of ownership; and\n\u00b7 the assumption of and exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the acquired businesses.\nIf any of our acquisitions do not perform as anticipated for any of the reasons noted above or otherwise, there could be a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nLosses incurred by us subsequent to completion of an acquisition may not be indemnifiable by the seller or may exceed the seller\u2019s indemnification obligations.\nAs discussed above, there may be liabilities assumed in any acquisition that we did not discover or that we underestimated in the course of performing our due diligence. Although a seller generally will have indemnification obligations to us under an acquisition agreement, these obligations are usually subject to financial limitations, such as general deductibles and maximum recovery amounts, as well as time limitations. We cannot assure you that our right to indemnification from any seller will be enforceable, collectible or sufficient in amount, scope or duration to fully offset the amount of any losses that we incur with respect to a particular acquisition. Any such liabilities, individually or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nRisks Related to our Common Stock and Preferred Stock\nWe have recently issued, and may in the future issue, a significant amount of equity securities and, as a result, your ownership interest in our company has been, and may in the future be, substantially diluted and your investment in our common stock could suffer a material decline in value. (All shares and per share amounts have been retrospectively adjusted for the 1:5 reverse stock split effectuated on November 27, 2020.)\nFrom January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2021, the number of shares of our common stock issued and outstanding has increased from 3,578,580 to 8,020,381 shares. During this period, we issued approximately 500,667 shares of our common stock as consideration for 42West, The Door, Shore Fire, Viewpoint, Be Social and B/HI acquisitions. Furthermore, we will issue 349,087 shares of common stock to the sellers of The Door and B/HI as earnout consideration for financial performance targets achieved during 2021. We may issue to the seller of Be Social the equivalent of up to $300,000 of our common stock based on the 30-day trading average on the date certain financial performance targets are achieved. During the year ended December 31, 2021, certain holders of convertible notes exercised their right to convert all or a portion of their convertible notes and we issued 963,985 shares of common stock. As of December 31, 2021, we had outstanding convertible notes payable that as of the date of this report are still outstanding in the aggregate principal amount of $2.9 million, which are convertible using a 90-day trading average stock price. As a result of these past issuances and potential future issuances, your ownership interest in the Company has been, and may in the future be, substantially diluted.\nThe market price for our common stock has been volatile, and these issuances could cause the price of our common stock to continue to fluctuate substantially. Once restricted stock issued in either private placements or to the sellers of the companies we acquired becomes freely tradable, these shareholders may decide to sell their shares of common stock and, if our stock is thinly traded, this could have a material adverse effect on its market price.\nWe may need to raise additional capital and may seek to do so by conducting one or more private placements of equity securities, securities convertible into equity securities or debt securities, or through a combination of one or more of such financing alternatives. Such issuances of additional securities would further dilute the equity interests of our existing shareholders, perhaps substantially, and may further exacerbate any or all of the above risks.\nThe Series C Convertible Preferred Stock has super voting rights that may adversely affect our shareholders.\nThe Series C Convertible Preferred Stock is held by Dolphin Entertainment LLC, an entity owned by Mr. O\u2019Dowd. Except as required by law, holders of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock will only have voting rights once the independent directors of the Board determine that an optional conversion threshold (as defined in the Series C Certificate of Designation) has occurred. On November 12, 2020, such determination by the Board was made, and the holder of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock (indirectly Mr. O\u2019Dowd) is entitled to super voting rights of three votes for each share of common stock into which such holder\u2019s shares of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock could then be converted. As of December 31, 2021, the Series C Preferred Stock could be converted into 4,738,940 shares of our common stock and the holder was entitled to 14,216,819 votes, which is approximately 65% of our voting securities. The holder of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock is entitled to vote together as a single class on all matters upon which common stockholders are entitled to vote. Your voting rights will be diluted as a result of these super voting rights. On November 12, 2020, we entered into a stock restriction agreement with Mr. O\u2019Dowd that prohibits the conversion of Series C Convertible Preferred Stock into common stock unless the majority of the independent directors of the board of directors vote to remove the restriction. The stock restriction agreement will be immediately terminated upon a change of control as defined in the agreement.\nIf we are unable to maintain compliance with Nasdaq listing requirements, our stock could be delisted, and the trading price, volume and marketability of our stock could be adversely affected.\nOur common stock is listed on the Nasdaq Capital Market. We cannot assure you, that we will be able to maintain compliance with Nasdaq\u2019s current listing standards, or that Nasdaq will not implement additional listing standards with which we will be unable to comply. On October 17, 2019, we received a deficiency notice from Nasdaq informing us that our common stock failed to comply with the $1 minimum bid price required for continued listing on Nasdaq under Nasdaq Listing Rule 5550(a)(2) based upon the closing bid price of the Common Stock for the 30 consecutive business days prior to the date of the notice from Nasdaq. Nasdaq normally provides an initial cure period of six months. Due to the market conditions in 2020, Nasdaq determined to toll the compliance period for the minimum bid price through June 30, 2020. As a result, we were required to regain compliance by December 28, 2020. To regain compliance, the minimum bid price of our common stock must meet or exceed $1.00 per share for a minimum of ten consecutive days at any point prior to December 28, 2020. On November 27, 2020, we effectuated a 1-to-5 reverse stock split and after ten consecutive days with a minimum bid price of at least $1.00, Nasdaq notified us that we were in compliance with the minimum bid price listing requirement.\nFailure to maintain compliance with Nasdaq listing requirements could result in the delisting of our shares from Nasdaq, which could have a material adverse effect on the trading price, volume and marketability of our common stock. Furthermore, a delisting could adversely affect our ability to issue additional securities and obtain additional financing in the future or result in a loss of confidence by investors or employees.\nThe sale or issuance of our common stock to Lincoln Park may cause dilution and the sale of the shares of common stock acquired by Lincoln Park, or the perception that such sales may occur, could cause the price of our common stock to fall.\nOn December 29, 2021, we entered into a Purchase Agreement (the \u201cPurchase Agreement\u201d) with Lincoln Park Capital Fund, LLC (\u201cLincoln Park\u201d), pursuant to which Lincoln Park committed to purchase up to $25 million of our common stock. Concurrently with the execution of the Purchase Agreement, we issued 51,827 shares of our common stock to Lincoln Park as a commitment fee and on March 7, 2022 we issued an additional 37,019 shares of our common stock as an additional commitment fee. The purchase shares sold pursuant to the Purchase Agreement may be sold by us to Lincoln Park at our discretion from time to time over a 36-month period. The purchase price for shares that we may sell to Lincoln Park under the Purchase Agreement will fluctuate based on the price of our common stock. Depending on market liquidity at the time, sales of such shares may cause the trading price of our common stock to fall.\nWe have the right to control the timing and amount of any sales of our shares to Lincoln Park in our sole discretion, subject to certain limits on the amount of shares that can be sold on a given date. Sales of shares of our common stock, if any, to Lincoln Park will depend upon market conditions and other factors to be determined by us. Therefore, Lincoln Park may ultimately purchase all, some or none of the shares of our common stock that may be sold pursuant to the Purchase Agreement and, after it has acquired shares, Lincoln Park may sell all, some or none of those shares. Sales to Lincoln Park by us could result in substantial dilution to the interests of other holders of our common stock. Additionally, the sale of a substantial number of shares of our common stock to Lincoln Park, or the anticipation of such sales, could make it more difficult for us to sell equity or equity-related securities in the future at a time and at a price that we might otherwise wish to effect sales, which could have a materially adverse effect on our business and operations.", "PERMNO": 17140, "SIC": 8700, "TIC": "DLPN"}
