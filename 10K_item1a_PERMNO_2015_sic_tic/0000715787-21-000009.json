RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the following factors, in addition to the other information included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and the other documents incorporated herein by reference, before deciding whether to purchase or sell our common stock. Any or all of the following risk factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nRisk Factors Related to COVID-19\nThe COVID-19 pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate, our ability to keep employees safe from the pandemic, our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, capital investments, our near term and long term ability to stay in compliance with debt covenants under our Syndicated Credit Facility and Senior Notes, our ability to refinance our existing indebtedness, and our ability to obtain financing in capital markets.\nThe World Health Organization has declared the COVID-19 outbreak a pandemic, and the virus continues to spread in areas where we operate and sell our products and services. The COVID-19 pandemic and similar issues in the future could have a material adverse effect on: our ability to operate; our ability to keep employees safe from the pandemic; our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and capital investments; our near term and long term ability to stay in compliance with debt covenants under our Syndicated Credit Facility and Senior Notes; our ability to refinance our existing indebtedness; and our ability to gain financing in the capital markets.\nPublic health organizations have recommended, and many governments have implemented, measures from time to time during the pandemic to slow and limit the transmission of the virus, including certain business shutdowns and shelter in place and social distancing requirements. Such preventive measures, or others we may voluntarily put in place, may have a material adverse effect on our business for an indefinite period of time, such as: the potential shut down of certain locations; decreased employee availability; potential border closures; and disruptions to the businesses of our selling channel partners, and others.\nOur suppliers and customers may also face these and other challenges, which could lead to a disruption in our supply chain, raw material inflation or the inability to get the raw materials necessary to produce our products, increased shipping and transport costs, as well as decreased construction and renovation spending and decreased demand for our products and services. These issues may also materially affect our current and future access to sources of liquidity, particularly our cash flows from operations, and access to financing from the capital markets. Although these disruptions may continue to occur, the long-term economic impact and near-term financial impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including but not limited to, potential near-term or long-term risk of asset impairment, restructuring, and other charges, cannot be reliably quantified or estimated at this time due to the uncertainty of future developments.\nSales of our principal products have been and may continue to be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, adverse economic cycles, and effects in the new construction market and renovation market.\nSales of our principal products are related to the renovation and construction of commercial and institutional buildings. This activity is cyclical and has been affected by the strength of a country\u2019s or region\u2019s general economy, prevailing interest rates and other factors that lead to cost control measures, or reduction in the use of space, by businesses and other users of commercial or institutional space. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic may have cyclical and structural impacts on this activity resulting from job losses for office workers, reductions in the use of coworking spaces, and increases in the number of people working from home. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, the future of the office, and what the office of the future might look like, is being highly debated by senior executives, commercial real estate firms, architects, designers and other global experts which could adversely affect the amount of money that customers spend on our products. In addition, the effects of cyclicality and other factors affecting the corporate office segment have traditionally tended to be more pronounced than the effects on other market segments. Historically, we have generated more sales in the corporate office segment than in any other segment. The effects of cyclicality and other factors on the new construction segment of the market have also tended in the past to be more pronounced than the effects on the renovation segment. These effects may recur and could be more pronounced if global economic conditions do not improve or are weakened by negative cycles or other factors, including as a result of the continuing COVID-19 pandemic.\nOur earnings could be adversely affected by non-cash adjustments to goodwill, when a test of goodwill assets indicate a material impairment of those assets.\nAs prescribed by accounting standards governing goodwill and other intangible assets, we undertake an annual review of the goodwill asset balance reflected in our financial statements. Our review is conducted during the fourth quarter of the year, unless there has been a triggering event prescribed by applicable accounting rules that warrants an earlier interim testing for possible goodwill impairment. A future goodwill impairment test may result in a future non-cash adjustment, which could adversely affect our earnings for any such future period.\nWe recorded a goodwill and intangible asset impairment loss of $121.3 million in the first quarter of 2020 primarily as a result of the expected duration of the COVID-19 pandemic and its anticipated negative impact to our revenue and operating income. Future impairment charges could result if these expectations change or the COVID-19 pandemic continues for an extended period.\nInternational Risk Factors\nOur substantial international operations are subject to various political, economic and other uncertainties that could adversely affect our business results, including by restrictive taxation or other government regulation and by foreign currency fluctuations.\nWe have substantial international operations and intend to continue to pursue and commit resources to growth opportunities beyond the United States. Outside of the United States, we maintain manufacturing facilities in the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, China, Thailand, Australia and Germany, in addition to product showrooms or design studios in Canada, Mexico, England, France, Germany, Spain, the Netherlands, India, Australia, Norway, United Arab Emirates, Russia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Thailand, China and elsewhere. In 2020, approximately half of our net sales and a significant portion of our production were outside the United States, primarily in Europe and Asia-Pacific.\nInternational operations carry certain risks and associated costs, such as: the complexities and expense of administering a business abroad; complications in compliance with, and unexpected changes in, legal and regulatory restrictions or requirements; foreign laws, international import and export legislation; trading and investment policies; economic and political instability in the global markets; foreign currency fluctuations; exchange controls; increased nationalism and protectionism; tariffs and other trade barriers; difficulties in collecting accounts receivable; potential adverse tax consequences and increasing tax complexity or changes in tax law associated with operating in multiple tax jurisdictions; uncertainties of laws and enforcement relating to intellectual property and privacy rights; difficulty in managing a geographically dispersed workforce in compliance with diverse local laws and customs, including health and safety regulations and wage and hour laws; potential governmental expropriation (especially in countries with undemocratic or authoritarian ruling parties); and other factors depending upon the jurisdiction involved. There can be no assurance that we will not experience these risks in the future.\nRisks include, for example, the uncertainty surrounding the implementation and effect of the United Kingdom\u2019s exit from the European Union described below, including changes to the legal and regulatory framework that apply to the United Kingdom and its relationship with the European Union.\nWe also make a substantial portion of our net sales in currencies other than U.S. dollars (approximately half of 2020 net sales), which subjects us to the risks inherent in currency translations. The scope and volume of our global operations make it impossible to eliminate completely all foreign currency translation risks as an influence on our financial results.\nIn addition, due to our global operations, we are subject to many laws governing international relations and international operations, including laws that prohibit improper payments to government officials and commercial customers and that restrict where we can do business, what information or products we can import and export to and from certain countries and what information we can provide to a non-U.S. government. These laws include but are not limited to the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (\u201cFCPA\u201d), the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, the Mexican National Anticorruption System (Sistema Nacional Anticorrupci\u00f3n, or \u201cSNA\u201d), the U.S. Export Administration Act and U.S. and international economic sanctions and money laundering regulations. We have internal policies and procedures relating to compliance with such regulations; however, there is a risk that such policies and procedures will not always protect us from the improper acts of employees, agents, business partners, joint venture partners or representatives, particularly in the case of recently acquired operations that may not have significant training in applicable compliance policies and procedures. Violations of these laws, which are complex, may result in criminal penalties, sanctions and/or fines that could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and reputation. In addition, we are subject to antitrust laws in various countries throughout the world. Changes in these laws or their interpretation, administration or enforcement may occur over time. Any such changes may limit our future acquisitions, divestitures or operations.\nFinally, we may not be aware of all the factors that may affect our business in foreign jurisdictions. The risks outlined above, and others specific to certain jurisdictions that we may not be aware of, could adversely and materially affect our business and results.\nThe uncertainty surrounding the implementation and effect of the U.K.\u2019s exit from the European Union, and related negative developments in the European Union could adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nIn 2016, voters in the U.K. approved an exit from the European Union via a referendum (commonly referred to as \u201cBrexit\u201d). The U.K. ceased to be a member of the European Union on January 31, 2020. In December 2020, the U.K. and the European Union agreed on a trade and cooperation agreement, which is being applied provisionally until it is formally ratified by the European Union parliament. Because the agreement merely sets forth a framework in many respects and will require complex additional bilateral negotiations between the U.K. and the European Union as both parties continue to work on the rules for implementation, significant political and economic uncertainty remains about how the precise terms of the relationship between the parties will differ from the terms before withdrawal. The uncertainty leading up to and following Brexit has had, and the implementation of Brexit may continue to have, a negative impact on our business and demand for our products in Europe, and particularly in the U.K. Brexit could adversely affect European or worldwide political, regulatory, economic or market conditions and could contribute to instability in political institutions and regulatory agencies. Brexit could also have the effect of disrupting the free movement of goods, services, and people between the U.K., the European Union and elsewhere. In addition, Brexit has had a detrimental effect, and could have further detrimental effects, on the value of either or both of the Euro and the British pound sterling, which could negatively impact our business (principally from the translation of sales and earnings in those foreign currencies into our reporting currency of U.S. dollars). Such a development could have other unpredictable adverse effects, including a material adverse effect on demand for office space and our flooring products in the U.K. and in Europe if the U.K. exit leads to economic difficulties in Europe.\nRisk Factors Related to our Indebtedness\nWe have a substantial amount of debt, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt.\nWe have a substantial amount of debt and debt service requirements. As of January 3, 2021, we had approximately $585.2 million of outstanding debt, and we had $295.4 million of undrawn borrowing capacity under our existing credit facility.\nThis level of debt could have significant consequences on our future operations, including:\n\u2022making it more difficult for us to meet our payment and other obligations under our outstanding debt;\n\u2022resulting in an event of default if we fail to comply with the financial and other restrictive covenants contained in our debt agreements, which event of default could result in all of our debt becoming immediately due and payable;\n\u2022reducing the availability of our cash flows to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or strategic investments and other general corporate purposes, and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes;\n\u2022subjecting us to the risk of increasing interest expense on variable rate indebtedness, including borrowings under our existing credit facility;\n\u2022limiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, and increasing our vulnerability to, changes in our business, the industry in which we operate and the general economy;\n\u2022placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or are less leveraged;\n\u2022limiting our ability to attract certain investors to purchase our common stock due to the amount of debt we have outstanding; and\n\u2022limiting our ability to refinance our existing indebtedness as it matures.\nIn addition, borrowings under our credit facility have variable interest rates, and therefore our interest expenses will increase if the underlying market rates (upon which the variable interest rates are based) increase.\nFurthermore, on July 27, 2017, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (the \u201cFCA\u201d), which regulates the London interbank offered rate (\u201cLIBOR\u201d), announced that the FCA will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. This announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR on the current basis is not guaranteed after 2021, and LIBOR may be discontinued or modified by 2021. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York began publishing the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\u201cSOFR\u201d) in April 2018 as an alternative for LIBOR. SOFR is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities. A transition away from the widespread use of LIBOR to SOFR or another benchmark rate may occur over the course of the next few years. We have exposure to LIBOR-based financial instruments, namely our existing credit facility which has variable (or floating) interest rates based on LIBOR. This facility allows for the use of an alternative benchmark rate if LIBOR is no longer available. At this time, we cannot predict the overall effect of the modification or discontinuation of LIBOR or the establishment of alternative benchmark rates.\nAny of the above-listed factors could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and our ability to meet our payment obligations under our debt.\nServicing our debt requires a significant amount of cash, and we may not have sufficient cash flow from our operations to pay our indebtedness.\nOur ability to generate cash in order to make scheduled payments of the principal of, to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness depends on our future performance, which is subject to economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. In addition, our ability to borrow funds in the future to make payments on our debt will depend on the satisfaction of the covenants in our existing credit facility and our other financing agreements, including the indenture governing the Senior Notes, and other agreements we may enter into in the future. Specifically, we will need to maintain certain financial ratios under our existing credit facility. Our business may not continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future and future borrowings may not be available to us under our existing revolving credit facility or from other sources in an amount sufficient to service our indebtedness, including the Senior Notes, to make necessary capital expenditures or to fund our other liquidity needs. If we are unable to generate cash from our operations or through borrowings, we may be required to adopt one or more alternatives, such as selling assets, restructuring debt or obtaining additional equity capital on terms that may be onerous or highly dilutive. Our ability to make payments on our indebtedness or refinance our indebtedness will depend on the capital markets and our financial condition at such time, as well as the terms of our financing agreements, including the existing credit facility, and the indenture governing the Senior Notes. We may not be able to engage in any of these activities or engage in these activities on desirable terms, which could result in a default on our debt obligations.\nWe may incur substantial additional indebtedness, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness.\nSubject to the restrictions in our existing credit facility and in the indenture governing our Senior Notes, we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur additional indebtedness in the future. Although our existing credit facility and the indenture governing the Senior Notes contain restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt, these restrictions are subject to a number of significant qualifications and exceptions, including the ability, on a non-committed basis, for us to increase revolving commitments and/or term loans under our existing credit facility, and debt incurred in compliance with these restrictions could be substantial. If new debt is added to our and our subsidiaries\u2019 existing debt levels, the related risks we now face would increase.\nRisk Factors Related to our Business and Operations\nWe compete with a large number of manufacturers in the highly competitive floorcovering products market, and some of these competitors have greater financial resources than we do. We may face challenges competing on price, making investments in our business, or competing on product design.\nThe floorcovering industry is highly competitive. Globally, we compete for sales of floorcovering products with other carpet manufacturers and manufacturers of other types of floorcovering. Although the industry has experienced significant consolidation, a large number of manufacturers remain in the industry. Moreover, some of our competitors are adding manufacturing capacity into the industry throughout the globe which could increase the amount of supply in the market. Increased capacity at our competitors could result in pricing pressure on our products (including products, like LVT, which may currently carry attractive margins) and less demand for our products, thus adversely affecting both revenues and profitability.\nSome of our competitors, including a number of large diversified domestic and foreign companies who manufacture modular carpet and resilient flooring as one segment of their business, have greater financial resources than we do. Competing effectively may require us to make additional investments in our product development efforts, manufacturing facilities, distribution network and sales and marketing activities.\nIn addition, we often compete on design preferences. Our customers\u2019 design preferences may evolve or change before we adapt quickly enough to those changes or before we recognize those changes have happened in the marketplace. If this occurs, it could negatively affect our sales as our customers choose other product offerings.\nOur success depends significantly upon the efforts, abilities and continued service of our senior management executives, our principal design consultant and other key personnel (including sales personnel), and our loss of any of them could affect us adversely.\nWe believe that our success depends to a significant extent upon the efforts and abilities of our senior management executives. In addition, we rely significantly on the leadership that David Oakey of David Oakey Designs provides to our internal design staff. Specifically, David Oakey Designs provides product design/production engineering services to us under an exclusive consulting contract that contains non-competition covenants. Our agreement with David Oakey Designs can be terminated by either party upon six months prior written notice to the other party. Our business also depends on the recruitment and retention of other key personnel, including strong sales leaders.\nWe may lose the services of key personnel for a variety of reasons, including if our compensation programs become uncompetitive in the relevant markets for our employees and service providers, or if the Company undergoes significant disruptive change (including not only economic downturns, but potentially other changes management believes are positive in the long term). The loss of key personnel with a great deal of knowledge, training and experience in the flooring industry - particularly in the areas of sales, marketing, operations, product design and management - could have an adverse impact on our business. We may not be able to easily replace such personnel, particularly if the underlying reasons for the loss make the Company relatively unattractive as an employer.\nWe are implementing a multi-year transformation of our sales organization, including the implementation of standardized processes in which our sales force goes to market, interacts with customers, works with the architect and design community and, in general, operates day-to-day. We are also implementing technology tools that the sales force will be required to use as part of their day-to-day jobs, and new management positions to actively manage and coach the sales force. All of these changes are disruptive, which may create challenges for our sales force to adapt, particularly for long tenured employees, which comprise a large portion of our sales force. There are no guarantees that these efforts will increase sales or improve profitability of the business, or that they will not instead adversely disrupt the business, decrease sales, and decrease overall profitability.\nLarge increases in the cost of our raw materials, shipping costs, duties or tariffs could adversely affect us if we are unable to pass these cost increases through to our customers.\nPetroleum-based products comprise the predominant portion of the cost of raw materials that we use in manufacturing carpet. Synthetic rubber uses petroleum based products as feedstock as well. We also incur significant shipping and transport costs to move our products around the globe. While we attempt to match cost increases with corresponding price increases, continued volatility in the cost of raw materials, transportation and shipping costs could adversely affect our financial results if we are unable to pass through such cost increases to our customers.\nUnanticipated termination or interruption of any of our arrangements with our primary third party suppliers of synthetic fiber or our sole third party supplier for luxury vinyl tile (\u201cLVT\u201d) could have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe depend on a small number of third-party suppliers of synthetic fiber and a single supplier for our LVT products. The unanticipated termination or interruption of any of our supply arrangements with our current suppliers of synthetic fiber (nylon) or sole supplier of LVT, including failure by any third party supplier to meet our product specifications, could have a material adverse effect on us because we do not have the capability to manufacture our own fiber for use in our carpet products or our own LVT. Our suppliers may not be able to meet our demand for a variety of reasons, including our inability to forecast our future needs accurately or a shortfall in production by the supplier for reasons unrelated to us, such as work stoppages, acts of war, terrorism, pandemics, fire, earthquake, energy shortages, flooding or other natural disasters. The primary manufacturing facility of our sole supplier of LVT is located in South Korea. If any of our supply arrangements with our primary suppliers of synthetic fiber or our sole supplier of LVT is terminated or interrupted, we likely would incur increased manufacturing costs and experience delays in our manufacturing process (thus resulting in decreased sales and profitability) associated with shifting more of our synthetic fiber purchasing to another synthetic fiber supplier or developing new supply chain sources for LVT. A prolonged inability on our part to source synthetic fiber included in our products or LVT on a cost-effective basis could adversely impact our ability to deliver products on a timely basis, which could harm our sales and customer relationships.\nIf we fail to realize the expected synergies and other benefits of the nora acquisition, our results of operations and stock price may be negatively affected.\nIn 2018, we completed the acquisition of nora, a manufacturer and multinational marketer of resilient rubber floor coverings. The success of the acquisition will depend substantially on our ability to realize the expected synergies and other benefits from combining the Company\u2019s legacy business and nora. Our ability to realize these anticipated benefits and cost savings is subject to various risks and uncertainties, including the risks that:\n\u2022we may not be able to successfully combine and integrate the businesses on a timely basis, or at all;\n\u2022the integration process could divert management\u2019s attention, cause employee or customer attrition or cause other disruption;\n\u2022nora may not contribute to the revenues and profitability of the combined business as much as we currently expect; and\n\u2022we may not be able to manage the increased indebtedness we have incurred in connection with the acquisition.\nIf we are not able to successfully combine the businesses within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the expected synergies and other benefits of the transaction may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected, the combined businesses may not perform as expected and the results of our operations or value of our common stock may be adversely affected.\nIt is also possible that the integration process could result in the loss of key employees or customers of the Company or nora, the disruption of the companies\u2019 ongoing businesses or unexpected integration issues, higher than expected integration costs and an overall integration process that takes longer than originally anticipated.\nWe will be required to devote significant management attention and resources to integrating the Company\u2019s legacy operations and nora. It is possible that the integration process could result in:\n\u2022diversion of management\u2019s attention;\n\u2022the lack of personnel or other resources to pursue other potential business opportunities; and\n\u2022the disruption of, or the loss of momentum in, each company\u2019s ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies.\nAny of these consequences could adversely affect each company\u2019s ability to maintain relationships with customers, suppliers, employees and other constituencies or their ability to achieve the anticipated benefits of the transaction, or could reduce each company\u2019s earnings or otherwise adversely affect the business and financial results of the combined company and the value of our common stock.\nThe market price of our common stock has been volatile and the value of your investment may decline.\nThe market price of our common stock has been volatile in the past and may continue to be volatile going forward. Such volatility may cause precipitous drops in the price of our common stock on the Nasdaq Global Select Market and may cause your investment in our common stock to lose significant value. As a general matter, market price volatility has had a significant effect on the market values of securities issued by many companies for reasons unrelated to their operating performance. We thus cannot predict the market price for our common stock going forward.\nChanges to our facilities, manufacturing processes, product construction, and product composition could disrupt our operations, increase customer complaints, increase warranty claims, negatively affect our reputation, and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nFrom time to time, we make improvements to our physical facilities, or move operations to new ones. Large scale changes or moves could disrupt our normal operations, leading to possible loss of productivity, which may adversely affect our results. We are also making significant investments and modifications to our manufacturing facilities, processes, product compositions, and product construction including but not limited to the production of our new CQuest\u2122 carpet tile backings. These changes can be disruptive. There is also no guarantee that our CQuest\u2122 backings will not fail to perform as expected and will not increase warranty claims or customer complaints. These efforts may also not yield the financial returns and improvements in the business that we hope to achieve from them. While these changes are intended to yield stronger financial results, they could potentially impact our financial results in negative ways due to project delays, business disruption as new facilities and equipment come online, increase customer complaints, or increase warranty claims; all of which could negatively affect our operations, reputation, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business operations could suffer significant losses from natural disasters, catastrophes, fire, pandemics or other unexpected events.\nWhile we manufacture our products in several facilities and maintain insurance covering our facilities, including business interruption insurance, our manufacturing facilities could be materially damaged by natural disasters, such as floods, tornadoes, hurricanes and earthquakes, or by fire or other unexpected events such as adverse weather conditions, pandemics or other public health crises (such as the COVID-19 pandemic described above), or other disruptions to our facilities, supply chain or our customers\u2019 facilities. We could incur uninsured losses and liabilities arising from such events, including damage to our reputation, and suffer material losses in operational capacity, which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDisruptions to or failures of our information technology systems could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely heavily on information technology systems-both software and computer hardware-to operate our business. We rely on these systems to, among other things:\n\u2022facilitate and plan the purchase, management and distribution of, and payment for, inventory and raw materials;\n\u2022control our production processes;\n\u2022manage and monitor our distribution network and logistics;\n\u2022receive, process and ship orders;\n\u2022manage billing, collections and payables;\n\u2022manage financial reporting; and\n\u2022manage payroll and human resources information.\nOur IT systems may be disrupted or fail for a number of reasons, including:\n\u2022natural disasters, like fires;\n\u2022power loss;\n\u2022software \u201cbugs\u201d, hardware defects or human error; and\n\u2022hacking, computer viruses, malware, ransomware, phishing scams, or other cyber attacks.\nAny of these events which deny us use of vital IT systems may seriously disrupt our normal business operations. These disruptions may lead to production or shipping stoppages, which may in turn lead to material revenue loss and reputational harm. There is no guarantee that our backup systems or disaster recovery procedures will be adequate to mitigate losses due to IT system disruptions in a timely fashion, and we may incur significant expense in correcting IT system emergencies.\nTo the extent our IT systems store sensitive data, including about our employees or other individuals, security breaches may expose us to other serious liabilities and reputational harm if such data is misappropriated. In addition, as cybercriminals continue to become more sophisticated, the costs to defend and insure against cyberattacks can be expected to rise.\nLegal Risk Factors\nWe face risks associated with litigation and claims.\nWe have been, and may in the future become, party to lawsuits including, without limitation, actions and proceedings in the ordinary course of business, such as claims brought by our customers in connection with commercial disputes, employment claims made by our current or former employees, or claims relating to intellectual property matters. Litigation might result in substantial costs and may divert management\u2019s attention and resources, which may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. An unfavorable judgment against us in any legal proceeding or claim could require us to pay monetary damages. Insurance might not cover such claims, might not provide sufficient payments to cover all the costs to resolve one or more such claims, and might not continue to be available on terms acceptable to us. In addition, an unfavorable judgment in which the counterparty is awarded equitable relief, such as an injunction, could harm our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nPlease refer to Item 3, \u201cLegal Proceedings,\u201d within this Report for additional information related to litigation and claims.", "PERMNO": 44768, "SIC": 2273, "TIC": "TILE"}
