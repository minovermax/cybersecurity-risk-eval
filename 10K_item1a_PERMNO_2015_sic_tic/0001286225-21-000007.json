Risk Factors.\nSummary of Risk Factors\nBelow is a summary of the principal factors that make an investment in our common stock speculative or risky. This summary does not address all the risks we face. Additional discussion of the risks summarized in this risk factor summary and other risks that we face, can be found below under the heading \u201cRisk Factors\u201d and should be carefully considered, together with other information in this Annual Report and our other filings with the SEC, before making an investment decision regarding our common stock.\nFinancial Risks Related to Our Business\n\u2022The COVID-19 pandemic and its effects could adversely impact our business, results of operations, liquidity and financial condition, and the magnitude and timing of such impact is highly uncertain and difficult to predict.\n\u2022If we are unable to continue to manage the growth of our diverse and complex operations, our financial performance may suffer.\n\u2022Because we recognize subscription revenue over the term of the applicable client agreement, a decline in subscription renewals or new service agreements may not be reflected immediately in our operating results.\n\u2022Transactions relating to our Convertible Notes may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\n\u2022If we are not able to integrate past or future acquisitions successfully, our operating results and prospects could be harmed.\n\u2022Variability in our sales and activation cycles could result in fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations and cause our stock price to decline.\n\u2022Many of our clients are price sensitive, and if market dynamics require us to change our pricing model or reduce prices, our operating results will be harmed.\n\u2022Economic trends that affect the rental housing market may have a negative effect on our business.\n\u2022We may require additional capital to support business growth or acquisitions, and this capital might not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all.\n\u2022A significant decline in our cash flow could impair our ability to make payments under our debt obligations.\n\u2022We generate commission revenue from the insurance policies we sell as a registered insurance agent, and if insurance premiums decline or if the insureds experience greater than expected losses, our revenues could decline and our operating results could be harmed.\nOperational Risks Related to Our Business\n\u2022The nature of our platform is complex and highly integrated, and if we fail to successfully manage releases or integrate new solutions, it could harm our revenues, operating income and reputation.\n\u2022Our business depends substantially on the renewal of our products and services for on demand units managed by our clients and the increase in the use of our on demand products and services for on demand units.\n\u2022We may not be able to continue to add new clients and retain and increase sales to our existing clients, which could adversely affect our operating results.\n\u2022If we are unable to successfully develop or acquire and sell enhancements and new solutions, our revenue growth will be harmed, and we may not be able to meet profitability expectations.\n\u2022Any disruption of service at our data centers or other facilities could interrupt or delay our clients\u2019 access to our solutions, which could harm our operating results.\n\u2022Interruptions or delays in service from our third-party data center providers could impair our ability to deliver certain of our products to our clients, resulting in client dissatisfaction, damage to our reputation, loss of clients, limited growth and reduction in revenue.\n\u2022We provide service level commitments to our clients, and our failure to meet the stated service levels could significantly harm our revenue and our reputation.\n\u2022Material defects or errors in the software we use to deliver our solutions could harm our reputation, result in significant costs to us and impair our ability to sell our solutions.\n\u2022Failure to effectively manage the development, sale and support of our solutions and data processing efforts outside the United States could harm our business.\n\u2022We rely on third-party technologies and services that may be difficult to replace or that could cause errors, failures or disruptions of our service, or introduce supply chain vulnerabilities, any of which could harm our business.\n\u2022We depend upon third-party service providers for important payment processing functions. If these third-party service providers do not fulfill their contractual obligations or choose to discontinue their services, our business and operations could be disrupted, and our operating results would be harmed.\n\u2022If our security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to our software platform, service infrastructure, or our clients\u2019 or their renters\u2019 or prospects\u2019 data, we may incur significant liabilities, third parties may misappropriate our intellectual property or financial assets, our solutions may be perceived as not being secure and clients may curtail or stop using our solutions.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks Related to Our Business\n\u2022We face a number of risks in our payment processing business that could result in a reduction in our revenues and profits.\n\u2022Evolution and expansion of our payment processing business may subject us to additional regulatory requirements and other risks, with respect to which failure to comply or adapt could harm our operating results.\n\u2022Because certain solutions we provide depend on access to client data, decreased access to this data or the failure to comply with the evolving laws and regulations governing privacy of data, cloud computing and cross-border data transfers, or the failure to address privacy concerns applicable to such data, could harm our business.\n\u2022Assertions by a third party that we infringe its intellectual property, whether successful or not, could subject us to costly and time-consuming litigation or expensive licenses.\n\u2022The rental housing industry, electronic commerce and many of the products and services that we offer, including background screening services, utility billing, affordable housing compliance and audit services, insurance and payments are subject to extensive and evolving governmental regulation. Changes in regulations or our failure to comply with regulations could harm our operating results.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Common Stock\n\u2022The concentration of our capital stock owned by insiders may limit your ability to influence corporate matters.\n\u2022The Capped Calls, Note Hedges and Warrant transactions may affect the value of our common stock.\n\u2022The Merger is subject to receipt of approval from our stockholders as well as the satisfaction of other closing conditions in the Merger Agreement.\n\u2022The announcement and pendency of our agreement to be acquired by funds affiliated with Thoma Bravo may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.\n\u2022The failure to complete the Merger may adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and stock price.\nFinancial Risks Related to Our Business\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and its effects could adversely impact our business, results of operations, liquidity and financial condition, and the magnitude and timing of such impact is highly uncertain and difficult to predict.\nGlobal health concerns from the COVID-19 pandemic and related government actions have caused significant disruption to the global economic environment. The pandemic has significantly increased economic uncertainty and reduced economic activity, including consumer and business spending, and leasing velocity within the rental housing industry. In response to the pandemic, government authorities have implemented numerous measures designed to contain the spread of the disease, including travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place and lockdown orders, and business limitations and shutdowns. Federal and state governments have also taken actions and provided stimulus to address the adverse economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on businesses and individuals, such as unemployment assistance, business loan programs and other measures. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact our operations and financial condition will depend upon future developments which are uncertain and difficult to predict, including the scope, severity and duration of the pandemic and the success of the actions taken to contain the pandemic and mitigate its impact.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is adversely impacting residents of rental properties and their ability or willingness to fully meet their obligations to our customers, which in turn may adversely impact our customers\u2019 ability or willingness to meet their obligations to us or may cause them to otherwise seek modifications to their obligations to us. Delays or failures by government entities in extending economic stimulus and support programs designed to assist individuals and businesses, or delays or failures in modifying such programs to successfully mitigate the hardships caused by the pandemic, could adversely impact residents and businesses who rely upon these programs, and their ability or willingness to meet their obligations to our customers. The impact of any such developments could result in increases in uncollectible receivables or delays in payment to us by our customers. These conditions could also adversely affect the rate of overall technology spending and influence the timing of our customers\u2019 and prospective customers\u2019 technology purchasing and implementation decisions, which could adversely affect their ability or willingness to purchase our solutions, delay purchasing decisions, reduce the value or duration of subscriptions, negatively affect our renewal rates and churn, negatively affect certain of our products associated with leasing velocity such as but not limited to screening, renters insurance, and payments, or result in a decrease in the number of end users of our solutions or the transactions performed using our solutions, any of which could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition on a short-term or longer-term basis.\nTo support the health and wellbeing of our employees, customers, partners and communities and in compliance with governmental restrictive orders in the locations in which we have offices, a significant majority of our employees are currently working remotely. Although such changes did not have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results for the year ended December 31, 2020 and we have been able to effectively operate and provide services and meet our obligations to our customers, if we are not able to continue to respond to and manage these impacts and related changes, our business, results of operations, liquidity and financial condition could be adversely impacted. Furthermore, remote work and the use of our business continuity plans over an extended period could impair or delay our ability to sell our solutions, adversely impact our product development and harm productivity and collaboration. We may also take further actions as may be required by government authorities or as we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers and business partners which could adversely impact our business.\nMany of our customers and vendors are also working remotely, which may delay the timing of orders, implementations, or deliveries. The disruptions to our operations caused by the COVID-19 pandemic may result in inefficiencies, delays and additional costs in our product development, sales, marketing and customer service efforts that we cannot fully mitigate due to the current economic conditions or other unpredictable aspects of the pandemic on our customers and vendors.\nThe pandemic also raises the possibility of an extended global economic downturn, and there has been significant volatility in the financial markets. As a result, our results and financial condition could adversely be impacted even after the pandemic is mitigated or contained and governmental restrictions are suspended or terminated. For example, our customers may continue to experience economic pressures and we may be unable to collect receivables from customers impacted by COVID-19, or such customers may request alternative payment structures that could adversely impact our results. A decrease in orders in a given period could also negatively impact our revenues in future periods because a substantial portion of our services generate revenue recognized over time. Moreover, we may experience materially adverse impacts as a result of the global economic impact, including reduced spending, lower economic activity and weakened banking and financial systems.\nOther factors related to the COVID-19 pandemic that may adversely impact our business operations include:\n\u2022service interruptions or impaired system performance due to failures of or delays in our systems or resources;\n\u2022the possibility that one or more clusters of COVID-19 cases could occur at one of our locations, data centers or other third-party providers, affecting our employees or affecting the systems or employees of our customers or other third parties on which we depend; or\n\u2022challenges to our systems supporting our remote workforce, due to the higher demand on such systems and the hardware needed to support such working conditions.\nThere are no comparable recent events that provide guidance as to the effect the spread of COVID-19 as a global pandemic may have, and, as a result, the ultimate impact of the pandemic is highly uncertain and subject to change. We do not yet know the full extent of the impacts on our business, our operations or the global economy. The pandemic may have the effect of increasing the severity and likelihood of the risks described herein.\nOur quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and may fluctuate in the future, which could cause our stock price to decline.\nOur quarterly operating results may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors, many of which are outside of our control. Fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may be due to a number of factors, including the risks and uncertainties discussed elsewhere in this filing. Some of the important factors that could cause our revenues and operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter include:\n\u2022the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, our customers, and the general economic impact of the pandemic in the short and longer term;\n\u2022general economic, industry and market conditions in the rental housing industry that impact our current and potential clients, including the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022the extent to which on demand software solutions maintain market acceptance;\n\u2022fluctuations in leasing activity by our clients;\n\u2022our ability to timely introduce enhancements to our existing solutions and new solutions;\n\u2022our ability to renew the use of our on demand solutions for units managed by our existing clients and to increase the use of our on demand solutions for the management of units by our existing and new clients;\n\u2022changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors or new competitors;\n\u2022the variable nature of our sales and implementation cycles;\n\u2022our ability to anticipate and adapt to external forces and the emergence of new technologies and products;\n\u2022our ability to enter into new markets and capture additional market share;\n\u2022our ability to integrate acquisitions in a cost-effective and timely manner;\n\u2022the timing of revenue and expenses related to recent and potential acquisitions or dispositions of businesses or technologies;\n\u2022changes in local economic, political and regulatory environments of our international operations including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022the amount and timing of our investment in research and development activities;\n\u2022technical difficulties, service interruptions, data or document losses or security breaches;\n\u2022our ability to hire and retain qualified key personnel, including particular key positions in our sales force and IT department;\n\u2022changes in the legal, regulatory or compliance environment related to the rental housing industry or the markets in which we operate, including without limitation changes related to fair credit reporting, payment processing, data protection and privacy, utility billing, insurance, the Internet and e-commerce, licensing, telemarketing, electronic communications, consumer protection, the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (\u201cHIPAA\u201d), the Health Information Technology Economic and Clinical Health Act (\u201cHITECH\u201d), and state and local laws related to rent control or regulation;\n\u2022the amount and timing of operating expenses and capital expenditures related to the expansion of our operations and infrastructure;\n\u2022increase in the number or severity of insurance claims on policies sold by us;\n\u2022litigation and settlement costs, including unforeseen costs;\n\u2022new accounting pronouncements and changes in accounting standards or practices, particularly any affecting the recognition of subscription revenue or accounting for mergers and acquisitions; and\n\u2022changes in tax policy in the United States and globally that affect the deductibility of certain expenses and how our profits are taxed.\nFluctuations in our quarterly operating results or guidance that we provide may lead analysts to change their long-term models for valuing our common stock, cause us to face short-term liquidity issues, impact our ability to retain or attract key personnel or cause other unanticipated issues, all of which could cause our stock price to decline. As a result of the potential variations in our quarterly revenue and operating results, we believe that quarter-to-quarter and year-to-date period comparisons of our revenues and operating results may not be meaningful and the results of any one quarter should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance.\nIf we are unable to continue to manage the growth of our diverse and complex operations, our financial performance may suffer.\nThe growth in the size, dispersed geographic locations, complexity and diversity of our business and the expansion of our product lines and client base has placed, and our anticipated growth may continue to place, a significant strain on our managerial, administrative, operational, financial and other resources. We had approximately 7,600 employees and over 31,700 on demand clients as of December 31, 2020. We expect to continue to experience growth, including through acquisitions. Our ability to effectively manage our anticipated future growth will depend on, among other things, the following:\n\u2022successfully supporting and maintaining a broad range of current and emerging solutions;\n\u2022identifying suitable acquisition targets and efficiently managing the closing of acquisitions and the integration of targets into our operations;\n\u2022maintaining continuity in our senior management and key personnel;\n\u2022attracting, retaining, training and motivating our employees, particularly technical, client service and sales personnel;\n\u2022enhancing our financial and accounting systems and controls;\n\u2022enhancing our information technology infrastructure, processes and controls;\n\u2022successfully completing system upgrades and enhancements; and\n\u2022managing expanded operations in geographically dispersed locations.\nIf we do not manage the size, complexity and diverse nature of our business effectively, we could experience product performance issues, delayed software releases and longer response times for assisting our clients with implementation of our solutions and could lack adequate resources to support our clients on an ongoing basis, any of which could adversely affect our reputation in the market and our ability to generate revenue from new or existing clients.\nBecause we recognize subscription revenue over the term of the applicable client agreement, a decline in subscription renewals or new service agreements may not be reflected immediately in our operating results.\nWe generally recognize revenue from clients ratably over the terms of their client agreements, which are typically for a period of one or more years. As a result, much of the revenue we report in each quarter is deferred revenue from client agreements entered into during previous quarters. Consequently, a decline in new or renewed client agreements in any one quarter will not be fully reflected in our revenue or our results of operations until future periods. Accordingly, this revenue recognition model also makes it difficult for us to rapidly increase our revenue through additional sales in any period, as revenue from new clients must be recognized over the applicable subscription term.\nTransactions relating to our Convertible Notes may adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nHolders of the Convertible Notes are entitled to convert the Convertible Notes under certain conditions for specified periods at their option prior to the scheduled maturities of the Convertible Notes. When holders elect to convert their Convertible Notes, unless we elect to satisfy our conversion obligations by delivering solely shares of our common stock (other than paying cash in lieu of delivering any fractional share), we are required to settle a portion or all of our conversion obligations through the payment of cash, which could adversely affect our liquidity. In addition, even if holders do not elect to convert their Convertible Notes, we could be required under applicable accounting rules to reclassify all or a portion of the outstanding principals of the Convertible Notes as a current rather than long-term liability, which would result in a material reduction of our net working capital.\nThe accounting method for convertible debt securities that may be settled in cash, such as the Convertible Notes, could have a material effect on our reported financial results.\nIn May 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\u201cFASB\u201d) issued FASB Staff Position No. APB 14-1, Accounting for Convertible Debt Instruments That May Be Settled in Cash Upon Conversion (Including Partial Cash Settlement), which has subsequently been codified as Accounting Standards Codification 470-20, Debt with Conversion and Other Options, which we refer to as ASC 470-20. Under ASC 470-20, an entity must separately account for the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments, such as the Convertible Notes, that may be settled entirely or partially in cash upon conversion in a manner that reflects the issuer\u2019s economic interest cost. The effect of ASC 470-20 on the accounting\nfor the Convertible Notes is that the equity components are required to be included in the additional paid-in capital section of stockholders\u2019 equity on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and the value of the equity components are treated as original issue discounts for purposes of accounting for the debt components of the Convertible Notes. As a result, we are required to record a greater amount of non-cash interest expense in current periods presented as a result of the amortization of the discounted carrying values of the Convertible Notes to their face amounts over the terms of the Convertible Notes. This adversely affects our reported financial results and could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock.\nIn addition, under certain circumstances, convertible debt instruments, such as the Convertible Notes, that may be settled entirely or partly in cash are currently accounted for utilizing the treasury stock method, the effect of which is that the shares issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Notes are not included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share except to the extent that the conversion value of the Convertible Notes exceeds their principal amounts. Under the treasury stock method, for diluted earnings per share purposes, the transaction is accounted for as if the number of shares of common stock that would be necessary to settle such excess, if we elected to settle such excess in shares, are issued.\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging - Contracts in Entity\u2019s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity\u2019s Own Equity. This ASU will eliminate the requirement described above to separate convertible notes into debt and equity components, instead allowing for these instruments to be accounted for as a single liability measured at its amortized cost. Furthermore, this ASU will require the use of the if-converted method when determined diluted earnings per share. These changes, once adopted, will reduce our reported interest expense and increase our reported net income when compared to our results calculated under existing accounting guidance. This standard may adversely impact our reported diluted shares outstanding and our diluted earnings per share in certain periods because of the required use of the if-converted method. ASU 2020-06 will be effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, with early adoption permitted for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2020. We currently expect to adopt this ASU effective January 1, 2022 and are still assessing our method of adoption.\nIf we are not able to integrate past or future acquisitions successfully, our operating results and prospects could be harmed.\nWe have acquired new technology and domain expertise through multiple acquisitions, including our most recent acquisitions of WhiteSky, Chirp, Stratis, Modern Message, Buildium, IMS, Simple Bills, Hipercept, and LeaseTerm Solutions. We expect to continue making acquisitions in the future. The success of our future acquisition strategy will depend on our ability to identify, negotiate, complete and integrate acquisitions. Acquisitions are inherently risky, and any acquisitions we complete may not be successful. Any acquisitions we pursue involve numerous risks, including the following:\n\u2022difficulties in integrating and managing the operations and technologies of the companies we acquire;\n\u2022diversion of our management\u2019s attention from normal daily operations of our business;\n\u2022our inability to maintain the clients, the key employees, the key business relationships and the reputations of the businesses we acquire;\n\u2022our inability to generate sufficient revenue from acquisitions to offset our increased expenses associated with acquisitions;\n\u2022difficulties in predicting or achieving the synergies between acquired businesses and our own businesses;\n\u2022our responsibility for the liabilities of the businesses we acquire, including, without limitation, liabilities arising out of their failure to maintain effective data security, data integrity, disaster recovery and privacy controls prior to the acquisition, or their infringement or alleged infringement of third-party intellectual property, contract or data access rights prior to the acquisition;\n\u2022difficulties in complying with new markets or regulatory standards to which we were not previously subject;\n\u2022delays in our ability to implement internal standards, controls, procedures and policies in the businesses we acquire; and\n\u2022adverse effects of acquisition activity on the key performance indicators we use to monitor our performance.\nOur current acquisition strategy includes the acquisition of complementary businesses, products, and solutions. In order to integrate and fully realize the benefits of such acquisitions, we expect to build application interfaces that enable such clients to use a wide range of our solutions while they continue to use their legacy management systems. In addition, over time we expect to migrate certain of our acquired companies\u2019 clients to our on demand property management solutions to retain them as clients and to be in a position to offer them our solutions on a cost-effective basis. These efforts may be unsuccessful or entail costs that result in losses or reduced profitability.\nUnanticipated events and circumstances occurring in future periods may affect the realizability of our intangible assets obtained through acquisitions. The events and circumstances that we consider include significant under-performance relative to projected future operating results and significant changes in our overall business or product strategies. These events and\ncircumstances may cause us to revise our estimates and assumptions used in analyzing the value of our other intangible assets with indefinite lives, and any such revision could result in a non-cash impairment charge that could have a material impact on our financial results.\nWe may be unable to secure the equity or debt funding necessary to finance future acquisitions on terms that are acceptable to us, or at all. If we finance acquisitions by issuing equity or convertible debt securities, our existing stockholders will likely experience ownership dilution, and if we finance future acquisitions with debt funding, we will incur interest expense and may have to comply with additional financing covenants or secure that debt obligation with our assets.\nVariability in our sales and activation cycles could result in fluctuations in our quarterly results of operations and cause our stock price to decline.\nThe sales and activation cycles for our solutions, from initial contact with a prospective client to contract execution and activation, vary widely by client and solution. We do not recognize revenue until the solution is activated. While most of our activations follow a set of standard procedures, a client\u2019s priorities or other factors may delay activation and our ability to recognize revenue, which could result in fluctuations in our quarterly operating results. Additionally, certain of our products are offered in suites containing multiple solutions, resulting in additional fluctuation in activations depending on each client\u2019s priorities and our own processes related to solutions included in the suite. The COVID-19 pandemic could also adversely affect the rate of technology spending and demand for our solutions, and delay or otherwise influence the timing of purchasing decisions and sales and activation cycles by our existing or prospective customers.\nMany of our clients are price sensitive, and if market dynamics require us to change our pricing model or reduce prices, our operating results will be harmed.\nMany of our existing and potential clients are price sensitive, and uncertain global economic conditions, as well as decreased leasing velocity, have contributed to increased price sensitivity in the multifamily housing market and the other markets that we serve. As market dynamics change, or as new and existing competitors introduce more competitive pricing or pricing models, we may be unable to renew our agreements with existing clients or clients of the businesses we acquire or attract new clients at the same price or based on the same pricing model as previously used. As a result, it is possible that we may be required to change our pricing model, offer price incentives or reduce our prices, which could harm our revenue, profitability and operating results.\nEconomic trends that affect the rental housing market may have a negative effect on our business.\nOur clients include a range of organizations whose success is closely linked to the rental housing market. Economic trends that negatively or positively affect the rental housing market or the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may adversely affect our business. Instability or downturns affecting the rental housing market may have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations by:\n\u2022decreasing demand for leasing and marketing solutions;\n\u2022reducing the number of occupied sites and units on which we earn revenue;\n\u2022preventing our clients from expanding their businesses and managing new properties;\n\u2022causing our clients to reduce spending on our solutions;\n\u2022subjecting us to increased pricing pressure in order to add new clients and retain existing clients;\n\u2022causing our clients to switch to lower-priced solutions provided by our competitors or internally developed solutions;\n\u2022delaying or preventing our collection of outstanding accounts receivable; and\n\u2022causing payment processing losses related to an increase in client insolvency.\nIn addition, economic trends that reduce the frequency of renter turnover or the quantity of new renters may reduce the number of rental transactions completed by our clients and may, as a result, reduce demand for our rental, leasing or marketing transaction specific services. The economic effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on the rental housing industry could provide further pressure on our customers who rely upon residents for rental and other payments and leasing activity through which they earn revenue.\nWe may require additional capital to support business growth or acquisitions, and this capital might not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all.\nWe intend to continue to make investments to support our business growth and may require additional funds to respond to business challenges or opportunities, including the need to develop new solutions or enhance our existing solutions, enhance our operating infrastructure or acquire businesses and technologies. Accordingly, we may need to engage in equity or debt financings to secure additional funds. If we raise additional funds through further issuances of equity or convertible debt\nsecurities, our existing stockholders could suffer significant ownership dilution, and any new equity securities we issue could have rights, preferences and privileges superior to those of holders of our common stock. In May 2020, we consummated an underwritten public offering of 5.85 million shares of our common stock, with total gross proceeds of $345.0 million. We concurrently issued convertible senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of $345.0 million. In the third quarter of 2019, we entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the \u201cAmended Credit Facility\u201d), and we had also entered into an amendment to our prior credit facility in the first quarter of 2018, each of which increased our borrowing capacity. Future debt financing could increase our interest expense and could involve additional restrictive covenants relating to our capital raising activities and other financial and operational matters, which may make it more difficult for us to obtain additional capital and to pursue business opportunities, including potential acquisitions. In addition, we may not be able to obtain additional financing on terms favorable to us, if at all. If we are unable to obtain adequate financing or financing on terms satisfactory to us when we require it, our ability to continue to support our business growth and to respond to business challenges or opportunities could be significantly limited.\nOur Amended Credit Facility contains restrictions that impact our business and expose us to risks that could adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition.\nAll of our obligations under the Amended Credit Facility are secured by substantially all of our assets. All of our existing and future domestic subsidiaries are required to guarantee our obligations under the Amended Credit Facility, other than certain immaterial subsidiaries, foreign subsidiary holding companies and our payment processing subsidiaries. Such guarantees by existing and future domestic subsidiaries are and will be secured by substantially all of the assets of such subsidiaries.\nOur Amended Credit Facility contains customary covenants, subject in each case to customary exceptions and qualifications, which limit our and certain of our subsidiaries\u2019 ability to, among other things:\n\u2022incur additional indebtedness or guarantee indebtedness of others;\n\u2022create liens on our assets;\n\u2022enter into mergers or consolidations;\n\u2022dispose of assets;\n\u2022prepay certain indebtedness;\n\u2022make changes to our governing documents and certain of our agreements;\n\u2022pay dividends and make other distributions on our capital stock, and redeem and repurchase our capital stock;\n\u2022make investments, including acquisitions; and\n\u2022enter into transactions with affiliates.\nOur Amended Credit Facility also contains, subject in each case to customary exceptions and qualifications, customary affirmative covenants. We are also required to comply with a maximum Consolidated Net Leverage Ratio, a maximum Consolidated Senior Secured Net Leverage Ratio, and a minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio. See additional discussion of these requirements in Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements under Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As of December 31, 2020, we were in compliance with all of the covenants under our Amended Credit Facility.\nThe Amended Credit Facility contains customary events of default, subject to customary cure periods for certain defaults, that include, among others, non-payment defaults, covenant defaults, material judgment defaults, bankruptcy and insolvency defaults, cross-defaults to certain other material indebtedness, ERISA defaults, inaccuracy of representations and warranties and a change in control default.\nEven if we comply with all of the applicable covenants, the restrictions on the conduct of our business could adversely affect our business by, among other things, limiting our ability to take advantage of financings, mergers, acquisitions and other corporate opportunities that may be beneficial to the business. Even if the Amended Credit Facility was terminated, additional debt we could incur in the future may subject us to similar or additional covenants.\nA significant decline in our cash flow could impair our ability to make payments under our debt obligations.\nIf we experience a decline in cash flow due to any of the factors described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section or otherwise, we could have difficulty paying interest and principal amounts due on our indebtedness and meeting the financial covenants set forth in our Amended Credit Facility. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or otherwise obtain the funds necessary to make required payments under our Amended Credit Facility or the respective indentures from the 2022 and 2025 Convertible Notes, or if we fail to comply with the requirements of our indebtedness, we could default under our Amended Credit Facility or respective Convertible Notes indentures. Any default that is not cured or waived could result in the termination of the revolving commitments, the acceleration of the obligations under the Amended Credit Facility or respective Convertible Notes indentures, an increase in the applicable interest rate under the Amended Credit Facility and a requirement that our subsidiaries that have guaranteed the Amended Credit Facility pay the obligations in full, and would permit our lenders to exercise remedies\nwith respect to all of the collateral that is securing the Amended Credit Facility, including substantially all of our and our subsidiary guarantors\u2019 assets. Any such default could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and financial condition.\nIf we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired, which could harm our operating results, our ability to operate our business and investors\u2019 views of us.\nEnsuring that we have adequate internal financial and accounting controls and procedures so that we can produce accurate financial statements on a timely basis is a costly and time-consuming effort that needs to be re-evaluated frequently. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. We are required to comply with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, or the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which requires annual management assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and a report by our independent auditors. As of September 30, 2019, we identified a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting which was disclosed in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2019. The material weakness resulted from certain individual control deficiencies related to our information technology general controls (\u201cITGCs\u201d) that, when viewed in combination, aggregated to a material weakness. This material weakness was remediated during the quarter ended June 30, 2020.\nIf we fail to maintain proper and effective internal controls in the future, our ability to produce accurate and timely financial statements could be impaired, which could harm our operating results, harm our ability to operate our business and reduce the trading price of our stock.\nWe generate commission revenue from the insurance policies we sell as a registered insurance agent, and if insurance premiums decline or if the insureds experience greater than expected losses, our revenues could decline and our operating results could be harmed.\nThrough our wholly owned subsidiaries, we generate commission revenue from offering liability and renter\u2019s insurance. We also sell additional insurance products, including auto and other personal lines insurance, to renters that buy renter's insurance from us. These policies are ultimately underwritten by various insurance carriers. Some of the property owners and managers that participate in our programs opt to require renters to purchase rental insurance policies and agree to grant to us exclusive marketing rights at their properties. If demand for residential rental housing declines, property owners and managers may be forced to reduce their rental rates and to stop requiring the purchase of rental insurance in order to reduce the overall cost of renting. If property owners or managers cease to require renter's insurance, elect to offer policies from competing providers or insurance premiums decline, our revenues from selling insurance policies will be adversely affected.\nAdditionally, one type of commission paid by insurance carriers to us is contingent commission, which is affected by claims experienced at the properties for which the renters purchase insurance. In the event that the severity or frequency of claims by the insureds increase unexpectedly, the contingent commission we typically earn will be adversely affected. As a result, our quarterly, or annual, operating results could fall below the expectations of analysts or investors, in which event our stock price may decline.\nOperational Risks Related to Our Business\nThe nature of our platform is complex and highly integrated, and if we fail to successfully manage releases or integrate new solutions, it could harm our revenues, operating income and reputation.\nWe manage a complex platform of solutions that consists of our property management solutions, integrated software-enabled value-added services and advertising and lease generation services. Many of our solutions include a large number of product centers that are highly integrated and require interoperability with other RealPage, Inc. products, as well as products and services of third-party service providers. Additionally, we typically deploy new releases of the software underlying our on demand software solutions on a bi-weekly, monthly or quarterly schedule, depending on the solution. Due to this complexity and the condensed development cycles under which we operate, we may experience errors in our software, corruption or loss of our data or unexpected performance issues from time to time. For example, our solutions may face interoperability difficulties with software operating systems or programs being used by our clients, or new releases, upgrades, fixes or the integration of acquired technologies may have unanticipated consequences on the operation and performance of our other solutions. If we encounter integration challenges or discover errors in our solutions late in our development cycle, it may cause us to delay our launch dates. Any major integration or interoperability issues or launch delays could have a material adverse effect on our revenues, operating income and reputation.\nOur business depends substantially on the renewal of our products and services for on demand units managed by our clients and the increase in the use of our on demand products and services for on demand units.\nWe generally license our solutions pursuant to client agreements with a term of one year or longer. The pricing of the agreements is typically based on a price per unit basis. Our clients have no obligation to renew these agreements after their term expires, or to renew these agreements at the same or higher annual contract value. In addition, under specific circumstances, our\nclients have the right to cancel their client agreements before they expire, for example, in the event of an uncured breach by us, or in some circumstances, upon the sale or transfer of a client property, by giving 30 days\u2019 notice or paying a cancellation fee. In addition, clients often purchase a higher level of professional services in the initial term than they do in renewal terms to ensure successful activation. As a result, our ability to grow is dependent in part on clients purchasing additional solutions or increasing the number of units they own or manage after the initial term of their client agreement. Though we maintain and analyze historical data with respect to rates of client renewals, upgrades and expansions, those rates may not accurately predict future trends in renewal of on demand units. Our clients\u2019 on demand unit renewal rates may decline or fluctuate for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to, their level of satisfaction with our solutions, our pricing, our competitors\u2019 pricing, reductions in our clients\u2019 spending levels or reductions in the number of on demand units managed by our clients. If our clients cancel or amend their agreements with us during their term, do not renew their agreements, renew on less favorable terms or do not purchase additional solutions or professional services in renewal periods, our revenue may grow more slowly than expected or decline and our profitability may be harmed.\nAdditionally, we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, some level of on demand unit attrition as properties are sold and the new owners and managers of properties previously owned or managed by our clients do not continue to use our solutions. We cannot predict the amount of on demand unit turnover we will experience in the future. However, we have experienced higher rates of on demand unit attrition with our Propertyware property management system, primarily because it serves smaller properties than our OneSite property management system, and we may experience higher levels of on demand unit attrition to the extent Propertyware grows as a percentage of our revenues. If we experience increased on demand unit turnover, our financial performance and operating results could be adversely affected.\nOn demand revenue that is derived from products that help owners and managers lease and market apartments may decrease as occupancy rates rise. We have also experienced, and expect to continue to experience, some number of consolidations of our clients with other parties. In addition, if one of our clients is consolidated with another client, the acquiring client may have negotiated lower prices for our solutions or may use fewer of our solutions than the acquired client. In each case, the consolidated entity may attempt to negotiate lower prices for using our solutions as a result of the entity\u2019s increased size. These consolidations may cause us to lose on demand units or require us to reduce prices as a result of enhanced client leverage, which could cause our financial performance and operating results to be adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to continue to add new clients and retain and increase sales to our existing clients, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nOur revenue growth is dependent on our ability to continually attract new clients while retaining and expanding our service offerings to existing clients. Growth in the demand for our solutions may be inhibited and we may be unable to sustain growth in our sales for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022the economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic upon our clients and their demand for our service offerings;\n\u2022our failure to develop new or additional solutions;\n\u2022our inability to market our solutions in a cost-effective manner to new clients or in new vertical or geographic markets;\n\u2022our inability to expand our sales to existing clients;\n\u2022our inability to build and promote our brand; and\n\u2022perceived or actual security, integrity, reliability, quality or compatibility problems with our solutions.\nA substantial amount of our past revenue growth was derived from purchases of upgrades and additional solutions by existing clients. Our costs associated with increasing revenue from existing clients are generally lower than costs associated with generating revenue from new clients. Therefore, a reduction in the rate of revenue increase from our existing clients, even if offset by an increase in revenue from new clients, could reduce our profitability and have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nIf we are unable to successfully develop or acquire and sell enhancements and new solutions, our revenue growth will be harmed and we may not be able to meet profitability expectations.\nThe industry in which we operate is characterized by rapidly changing client requirements, technological developments and evolving industry standards. Our ability to attract new clients and increase revenue from existing clients will depend in large part on our ability to successfully develop, bring to market and sell enhancements to our existing solutions and new solutions that effectively respond to the rapid changes in our industry. Any enhancements or new solutions that we develop or acquire may not be introduced to the market in a timely or cost-effective manner and may not achieve the broad market acceptance necessary to generate the revenue required to offset the operating expenses and capital expenditures related to development or acquisition. If we are unable to timely develop or acquire and sell enhancements and new solutions that keep\npace with the rapid changes in our industry, our revenue will not grow as expected and we may not be able to maintain or meet profitability expectations.\nAny disruption of service at our data centers or other facilities could interrupt or delay our clients\u2019 access to our solutions, which could harm our operating results.\nThe ability of our clients to access our service is critical to our business. We host our products and services, support our operations and service our clients primarily from data centers in the Dallas, Texas area, but also from data centers located elsewhere in the United States and in Europe.\nWe may fail to provide such service as a result of numerous factors, many of which are beyond our control, including, without limitation: mechanical failure, power outage, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, human error, physical or electronic information security breaches, war, terrorism and related conflicts or similar events worldwide, fire, earthquake, hurricane, flood and other natural disasters, sabotage and vandalism. We attempt to mitigate these risks at our Texas-based data centers and other facilities through various business continuity efforts, including: redundant infrastructure, 24 x 7 x 365 system activity monitoring, physical security, backup and recovery procedures, use of a secure off-site storage facility for backup media, separate test systems and rotation of management and system security measures, but our precautions may not protect against all potential problems. Disaster recovery procedures are in place to facilitate the recovery of our operations, products and services within the stated service level goals. Our secondary data center is equipped with physical space, power, storage and networking infrastructure and Internet connectivity to support the solutions we provide in the event of the interruption of services at our primary data center. Even with this secondary data center, however, our operations would be interrupted during the transition process should our primary data center experience a failure. Moreover, both our primary and secondary data centers are located in the greater metropolitan Dallas area. As a result, any regional disaster could affect both data centers and result in a material disruption of our services.\nProblems at one or more of our data centers, whether or not within our control, could result in service disruptions or delays or loss or corruption of data or documents. This could damage our reputation, cause us to issue credits to clients, subject us to potential liability or costs related to defending against claims, or cause clients to terminate or elect not to renew their agreements, any of which could negatively impact our revenues and harm our operating results.\nInterruptions or delays in service from our third-party data center providers could impair our ability to deliver certain of our products to our clients, resulting in client dissatisfaction, damage to our reputation, loss of clients, limited growth and reduction in revenue.\nOur products and services are hosted and supported from data centers, operated by third-party providers, in various geographic locations within the continental United States and Europe. Our operations depend on our third-party data center providers\u2019 abilities to protect these facilities against damage or interruption from natural disasters, power or telecommunications failures, criminal acts and similar events. In the event that any of our third-party hosting or facilities arrangements is terminated, or if there is a lapse of service or damage to a facility, we could experience interruptions in the availability of our on demand software as well as delays and additional expenses in arranging new facilities and services.\nDespite precautions taken at these third party data centers, the occurrence of spikes in usage volume, a natural disaster, an act of terrorism, adverse changes in United States or foreign laws and regulations, vandalism or sabotage, a decision to close a third-party facility without adequate notice, or other unanticipated problems at a facility could result in lengthy interruptions in the availability of our on demand software. Even with current and planned disaster recovery arrangements, our business could be harmed. Also, in the event of damage or interruption, our insurance policies may not adequately compensate us for any losses that we may incur. These factors in turn could further reduce our revenue, subject us to liability and cause us to issue credits or cause clients to fail to renew their subscriptions, any of which could materially adversely affect our business.\nWe provide service level commitments to our clients, and our failure to meet the stated service levels could significantly harm our revenue and our reputation.\nOur client agreements provide that we maintain certain service level commitments to our clients relating primarily to product functionality, network uptime, critical infrastructure availability and hardware replacement. For example, our service level agreements generally require that our solutions are available 98% of the time during coverage hours (normally 6:00 a.m. though 10:00 p.m. Central time daily) 365 days per year (other than certain permitted exceptions such as maintenance). If we are unable to meet the stated service level commitments, we may be contractually obligated to provide clients with refunds or credits. Additionally, if we fail to meet our service level commitments a specified number of times within a given time frame or for a specified duration, our clients may terminate their agreements with us or extend the term of their agreements at no additional fee. As a result, a failure to deliver services for a relatively short duration could cause us to issue credits or refunds to a large number of affected clients or result in the loss of clients. In addition, we cannot assure that our clients will accept these credits, refunds, termination or extension rights in lieu of other legal remedies that may be available to them. Our failure to meet our commitments could also result in substantial client dissatisfaction or loss. Because of the loss of future revenues through the issuance of credits or the loss of clients or other potential liabilities, our revenue could be significantly impacted if\nwe cannot meet our service level commitments to our clients. Although we were able to effectively service our customers and meet our service level obligations during the year ended December 31, 2020 after implementing changes to our work environments as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, including working from home in response to governmental orders and safety considerations related to our employees and customers, if we are not able to continue to respond to and manage these impacts and related changes, our business, results of operations, liquidity and financial condition could be adversely impacted.\nWe face intense competitive pressures and our failure to compete successfully could harm our business and operating results.\nWe compete in a number of markets including accounting software, property management software for multifamily, single family and commercial solutions, vertically-integrated cloud computing services, software-enabled value-added services including applicant screening, insurance, relationship management (\u201cCRM\u201d), marketing and web portals, Internet listing services, utility billing and energy management, revenue management, multifamily housing and commercial real estate market research, spend management, payment processing, affordable housing compliance and audit services and vacation rentals. The markets for many of our solutions are intensely competitive, fragmented and rapidly changing. Some of these markets have relatively low barriers to entry. With the introduction of new technologies and market entrants, we expect competition to intensify in the future. Increased competition could result in pricing pressures, reduced sales and reduced margins. Often we compete to sell our solutions against existing systems that our potential clients have already made significant expenditures to install.\nOur competitors vary depending on our product and service. Certain competitors compete with us in a number of areas, including Yardi, Inc., Entrata, Inc., MRI Software LLC, AppFolio, Inc., and CoStar Group, Inc. Other competitors compete with us with respect to a single product or category of products. We compete in various markets, with different competitive considerations in these various markets. In many of our markets we compete with a number of providers, including those who market specifically to multifamily, single family, and commercial real estate owners and property managers as well as other providers. In addition, many of our existing or potential clients have developed or may develop their own solutions that may be competitive with our solutions. We also may face competition for potential acquisition targets from our competitors who are seeking to expand their offerings.\nWith respect to all of our competitors, we compete based on a number of factors, including total cost of ownership, level of integration with property management systems, ease of implementation, product functionality and scope, performance, security, scalability and reliability of service, brand and reputation, sales and marketing capabilities and financial resources. Some of our existing competitors and new market entrants may enjoy substantial competitive advantages, such as greater name recognition, longer operating histories, larger installed client bases and larger sales and marketing budgets, as well as greater financial, technical and other resources. In addition, any number of our existing competitors or new market entrants could combine or consolidate, or obtain new financing through public or private sources, to become a more formidable competitor with greater resources. As a result of such competitive advantages, our existing and future competitors may be able to:\n\u2022develop superior products or services, gain greater market acceptance and expand their offerings more efficiently or more rapidly;\n\u2022adapt to new or emerging technologies and changes in client requirements more quickly;\n\u2022take advantage of acquisition and other opportunities more readily;\n\u2022adopt more aggressive pricing policies, such as offering discounted pricing for purchasing multiple bundled products;\n\u2022devote greater resources to the promotion of their brand and marketing and sales of their products and services; and\n\u2022devote greater resources to the research and development of their products and services.\nIf we are not able to compete effectively, our operating results will be harmed.\nWe integrate our software-enabled value-added services with competitive property management software for some of our clients. Our application infrastructure, marketed to our clients as SmartSource IT, is based on an open architecture that enables third-party applications to access and interface with applications hosted in SmartSource IT through our RealPage Exchange platform. Likewise, through this platform our SmartSource IT services are able to access and interface with other third-party applications, including third-party property management systems. We also provide services to assist in the implementation, training, support and hosting with respect to the integration of some of our competitors\u2019 applications with our solutions. We sometimes rely on the cooperation of our competitors to implement solutions for our clients. However, frequently our reliance on the cooperation of our competitors can result in delays in integration. There is no assurance that our competitors, even if contractually obligated to do so, will continue to cooperate with us or will not prospectively alter their obligations to do so. We also occasionally develop interfaces between our software-enabled value-added services and competitor property management software without their cooperation or consent. There is no assurance that our competitors will not alter their applications in\nways that inhibit or prevent integration or assert that their intellectual property rights restrict our ability to integrate our solutions with their applications. Moreover, regardless of merit, such interface-related activity may result in costly litigation.\nMaterial defects or errors in the software we use to deliver our solutions could harm our reputation, result in significant costs to us and impair our ability to sell our solutions.\nThe software applications underlying our solutions are inherently complex and may contain material defects or errors, particularly when first introduced or when new versions or enhancements are released. We have, from time to time, found defects in the software applications underlying our solutions, and new errors in our existing solutions may be detected in the future. Any errors or defects that cause performance problems or service interruptions could result in:\n\u2022a reduction in new sales or subscription renewal rates;\n\u2022unexpected sales credits or refunds to our clients, loss of clients and other potential liabilities;\n\u2022delays in client payments, increasing our collection reserve and collection cycle;\n\u2022diversion of development resources and associated costs;\n\u2022harm to our reputation and brand; and\n\u2022unanticipated litigation costs.\nAdditionally, the costs incurred in correcting defects or errors could be substantial and could adversely affect our operating results.\nFailure to effectively manage the development, sale and support of our solutions and data processing efforts outside the United States could harm our business.\nOur success depends on our ability to process high volumes of client data, enhance existing solutions and develop new solutions rapidly and cost effectively. We currently maintain offices in Hyderabad, India; Cebu, Philippines; Manila, Philippines; and Medellin, Colombia, where we employ development and data processing personnel or conduct other business functions important to our operations. We believe that performing these activities in Hyderabad, Cebu, Manila, and Medellin increases the efficiency and decreases the costs of our related operations. We maintain an office in Barcelona, Spain where certain of our vacation rental product development, sales and support operations are based. We also maintain offices in London, England and Sydney, Australia, where we provide property management, online leasing and resident software solutions. We believe our access to a multilingual employee base enhances our ability to serve vacation and other rental property managers outside the United States and in non-English speaking countries. Managing and staffing international operations requires management\u2019s attention and financial resources. The level of cost savings achieved by our international operations may not exceed the amount of investment and additional resources required to manage and operate these international operations. Our product offerings outside the United States may not be profitable or otherwise successful. Additionally, if we experience difficulties as a result of political, social, economic or environmental instability, change in applicable law, limitations of local infrastructure or problems with our workforce or facilities at our or third parties\u2019 international operations, including quarantines or other interruptions that affect our workforce as a result of an outbreak of the coronavirus in any of the locations where we operate, our business could be harmed due to delays in product release schedules or data processing services.\nWe rely on third-party technologies and services that may be difficult to replace or that could cause errors, failures or disruptions of our service, or introduce supply chain vulnerabilities, any of which could harm our business.\nWe rely on third-party providers in connection with the delivery of our solutions. Such providers include, but are not limited to, computer hardware and software vendors, database and data providers and cloud hosting providers. We utilize equipment, software and services from various third party providers. Our OneSite Accounting service relies on a software-as-a-service, or SaaS, accounting system developed and maintained by a third-party service provider. We host this application in our data centers and provide supplemental development resources to extend this accounting system to meet the unique requirements of the rental housing industry. Our shared cloud portfolio reporting service utilizes software licensed from a third party. We expect to utilize additional service providers as we expand our platform. Although the third-party technologies and services that we currently require are commercially available, such technologies and services may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Any loss of the right to use any of these technologies or services could result in delays in the provisioning of our solutions until alternative technology is either developed by us, or, if available, is identified, obtained and integrated, and such delays could harm our business. It also may be time consuming and costly to enter into new relationships. Additionally, any errors or defects in the third-party technologies we utilize or delays or interruptions in the third-party services we rely on could result in errors, failures or disruptions of our services, which also could harm our business.\nWe depend upon third-party service providers for important payment processing functions. If these third-party service providers do not fulfill their contractual obligations or choose to discontinue their services, our business and operations could be disrupted and our operating results would be harmed.\nWe rely on several large payment processing service providers to provide payment processing services to our clients. These services include electronic funds transfers, or EFT\u2019s, check services, bank card authorizations, data capture, settlement and merchant accounting services and access to various reporting tools. We and our clients also rely on third-party hardware manufacturers to manufacture check scanning hardware which is utilized to process transactions. Some service providers are our competitors who also directly or indirectly sell payment processing services to our clients in competition with us. With respect to these service providers, we have significantly less control over the systems and processes than if we were to maintain and operate those systems and processes ourselves. In some cases, functions necessary to our business are performed on proprietary third-party systems and software to which we have no access. We also generally do not have long-term contracts with these service providers. Accordingly, the failure of these organizations and service providers to renew their contracts with us or to fulfill their contractual obligations and perform satisfactorily could result in significant disruptions to our operations and adversely affect our operating results. In addition, the businesses we have acquired, or may acquire in the future, typically rely on other payment processing service providers. We may encounter difficulty converting payment processing services from these service providers to our payment processing platform. If we are required to find an alternative source for performing these functions, we may have to expend significant money, time and other resources to develop or obtain an alternative. If developing or obtaining an alternative is not accomplished in a timely manner and without significant disruption to our business, we may be unable to fulfill our responsibilities to our clients or meet their expectations, with the attendant potential for liability claims, damage to our reputation, and loss of our ability to attract or maintain clients.\nIf our security measures are breached and unauthorized access is obtained to our software platform, service infrastructure, or our clients\u2019 or their renters\u2019 or prospects\u2019 data, we may incur significant liabilities, third parties may misappropriate our intellectual property or financial assets, our solutions may be perceived as not being secure and clients may curtail or stop using our solutions.\nMaintaining the security of our software platform and service infrastructure is of paramount importance to us and our clients, and we devote significant resources to this effort. Breaches of the security measures we take to protect our software platform and service infrastructure and our and our clients\u2019 confidential or proprietary information that is stored on and transmitted through those systems could disrupt and compromise the security of our internal systems and on demand applications, impair our ability to provide products and services to our clients and protect the privacy of their data, compromise our confidential or technical business information harming our competitive position, result in theft or misuse of our intellectual property or financial assets or otherwise adversely affect our business.\nThe solutions we provide involve the collection, storage and transmission of confidential personal and proprietary information regarding our clients and our clients\u2019 current and prospective renters and business partners. Specifically, we collect, store and transmit a variety of client data such as demographic information and payment histories of our clients\u2019 prospective and current renters and business partners. Additionally, we collect and transmit sensitive financial data such as credit card and bank account information. Treatment of certain types of data, such as personally identifiable information, protected health information and sensitive financial data may be subject to global, federal or state regulations requiring heightened privacy and security. If our data security or data integrity measures are breached or otherwise fail or prove to be inadequate for any reason, as a result of third-party actions or our employees\u2019 or contractors\u2019 errors or malfeasance or otherwise, and unauthorized persons obtain access to this information, or the data is otherwise compromised, we could incur significant liability to our clients and to their prospective or current renters or business partners, significant costs associated with internal regulatory investigations and litigation, or significant fines and sanctions by payment processing networks or governmental authorities. Any of these events or circumstances could result in damage to our reputation and material harm to our business.\nWe also rely upon our clients as users of our system to promote security of the system and the data within it, such as administration of client-side access credentialing and control of client-side display of data. On occasion, our clients have failed to perform these activities in such a manner as to prevent unauthorized access to data. To date, these breaches have not resulted in claims against us or in material harm to our business, but we cannot be certain that the failure of our clients in future periods to perform these activities will not result in claims against us, which could expose us to potential litigation, damage to our reputation and material harm to our business.\nThere can be no certainty that the measures we have taken to protect our software platform and service infrastructure, our confidential and proprietary information and the privacy and integrity of our clients\u2019, their current or prospective renters\u2019 and business partners\u2019 data are adequate to prevent or remedy unauthorized access to our system. Because techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to, or to sabotage, systems change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate preventive measures. Experienced computer programmers seeking to intrude or cause harm, or hackers, have penetrated our service infrastructure in the past and are likely to attempt to do so in the future. Hackers may consist of sophisticated organizations, competitors, governments or individuals\nwho launch targeted attacks to gain unauthorized access to our systems and financial assets. A hacker who is able to penetrate our service infrastructure could misappropriate proprietary or confidential information or financial assets or cause interruptions in our services. For example, during May 2018, as disclosed in our Form 10-Q for the quarter ended March 31, 2018, we were the subject of a targeted email phishing campaign that led to a business email compromise, pursuant to which an unauthorized party gained access to an external third party system used by a subsidiary that we acquired in 2017. The incident resulted in the diversion of approximately $6.0 million of funds, net of recoveries, intended for disbursement to three clients. Although we continue to vigorously pursue recovery of our losses and related expenses arising from this incident, there can be no assurance of recovery or of the timing of any such recovery.\nWe might be required to expend significant capital and resources to protect against, or to remedy, problems caused by intentional or unintentional threats such as hackers, and we may not have a timely remedy against a threat which is able to penetrate our service infrastructure. In addition to purposeful breaches, inadvertent actions or the transmission of computer viruses or malicious other logic could expose us to security risks. If an actual or perceived breach of our security occurs or if our clients and potential clients perceive vulnerabilities, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed, we could lose sales and clients and our business could be materially harmed.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks Related to Our Business\nWe face a number of risks in our payment processing business that could result in a reduction in our revenues and profits.\nIn connection with our electronic payment processing services, we process renter payments and subsequently settle these renter payments to our clients after varying clearing times. These payments are settled through our sponsor banks, and in the case of EFT, our Originating Depository Financial Institutions, or ODFIs. The renter payments that we process for our clients are identified in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as restricted cash and the corresponding liability for these renter payments is identified as client deposits. Our electronic payment processing business and related maintenance of custodial accounts subjects us to a number of risks, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022liability for client costs related to disputed or fraudulent transactions if those costs exceed the amount of the client reserves we have during the clearing period or after renter payments have been settled to our clients;\n\u2022electronic processing limits on the amount of custodial balances that any single ODFI, or collectively all of our ODFIs, will underwrite;\n\u2022reliance on sponsor banks, card payment processors and other payment service provider partners to process electronic transactions;\n\u2022failure by us or our sponsor banks to adhere to applicable laws and regulatory requirements or the standards of the electronic payments rules and regulations and other rules and regulations that may impact the provision of electronic payment services;\n\u2022continually evolving laws and regulations governing payment processing and money transmission, the application or interpretation of which is not clear in some jurisdictions;\n\u2022incidences of fraud, a security breach or our failure to comply with required external audit standards;\n\u2022our inability to increase or modify our fees at times when sponsor banks, electronic payment partners or associations increase their transaction processing fees or impose restrictions on the type, structure or amount of fees we can charge;\n\u2022repricing actions taken by card associations or payment networks or imposed as a result of governmental regulation or due to competitive pressures, which could negatively impact the prices we can charge customers for our services; and\n\u2022inconsistent and conflicting laws, regulations and card association or payment network rules that may result in fee structures that cause consumer confusion, complaints or litigation.\nIf any of these risks related to our electronic payment processing business were to materialize, our business or financial results could be negatively affected. Although we attempt to structure and adapt our payment processing operations to comply with these complex and evolving laws and regulations, our efforts may not guarantee compliance. In the event we are found to be in violation of regulatory or legal requirements, we may be subject to monetary fines, cease and desist orders, mandatory product changes, or other penalties that could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Additionally, we are exposed to financial risk when payments from renters to our clients are returned or charged-back for various reasons such as insufficient funds, stop payment orders, unauthorized use or other reasons. In instances where there are returns or chargebacks, we attempt to collect these funds from our clients. However, if we are unable to collect such amounts from our clients, we bear the risk of loss for the amount of the return or chargeback. While we have not experienced material losses resulting from payment returns or chargebacks in the past, there can be no assurance that we will not experience significant losses in the future. Any increase in\nreturns or chargebacks that we are not able to recover our clients may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have a service provider agreement with a financial institution under which we are a registered independent sales organization, or ISO. Under this agreement the financial institution processes credit card and debit card payments (\u201cCard Payments\u201d) on behalf of our clients. As an ISO, we assume the underwriting risk for the payments processed on behalf of our clients. If we experience excessive chargebacks, either we or the financial institution have the authority to cease client card processing services, and such events could result in a material adverse effect on our revenues, operating income, and reputation.\nEvolution and expansion of our payment processing business may subject us to additional regulatory requirements and other risks, with respect to which failure to comply or adapt could harm our operating results.\nThe evolution and expansion of our payment processing business may subject us to additional risks and regulatory requirements, including laws governing money transmission and payment processing/settlement services. These requirements vary throughout the markets in which we operate, and have increased over time as the geographic scope and complexity of our product services have expanded. While we maintain a compliance program focused on applicable laws and regulations throughout the payments industry, there is no guarantee that we will not be subject to fines, criminal and civil lawsuits or other regulatory enforcement actions in one or more jurisdictions, or be required to adjust business practices to accommodate future regulatory requirements.\nIn order to maintain flexibility in the growth and expansion of our payments operations, we have obtained money transmitter licenses (or their equivalents) in several states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico. Our efforts to maintain these licenses could result in significant management time, effort, and cost, and may still not guarantee compliance given the constant state of change in these regulatory frameworks. Accordingly, costs associated with changes in compliance requirements, regulatory audits, enforcement actions, reputational harm, or other regulatory limitations may impact our ability to grow our payment processing business and could adversely affect our financial results.\nBecause certain solutions we provide depend on access to client data, decreased access to this data or the failure to comply with the evolving laws and regulations governing privacy of data, cloud computing and cross-border data transfers, or the failure to address privacy concerns applicable to such data, could harm our business.\nCertain of our solutions depend on our continued access to our clients\u2019 data regarding their prospective and current renters, including data compiled by other third-party service providers who collect and store data on behalf of our clients. Federal, state and foreign governments have adopted and continue to adopt new laws and regulations addressing data privacy and the collection, processing, storage, transmission, use and disclosure of personal information. Such laws and regulations are subject to differing interpretations and may be inconsistent among jurisdictions. These and other requirements could reduce demand for our solutions or restrict our ability to store and process data or, in some cases, impact our ability to offer our services and solutions in certain locations.\nIn addition to government activity, privacy advocacy and other industry groups have established or may establish new self-regulatory standards that may place additional burdens on us. Our clients may expect us to meet voluntary certification or other standards established by third parties. If we are unable to maintain these certifications or meet these standards, it could adversely affect our ability to provide our solutions to certain clients and could harm our business.\nAny restrictions on the use of or decrease in the availability of data from our clients, or other third parties that collect and store such data on behalf of our clients, and the costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, applicable legislative and regulatory initiatives may limit our ability to collect, aggregate or use this data. Any limitations on our ability to collect, aggregate or use such data could reduce demand for certain of our solutions. Additionally, any inability to adequately address privacy concerns, even if unfounded, or comply with applicable privacy laws, regulations and policies, could result in liability to us or damage to our reputation and could inhibit sales and market acceptance of our solutions and harm our business.\nAssertions by a third party that we infringe its intellectual property, whether successful or not, could subject us to costly and time-consuming litigation or expensive licenses.\nThe software and technology industries are characterized by the existence of a large number of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secrets and by frequent litigation based on allegations of infringement, misappropriation, misuse and other violations of intellectual property rights. We have received in the past, and may receive in the future, communications from third parties claiming that we have infringed or otherwise misappropriated the intellectual property rights or terms of use of others. Our technologies may not be able to withstand any third-party claims against their use. Since we currently have a limited number of patents, we may not be able to use patent infringement as a defensive strategy in such litigation. Additionally, although we have licensed from other parties proprietary technology covered by patents, we cannot be certain that any such patents will not be challenged, invalidated or circumvented. If such patents are invalidated or circumvented, this may allow existing and potential competitors to develop products and services that are competitive with, or superior to, our solutions.\nMany of our client agreements require us to indemnify our clients for certain third-party claims, such as intellectual property infringement claims, which could increase our costs of defending such claims and may require that we pay damages if there were an adverse ruling or settlement related to any such claims. These types of claims could harm our relationships with our clients, may deter future clients from purchasing our solutions or could expose us to litigation for these claims. Even if we are not a party to any litigation between a client and a third party, an adverse outcome in any such litigation could make it more difficult for us to defend our intellectual property in any subsequent litigation in which we are a named party.\nLitigation could force us to stop selling, incorporating or using our solutions that include the challenged intellectual property or redesign those solutions that use the technology. In addition, we may have to pay damages if we are found to be in violation of a third party\u2019s rights. We may have to procure a license for the technology, which may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all, may significantly increase our operating expenses or may require us to restrict our business activities in one or more respects. As a result, we may also be required to develop alternative non-infringing technology, which could require significant effort and expense. There is no assurance that we would be able to develop alternative solutions or, if alternative solutions were developed, that they would perform as required or be accepted in the relevant markets. In some instances, if we are unable to offer non-infringing technology, or obtain a license for such technology, we may be required to refund some or the entire license fee paid for the infringing technology by our clients.\nOur exposure to risks associated with the use of intellectual property may be increased as a result of acquisitions, as we have a lower level of visibility into the development process with respect to acquired technology or the care taken to safeguard against infringement risks. Such risks include, without limitation, patent infringement risks, copyright infringement risks, risks arising from the inclusion of open source software that is subject to onerous license provisions that could even require disclosure of our proprietary source code, or violations of terms of use for third party solutions that our acquisition targets use. Third parties may make infringement and similar or related claims after we have acquired technology that had not been asserted prior to our acquisition.\nAny failure to protect and successfully enforce our intellectual property rights could compromise our proprietary technology and impair our brands.\nOur success depends on our ability to protect our proprietary rights to the technologies we use in our solutions. If we are unable to protect our proprietary rights adequately, our competitors could use the intellectual property we have developed to enhance their own products and services, which could harm our business. We rely on a combination of copyright, service mark, trademark and trade secret laws, as well as confidentiality procedures and contractual restrictions, to establish and protect our proprietary rights, all of which provide only limited protection. We currently have a limited number of issued patents and pending patent applications, and we may be unable to obtain patent protection in the future. In addition, if any patents are issued in the future, they may not provide us with any competitive advantages, may not be issued in a manner that gives us the protection that we seek and may be successfully challenged by third parties. Unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use the technologies underlying our solutions. Monitoring unauthorized use of our technologies is difficult, and we do not know whether the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our technology. If we are unable to protect our proprietary rights, we may find ourselves at a competitive disadvantage to others who have not incurred the substantial expense, time and effort required to create similar innovative products.\nWe cannot assure that any future service mark or trademark registrations will be issued for pending or future applications or that any registered service marks or trademarks will be enforceable or provide adequate protection of our proprietary rights. If we are unable to secure new marks, maintain already existing marks and enforce the rights to use such marks against unauthorized third-party use, our ability to brand, identify and promote our solutions in the marketplace could be impaired, which could harm our business.\nWe customarily enter into agreements with our employees, contractors and certain parties with whom we do business to limit access to, use of, and disclosure of our confidential and proprietary information. The legal and technical steps we have taken, however, may not prevent unauthorized use or the reverse engineering of our technology. Moreover, we may be required to release the source code of our software to third parties under certain circumstances. For example, some of our client agreements provide that if we cease to maintain or support a certain solution without replacing it with a successor solution, then we may be required to release the source code of the software underlying such solution. In addition, others may independently develop technologies that are competitive to ours or infringe our intellectual property. Moreover, it may be difficult or practically impossible to detect copyright infringement or theft of our software code. Enforcement of our intellectual property rights also depends on our legal actions being successful against these infringers, but these actions may not be successful, even when our rights have been infringed. Furthermore, the legal standards relating to the validity, enforceability and scope of protection of intellectual property rights in Internet-related industries are uncertain and still evolving.\nAdditionally, as we sell our solutions internationally, effective patent, trademark, service mark, copyright and trade secret protection may not be available or as robust in every country in which our solutions are available. As a result, we may not be able to effectively prevent competitors outside the United States from infringing or otherwise misappropriating our intellectual property rights, which could reduce our competitive position and ability to compete or otherwise harm our business.\nWe may be unable to halt the operations of websites that aggregate or misappropriate data from our websites.\nFrom time to time, third parties have misappropriated data from our websites through website scraping, software robots or other means and aggregated this data on their websites with data from other companies. In addition, copycat websites have misappropriated data on our network and attempted to imitate our brand or the functionality of our website. When we have become aware of such websites, we have employed technological or legal measures in an attempt to halt their operations. However, we may be unable to detect all such websites in a timely manner and, even if we could, technological and legal measures may be insufficient to halt their operations. In some cases, particularly in the case of websites operating outside of the United States, our available remedies may not be adequate to protect us against the impact of the operation of such websites. Regardless of whether we can successfully enforce our rights against the operators of these websites, any measures that we may take could require us to expend significant financial or other resources, which could harm our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, to the extent that such activity creates confusion among consumers or advertisers, our brand and business could be harmed.\nLegal proceedings against us could be costly and time consuming to defend.\nWe are from time to time subject to legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business, including claims brought by our clients or vendors in connection with commercial disputes, claims brought by our clients\u2019 current or prospective renters, including class action lawsuits based on asserted statutory or regulatory violations, employment-based claims made by our current or former employees, and other claims brought by administrative agencies, government regulators, or insurers.\nOn February 23, 2015, we received from the Federal Trade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d) a Civil Investigative Demand consisting of interrogatories and a request to produce documents relating to our compliance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act (\u201cFCRA\u201d). We responded to the request and requests for additional information by the FTC. On November 2, 2017, the FTC staff informed us of its belief that there was a basis for claims that could include monetary and injunctive relief against us for failing to follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of our tenant screening reports. In October 2018, we reached a settlement with the FTC resolving all issues raised by the FTC related to this matter. Under the settlement, we paid $3.0 million to the FTC and agreed to continue to comply with the FCRA. The settlement does not require any changes to our current business practices. We believe that our business practices did not, and do not, violate the FCRA or any other laws.\nIn connection with the Merger Agreement, we filed with the SEC the Proxy Statement on February 5, 2021. Following the filing of the Proxy Statement, four lawsuits relating to the Merger were filed: (i) Asp v. RealPage, Inc., et al., Case No: 1:21-cv-00158-LPS, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware on February 5, 2021, on behalf of an individual stockholder of the Company (the \u201cAsp Action\u201d); (ii) Parshall v. RealPage, Inc., et al., Case No. 1:21-cv-00206-LPS, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware on February 16, 2021 on behalf of an individual stockholder of the Company (the \u201cParshall Action\u201d); (iii) Anderson v. RealPage, Inc., et al., Case No: 1:21-cv-00212-LPS, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware on February 16, 2021 on behalf of an individual stockholder of the Company (the \u201cAnderson Action\u201d); and (iv) Waterman v. RealPage, Inc. et al, Case No. 1:21-cv-00230-LPS, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware on February 18, 2021 on behalf of an individual stockholder of the Company (the \u201cWaterman Action\u201d and together with the Asp Action, the Parshall Action, and the Anderson Action, the \u201cActions\u201d). In addition, the Company received a demand letter relating to the Merger on February 8, 2021 from counsel representing an individual stockholder of the Company (the \u201cDemand Letter\u201d and together with the Actions, the \u201cMatters\u201d). The Matters each allege that the defendants named therein violated Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, because the Proxy Statement allegedly omits or misstates certain material information. The Actions each seek, among other things, injunctive relief preventing the consummation of the Merger, rescission of the Merger if it is consummated, damages and attorneys\u2019 fees. We believe that the claims asserted in the Matters are without merit.\nLitigation, enforcement actions and other legal proceedings, regardless of their outcome, may result in substantial costs and may divert management\u2019s attention and our resources, which may harm our business, overall financial condition and operating results. In addition, legal claims that have not yet been asserted against us may be asserted in the future. Although we maintain insurance, there is no guarantee that such insurance will be available or sufficient to cover any such legal proceedings or claims. For example, insurance may not cover such legal proceedings or claims or the insurer may withhold or dispute coverage of such legal proceedings or claims on various grounds, including by alleging such coverage is beyond the scope of such policies, that we are not in compliance with the terms of such insurance policies or that such policies are not in effect, even after proceeds under such insurance policies have been received by us. A legal proceeding or claim brought against us that is uninsured or under-insured could result in unanticipated costs, thereby harming our operating results. We are currently involved in a dispute with our insurance carrier regarding coverage for a May 2018 targeted email phishing incident that led to a business email compromise and the diversion of funds totaling approximately $6.0 million, net of recoveries, that were intended for disbursement to three of our clients. The insurance carrier made payment on a portion of our claim in January 2019, and while there can be no assurance of the final outcome, we intend to vigorously pursue repayment of the remaining losses. Insurance\nmay not be sufficient for one or more such legal proceedings or claims and may not continue to be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all.\nWe could be sued for contract, warranty or product liability claims, and such lawsuits may disrupt our business, divert management\u2019s attention and our financial resources or have an adverse effect on our financial results.\nWe provide warranties to clients of certain of our solutions and services relating primarily to product functionality, network uptime, critical infrastructure availability and hardware replacement. General errors, defects, inaccuracies or other performance problems in the software applications underlying our solutions or inaccuracies in or loss of the data we provide to our clients could result in financial or other damages to our clients. Additionally, errors associated with any delivery of our services, including utility billing, could result in financial or other damages to our clients. There can be no assurance that any warranty disclaimers, general disclaimers, waivers or limitations of liability set forth in our contracts would be enforceable or would otherwise protect us from liability for damages. We maintain general liability insurance coverage, including coverage for errors and omissions, in amounts and under terms that we believe are appropriate. There can be no assurance that this coverage will continue to be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all, or in sufficient amounts to cover one or more claims, or that the insurer will not deny coverage for any future claim or dispute coverage of such legal proceedings or claims even after proceeds under such insurance policies have been received by us. The successful assertion of one or more claims against us that exceeds available insurance coverage, could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe rental housing industry, electronic commerce and many of the products and services that we offer, including background screening services, utility billing, affordable housing compliance and audit services, insurance and payments are subject to extensive and evolving governmental regulation. Changes in regulations or our failure to comply with regulations could harm our operating results.\nThe rental housing industry is subject to extensive and complex federal, state and local laws and regulations. Our services and solutions must work within the extensive and evolving legal and regulatory requirements applicable to us, our clients or our third-party service providers, including, but not limited to, those under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Deceptive Trade Practices Act, the Drivers Privacy Protection Act, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Fair and Accurate Credit Transactions Act, the United States Tax Reform Act of 1986 (TRA86), which is an IRS law governing tax credits, the Privacy Rules, Safeguards Rule and Consumer Report Information Disposal Rule promulgated by the Federal Trade Commission, or FTC, the FTC\u2019s Telemarketing Sales Rule, the Telephone Consumer Protection Act (TCPA), the CAN-SPAM Act, the Electronic Communications Privacy Act, the regulations of the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development, or HUD, HIPAA/HITECH, rules and regulations of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), the Americans with Disabilities Act, and complex and divergent state and local laws and regulations related to data privacy and security, credit and consumer reporting, deceptive trade practices, discrimination in housing, telemarketing, electronic communications, call recording, utility billing and energy and gas consumption. These regulations are complex, change frequently and may become more stringent over time. Although we attempt to structure and adapt our solutions and service offerings to comply with these complex and evolving laws and regulations, we may be found to be in violation. If we are found to be in violation of any applicable laws or regulations, we could be subject to administrative and other enforcement actions as well as class action lawsuits or demands for client reimbursement. Additionally, many applicable laws and regulations provide for penalties or assessments on a per occurrence basis. Due to the nature of our business, the type of services we provide and the large number of transactions processed by our solutions, our potential liability in an enforcement action or class action lawsuit could be significant. In addition, entities such as HUD, the FTC and the CFPB have the authority to promulgate rules and regulations that may impact us, our clients and our business.\nOn February 23, 2015, we received from the FTC a Civil Investigative Demand consisting of interrogatories and a request to produce documents relating to our compliance with the FCRA. We responded to the request and requests for additional information by the FTC. On November 2, 2017, the FTC staff informed us of its belief that there was a basis for claims that could include monetary and injunctive relief against us for failing to follow reasonable procedures to assure maximum possible accuracy of our tenant screening reports. We believe that our business practices did not, and do not, violate the FCRA or any other law. In October 2018, we reached a settlement with the FTC resolving all issues raised by the FTC related to this matter. Under the settlement, we paid $3.0 million to the FTC and agreed to continue to comply with the FCRA. The settlement does not require any changes to our current business practices.\nWe believe increased regulation is likely in the area of data privacy, and laws and regulations applying to the solicitation, collection, processing or use of personally identifiable information or consumer information could affect our and our clients\u2019 ability to use and share data, potentially reducing demand for our on demand software solutions. In October 2015, the European Court of Justice invalidated the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor framework, which had been the primary compliance mechanism for establishing data transfers outside of the European Economic Area in accordance with the European Union\u2019s Data Protection Directive 95-46 EC. In July 2016, the U.S. and European Union entered into a new compliance framework, (the \u201cPrivacy Shield\u201d), which was intended to replace the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor framework. The Privacy Shield framework was subsequently\ninvalidated in July 2020, creating uncertainty regarding compliance with applicable privacy laws and regulations. While alternative compliance options exist, the long-term viability of the overall compliance framework remains in question, which could result in increased regulation, cost of compliance and limitations on data transfers for both our clients and us. In May 2018, the General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d) became effective in the European Union and imposed new requirements and restrictions upon companies that process personal data of EU citizens. In June 2018, the State of California passed the California Consumer Privacy Act (\u201cCCPA\u201d), which created new requirements and restrictions for processing personal data of California citizens beginning January 1, 2020. If we are unable to meet the requirements of applicable privacy laws and regulations, the Privacy Shield, GDPR or CCPA with respect to our services subject to these provisions, we may incur monetary or other penalties which could harm our business or financial condition.\nSome of our LeaseStar products operate under the real estate brokerage laws of numerous states and require maintaining licenses in many of these states. Brokerage laws in these states could change, affecting our ability to provide some LeaseStar or, if applicable, other products in these states.\nIncreased regulation is also likely in states and local jurisdictions related to rent control and rent regulation. During 2019, California, New York and Oregon each adopted state legislation that regulates rent pricing, and other states and municipalities are considering similar legislation. Such legislation impacts our clients\u2019 businesses as they determine rental rates, and could impact the supply of rental units over time in markets impacted by such regulation. The impact of restrictions on rental rates could also depress demand and pricing for certain of our products designed to enable our clients to evaluate market conditions in determining rental rates.\nWe deliver our on demand software solutions over the Internet and sell and market certain of our solutions over the Internet. As Internet commerce continues to evolve, increasing regulation by federal, state or foreign agencies becomes more likely. Taxation of products or services provided over the Internet or other charges imposed by government agencies or by private organizations for accessing the Internet may also be imposed. Any regulation imposing greater fees for Internet use or restricting information exchange over the Internet could result in a decline in the use of the Internet and the viability of on demand software solutions, which could harm our business and operating results.\nOur insurance business is subject to governmental regulation which could reduce our profitability or limit our growth.\nThrough our wholly owned subsidiaries, we hold insurance agent licenses from a number of individual state departments of insurance and are subject to state governmental regulation and supervision in connection with the operation of our insurance business. In addition, we have appointed numerous sub-producing agents to generate insurance business for our products. These sub-producing agents primarily consist of property owners and managers who market insurance products to residents. The sub-producing agents are subject to the same state regulation and supervision, and we cannot ensure that these sub-producing agents will not violate these regulations, and thus expose our insurance business to sanctions by these state departments of insurance for any such violations. Furthermore, state insurance departments conduct periodic examinations, audits and investigations of the affairs of insurance agents. This state governmental supervision could reduce our profitability or limit the growth of our insurance business by increasing the costs of regulatory compliance, limiting or restricting the solutions we provide or the methods by which we provide them or subjecting us to the possibility of regulatory actions or proceedings. Our continued ability to maintain these insurance agent licenses in the jurisdictions in which we are licensed depends on our compliance with the rules and regulations promulgated from time to time by the regulatory authorities in each of these jurisdictions.\nIn all jurisdictions, the applicable laws and regulations are subject to amendment or interpretation by regulatory authorities. Generally, such authorities are vested with relatively broad discretion to grant, renew and revoke licenses and approvals and to implement regulations, as well as regulate rates that may be charged for premiums on policies. Accordingly, we may be precluded or temporarily suspended from carrying on some or all of the activities of our insurance business or fined or penalized in a given jurisdiction. No assurances can be given that our insurance business can continue to be conducted in any given jurisdiction as it has been conducted in the past.\nWe are required to maintain a 50-state general agency insurance license as well as individual insurance licenses for each sales agent involved in the solicitation of insurance products. Both the agency and individual licenses require compliance with state insurance regulations, payment of licensure fees, and continuing education programs. In the event that regulatory compliance requirements are not met, we could be subject to license suspension or revocation, state Department of Insurance audits and regulatory fines. As a result, our ability to engage in the business of insurance could be restricted, and our revenue and financial results will be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Common Stock\nThe concentration of our capital stock owned by insiders may limit your ability to influence corporate matters.\nOur executive officers, directors, and entities affiliated with them together beneficially owned approximately 11.1% of our common stock as of December 31, 2020. Of such amount, Stephen T. Winn, our Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the Board, and entities beneficially owned by Mr. Winn held an aggregate of approximately 10.1% of our common stock as of\nDecember 31, 2020. Beneficial ownership is determined in accordance with the rules of the SEC. The number of shares of common stock deemed outstanding includes all shares of restricted stock and those shares issuable upon exercise of options that may be exercised within 60 days after December 31, 2020. This concentration of ownership may adversely affect the trading price of our common stock because investors often perceive disadvantages in owning stock in companies with large stockholders. Mr. Winn and entities beneficially owned by Mr. Winn may exert significant influence over our management and affairs and matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election of directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions, such as mergers, consolidations or the sale of substantially all of our assets. Consequently, this concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control, including a merger, consolidation or other business combination involving us, or discouraging a potential acquirer from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control, even if that change of control would benefit our other stockholders.\nThe trading price of our common stock may be volatile.\nThe trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors, including, but not limited to, those described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section, some of which are beyond our control. Factors affecting the trading price of our common stock include:\n\u2022variations in our operating results or in expectations regarding our operating results;\n\u2022variations in operating results of similar companies;\n\u2022changes in our financial guidance and how our actual results compare to such guidance;\n\u2022changes in the estimates of our operating results or changes in recommendations by any research analysts that elect to follow our common stock;\n\u2022announcements of technological innovations, new solutions or enhancements, acquisitions, strategic alliances or agreements by us or by our competitors;\n\u2022announcements by competitors regarding their entry into new markets, and new product, service and pricing strategies;\n\u2022marketing, advertising or other initiatives by us or our competitors;\n\u2022increases or decreases in our sales of products and services for use in the management of units by clients and increases or decreases in the number of units managed by our clients;\n\u2022threatened or actual litigation;\n\u2022changes in our board of directors or management;\n\u2022recruitment or departure of key personnel;\n\u2022market conditions in our industry and the economy as a whole;\n\u2022the overall performance of the equity markets;\n\u2022sales of our shares of common stock by existing stockholders;\n\u2022volatility in our stock price, which may lead to higher stock-based expense under applicable accounting standards; and\n\u2022adoption or modification of regulations, policies, procedures or programs applicable to our business.\nIn addition, the stock market in general, and the market for technology and specifically Internet-related companies, has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of those companies. Broad market and industry factors may harm the market price of our common stock regardless of our actual operating performance. In addition, in the past, following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a particular company\u2019s securities, securities class action litigation has often been instituted against these companies. This litigation, if instituted against us, could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management\u2019s attention and our resources, whether or not we are successful in such litigation.\nFuture sales of our common stock in the public market could lower the market price for our common stock.\nIn the future, we may sell additional shares of our common stock to raise capital. On June 5, 2018, we amended our certificate of incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock by 125,000,000 shares, bringing the total authorized shares of common stock to 250,000,000. In May 2020, we consummated an underwritten public offering of 5.85 million shares of our common stock, with total gross proceeds of $345.0 million. A substantial number of shares of our common stock is reserved for issuance of awards under our equity plan, and upon conversion of the Convertible Notes. We cannot predict the size of future issuances or the effect, if any, that they may have on the market price for our common stock. The issuance and sale of substantial amounts of common stock, or the perception that such issuances and sales may occur, could\nadversely affect the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital through the sale of additional equity.\nThe Capped Calls, Note Hedges and Warrant transactions may affect the value of our common stock.\nIn connection with the pricing of the Convertible Notes issued in May 2017 and May 2020, we entered into hedging transactions (the Capped Calls and Note Hedges, collectively referred to as the \u201cNote Hedge Instruments\u201d) with the option counterparties. We also entered into Warrant transactions with the May 2017 option counterparties. The Hedge Instruments are expected, subject to certain limits in the case of the Capped Calls, to reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the Convertible Notes and/or offset any cash payments we are required to make in excess of the principal amount of Convertible Notes once converted, as the case may be. However, the Warrants could separately have a dilutive effect on our common stock to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock exceeds the strike price of the Warrants.\nIn connection with establishing their initial hedges of the Hedge Instruments and Warrants, the option counterparties or their respective affiliates expected to enter into various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock concurrently with or shortly after the pricing of the Convertible Notes issued in May 2017 and May 2020. The option counterparties or their respective affiliates may modify any such hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivatives with respect to our common stock and/or purchasing or selling our common stock or other securities of ours in secondary market transactions prior to the maturity of the Convertible Notes (and are likely to do so during any observation period related to a conversion of the Convertible Notes). This activity could also cause or avoid an increase or a decrease in the market price of our common stock.\nOur charter documents and Delaware law could prevent a takeover that stockholders consider favorable and could also reduce the market price of our stock.\nOur amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company. These provisions could also make it more difficult for stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions. These provisions include:\n\u2022a classified board of directors whose members serve staggered three-year terms;\n\u2022not providing for cumulative voting in the election of directors;\n\u2022authorizing our board of directors to issue, without stockholder approval, preferred stock with rights senior to those of our common stock;\n\u2022prohibiting stockholder action by written consent; and\n\u2022requiring advance notification of stockholder nominations and proposals.\nThese and other provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and our amended and restated bylaws and under Delaware law could discourage potential takeover attempts, reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock and result in the market price of our common stock being lower than it would be without these provisions.\nWe do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock.\nWe do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future. If we do not pay cash dividends, you would receive a return on your investment in our common stock only if the market price of our common stock has increased when you sell your shares. In addition, the terms of our credit facilities currently restrict our ability to pay dividends. See additional discussion under the Dividend Policy heading of Part II, Item 5 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe Merger is subject to receipt of approval from our stockholders as well as the satisfaction of other closing conditions in the Merger Agreement.\nThe Merger Agreement contains a number of customary conditions to complete the Merger, including, (1) the adoption of the Merger Agreement by the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock, (2) the expiration or early termination of the applicable waiting period under the HSR Act, and the approval of the Merger under other applicable antitrust approvals, (3) the absence of an order, injunction or law prohibiting the Merger, (4) receipt of governmental consents (or, in certain circumstances, implementation of alternative arrangements) with respect to a change of control of certain money transmitter licenses held by a subsidiary of RealPage, (5) the accuracy of the other party\u2019s representations and warranties, subject to certain materiality standards set forth in the Merger Agreement, (6) compliance in all material respects with the other party\u2019s obligations under the Merger Agreement and (7) no Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined in the Merger Agreement) having occurred since the date of the Merger Agreement. We can provide no assurance that all required approvals will be obtained or that all closing conditions will be satisfied, and, if all required approvals are obtained and the closing conditions are satisfied, we can provide no assurance as to the terms, conditions and timing of such approvals or the timing of\nthe completion of the Merger. Any delay in completing the Merger could cause us not to realize some or all of the benefits that we expect to achieve if the Merger is successfully completed within its expected timeframe.\nThe announcement and pendency of our agreement to be acquired by funds affiliated with Thoma Bravo may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nOn December 20, 2020, we entered into the Merger Agreement with Parent and Merger Sub, pursuant to which Parent agreed to acquire us subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein. Our pending acquisition by Parent may have an adverse effect on our revenue in the near term if our customers delay, defer, or cancel purchases or orders pending completion of the Merger. In addition, the announcement and pendency of the Merger may cause reluctance by customers to begin or continue to do business with us due to potential uncertainty about the direction of our products and solutions following consummation of the Merger. We are subject to additional risks in connection with the announcement and pendency of the Merger, including:\n\u2022difficulties maintaining existing and/or establishing business relationships, including relationships with significant customers, suppliers and partners;\n\u2022disruption to our business, including increased costs and diversion of management time and resources that could otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that may have been beneficial to us;\n\u2022the restrictions imposed on our business and operations pursuant to certain covenants set forth in the Merger Agreement, which may prevent us from pursuing certain opportunities, responding to competitive pressures and industry developments, or taking certain actions without Parent\u2019s approval;\n\u2022adverse effects on our ability to attract, recruit, retain and motivate current and prospective employees who may be uncertain about their future roles following completion of the Merger, and the possibility that our employees could lose productivity as a result of uncertainty regarding their employment following the Merger;\n\u2022the outcome of legal proceedings that have been and may be instituted against us, our directors, executive officers and others relating to the Merger; and\n\u2022the diversion of our employees\u2019 attention due to activities related to the Merger.\nThe failure to complete the Merger may adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and stock price.\nAs described above, consummation of the Merger remains subject to certain customary closing conditions. There can be no assurance that these conditions to the completion of the Merger will be satisfied in a timely manner or at all. If the Merger is not completed, our stock price could fall to the extent its current price reflects an assumption that the Merger will be completed, and it is uncertain when, if ever, our stock price would return to the price at which our shares currently trade. Furthermore, if the Merger is not completed, we may suffer other consequences that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results, and stock price, including the following:\n\u2022any disruptions to our business resulting from the announcement and pendency of the Merger, including adverse changes in our relationships with customers, suppliers, partners and employees, may continue or intensify in the event the Merger is not consummated or is significantly delayed;\n\u2022matters relating to the Merger require substantial commitments of management time and resources that could otherwise have been devoted to other opportunities that may have been beneficial to us;\n\u2022we would have incurred significant costs, including professional services fees and other transaction costs, in connection with the Merger that we would be unable to recover;\n\u2022we may have to pay Parent a termination fee of $288.0 million under certain circumstances that give rise to the termination of the Merger Agreement;\n\u2022we may be subject to negative publicity or be negatively perceived by the investment or business communities;\n\u2022we have been and may be subject to legal proceedings related to the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement;\n\u2022we may not be able to take advantage of alternative business opportunities or effectively respond to competitive pressures; and\n\u2022we may experience a departure of employees.\nOther General Risks\nChanges in, or errors in our interpretations and applications of, financial accounting standards or practices may cause adverse, unexpected financial reporting fluctuations and affect our reported results of operations.\nA change in accounting standards or practices can have a significant effect on our reported results and may even affect our reporting of transactions completed before the change is effective. New accounting pronouncements and varying interpretations of accounting pronouncements have occurred and may occur in the future. Changes to existing rules or the questioning of current practices or errors in our interpretations and applications of financial accounting standards or practices may adversely affect our reported financial results or the way in which we conduct our business.\nFor more information on recently issued accounting standards, see Note 2 to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur ability to use net operating losses to offset future taxable income may be subject to certain limitations.\nIn general, under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, or the Internal Revenue Code, a corporation that undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change net operating losses, or NOLs, to offset future taxable income. Our ability to utilize NOLs of companies that we have acquired or may acquire in the future may be subject to limitations. Future changes in our stock ownership, some of which are outside of our control, could result in an ownership change under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. For these reasons, we may not be able to utilize a material portion of the NOLs reflected on our balance sheet, even if we maintain profitability.\nIf we are required to collect sales and use taxes on the solutions we sell in additional taxing jurisdictions, we may be subject to liability for past sales and our future sales may decrease.\nStates and some local taxing jurisdictions have differing rules and regulations governing sales and use taxes, and these rules and regulations are subject to varying interpretations that may change over time. We review these rules and regulations periodically and currently collect and remit sales taxes in taxing jurisdictions where we believe we are required to do so. However, additional state and/or local taxing jurisdictions may seek to impose sales or other tax collection obligations on us, including for past sales. A successful assertion that we should be collecting additional sales or other taxes on our solutions could result in substantial tax liabilities for past sales, discourage clients from purchasing our solutions or otherwise harm our business and operating results. This risk may be greater with regard to solutions acquired through acquisitions because the acquired entities may not have had the same practices and procedures that we have in place.\nWe may also become subject to tax audits or similar procedures in jurisdictions where we already collect and remit sales taxes. A successful assertion that we have not collected and remitted taxes at the appropriate levels may also result in substantial tax liabilities for past sales. Liability for past taxes may also include very substantial interest and penalty charges. Our client contracts provide that our clients must pay all applicable sales and similar taxes. Nevertheless, clients may be reluctant to pay back taxes and may refuse responsibility for interest or penalties associated with those taxes. If we are required to collect and pay back taxes and the associated interest and penalties, and if our clients fail or refuse to reimburse us for all or a portion of these amounts, we will incur unplanned expenses that may be substantial. Moreover, imposition of such taxes on our solutions going forward will effectively increase the cost of such solutions to our clients and may adversely affect our ability to continue to sell those solutions to existing clients or to gain new clients in the areas in which such taxes are imposed.\nChanges to applicable U.S. or foreign tax laws and regulations may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to federal and state income taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions, and our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to the allocation of expenses in differing jurisdictions. Our tax rate is affected by changes in the mix of earnings and losses in jurisdictions with differing statutory tax rates, including jurisdictions in which we have completed or may complete acquisitions and the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, including our ability to utilize our net operating losses. Increases in our effective tax rate could harm our operating results.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\u201cTax Reform Act\u201d), which was signed into law on December 22, 2017, contains significant changes to the U.S. federal income tax laws, including changes to the corporate tax rate, business-related deductions, and taxation of foreign earnings, among others, that are generally effective for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017. Throughout calendar year 2018, the U.S. Treasury and certain states issued proposed and final legislation and clarifying guidance with respect to the various provisions of the Tax Reform Act. Additional legislation and guidance may still be issued in the future, which could have a material adverse impact on the value of our U.S. deferred tax assets, result in significant changes to currently computed income tax liabilities for past and current tax periods, and increase our future U.S. tax expense. The implementation by us of new practices and processes designed to comply with, and benefit from, the Tax Reform Act and its rules and regulations could require us to make substantial changes to our business practices, allocate additional resources, and increase our costs, which could negatively affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOur business is subject to the risks of international operations.\nCompliance with complex foreign and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases our cost of doing business. These numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include internal control and disclosure rules, data privacy and filtering requirements, anti-corruption laws, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments to governmental officials, and antitrust and competition regulations, among others.\nViolations of these laws and regulations could result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against us, our officers, or our employees, prohibitions on the conduct of our business and on our ability to carry on operations in one or more countries, and could also materially affect our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business and our operating results. Although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can be no assurance that our employees, contractors, or agents will not violate our policies.\nIn addition, we are subject to a variety of risks inherent in doing business internationally, including:\n\u2022political, social, economic or environmental instability, terrorist attacks and security concerns in general;\n\u2022limitations of local infrastructure;\n\u2022fluctuations in currency exchange rates;\n\u2022higher levels of credit risk and payment fraud;\n\u2022reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries;\n\u2022difficulties in staffing and managing global operations and the increased travel, infrastructure and legal compliance costs associated with multiple international locations;\n\u2022compliance with statutory equity requirements and management of tax consequences; and\n\u2022outbreaks of highly contagious diseases.\nIf we are unable to manage the complexity of our international operations successfully, our financial results could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on our management team and need additional personnel to grow our business, and the loss of one or more key employees or our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could harm our business.\nOur success and future growth depend on the skills, working relationships and continued services of our management team. The loss of our Chief Executive Officer or other senior executives, or our inability to successfully integrate certain new members of our management, could adversely affect our business. Our future success also will depend on our ability to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled software developers, marketing and sales personnel, technical support and product development personnel in the United States and internationally. Our employees work for us on an at-will basis. Competition for these types of personnel is intense, particularly in the software industry. As a result, we may be unable to attract or retain qualified personnel. Our inability to attract and retain the necessary personnel could adversely affect our business.\nIf securities analysts do not continue to publish research or reports about our business or if they publish negative evaluations of our stock, the price of our stock could decline.\nWe expect that the trading price for our common stock may be affected by research or reports that industry or financial analysts publish about us or our business. If one or more of the analysts who cover us downgrade their evaluations of our stock, the price of our stock could decline. If one or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company, we could lose visibility in the market for our stock, which in turn could cause our stock price to decline.", "PERMNO": 12089, "SIC": 7372, "TIC": "RP"}
