{"cik": "845877", "company": "FEDERAL AGRICULTURAL MORTGAGE CORP", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-02-25", "item_1A": "Item 1A.Risk Factors\nFarmer Mac's business activities, financial performance, and results of operations are, by their nature, subject to risks and uncertainties, including those related to the agricultural industry, the rural utilities industry, access to the capital markets, the regulatory environment, and the level of prevailing interest rates and overall market conditions. The following risk factors should be considered in conjunction with \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including the risks and uncertainties described in the \"Forward-Looking Statements\" section. Because new risk factors likely will emerge from time to time, management can neither predict all potential risk factors nor assess the effects of those factors on Farmer Mac's business, operating results, and financial condition or how much any factor, or combination of factors, may affect Farmer Mac's actual results and financial condition. If any of the following risks materialize, Farmer Mac's business, financial condition, and/or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Farmer Mac undertakes no obligation to update or revise this risk factor discussion, except as required by applicable law.\nCredit and Counterparty Risk\nFactors outside of Farmer Mac's or borrowers' control may negatively affect borrowers' profitability and ability to repay their loans in Farmer Mac's portfolio, which could have a material adverse effect on Farmer Mac's financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, or capital levels.\nExternal factors beyond Farmer Mac's or borrowers' control could negatively affect borrowers' profitability, such as protracted adverse weather; volatility in demand for agricultural products or electricity in rural areas; variability in borrowers' input costs; protracted regional, domestic, or global economic stress; legislative or regulatory actions affecting rural borrowers; U.S. trade policy affecting the demand for agricultural exports or the price of imports required for borrowers' operations; increased competition among producers due to oversupply or available alternatives; and adverse changes in interest rates and land values. Any of these factors could put downward pressure on the profitability of a farming or rural utilities operation, which could then inhibit the related borrower's repayment capacity on one or more loans that Farmer Mac may have from that borrower in its portfolio.\nFarmer Mac assumes the ultimate credit risk of borrower defaults on its agricultural mortgage and rural utilities loan assets, and Farmer Mac's earnings, which come from net interest income, guarantee fees, and commitment fees on those assets, depend significantly on their performance. Widespread and sustained repayment shortfalls on loans in Farmer Mac's portfolio could result in losses, particularly if the available collateral is insufficient to cover Farmer Mac's exposure, and this could have a material adverse effect on Farmer Mac's financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, or capital levels.\nConcentration in a particular commodity type, geographic region, or collateral type may expose Farmer Mac to credit risk that could materially and adversely affect its business, operating results, and financial condition.\nFarmer Mac may be subject to credit risk due to concentration in or exposure to a particular commodity type, geographic region, or collateral type. Widespread weakening in the financial condition of borrowers within a particular geographic region, commodity type, or collateral type could negatively affect Farmer Mac\u2019s financial condition if Farmer Mac\u2019s policies on geographic and commodity concentration are not sufficient to successfully mitigate the risk of concentration in these areas. Farmer Mac's credit risk may\nalso increase as a result of its exposure to loans that are adversely affected by a decline in the sale value of the underlying collateral, particularly if the collateral is single-use or highly improved, such as storage and processing facilities or permanent plantings. Single-use or highly improved collateral increases the risk of ultimate losses on a given loan because producers requiring single-use or highly improved collateral are less able to adapt their operations or switch commodity groups when faced with adverse conditions and are more likely to be undercollateralized in a default scenario. For example, Farmer Mac's cumulative net credit losses for loans to borrowers in the Agricultural Storage and Processing category comprise 47.0% of its cumulative net credit losses for all categories.\nConcentrated exposure to a particular borrower or AgVantage counterparty may expose Farmer Mac to credit risk that could materially and adversely affect its business, operating results, and financial condition.\nFarmer Mac may be subject to credit risk due to concentrated exposure to a particular borrower. Farmer Mac\u2019s Farm & Ranch portfolio consists of loans varying in size and by borrower, including large exposures ($25 million or more) to individual borrowers. The default of any one of these borrowers could negatively affect Farmer Mac's financial condition. Farmer Mac also has concentrated exposures to individual business counterparties on AgVantage securities, which are general obligations of institutional counterparties secured by eligible loans held by the issuing institution. Although AgVantage securities are collateralized by eligible loans in a principal amount equal to or greater than the principal amount of the securities outstanding, Farmer Mac could suffer losses if the market value of the loan collateral declines and the counterparty defaults. Taking possession of the loan collateral upon a default by the AgVantage counterparty could also result in higher current expected credit losses for Farmer Mac's loans held on balance sheet, as well as increased capital requirements. Most of Farmer Mac's AgVantage exposure is concentrated in a small number of issuers. As of December 31, 2019, $7.7 billion of the $8.4 billion of AgVantage securities outstanding had been issued by three counterparties. A default by any of these counterparties could have a significant adverse effect on Farmer Mac's business, operating results, and financial condition.\nFarmer Mac Guaranteed Securities and LTSPCs expose Farmer Mac to significant contingent liabilities, and Farmer Mac's ability to fulfill its obligations under its guarantees and LTSPCs may be limited.\nFarmer Mac's guarantee and purchase commitment obligations to third parties, including LTSPCs and securities guaranteed by Farmer Mac, are obligations of Farmer Mac only and are not backed by the full faith and credit of the United States, FCA, or any other agency or instrumentality of the United States other than Farmer Mac. As of December 31, 2019, Farmer Mac had $3.5 billion of contingent liabilities related to LTSPCs and securities issued to third parties and guaranteed by Farmer Mac, which represents Farmer Mac's exposure if all loans underlying these LTSPCs and guarantees defaulted and Farmer Mac recovered no value from the related collateral. If this were to occur, the funds available for payment on these guarantees and LTSPCs could be substantially less than the aggregate amount of the corresponding liabilities. As of December 31, 2019, Farmer Mac held cash, cash equivalents, and other investment securities with a fair value of $3.6 billion that could be used as a source of funds for payment on its obligations, including its guarantee and LTSPC obligations. Although Farmer Mac believes that it remains well-collateralized on the assets underlying its guarantee and LTSPC obligations to third parties and that the estimated probable losses for these obligations remain low relative to the amount available for payment of claims on these obligations, Farmer Mac's total contingent liabilities for these obligations could exceed the amount it may have available for payment of Farmer Mac's obligations, including claims\non Farmer Mac's contingent obligations. See \"Management's Discussion and Analysis-Risk Management-Credit Risk - Loans and Guarantees\" for more information on Farmer Mac's management of credit risk.\nFarmer Mac is exposed to counterparty credit risk on its investment securities that could materially and adversely affect its business, operating results, and financial condition.\nFarmer Mac maintains an investment portfolio that can be drawn upon for liquidity needs. This portfolio consists of cash and cash equivalents, U.S. Treasury securities, investment securities guaranteed by U.S. Government agencies and GSEs, and asset-backed securities principally backed by U.S. Government-guaranteed student loans, including auction rate certificates. Farmer Mac regularly reviews concentration limits to ensure that its investments are appropriately diversified and comply with policies approved by Farmer Mac's board of directors and with applicable FCA regulations, but Farmer Mac is still exposed to credit risk from issuers of the investment securities it holds, particularly to issuers to whom Farmer Mac may have a higher concentration of exposure relative to the rest of Farmer Mac's investment portfolio. For example, as of December 31, 2019, Farmer Mac held at fair value $1.1 billion of investment securities guaranteed by GSEs. A default by multiple issuers of investment securities held by Farmer Mac or by a single issuer of investment securities in which Farmer Mac is more heavily concentrated could have an adverse effect on Farmer Mac's business, operating results, and financial condition.\nFarmer Mac is exposed to counterparty risk on both its cleared and non-cleared swaps transactions that could materially and adversely affect its business, operating results, and financial condition.\nFarmer Mac uses interest rate swap contracts and hedging arrangements to manage its interest rate risk. Farmer Mac clears a significant portion of its interest rate swaps through a swap clearinghouse and uses the services of a futures commission merchant to post and receive mark-to-market margin amounts. Farmer Mac also transacts non-cleared (bilateral) derivative contracts directly with swap counterparties and posts and receives collateral to secure the market value of those contracts. A failure of any of these counterparties could cause intra-day disruption for Farmer Mac's swap operations if the failure were to prompt a termination of all or part of Farmer Mac's swap positions or if Farmer Mac were unable to quickly access margin or collateral amounts. These conditions could be exacerbated in volatile market conditions, in which the market could move against Farmer Mac's position before Farmer Mac had time to reposition its swaps. Farmer Mac's derivative contracts executed before March 2017 have market value thresholds ranging from $15 to $25 million that must be exceeded before collateral must be posted by Farmer Mac. Repositioning these swaps under current margin rules if the related counterparty were to fail could require Farmer Mac to post significant collateral within a short time frame. Any of these factors resulting from a failure of the swap clearinghouse, futures commission merchant, or any of Farmer Mac's bilateral swap counterparties could have a negative effect on Farmer Mac's operations and liquidity and could expose Farmer Mac to additional interest rate risk, which could materially and adversely affect its business, operating results, and financial condition. As of December 31, 2019, the aggregate notional balance of Farmer Mac's cleared swaps was $11.0 billion, and the aggregate notional balance of Farmer Mac's non-cleared swaps was $3.0 billion (including $0.4 billion notional amount of non-cleared swaps executed before March 2017).\nStrategic/Business Risk\nFarmer Mac's business, operating results, financial condition, and capital levels may be materially and adversely affected by external factors that may affect the demand for Farmer Mac's secondary market, the price or marketability of Farmer Mac's products, or Farmer Mac's ability to offer its products and services.\nFarmer Mac's business, operating results, financial condition, and capital levels may be materially and adversely affected by external factors that may affect the price or marketability of Farmer Mac's products and services or Farmer Mac's ability to offer its products and services, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022disruptions in the capital markets;\n\u2022competitive pressures in Farmer Mac's loan purchase and guarantee activities or in the issuance of its debt securities;\n\u2022changes in interest rates that may increase Farmer Mac's funding costs;\n\u2022market or customer perception of Farmer Mac's reputation;\n\u2022legislative or regulatory developments adversely affecting Farmer Mac's ability to offer new products, the ability or motivation of lenders to participate in Farmer Mac's lines of business, or the cost of related corporate activities;\n\u2022reduced demand for agricultural real estate loans or Rural Utilities loans due to regional, domestic, or global economic conditions; and\n\u2022expanded funding alternatives available to agricultural and rural utilities borrowers.\nAn inability to access the equity and debt capital markets could have a material adverse effect on Farmer Mac's business, operating results, financial condition, liquidity, and capital levels.\nFarmer Mac's ability to operate its business, meet its obligations, generate asset volume growth, and fulfill its statutory mission depends on Farmer Mac's capacity to remain adequately capitalized through the issuance of equity and debt securities at favorable rates and terms in the U.S. financial markets. Farmer Mac's potential for growth and future net income depends in part on Farmer Mac's ability to access equity markets to raise efficient capital. The issuance of debt securities is Farmer Mac's primary source for repaying or refinancing existing debt, and one of the primary sources of Farmer Mac's revenue is the net interest income earned from the difference, or \"spread,\" between the return received on assets held and the related borrowing costs. Farmer Mac's ability to access the debt and equity markets to raise capital, fund its assets, repay debt, and earn net interest income depends on market perception of Farmer Mac. If Farmer Mac were unable to access the U.S. financial markets to issue equity or debt securities at favorable rates and terms, Farmer Mac's business, operating results, or financial condition could be adversely affected.\nThe loss of business from key business counterparties or customers, including AgVantage counterparties, could adversely affect Farmer Mac's business and result in a decrease in its revenues and profits.\nFarmer Mac's business and ability to generate revenues and profits largely depends on its ability to purchase eligible loans or place eligible loans under guarantees or LTSPCs and to purchase or guarantee AgVantage securities. Farmer Mac conducts a significant portion of its business with a small number of business counterparties. This could result in vulnerability as existing assets pay down or mature and the status and needs of Farmer Mac's business partners evolve. In 2019, ten institutions generated\napproximately 66% of loan purchase volume in the Farm & Ranch line of business. As of December 31, 2019, approximately 92% of the $8.4 billion outstanding principal amount of AgVantage securities under Farmer Mac's Institutional Credit line of business were issued by three institutions (of which $1.1 billion and $1.5 billion will be maturing in 2020 and 2021, respectively). As of December 31, 2019, transactions with two institutions represented nearly all of the business volume under Farmer Mac's Rural Utilities line of business. Farmer Mac's ability to maintain the current relationships with its business counterparties or customers and the business generated by those business counterparties or customers is significant to Farmer Mac's business. As a result, the loss of business from any one of Farmer Mac's key business counterparties could negatively affect Farmer Mac's revenues and profitability. Farmer Mac may not be able to replace the loss of business of a key business counterparty or customer with alternate sources of business due to limitations on the types of assets eligible for the secondary market provided by Farmer Mac under its charter, which could adversely affect Farmer Mac's business and result in a decrease in its revenues and profits.\nFarmer Mac's efforts to balance fulfilling its Congressional mission with providing a return to its stockholders may result in business transactions that involve lower returns or higher risk, which could adversely affect its business, operating results, or financial condition.\nCongress created Farmer Mac to provide for a secondary market for agricultural mortgage loans, Rural Utilities loans, and the guaranteed portions of USDA-guaranteed loans. In pursuing this mission, Farmer Mac's secondary market activities are designed to:\n\u2022increase the availability of credit to rural borrowers at stable interest rates;\n\u2022provide greater liquidity and lending capacity in extending credit to rural borrowers; and\n\u2022provide an arrangement for new lending by facilitating capital market investments in funding for rural borrowers, including funds at fixed rates of interest.\nFarmer Mac's charter provides that its standards for Farm & Ranch loans shall not discriminate against small originators or small agricultural mortgage loans that are at least $50,000. The charter also requires Farmer Mac's board of directors to promote and encourage the inclusion of qualified loans for small farms and family farmers in the agricultural mortgage secondary market.\nAlthough Farmer Mac strives to undertake its mission-related activities in a manner consistent with providing an accretive return to Farmer Mac's stockholders, it is possible that these activities may contribute to a lower return to stockholders than if Farmer Mac's sole purpose were to maximize stockholder value. If Farmer Mac were to undertake activities involving greater risk to satisfy its Congressional mission or that generate lower returns or limited in the activities it was allowed to undertake, Farmer Mac's business, operating results, or financial condition could be adversely affected.\nA few stockholders who own large amounts of Farmer Mac voting common stock may seek to influence Farmer Mac's business, strategy, or board composition, and the interests of these stockholders may differ from the interests of Farmer Mac or other holders of Farmer Mac's common stock.\nThe ownership of Farmer Mac's two classes of voting common stock is concentrated in a small number of institutions. Approximately 44% of Farmer Mac's Class A voting common stock is held by three financial institutions, with 31% held by one institution. Approximately 97% of Farmer Mac's Class B voting common stock is held by five FCS institutions (two of which are related to each other through a parent-subsidiary relationship). The holders of Farmer Mac's Class A voting common stock and the holders of\nFarmer Mac's Class B voting common stock each have the right to elect one-third of the membership of Farmer Mac's board of directors. Many of these holders are rural lenders that may compete directly with each other. As long as Farmer Mac's Class A and Class B voting common stock is highly concentrated in a small number of institutions, there is the potential that these institutions will seek to influence, and may be successful in influencing, Farmer Mac's business, strategy, or board composition in a way that may not be in the best interests of either Farmer Mac or other stockholders.\nChanges in Farmer Mac's board of directors could adversely affect its business, operations, and strategy.\nFarmer Mac's charter prescribes that its board of directors consist of fifteen members. Five members are elected annually by holders of Farmer Mac's Class A voting common stock, five members are elected annually by holders of Farmer Mac's Class B voting common stock, and five members are appointed by the President of the United States with the advice and consent of the United States Senate (one of whom is designated as the chair of the board of directors). Farmer Mac's Presidentially-appointed members serve at the pleasure of the President of the United States and therefore could be replaced at any time. If, as a result of annual elections or new Presidential appointments to the board, Farmer Mac were to experience a significant turnover in the membership of its board of directors within a short time and the new directors were not able to become proficient quickly in Farmer Mac's business, operations, and strategies, the effectiveness of Farmer Mac's board of directors in overseeing the business, affairs, strategies, and operations of Farmer Mac could be adversely affected. In 2019, four new individuals joined Farmer Mac's board of directors, two of whom were elected by holders of voting common stock in May 2019, one of whom was designated by the board in December 2019 to fill a vacancy created by the death of a former director, and one of whom was appointed by the President of the United States after confirmation by the U.S. Senate in December 2019 (which director was later designated as chair of the board in January 2020).\nOperational Risk\nThe inadequacy or failure of Farmer Mac's operational systems, cybersecurity plan, internal controls or processes, or infrastructure, or those of third parties, could have a material adverse effect on Farmer Mac's business, liquidity, operating results, reputation, or financial condition.\nFarmer Mac is exposed to operational risk due to the complex nature of its business operations and the processes and systems used to undertake its business activities and comply with regulatory requirements. Operational risk refers to the risk of loss to Farmer Mac or damage to its reputation resulting from:\n\u2022inadequate or failed internal processes, systems, cybersecurity plan, or infrastructure;\n\u2022Farmer Mac's inability to successfully implement enhancements to any of these or migrate to new systems or infrastructure;\n\u2022failed execution based on human error;\n\u2022inadequate or failed internal controls or processes that Farmer Mac has in place to detect or prevent fraud; or\n\u2022external events, including a disruption involving physical site access, cyber incidents, catastrophic events, natural disasters, terrorist activities, or disease pandemics.\nFarmer Mac relies on business processes that largely depend on people, technology, and the use of complex systems and models to manage its business, process a high volume of daily transactions, and generate the records on which Farmer Mac's financial statements are based. Inadequacies or failures in\nFarmer Mac's internal processes, personnel, systems, cybersecurity plan, or infrastructure could lead to a significant disruption in its business operations, financial and economic loss, errors in its financial statements, impairment of its liquidity, liability or service interruptions to its customers, increased regulatory or legislative scrutiny, or reputational damage.\nThe potential for operational risk exposure also exists as a result of Farmer Mac's interactions with, and reliance on, third parties. Farmer Mac's business relies on its ability to process, evaluate, and interpret significant amounts of information, much of which is provided by third parties. If the financial, accounting, data processing, backup, information technology, or other operating systems and infrastructure of third parties with whom Farmer Mac interacts or upon whom it relies fail to operate properly or are disrupted, then Farmer Mac's operations and its ability to conduct its business in the ordinary course may be adversely affected. Farmer Mac's ability to implement safeguards preventing disruption to third party systems or infrastructure is more limited than for its own systems or infrastructure.\nFarmer Mac conducts many of its critical business operations and activities in its main office in Washington, D.C. This concentration of Farmer Mac's personnel, technology, and facilities increases Farmer Mac's risk of financial or other loss. Although Farmer Mac routinely reviews, updates, and tests its business continuity and disaster recovery plans, these plans may not be sufficient to mitigate all potential business continuity risks. Farmer Mac's recovery capabilities or those of third parties with whom it interacts or upon whom it relies could be overwhelmed by a disruption in infrastructure or a catastrophic event outside of its control. If Farmer Mac is not able to resume business operations or its employees are unable to communicate with each other in the event of a disruption, Farmer Mac may not be able to successfully implement its continuity and disaster recovery plans, which could have a material adverse effect on Farmer Mac's business, liquidity, operating results, reputation, or financial condition.\nAny significant deficiency, failure, interruption, or breach in Farmer Mac's information systems, including the occurrence of successful cyber-attacks or a significant deficiency in Farmer Mac's cybersecurity plan, could result in a loss of business, damage to Farmer Mac's reputation, the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information, or increased costs or liability to Farmer Mac, which could adversely affect Farmer Mac's business, operating results, or financial condition.\nFarmer Mac relies heavily on information systems, including from third parties, to conduct and manage its business operations. These information systems encompass an integrated set of hardware, software, infrastructure, and trained personnel organized to facilitate the planning, control, coordination, and decision-making processes occurring within Farmer Mac. As Farmer Mac's reliance on information systems has increased, so have the risks posed to its systems, including the effect of events that would threaten the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of Farmer Mac's information resources, known as cyber incidents. Like many other financial institutions, Farmer Mac faces regular attempts by third parties to gain unauthorized access to its information systems. Farmer Mac has experienced cyber incidents that have not had a material effect on its business, operating results, or financial condition, but it is not possible to predict the effect on Farmer Mac of any future cyber incidents.\nFarmer Mac has undertaken preventive measures and devotes what Farmer Mac believes to be adequate resources to design, manage, monitor, deploy, and assess its information systems and cybersecurity program consistent with industry best practices. Specifically, Farmer Mac's cybersecurity program assesses Farmer Mac's cybersecurity risk profile and seeks to ensure there are sufficient measures and safeguards in place to mitigate the risks identified. However, Farmer Mac may not be able to prevent,\naddress on a timely and adequate basis, or fully mitigate the negative effects associated with a successful cyber-attack on Farmer Mac's or its third-party information systems, which could adversely affect Farmer Mac's business, operating results, reputation, or financial condition. Because the methods used to launch cyber-attacks change often or, in some cases, are not recognized until launched, Farmer Mac also may be unable to implement effective preventative measures or proactively address these methods until they are discovered. A failure or interruption in any of Farmer Mac's information systems could cause a disruption or malfunction of its operations, which could adversely affect Farmer Mac's ability to conduct business with its customers, loan servicers, service providers, or other counterparties, result in financial loss, or damage Farmer Mac's reputation.\nThe secure transmission, processing, and storage of Farmer Mac's confidential, proprietary, and other information assets through Farmer Mac's or its third-party information systems is instrumental to Farmer Mac's operations. Any action that results in unauthorized access to Farmer Mac's information systems by third parties, including through viruses, malware, cyber-attacks, or other information system breaches, could disrupt Farmer Mac's operations, corrupt its data, or cause the misappropriation, unauthorized release, loss, or destruction of the confidential, proprietary, or other information assets of its customers, loan servicers, service providers, or other counterparties. Unauthorized access to Farmer Mac's information systems or sensitive information could cause Farmer Mac to experience prolonged operational interruption, damage to its reputation, material loss of business, legal liability, or increased costs from private data exposure, which could adversely affect Farmer Mac's business, operating results, reputation, or financial condition\nFailure by Farmer Mac's third-party loan servicers, information systems providers, and other service providers to protect confidential information from unauthorized access and dissemination could result in liability for Farmer Mac or damage Farmer Mac's reputation, which could have a negative effect on Farmer Mac's business, operating results, or financial condition.\nFarmer Mac relies on third parties, including loan servicers, information systems providers, software-as-a-service (SaaS) providers, cloud computing service providers, and other service providers, to perform various functions for Farmer Mac. In the course of these activities, these third parties collect and have access to a variety of confidential or proprietary information, including, among others, sensitive financial information, information presented to Farmer Mac's board of directors, information provided to Farmer Mac's regulators, information about the lenders that participate in Farmer Mac's lines of business, and personal financial information about the borrowers with loans in one of Farmer Mac's lines of business. Any unauthorized access to or cyber incidents affecting the information systems of one of these third parties, including through viruses, malware, cyber-attacks, or other information system breaches, could result in the misappropriation and inappropriate release of the confidential or proprietary information entrusted to Farmer Mac. Prior instances of unauthorized access to Farmer Mac's third parties' information systems have not resulted in the misappropriation or inappropriate release of the confidential or proprietary information entrusted to Farmer Mac, although it is not possible to predict the consequences of any future instances. Any employees or agents of Farmer Mac's third parties that have authorized access to confidential or proprietary information could also inadvertently or erroneously disseminate the information to unauthorized third parties. Any unauthorized access to or dissemination of confidential or proprietary information could result in liability for Farmer Mac or damage Farmer Mac's reputation, either of which could have a negative effect on Farmer Mac's business, operating results, or financial condition.\nIf Farmer Mac's management of risk associated with its loan assets and investment securities based on model assumptions and output is not effective, its business, operating results, financial condition, or capital levels could be materially adversely affected.\nFarmer Mac continually develops and adapts profitability and risk management models to adequately address a wide range of possible market developments. Some of Farmer Mac's qualitative tools and metrics for managing risk are based on its use of observed historical market behavior. Farmer Mac applies statistical and other tools to these observations to quantify its risks. These tools and metrics may fail to predict future or unanticipated risk or may not be effective in mitigating its risk exposure in all economic market environments or against all types of risk, which could expose Farmer Mac to material unanticipated losses. The inability of Farmer Mac to effectively identify and manage the risks inherent in its business could have a material adverse effect on its business, operating results, financial condition, or capital levels.\nMarket Risk\nFarmer Mac is exposed to interest rate risk that could materially and adversely affect its business, operating results, or financial condition.\nFarmer Mac is subject to interest rate risk due to the timing differences in the cash flows of the assets it holds and the liabilities issued to fund those assets. Farmer Mac's primary strategy for managing interest rate risk is to fund asset purchases with liabilities that have similar duration and convexity characteristics so that they will perform similarly as interest rates change. However, the ability of borrowers to prepay their loans before the scheduled maturities increases the likelihood of asset and liability cash flow mismatches. In a changing interest rate environment, these cash flow mismatches affect Farmer Mac's earnings if assets repay sooner than expected and the resulting cash flows must be reinvested in lower-yielding investments, particularly if Farmer Mac's related funding costs cannot be correspondingly repaid. Conversely, if assets repay more slowly than anticipated and the associated debt issued to fund the assets must be reissued at a higher interest rate, Farmer Mac's earnings could be adversely affected.\nFarmer Mac is also subject to repricing risk, which is the risk that Farmer Mac's funding cost relative to a benchmark index (for example, the London Interbank Offered Rate known as \"LIBOR\") will increase from the time the initial funding was issued and the time the liabilities are re-funded. This risk arises from maturity mismatches between assets and liabilities where assets with longer maturities must be re-funded. A significant increase in the difference between Farmer Mac's funding cost relative to the benchmark index, including LIBOR, could compress spread income on the assets Farmer Mac holds and seeks to re-fund with the higher cost funding. Widespread compression within a short timeframe could have an adverse effect on Farmer Mac's operating results or financial condition.\nChanges in interest rates relative to Farmer Mac's management of interest rate risk through derivatives may cause volatility in financial results and capital levels and may adversely affect Farmer Mac's net income, liquidity position, or operating results.\nFarmer Mac enters into financial derivatives transactions to hedge interest rate risks inherent in its business and carries its financial derivatives at fair value in its consolidated financial statements. Although Farmer Mac's financial derivatives provide economic hedges of interest rate risk, changes in the fair values of financial derivatives can cause volatility in net income and in capital, particularly if those financial derivatives are not designated in hedge accounting relationships or if there is any ineffectiveness in a hedge accounting relationship. As interest rates increase or decrease, the fair values of Farmer Mac's\nderivatives change based on the position Farmer Mac holds relative to the specific characteristics of the derivative. Farmer Mac's core capital available to meet its statutory minimum capital requirement can be affected by changes in the fair values of financial derivatives, as noted above. Adverse changes in the fair values of Farmer Mac's financial derivatives that are not designated in hedge accounting relationships and any hedge ineffectiveness that results in a loss would reduce the amount of core capital available to meet this requirement. In 2019 and 2018, Farmer Mac recorded gains of $10.1 million and $8.0 million, respectively, from changes in the fair values of its financial derivatives as a result of movements in interest rates during those years. In addition, Farmer Mac recorded losses of $7.9 million and gains of $4.9 million in 2019 and 2018, respectively, related to ineffectiveness in hedge accounting relationships.\nChanges in interest rates have required, and in the future may require, Farmer Mac to post cash or investment securities to collateralize its derivative exposures due to corresponding changes in the fair market values of these derivatives. If changes in interest rates were to result in a significant decrease in the fair value of Farmer Mac's derivatives, Farmer Mac would be required to post cash, cash equivalents, or investment securities, possibly within a short period of time, to satisfy its obligations under its derivatives contracts. As of December 31, 2019, Farmer Mac posted $0.5 million of cash and $131.7 million of investment securities as collateral for its derivatives in net liability positions. If Farmer Mac is required to fully collateralize a significant portion of its derivatives in an adverse interest rate environment, it could have a material adverse effect on Farmer Mac's liquidity position or operating results.\nThe reform, replacement, or discontinuation of the LIBOR benchmark interest rate could adversely affect Farmer Mac's business, operating results, or financial condition.\nIn July 2017, the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021 and will support the LIBOR indexes through 2021 to allow for a transition to any alternative reference rates. This announcement indicates that the continuation of LIBOR in its current form will not be guaranteed after 2021, and it appears likely that LIBOR will be discontinued or modified by 2021. Farmer Mac is evaluating the potential effect on its business of the replacement of the LIBOR benchmark interest rate, including the possibility of replacement benchmark interest rates. As of December 31, 2019, Farmer Mac held $5.1 billion of floating rate assets in its lines of business and its investment portfolio, had issued $3.8 billion of floating rate debt, and had entered into $13.8 billion notional amount of interest rate swaps, each of which reset based on LIBOR. In addition, Farmer Mac's Series C Preferred Stock will be indexed to LIBOR after July 17, 2024. The market transition away from LIBOR and towards an alternative benchmark interest rate that may be developed is expected to be complicated and may require the development of term and credit adjustments to accommodate for differences between the benchmark interest rates. The introduction of an alternative reference rate may also introduce additional re-funding and repricing risk for Farmer Mac if an alternative benchmark interest rate index is being used along with LIBOR during a transition period. If LIBOR is discontinued and an alternative benchmark interest rate does not become widely used or accepted in place of LIBOR, then there may be uncertainty or differences in the calculation of the applicable interest rate or payment amounts depending on the terms of the governing instruments for Farmer Mac's assets and liabilities. This could result in different financial performance for previously booked transactions, require different hedging strategies, or require renegotiation of previously booked transactions, and may affect Farmer Mac's existing transaction data, products, systems, operations and pricing processes, which could adversely affect Farmer Mac's business, operating results, or financial condition.\nFinancial Risk\nIncorrect estimates and assumptions by management in preparing financial statements could adversely affect Farmer Mac's business, operating results, reported assets and liabilities, financial condition, reputation, or capital levels.\nFarmer Mac's accounting policies and methods are fundamental to how it records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. Some of these policies and methods require management to make estimates and assumptions in preparing Farmer Mac's consolidated financial statements. Incorrect estimates and assumptions by management in connection with preparing Farmer Mac's consolidated financial statements could adversely affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of income and expenses. For example, as of December 31, 2019, Farmer Mac's assets and liabilities recorded at fair value included financial instruments valued at $7.2 billion whose fair values management estimated in the absence of readily observable fair values (in other words, level 3). These financial instruments measured with significant unobservable inputs represented 33% of total assets and 71% of financial instruments measured at fair value as of December 31, 2019. More information about fair value measurement is included in \"Management's Discussion and Analysis-Critical Accounting Policies-Fair Value Measurement.\" If management makes incorrect assumptions or estimates that result in understating or overstating reported financial results, it could materially and adversely affect Farmer Mac's business, operating results, reported assets and liabilities, financial condition, reputation, or capital levels.\nChanges in accounting standards or in applying accounting policies could adversely affect Farmer Mac's business, operating results, financial condition, or capital levels.\nFarmer Mac is subject to the requirements of entities that set and interpret the accounting standards governing the preparation of Farmer Mac's consolidated financial statements. These entities, which include the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\"), the SEC, and Farmer Mac's independent registered public accounting firm, may add new accounting standards or change their interpretations of how those standards should be applied. These changes may be difficult to predict and could affect how Farmer Mac records and reports its financial condition and results of operations. In some cases, Farmer Mac could be required to apply a new or revised standard retrospectively, potentially resulting in changes to previously reported financial results. For example, the FASB issued a new accounting standard in 2016, effective for Farmer Mac for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, that requires entities to measure credit losses based on an \"expected credit loss\" approach rather than an \"incurred loss\" approach currently required under GAAP. The new approach requires entities to measure all expected credit losses for financial assets carried at amortized cost and debt securities classified as available-for-sale, based on historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable forecasts of collectability. This new accounting standard could cause increases and more volatility in Farmer Mac's provision for credit losses and could adversely affect Farmer Mac's business, operating results, financial condition, or capital levels. See Note 2(o) to the consolidated financial statements for more information about this new accounting standard.\nChanges in the value or composition of Farmer Mac's investment securities could adversely affect Farmer Mac's business, operating results, financial condition, or capital levels.\nDeterioration in financial or credit market conditions could reduce the fair value of Farmer Mac's investment securities, particularly those securities that are less liquid and more subject to market\nvariability. Some securities owned by Farmer Mac, including auction-rate certificates, do not have well-established secondary trading markets, making it more difficult to estimate current fair values for those securities. This requires Farmer Mac to rely on market observations and internal models to estimate the fair values of its investment securities and to determine whether credit losses exist. However, available market data may not reflect the actual sale conditions Farmer Mac may face when selling its investment securities, particularly in adverse financial market conditions. Internal models require Farmer Mac to exercise judgment about estimates and assumptions used in the models. If Farmer Mac uses unreliable market data or incorrect estimates or assumptions in its internal models to estimate the fair value of its investment securities, those estimates could adversely affect results of operations during the reporting period. Also, if Farmer Mac decides to sell securities in its investment portfolio, the price ultimately realized will depend on the demand and liquidity in the market at the time of sale, which could be significantly less than Farmer Mac's estimates for fair value. Failure to accurately estimate the fair value of Farmer Mac's investment securities could adversely affect Farmer Mac's business, operating results, financial condition, or capital levels.\nThe trading price for Farmer Mac's Class C non-voting common stock may be volatile due to market influences, trading volume, the effects of equity awards for Farmer Mac's officers, directors, and employees, or sales of significant amounts of the stock by large holders.\nThe trading price of Farmer Mac's Class C non-voting common stock (\"Class C stock\") has at times experienced substantial price volatility and may continue to be volatile. For example, from January 2019 to December 2019, the closing price of the Class C stock ranged from $62.55 per share to $87.65 per share. The trading price may fluctuate in response to various factors, including short sales, hedging, the presence or absence of a share repurchase program, stock market influences in general that are unrelated to Farmer Mac's operating performance, or sales of significant amounts of the stock by large holders. Farmer Mac typically grants equity awards each year that are based on the Class C stock, including grants that vest over time or upon the achievement of specified performance goals. Sales of stock acquired upon vesting or the exercise of equity awards by Farmer Mac's officers, directors, or employees, whether under an established trading plan or otherwise, could adversely affect the trading price of the Class C stock.\nAs to the potential effect of sales of significant amounts of the Class C stock by large holders, Farmer Mac is aware of a regulatory action that could result in significant sales by Zions Bancorporation, National Association (\u201cZions\u201d), which held 840,000 shares of Class C stock (approximately 9% of the outstanding shares) as of December 31, 2019. In a letter granting conditional approval of a proposed merger involving Zions, the applicable federal regulator found that, although Zions had requested to maintain its ownership in Farmer Mac\u2019s Class C stock after the merger, the continued ownership of Class C stock (held by Zions' holding company before the merger) would not be a permissible investment for the surviving national bank entity of the merger based on then-current precedent. Under the terms of the conditional approval letter, Zions must divest its ownership of the Class C stock by September 30, 2020 unless the regulator determines separately that it would be permissible for Zions to retain some or all of those shares or to divest on a different schedule. If such a separate determination is not made by the regulator and Zions sells all or a significant amount of its remaining Class C stock, those sales could adversely affect the trading price of Farmer Mac\u2019s Class C stock. Zions sold approximately 7,000 shares of its Class C stock between February 3 and February 11, 2020, as reported in Zions\u2019 filings with the SEC. The merger condition related to Zions\u2019 ownership of Class C stock does not apply to Zions\u2019 ownership of 322,100 shares of Farmer Mac\u2019s Class A voting common stock (approximately 31.25% of the outstanding shares of that stock as of December 31, 2019). For more information about Zions\u2019 transactions and relationships with Farmer Mac, see \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of\nOperations-Results of Operations-Related Party Transactions\" and Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements.\nAll of these factors may be exacerbated during periods of low trading volume for Farmer Mac's Class C stock, which averaged approximately 40,000 shares daily during 2019, and may have a prolonged negative effect on its trading price or increase price volatility.\nRegulatory and Compliance Risk\nFarmer Mac and many of its business partners are subject to comprehensive government regulation, and changes to the laws and regulations to which Farmer Mac or its business partners are subject could adversely affect Farmer Mac's business, operating results, reputation, or financial condition.\nFarmer Mac was established under a statutory charter that is subject to amendment by the U.S. Congress at any time and is regulated by various government agencies, including the FCA and the SEC. As a result, Farmer Mac is exposed to the risk of legal or regulatory penalties; material financial loss including fines, judgments, damages, and/or settlements; or loss of reputation if it fails to comply with applicable laws, regulations, rules, regulatory requests, self-regulatory organization standards, or codes of conduct applicable to its business activities. Future legislative or regulatory actions affecting Farmer Mac's statutory charter or its business activities, including increased regulatory supervision, and any required changes to Farmer Mac's business or operations resulting from such actions, could result in a financial loss for Farmer Mac or otherwise reduce its profitability, impose additional compliance and other costs on Farmer Mac, limit the products offered by Farmer Mac or its ability to pursue business opportunities in which it might otherwise consider engaging, curtail business activities in which it is currently engaged, affect the value of assets that Farmer Mac holds, or otherwise adversely affect Farmer Mac's business, results of operations, reputation, or financial condition.\nThe financial services industry, in which most of Farmer Mac's business counterparties and customers operate, is subject to significant legislation and regulations. Specifically, to the extent that current or future legislation, regulations, or supervisory activities affect the activities of banks, insurance companies, other rural lenders, derivatives counterparties, clearinghouses, securities dealers, or other regulated entities that constitute a large portion of Farmer Mac's business counterparties or customers, Farmer Mac could experience loss of business or business opportunities, increased compliance costs, disadvantageous business terms in its dealings with counterparties, and unfavorable changes to its business practices or activities. As a result, Farmer Mac's business, operating results, reputation, or financial condition could be adversely affected.\nFarmer Mac is subject to capital requirements that are subject to change, and failure to meet those requirements could result in supervisory measures or the inability of Farmer Mac to declare dividends, or otherwise materially and adversely affect Farmer Mac's business, operating results, or financial condition.\nFarmer Mac is required by statute and regulation to maintain certain capital levels. Any inability by Farmer Mac to meet these capital requirements could result in supervisory measures by FCA, adversely affect Farmer Mac's ability to declare dividends on its common and preferred stock, or otherwise materially and adversely affect Farmer Mac's business, operating results, or financial condition. Also, as required by an FCA regulation on capital planning, Farmer Mac has adopted a policy to maintain a sufficient level of Tier 1 capital and to restrict paying Tier 1-eligible dividends if Tier 1 capital falls below\nspecified thresholds. For more information about Farmer Mac's capital requirements, including the Tier 1 capital requirement, see \"Business-Government Regulation of Farmer Mac-Regulation-Capital Standards.\" Factors that could adversely affect the adequacy of Farmer Mac's capital levels in the future, and which may be beyond Farmer Mac's control, include:\n\u2022credit losses or other-than-temporary impairment charges;\n\u2022adverse changes in interest rates or credit spreads;\n\u2022the need to increase the level of the allowance for losses on loans;\n\u2022legislative or regulatory actions that increase Farmer Mac's capital requirements; and\n\u2022changes in GAAP.\nPolitical Risk\nFarmer Mac is a GSE that may be materially and adversely affected by legislative or political developments that may affect the ongoing operations or continued existence of GSEs.\nFarmer Mac is a GSE that is governed by a statutory charter, which is subject to amendment by the U.S. Congress at any time, and regulated by government agencies, including the FCA and the SEC. Although Farmer Mac is not aware of any pending legislative proposals that would adversely affect the way Farmer Mac conducts its business or the status of Farmer Mac as a GSE, Farmer Mac's ability to effectively conduct its business is subject to risks and uncertainties related to legislative or political developments that may affect the status or operations of GSEs generally. Farmer Mac cannot predict whether or when legislative initiatives (including any relating to housing GSEs) may commence that, if successful, could negatively affect the status of Farmer Mac as a GSE or how Farmer Mac operates, and which could have a material and adverse effect on Farmer Mac's business, operating results, financial condition, or capital levels. See \"Business-Government Regulation of Farmer Mac\" for more information about the rules and regulations governing Farmer Mac's activities.\nHuman Capital Risk\nFarmer Mac's ability to attract and retain motivated and qualified employees is critical to the success of its business, and significant or sustained disruption in the continuity of Farmer Mac's employees or executive leaders may materially adversely affect Farmer Mac's business performance, operations, financial condition, or reputation.\nFarmer Mac relies on its employees' breadth and depth of knowledge of Farmer Mac and the industries in which it operates to run its business operations successfully. If Farmer Mac is unable to continue to retain and attract motivated and qualified employees or does not have adequate human capital to achieve its business objectives, Farmer Mac's business performance, operations, financial condition, or reputation could be materially adversely affected. A significant disruption in the continuity of Farmer Mac's employees or any significant executive leadership change could also result in a loss of productivity and affect Farmer Mac's ability to successfully execute business strategies by creating uncertainty or instability or requiring Farmer Mac to divert or expend more resources to replace personnel. For example, after the termination of employment of Farmer Mac's former President and Chief Executive Officer in December 2017, Farmer Mac expended significant resources and attention to identify his successor. Loss of key leadership personnel could also damage the public or market perception of Farmer Mac or result in the departure of other executives or key employees. Any of these factors could materially adversely affect Farmer Mac's business performance, operations, financial condition, or reputation.\nAny of the risks described in this section could materially and adversely affect Farmer Mac's business, operating results, financial condition, reputation, capital levels, and future earnings.
