{"cik": "1082506", "company": "Great Elm Capital Group, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2019-09-27", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors.\nOur business is subject to a number of risks. You should carefully consider the following risk factors, together with all of the other information included in this report, before you decide whether to invest in our securities. The following risks are not the only risks we face. If any of the following risks occurs or continues to occur, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of our common shares could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe have a limited track record in the investment management, durable medical equipment and real estate businesses, and provide no assurance as to our acquisition and investment program. We entered the investment management business in November 2016, we entered the real estate business in March 2018, and we entered the durable medical equipment business in September 2018. Accordingly, there is limited historical information about our performance.\nWe have plans to make significant investments and will continue to explore opportunities in these and other sectors but cannot provide specificity as to our future investments or financing plans.\nThese and other factors, including the other risk factors described in this report, make it difficult for you and other market participants to value our company and our prospects. We are unaware of any comparable company that securities analysts can use to benchmark our performance and valuation. We cannot give any assurance that any of the uncertainties or risk factors in this report will be favorably resolved.\nOur growth strategy may not be successful. The process to identify potential investment opportunities and acquisition targets, to investigate and evaluate the future returns therefrom and business prospects thereof and to negotiate definitive agreements with respect to such transactions on mutually acceptable terms can be time consuming and costly. We are likely to encounter intense competition from other companies with similar business objectives to ours, including private equity and venture capital funds, sovereign wealth funds, special purpose acquisition companies, investment firms with significantly greater financial and other resources and operating businesses competing for acquisitions. Many of these companies are well established, well financed and have extensive experience in identifying and effecting business combinations.\nThe Company continually evaluates its assets and investments relative to other market opportunities in order to maximize shareholder value. As a result, the Company may purchase new assets or businesses or sell existing assets or businesses at any time. If such a purchase or sale is not successfully completed, integrated or managed effectively, or does not result in the benefits or cost savings we expect, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected.\nBecause we will consider investments in different industries, you have no basis at this time to ascertain the merits or risks of any business that we may ultimately invest in or seek to acquire. We are a holding company seeking to acquire assets and businesses. We are not limited to acquisitions and/or investments in any particular industry or type of business. Accordingly, there is no current basis for you to evaluate the possible merits or risks of the particular industry in which we may ultimately invest or the target businesses in which we may ultimately invest or seek to acquire. We may not properly assess all of the significant risks present in that opportunity. Even if we properly assess those risks, some of them may be outside of our control or ability to affect. Except as required under the Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (Nasdaq) rules and applicable law, we will not seek stockholder approval of any investment or acquisition that we may pursue, so you will most likely not be provided with an opportunity to evaluate the specific merits or risks of such a transaction before we become committed to the transaction. Our business, financial condition and results of operations are dependent upon our investments. Any material adverse change in one of our investments or in a particular industry in which we invest may cause material adverse changes to our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, concentration of capital we devote to a particular investment or industry may increase the risk that such investment could significantly impact our financial condition and results of operations, possibly in a material adverse way.\nSubsequent to an investment, we may be required to take write-downs or write-offs, restructuring and impairment or other charges that could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition, results of operations and our share price, which could cause you to lose some or all of your investment. Even if we conduct extensive due diligence on a target business that we invest in, we cannot assure you that this diligence will identify all material issues that may be present inside a particular target business, that it would be possible to uncover all material issues through a customary amount of due diligence, or that factors outside of the target business or outside of our control will not later arise. As a result of these factors, we may be forced to later write-down or write-off assets, restructure our operations, or incur impairment or other charges that could result in us reporting losses. Even if our due diligence successfully identifies certain risks, unexpected risks may arise and previously known risks may materialize in a manner not consistent with our preliminary risk analysis. Even though these charges may be non-cash items and not have an immediate impact on our liquidity, the fact that we report charges of this nature could contribute to negative market perceptions about us or our securities. In addition, charges of this nature may cause us to violate covenants under our debt agreements. Accordingly, you could suffer a significant reduction in the value of your shares.\nWe may not correctly assess the management teams of the businesses we invest in. The value of the businesses we invest in is driven by the quality of the leaders of those businesses. When evaluating the desirability of a prospective target business, our ability to assess the target business\u2019 management may be limited due to a lack of time, resources or information. Our assessment of the capabilities of the target\u2019s management, therefore, may prove to be incorrect and such management may lack the skills, qualifications or abilities we expected. Should the target\u2019s management not possess the necessary skills, qualifications or abilities, the operations and profitability of that business will be negatively impacted. In addition, we may acquire private, non-public companies, with unsophisticated accounting operations and personnel.\nOur ability to successfully grow our business will be dependent upon the efforts of our key personnel. The loss of key personnel could negatively impact the operations and profitability of our business. Our ability to successfully effect our growth strategy is dependent upon the efforts of our key personnel. The loss of our key personnel could severely negatively impact the operations and profitability of our business.\nIncreased competition may adversely affect our revenues, profitability and staffing. All aspects of our business are intensely competitive. We will compete directly with a number of BDCs, private equity and venture capital funds, financial investment firms and special purpose acquisition companies. There has been increasing competition from others offering financial services, including services based on technological innovations. Increased competition or an adverse change in our competitive position could lead to a reduction of business and therefore a reduction of revenues and profits.\nCompetition also extends to the hiring and retention of highly skilled management and employees. A competitor may be successful in hiring away employees, which may result in us losing business formerly serviced by such employees. Competition can also increase our costs of recruiting, hiring and retaining the employees we need to effectively operate our business.\nChanging conditions in financial markets and the economy could impact us through decreased revenues, losses or other adverse consequences. Global or regional changes in the financial markets or economic conditions could adversely affect our business in many ways, including the following:\n\u25aa\nLimitations on the availability of credit could affect our ability to borrow on a secured or unsecured basis, which may adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations. Global market and economic conditions have been disrupted and volatile in the last several years and may be in the future. Our cost and availability of funding could be affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads.\n\u25aa\nShould one of our customers, debtors or competitors fail, our business prospects and revenue could be negatively impacted due to negative market sentiment causing customers to cease doing business with us and our lenders to cease extending credit to us, which could adversely affect our business, funding and liquidity.\nWe may not be able to generate sufficient taxable income to fully realize our deferred tax asset, which would also have to be reduced if U.S. federal income tax rates are lowered. At June 30, 2019, we had NOL carryforwards of approximately $1.6 billion. If we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income, we will not be able to fully realize the full amount of the deferred tax asset. If we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income prior to the expiration of our U.S. federal NOL carryforwards, the NOL carryforwards would expire unused. Our projections of future taxable income required to fully realize the recorded amount of the gross deferred tax asset reflect numerous assumptions about our operating businesses and investments and are subject to change as conditions change specific to our business units, investments or general economic conditions. Changes that are adverse to us could result in the need to increase the deferred tax asset valuation allowance resulting in a charge to results of operations and a decrease to stockholders\u2019 equity. In addition, if U.S. federal income tax rates are lowered, we would be required to reduce our net deferred tax asset with a corresponding reduction to earnings during the period.\nIf our tax filing positions were to be challenged by federal, state and local or foreign tax jurisdictions, we may not be wholly successful in defending our tax filing positions. We record reserves for unrecognized tax benefits based on our assessment of the probability of successfully sustaining tax filing positions. Management exercises significant judgment when assessing the probability of successfully sustaining tax filing positions, and in determining whether a contingent tax liability should be recorded and, if so, estimating the amount. If our tax filing positions are successfully challenged, payments could be required that are in excess of reserved amounts or we may be required to reduce the carrying amount of our net deferred tax asset, either of which result could be significant to our financial position, cash balances and results of operations.\nWe may issue notes or other debt securities, or otherwise incur substantial debt, which may adversely affect our leverage and financial condition and thus negatively impact the value of our stockholders\u2019 investment in us. We may choose to incur substantial debt to finance our growth plans. The incurrence of debt could have a variety of negative effects, including:\n\u25aa\ndefault and foreclosure on our assets if our operating cash flows are insufficient to repay our debt obligations;\n\u25aa\nacceleration of our obligations to repay the indebtedness even if we make all principal and interest payments when due if we breach covenants that require the maintenance of financial ratios or reserves without a waiver or renegotiation of that covenant;\n\u25aa\nour immediate payment of all principal and accrued interest, if any, if the debt is payable on demand;\n\u25aa\nour inability to pay dividends on our common stock;\n\u25aa\nusing a substantial portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on our debt, which will reduce the funds available for dividends on our common stock (if declared), expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions and other general corporate purposes;\n\u25aa\nlimitations on our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business and in the industry in which we operate;\n\u25aa\nincreased vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation; and\n\u25aa\nlimitation on our ability to borrow additional amounts for expenses, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, execution of our strategy and other purposes and other disadvantages compared to our competitors who have less debt.\nThere are conflicts of interest involving MAST Capital Management, LLC (MAST Capital) and its affiliates, that own approximately 7.9% of the Company\u2019s outstanding stock, and are participants in material transactions. These conflicts of interest, include, among others:\n\u25aa\nFunds managed by MAST Capital are a significant stockholder and appointed two members of our Board;\n\u25aa\nFunds managed by MAST Capital owned all of our previously outstanding senior secured notes which we settled in October 2016 for total cash payments of approximately $39.8 million;\n\u25aa\nPeter A. Reed was a partner in MAST Capital, became our Chief Executive Officer in September 2017, is a member of our Board, Chief Executive Officer of GECC and Chief Investment Officer of GECM;\n\u25aa\nAdam M. Kleinman was a partner in MAST Capital, became our President and Chief Operating Officer in March 2018, is Chief Compliance Officer of GECC and Chief Operating Officer, Chief Compliance Officer and General Counsel of GECM;\n\u25aa\nIn connection with hiring the MAST Capital team, we took over a substantial portion of the operating expenses of MAST Capital and those transactions were restructured in September 2017;\n\u25aa\nWe assumed certain of MAST Capital\u2019s commercial contracts, leases and other obligations; and\n\u25aa\nMAST Capital will receive compensation in connection with GECC\u2019s business through its equity ownership of GECC GP Corp. (GP Corp.) and a note payable of GP Corp.\nThese conflicts of interest may result in arrangements that are not as favorable to us as those available on an arms-length basis. The significant ownership stake held by certain private investment funds managed by MAST Capital (the MAST Funds) may result in MAST Capital having undue influence over our affairs. These conflicts of interests may adversely affect the perception of our company, the value of our common stock or the willingness of new investors to invest in us.\nThe financial services industry is subject to extensive regulation, including recent legislation and new or pending regulation, which may significantly affect our business. The financial services industry is subject to extensive laws, rules and regulations. In recent years in particular, there has been significant legislation and increased regulation affecting the financial services industry. These legislative and regulatory initiatives affect us, our competitors, our managed investment products and our customers. These changes could have an effect on our revenue and profitability, limit our ability to pursue business opportunities, impact the value of assets that we hold, require us to change certain business practices, impose additional costs on us, and otherwise adversely affect our business. Accordingly, we cannot provide assurance that legislation and regulation will not eventually have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nFirms that engage in securities and derivatives trading and wealth and asset management must comply with the laws, rules and regulations imposed by national and state governments and regulatory and self-regulatory bodies with jurisdiction over such activities. Such laws, rules and regulations cover all aspects of the financial services business, including, but not limited to, sales and trading methods, trade practices, use and safekeeping of customers\u2019 funds and securities, capital structure, anti-money laundering and anti-bribery and corruption efforts, recordkeeping and the conduct of directors, officers and employees. Regulators will supervise our business activities to monitor compliance with laws, rules and regulations of the relevant jurisdiction. In addition, if there are instances in which our regulators question our compliance with laws, rules, and regulations, they may investigate the facts and circumstances to determine whether we have complied.\nWe may incur losses if our risk management is not effective. We seek to monitor and control our risk exposure. Our risk management processes and procedures are designed to limit our exposure to acceptable levels as we conduct our business. While we intend to employ various risk monitoring and risk mitigation techniques, those techniques and the judgments that accompany their application, including risk tolerance determinations, cannot anticipate every economic and financial outcome or the specifics and timing of such outcomes. As a result, we may incur losses notwithstanding our risk management processes and procedures.\nOperational risks may disrupt our business, result in regulatory action against us or limit our growth. Our businesses will be highly dependent on our ability to process, on a daily basis, transactions across numerous and diverse markets and the transactions we process have become increasingly complex. If any of our financial, accounting or other data processing systems do not operate properly or are disabled or if there are other shortcomings or failures in our internal processes, people or systems, we could suffer an impairment to our liquidity, a financial loss, a disruption of our businesses, liability to clients, regulatory intervention or reputational damage. These systems may fail to operate properly or become disabled as a result of events that are wholly or partially beyond our control, including a disruption of electrical or communications services or our inability to occupy one or more of our buildings. The inability of our systems to accommodate an increasing volume of transactions could also constrain our ability to expand our businesses.\nOur financial and other data processing systems will rely on access to and the functionality of operating systems maintained by third parties. If the accounting, trading or other data processing systems on which we are dependent are unable to meet increasingly demanding standards for processing and security or if they fail or have other significant shortcomings, we could be adversely affected. Such consequences may include our inability to effect transactions and manage our exposure to risk.\nIn addition, our ability to conduct business may be adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses and the communities in which they are located. This may include a disruption involving electrical, communications, transportation or other services used by us or third parties with which we conduct business. Our operations will rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential and other information in our computer systems and networks. Our computer systems, software and networks may be vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses or other malicious code, and other events that could have a security impact. Additionally, if a customer\u2019s computer system, network or other technology is compromised by unauthorized access, we may face losses or other adverse consequences by unknowingly entering into unauthorized transactions. If one or more of such events occur, this potentially could jeopardize our, our customers\u2019 or counterparties\u2019 confidential and other information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, our computer systems and networks. Furthermore, such events may cause interruptions or malfunctions in our, our customers\u2019, our counterparties\u2019 or third parties\u2019 operations, including the transmission and execution of unauthorized transactions.\nWe may be required to expend significant additional resources to modify our protective measures or to investigate and remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures, and we may be subject to litigation and financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by us. The increased use of smartphones, tablets and other mobile devices as well as cloud computing may also heighten these and other operational risks. We and our third-party providers are the subject of attempted unauthorized access, computer viruses and malware, and cyber-attacks designed to disrupt or degrade service or cause other damage and denial of service. Cyberattacks and other cyber incidents are occurring more frequently, are constantly evolving in nature, are becoming more sophisticated and are being carried out by groups and individuals (including criminal hackers, hacktivists, state-sponsored actors, criminal and terrorist organizations, individuals or groups participating in organized crime and insiders) with a wide range of expertise and motives (including monetization of corporate, payment or other internal or personal data, theft of computing resources, financial fraud, operational disruption, theft of trade secrets and intellectual property for competitive advantage and leverage for political, social, economic and environmental reasons). Such cyberattacks and cyber incidents can take many forms including cyber extortion, denial of service, social engineering, such as impersonation attempts to fraudulently induce employees or others to disclose information or unwittingly provide access to systems or data, introduction of viruses or malware, such as ransomware through phishing emails, website defacement or theft of passwords and other credentials, unauthorized use of computing resources for digital currency mining and business email compromises. There can be no assurance that such unauthorized access or cyber incidents will not occur in the future, and they could occur more frequently and on a larger scale. Legal liability arising from such risks may harm our business. Many aspects of our business involve substantial risks of liability.\nOur financial and operational controls may not be adequate. As we expand our business, there can be no assurance that financial controls, the level and knowledge of personnel, operational abilities, legal and compliance controls and other corporate support systems will be adequate to manage our business and growth. The ineffectiveness of any of these controls or systems could adversely affect our business and prospects. In addition, if we acquire new businesses and introduce new products, we face numerous risks and uncertainties integrating their controls and systems, including financial controls, accounting and data processing systems, management controls and other operations. A failure to integrate these systems and controls, and even an inefficient integration of these systems and controls, could adversely affect our business and prospects.\nWe have identified material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that could, if not remediated, result in material misstatements in our financial statements. In connection with the audit of our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended June 30, 2019, we have identified and concluded that we continue to have material weaknesses relating to our internal control over financial reporting. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. See Part II, Item 9A in this Form 10-K for more details. While the material weaknesses described in that section creates a reasonable possibility that an error in financial reporting may go undetected, after extensive review and the performance of additional analysis and other procedures, no material adjustments, restatement or other revisions to our previously issued financial statements were required.\nAs further described in Part II, Item 9A of this Form 10-K below, we are taking specific steps to remediate our material weaknesses that we identified by implementing and enhancing our internal control procedures. These material weaknesses will not be considered remediated until all necessary internal controls have been implemented, repeatably tested and determined to be operating effectively. In addition, we may need to take additional measures to address the material weakness or modify the remediation steps, and we cannot be certain that the measures we have taken, and expect to take, to improve our internal controls will be sufficient to address the issues identified, to ensure that our internal controls are effective or to ensure that the identified material weaknesses will not result in a material misstatement of our annual or interim consolidated financial statements.\nCatastrophic events (or a combination of events), such as terrorism/sabotage, or fire, as well as deliberate cyber terrorism, could adversely impact our financial performance. Our business operating segments could be exposed to effects of catastrophic events, such as severe weather conditions, natural disasters, major accidents, acts of malicious destruction, sabotage or terrorism, which could adversely impact our operations and financial performance.\nAdditionally, the perceived threat of a terrorist attack could negatively impact us. Any damage or business interruption costs as a result of uninsured or underinsured acts of terrorism could result in a material cost to us and could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operation. Adequate terrorism insurance may not be available at rates we believe are reasonable in the future. All of the risks indicated in this paragraph could be heightened by foreign policy decisions of the U.S. and other influential countries or general geopolitical conditions.\nLosses not covered by insurance may be large, which could adversely impact our financial performance. We carry various insurance policies on our assets. These policies contain policy specifications, limits and deductibles that may mean that such policies do not provide coverage or sufficient coverage against all potential material losses. There are certain types of risk (generally of a catastrophic nature such as war or environmental contamination) which are either uninsurable or not economically insurable. Further, there are certain types of risk for which insurance coverage is not equal to the full replacement cost of the insured assets. Should any uninsured or underinsured loss occur, we could lose our investment in, and anticipated profits and cash flows from, one or more of our assets or operations.\nWe also carry directors and officers liability insurance (D&O insurance) for losses or advancement of defense costs in the event a legal action is brought against the company\u2019s directors, officers or employees for alleged wrongful acts in their capacity as directors, officers or employees. Our D&O insurance contains certain customary exclusions that may make it unavailable for the company in the event it is needed; and in any case our D&O insurance may not be adequate to fully protect the company against liability for the conduct of its directors, officers or employees.\nRisks Related to Our Durable Medical Equipment Business\nAdverse trends in the healthcare industry may negatively affect our investment in Great Elm DME, Inc. (DME Inc.), a supplier of durable medical equipment and services.\nThe healthcare industry is currently experiencing, among other things:\n\u25aa\nchanges in the demand for and methods of delivering healthcare services\u037e\n\u25aa\ncompetition among healthcare providers\u037e\n\u25aa\nconsolidation of large health insurers\u037e\n\u25aa\nregulatory and government reimbursement uncertainty resulting from the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (the ACA) and other healthcare reform laws\u037e\n\u25aa\nfederal court decisions on cases challenging the legality of certain aspects of the ACA\u037e\n\u25aa\nfederal and state government plans to reduce budget deficits and address debt ceiling limits by lowering healthcare provider Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement rates\u037e\n\u25aa\nchanges in third-party reimbursement methods and policies\u037e and\n\u25aa\nincreased scrutiny of billing, referral and other practices by U.S. federal and state authorities.\nThese factors may negatively impact the economic performance of DME Inc., which may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition.\nA significant portion of DME Inc.\u2019s rental patients who use its products have health coverage under the Medicare program, and future changes in the reimbursement rates or payment methodologies under Medicare and other government programs may adversely affect the financial condition of DME Inc., which could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results.\nAs a provider of respiratory-related product rentals, a portion of DME Inc.\u2019s revenue comes from Medicare reimbursement, due in part to a higher proportion of elderly persons suffering from chronic respiratory conditions than in the general population. There are increasing pressures on Medicare to control healthcare costs and to reduce or limit reimbursement rates for home medical products.\nLegislation, including the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003, the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005, the Medicare Improvements for Patients and Providers Act of 2008, the ACA, and the 21st Century Cures Act contain provisions that directly impact reimbursement for the durable medical equipment products supplied by DME Inc. These legislative provisions as currently in effect and any changes to such provisions in the future will continue to have a material effect on DME Inc.\u2019s business, financial condition and operating results.\nFurther, due to budgetary shortfalls, many states are considering, or have enacted, cuts to their Medicaid programs. These cuts have included, or may include, elimination or reduction of coverage for DME Inc.\u2019s products, amounts eligible for payment under co-insurance arrangements, or reimbursement rates for covered items. Continued state budgetary pressures could lead to further reductions in funding for the reimbursement for DME Inc.\u2019s products which, in turn, would adversely affect its, and ultimately our, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe competitive bidding process under Medicare could adversely impact the business and financial condition of DME Inc.\nThe Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish and implement programs under which competitive bid areas (CBAs)are established throughout the U.S. for purposes of awarding contracts for the furnishing of competitively priced items of durable medical equipment. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the agency responsible for administering this Medicare program, conducts a competition for each competitive acquisition area under which suppliers submit bids to supply certain covered items of durable medical equipment. Successful bidders must meet certain program quality standards in order to be awarded a contract and only successful bidders can supply the covered items to Medicare beneficiaries in the CBAs. There are, however, regulations in place that allow non-contracted suppliers to continue to provide products and services to their existing customers at the new competitive bidding payment amounts. The contracts are expected to be re-bid every three years.\nWe continue to monitor developments regarding the implementation of this competitive bidding program, but we are currently unable to predict the outcome of the competitive bidding program on DME Inc. once fully implemented. It is likely that reimbursement rates will continue to fluctuate, thus resulting in payment adjustments which could adversely affect the financial conditions and results of operations of DME Inc.\nCMS suspended its competitive bidding process last year and existing contracts expired on December 31, 2018. As of January 1, 2019, there is a temporary gap in the competitive bidding program that is expected to last until December 31, 2020. The bids the for 2021 competitive bidding program were due on September 18, 2019.\nSince 2011, the competitive bidding program has undergone several rounds, awarding contracts to program winners to supply durable medical equipment in competitive bid areas. Certain operating subsidiaries of DME Inc. currently have contracts in Phoenix and Tucson, AZ, as well as Omaha, NE, where it anticipates new competition as a result of the expiration of contracts that could adversely affect the financial conditions and results of operations of DME Inc.\nDME Inc. obtains some of the components, subassemblies and completed products included in its sleep and respiratory-focused durable medical equipment from a single source or a limited group of manufacturers or suppliers, and the partial or complete loss of one of these manufacturers or suppliers could cause significant production delays, an inability to meet customer demand and a substantial loss in revenue.\nDME Inc. utilizes single-source suppliers for some of the components and subassemblies it uses in its sleep and respiratory-focused durable medical equipment. DME Inc.\u2019s use of single-source suppliers for some components of its durable medical equipment may expose it to several risks, including, among other things:\n\u25aa\nits suppliers may encounter financial hardships as a result of unfavorable economic and market conditions unrelated to its demand for components, which could inhibit their ability to fulfill orders and meet DME Inc.\u2019s requirements;\n\u25aa\nsuppliers may fail to comply with regulatory requirements, be subject to lengthy compliance, validation or qualification periods, or make errors in manufacturing components that could negatively affect the performance or safety of DME Inc.\u2019s products or cause delays in the supplying of DME Inc.\u2019s products to its customers;\n\u25aa\nnewly identified suppliers may not qualify under the stringent quality regulatory standards to which DME Inc.\u2019s business is subject;\n\u25aa\nDME Inc. or its suppliers may not be able to respond to unanticipated changes in customer orders, and if orders do not match forecasts, DME Inc. or its suppliers may have excess or inadequate inventory of materials and components;\n\u25aa\nDME Inc. may be subject to price fluctuations due to a lack of long-term supply arrangements for key components;\n\u25aa\nDME Inc. may experience delays in delivery by its suppliers due to customs clearing delays, shipping delays, scarcity of raw materials or changes in demand from DME Inc. or their other customers;\n\u25aa\nDME Inc. or its suppliers may lose access to critical services and components, resulting in an interruption in the manufacture, assembly and shipment of its systems;\n\u25aa\nDME Inc.\u2019s suppliers may be subject to allegations by other parties of misappropriation of proprietary information in connection with their supply of products to DME Inc., which could inhibit their ability to fulfill DME Inc.\u2019s orders and meet its requirements;\n\u25aa\nfluctuations in demand for products that DME Inc.\u2019s suppliers manufacture for others may affect their ability or willingness to deliver components to DME Inc. in a timely manner;\n\u25aa\nDME Inc.\u2019s suppliers may wish to discontinue supplying components or services to DME Inc.; and\n\u25aa\nDME Inc. may not be able to find new or alternative components or reconfigure its system and manufacturing processes in a timely manner if the necessary components become unavailable.\nDME Inc. may experience problems with some of its suppliers in the future. It may not be able to quickly establish additional or replacement suppliers, particularly for single source components or subassemblies. Any interruption or delay in the supply of components or subassemblies, or DME Inc.\u2019s inability to obtain components or subassemblies from alternate sources at acceptable prices in a timely manner, could impair its ability to meet the demand of its customers and cause them to cancel orders or switch to competitive products, potentially resulting in a loss of revenues.\nDME Inc. depends upon reimbursement from Medicare, private payors, Medicaid and patients for a significant portion of its revenue, and if it fails to manage the complex and lengthy reimbursement process, its business and operating results could suffer.\nA significant portion of DME Inc.\u2019s rental revenue is derived from reimbursement by third-party payors. DME Inc. accepts assignment of insurance benefits from customers and, in a majority of cases, invoices and collects payments directly from Medicare, private insurance companies and Medicaid, as well as direct from patients under co-insurance provisions.\nDME Inc.\u2019s financial condition and results of operations may be affected by the healthcare industry\u2019s reimbursement process, which is complex and can involve lengthy delays between the time that a product is delivered to the consumer and the time that the reimbursement amounts are settled. Depending on the payor, DME Inc. may be required to obtain certain payor-specific documentation from physicians and other healthcare providers before submitting claims for reimbursement. Certain payors have filing deadlines and they will not pay claims submitted after such time. DME Inc. is also subject to extensive pre-payment and post-payment audits by governmental and private payors that could result in material delays, refunds of monies received or denials of claims submitted for payment under such third-party payor programs and contracts. We cannot ensure that DME Inc. will be able to continue to effectively manage the reimbursement process and collect payments for its products promptly. If it fails to manage the complex and lengthy reimbursement process, it could adversely affect DME Inc.\u2019s business, financial conditions and results of operations.\nIf DME Inc. fails to comply with state and federal fraud and abuse laws, including anti-kickback, Stark, false claims and anti-inducement laws, it, and we, could face substantial penalties and DME Inc.\u2019s business, operations, and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nThe federal anti-kickback statute prohibits, among other things, knowingly and willfully offering, paying, soliciting or receiving remuneration to induce or in return for purchasing, leasing, ordering, or arranging for the purchase, lease or order of any healthcare item or service reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal healthcare programs. Although there are a number of statutory exceptions and regulatory safe harbors protecting certain common activities from prosecution, the exceptions and safe harbors are drawn narrowly, and any remuneration to or from a prescriber or purchaser of healthcare products or services may be subject to scrutiny if it does not qualify for an exception or safe harbor. DME Inc.\u2019s practices may not in all cases meet all of the criteria for safe harbor protection from anti-kickback liability. Failure to meet all requirements of a safe harbor is not determinative of a kickback issue but could subject the practice to increased scrutiny by the government.\nThe \u201cStark Law\u201d prohibits a physician from referring Medicare or Medicaid patients to an entity providing \u201cdesignated health services,\u201d which includes durable medical equipment, if the physician or immediate family member of the physician has an ownership or investment interest in or compensation arrangement with such entity that does not comply with the requirements of a Stark exception. Violation of the Stark Law could result in denial of payment, disgorgement of reimbursements received under a non-compliant arrangement, civil penalties, and exclusion from Medicare, Medicaid or other governmental programs. Although we believe that DME Inc. has structured its provider arrangements to comply with current Stark Law requirements, these arrangements may not expressly meet the requirements for applicable exceptions from the law.\nFederal false claims laws prohibit any person from knowingly presenting or causing to be presented a false claim for payment to the federal government, or knowingly making or causing to be made a false statement to get a false claim paid. The majority of states also have statutes or regulations similar to the federal anti-kickback and self-referral laws and false claims laws, which apply to items or services, reimbursed under Medicaid and other state programs, or, in several states, apply regardless of payor. These false claims statutes allow any person to bring suit in the name of the government alleging false and fraudulent claims presented to or paid by the government (or other violations of the statutes) and to share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement. Such suits, known as qui tam actions, have increased significantly in the healthcare industry in recent years. Sanctions under these federal and state laws may include civil monetary penalties, damages, exclusion of a manufacturer\u2019s products from reimbursement under government programs, criminal fines and imprisonment. In addition, the recently enacted ACA, among other things, amends the intent requirement of the federal anti-kickback and criminal healthcare fraud statutes. A person or entity no longer needs to have actual knowledge of this statute or specific intent to violate it. In addition, the ACA provides that the government may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the federal anti-kickback statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the false claims statutes. Because of the breadth of these laws and the narrowness of the safe harbors and exceptions, it is possible that some of DME Inc.\u2019s business activities could be subject to challenge under one or more of such laws. Such a challenge, regardless of the outcome, could have a material adverse effect on its business, business relationships, reputation, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, there has been a recent trend of increased federal and state regulation of payments made to physicians. Certain states mandate implementation of compliance programs and/or the tracking and reporting of gifts, compensation and other remuneration to physicians. The shifting compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with different compliance and/or reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions increase the possibility that a healthcare company may violate one or more of the requirements.\nThe federal Civil Monetary Penalties Law prohibits the offering or giving of remuneration to a Medicare or Medicaid beneficiary that the person knows or should know is likely to influence the beneficiary\u2019s selection of a particular supplier of items or services reimbursable by a federal or state governmental healthcare program. While it is DME Inc.\u2019s intent to comply with all applicable laws, the government may find that DME Inc.\u2019s marketing activities violate the Civil Monetary Penalties Law. If it is found to be in non-compliance, DME Inc. could be subject to civil money penalties of up to $0.01 million for each wrongful act, assessment of three times the amount claimed for each item or service and exclusion from the federal or state healthcare programs.\nThe scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform, especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations. If DME Inc.\u2019s operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws described above or any other government regulations that apply to us, it, and potentially we, may be subject to penalties, including civil and criminal penalties, damages, fines and the curtailment or restricting of DME Inc.\u2019s operations. Any penalties, damages, fines, curtailment or restructuring of DME Inc.\u2019s operations could harm its ability to operate its business, and ultimately our financial results. Any action against DME Inc. for violation of these laws, even if successfully defended against, could cause DME Inc. to incur significant legal expenses and divert its management\u2019s attention from operation of its business. Moreover, achieving and sustaining compliance with applicable federal and state fraud and abuse laws may prove costly.\nRisks Related to Our Investment Management Business\nOur investment management agreements may be terminated. The investment management agreements (IMAs) we have through GECM with various pooled investment vehicles, such as GECC, may be cancelled at the applicable counterparty\u2019s discretion upon certain notice or upon the occurrence of certain events. We do not control the boards of directors of such pooled investment vehicles, and they may cancel our respective IMAs at their discretion without making any termination payment to us. GECM\u2019s investment performance is a key element of retaining this business. We have recorded an intangible asset attributable to the IMAs that is being amortized over a 15-year economic life even though the IMAs are cancellable by the respective counterparties.\nDifficult or changing market conditions can adversely affect our investment management business in many ways, by reducing the value or performance of our funds (including our invested funds and funds invested by third parties) or by reducing the ability of our funds to raise or deploy capital, each of which could negatively impact our income and cash flow and adversely affect our financial condition. The build-out of our investment management business is affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions and events throughout the world, such as interest rates, availability of credit, inflation rates, economic uncertainty, changes in laws and regulations, market perceptions and other factors.\nAdverse changes could lead to a reduction in investment income, losses on our own capital invested and lower revenues from investment management fees. Such adverse changes may also lead to a decrease in new capital raised and may cause investors to withdraw their investments and commitments. Even in the absence of a market downturn, below-market investment performance by our funds and portfolio managers could reduce investment management revenues and assets under management and result in reputational damage that may make it more difficult to attract new investors or retain existing investors.\nIn July 2017, the head of the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced the desire to phase out the use of LIBOR by the end of 2021. It is unclear if at that time whether or not LIBOR will cease to exist or if new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2021. As a result of this transition, interest rates on financial instruments tied to LIBOR, as well as the revenue and expenses associated with those financial instruments, may be adversely affected. Further, any uncertainty regarding the continued use and reliability of LIBOR as a benchmark interest rate could adversely affect the value of our financial instruments tied to LIBOR. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, is considering replacing U.S. dollar LIBOR with a new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements, backed by Treasury securities, called the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR). The first publication of SOFR was released in April 2018. If LIBOR ceases to exist, GECC may need to renegotiate outstanding loans to its portfolio companies which extend beyond 2021, and that utilize LIBOR as a factor in determining the interest rate, to replace LIBOR with the new standard that is established. Whether or not SOFR attains market traction as a LIBOR replacement remains a question and the future of LIBOR at this time is uncertain. As such, the potential effect of any such event on our cost of capital and investment income cannot yet be determined.\nIf we are deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act, we may be required to institute burdensome compliance requirements and our activities may be restricted, which may make it difficult for us to execute our growth plans. If we are deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act, we will be subject to additional regulatory requirements and our activities may be restricted, including:\n\u25aa\nrestrictions on the nature of our investments;\n\u25aa\nlimitations on our ability to borrow;\n\u25aa\nprohibitions on transactions with affiliates; and\n\u25aa\nrestrictions on the issuance of securities.\nEach of these may make it difficult for us to run our business. In addition, the law may impose upon us burdensome requirements, including:\n\u25aa\nregistration as an investment company and subsequent regulation as an investment company;\n\u25aa\nadoption of a specific form of corporate structure; and\n\u25aa\nreporting, record keeping, voting, proxy and disclosure requirements and other rules and regulations.\nIn order not to be regulated as an investment company under the Investment Company Act, unless we can qualify for an exclusion, we must ensure that we are engaged primarily in a business other than investing, reinvesting or trading of securities and that our activities do not include investing, reinvesting, owning, holding or trading \u201cinvestment securities\u201d constituting more than 40% of our total assets (exclusive of U.S. government securities and cash items) on an unconsolidated basis. Though we do not believe that our principal activities will subject us to the Investment Company Act, if we were deemed to be subject to the Investment Company Act, compliance with these additional regulatory burdens would require additional expense and attention from management for which we have not accounted.\nOur officers and directors may become aware of business opportunities which may be appropriate for presentation to us and the other entities to which they owe certain fiduciary or contractual duties. Accordingly, they may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented. These conflicts may not be resolved in our favor and a potential target business may be presented to another entity prior to its presentation to us, subject to their fiduciary duties under applicable law.\nWe may engage in a business combination with one or more target businesses that have relationships with the MAST Funds, our executive officers, directors or existing holders which may raise potential conflicts of interest. In light of the involvement of our executive officers and directors with other entities in the investment management business and otherwise, we may decide to acquire or do business with one or more businesses affiliated with the MAST Funds or our executive officers and directors.\nOur directors also serve as officers and board members for other entities. Such entities may compete with us. We could pursue an affiliate transaction if we determined that such affiliated entity met our criteria for a business combination and such transaction was approved by a majority of our disinterested directors. Potential conflicts of interest may exist, and, as a result, the terms of the business combination may not be as advantageous to our public stockholders as they would be absent any conflicts of interest.\nRisks Related to Our Real Estate Business\nOur initial investment through our real estate business includes the Property leased pursuant to a long-term triple net lease and the failure of the tenant to satisfy its obligations under the lease may adversely affect the condition of the Property or the results of our real estate business segment. Because the Property is leased pursuant to a long-term triple net lease, we depend on the tenant to pay all insurance, taxes, utilities, common area maintenance charges, maintenance and repair expenses and to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims, litigation and liabilities arising in connection with its business, including any environmental liabilities resulting from the tenant\u2019s failure to comply with applicable environmental laws. There are no assurances that the tenant will have sufficient assets and income to enable it to satisfy its payment obligations to us under the lease. The inability or unwillingness of the tenant to meet its rent obligations could materially adversely affect the business, financial position or results of operations of our real estate business segment. Furthermore, the inability or unwillingness of the tenant to satisfy its other obligations under the lease, such as the payment of insurance, taxes and utilities, could materially and adversely affect the condition of the Property. Our triple net lease agreement requires that the tenant maintains comprehensive liability and all risk property insurance. However, there are certain types of losses (including losses arising from environmental conditions or of a catastrophic nature, such as earthquakes, hurricanes and floods) that may be uninsurable or not economically insurable. Insurance coverage may not be sufficient to pay the full current market value or current replacement cost of a loss. Inflation, changes in building codes and ordinances, environmental considerations, and other factors also might make it infeasible to use insurance proceeds to replace the Property after such property has been damaged or destroyed. In addition, if we experience a loss that is uninsured or that exceeds policy coverage limits, we could lose the capital invested in the Property as well as the anticipated future cash flows from the Property.\nWe are subject to risks inherent in ownership of real estate. Cash flows from our real estate business segment and real estate values are affected by a number of factors, including competition from other available properties and the ability to provide adequate property maintenance and insurance and to control operating costs. Cash flows from our real estate business segment and real estate values are also affected by such factors as governmental regulations (including zoning, usage and tax laws), property tax rates, utility expenses, potential liability under environmental and other laws and changes in environmental and other laws.\nNatural disasters, terrorist attacks or other unforeseen events could cause damage to the property we currently own, or may in the future own, resulting in increased expenses and reduced revenues. Natural disasters, such as earthquakes, hurricanes and floods, or terrorist attacks could cause significant damage and require significant repair costs, and make the property we currently own, or may in the future own, temporarily uninhabitable, reducing our revenues. Damage and business interruption losses could exceed the aggregate limits of any insurance coverage we may have. We may not have sufficient insurance coverage for losses caused by a terrorist attack, or such insurance may not be maintained, available or cost-effective.\nWe may incur significant liabilities from environmental contamination. Existing or future laws impose or may impose liability on us to clean up environmental contamination on or around the property that we currently own, or may in the future own, even if we were not responsible for or aware of the environmental contamination or even if such environmental contamination occurred prior to our involvement with such property. From time to time, we may conduct environmental assessments, commonly referred to as \u201cPhase 1 Environmental Reports,\u201d on properties in which we are considering an investment. These assessments typically include an investigation (excluding soil or groundwater sampling or analysis) and a review of publicly available information regarding the site and other nearby properties. However, such environmental assessments may not identify all potential environmental liabilities.\nWe may face potential difficulties or delays renewing leases or re-letting space. We currently derive all of our real estate business income from rent received from a single tenant in connection with our initial investment in two Class A office buildings in Fort Myers, FL. If the tenant experiences a downturn in its business or other types of financial distress, it may be unable to make timely rental payments. Also, in the event that the tenant does not renew the lease, we may not be able to re-let the space or there could be a substantial delay in re-letting the space. Even if the tenant decides to renew or lease new space, the terms of renewals or new leases, including the cost of required renovations or concessions, may be less favorable to us than the current lease term.\nWe face potential adverse effects from a tenant\u2019s bankruptcy or insolvency. The bankruptcy or insolvency of a tenant may adversely affect the income produced by our property, or by any properties we may own in the future. Our tenant could file for bankruptcy protection or become insolvent in the future. A bankrupt tenant may reject and terminate its lease with us. In such case, our claim against the bankrupt tenant for unpaid and future rent would be subject to a statutory cap that might be substantially less than the remaining rent actually owed under the lease. This shortfall could adversely affect our cash flow and results of operations.\nWe face possible risks associated with the physical effects of climate change. The physical effects of climate change could have a material adverse effect on our properties, and consequently on our operations and business. For example, we have two Class A office buildings located in southern Florida; to the extent climate change causes changes in weather patterns, that geographic area could experience increases in storm intensity and rising sea-levels. Over time, these conditions could result in declining demand for office space in our office buildings or our inability to operate the buildings at all. Climate change may also have indirect effects on our business by increasing the cost of (or making unavailable) property insurance on terms we find acceptable, or by increasing the cost of energy at our properties. There can be no assurance that climate change will not have a material adverse effect on our property, operations or business.\nWe depend upon personnel of our property managers. We do not have any internal real estate management capacity. We depend, and will depend in the future, on our property managers and their personnel to efficiently manage the day-to-day operations at certain of our properties; any difficulties our property managers encounter in hiring, training and retaining skilled personnel may adversely affect the income produced by our properties.\nRisks Relating to Our Common Stock\nOur common stock is subject to transfer restrictions. We have significant NOL carryforwards and other tax attributes, the amount and availability of which are subject to certain qualifications, limitations and uncertainties. In order to reduce the possibility that certain changes in ownership could result in limitations on the use of the tax attributes, our amended and restated certificate of incorporation (our certificate of incorporation) contains provisions that generally restrict the ability of a person or entity from acquiring ownership (including through attribution under the tax law) of 4.99% or more of our common stock and the ability of persons or entities now owning 5% or more of our common shares from acquiring additional common shares. The restriction will remain until the earliest of (1) the repeal of Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended or any successor statute if our Board determines that the restriction on transfer is no longer necessary or desirable for the preservation of tax benefits, (2) the close of business on the first day of a taxable year as to which our Board determines that no tax benefits may be carried forward, (3) such date as our Board may fix for expiration of transfer restrictions and (4) January 29, 2028. The restriction may be waived by our Board on a case-by-case basis. You are advised to carefully monitor your ownership of our common shares and consult your own legal advisors to determine whether your ownership of our common shares approaches the proscribed level.\nWe also have a Tax Rights Plan that would be triggered if any person acquires 4.99% or more of our common stock without prior approval by our Board. Holders of more than 4.99% of our common stock on the day the rights plan was adopted were exempted from this limitation as to the number shares they held at the time of adoption of the rights plan.\nWe may issue additional shares of common stock or shares of our preferred stock to obtain additional financial resources, as acquisition currency or under employee incentive plans. Any such issuances would dilute the interest of our stockholders and likely present other risks. Our certificate of incorporation authorizes our Board to issue shares of our common stock or preferred stock from time to time in their business judgement up to the amount of our then authorized capitalization. We may issue a substantial number of additional shares of our common stock and may issue shares of our preferred stock. These issuances:\n\u25aa\nmay significantly dilute your equity interests;\n\u25aa\nmay require you to make an additional investment in us or suffer dilution of your equity interest;\n\u25aa\nmay subordinate the rights of holders of shares of our common stock if shares of preferred stock are issued with rights senior to those afforded to our common stock;\n\u25aa\ncould cause a change in control if a substantial number of shares of our common stock are issued;\n\u25aa\nmay affect, among other things, our ability to use our NOL carry forwards and could result in the resignation or removal of our present officers and directors; and\n\u25aa\nmay adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock.\nOur common stock price may be volatile. The trading price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially, depending on many factors, some of which are beyond our control and may not be directly related to our operating performance. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u25aa\nprice and volume fluctuations in the overall stock market from time to time;\n\u25aa\nsignificant volatility in the market price and trading volume of securities of our competitors;\n\u25aa\nactual or anticipated changes in our earnings or fluctuations in our operating results or changes in the expectations or recommendations of securities analysts;\n\u25aa\nmaterial announcements by us or our competitors regarding business performance, financings, mergers and acquisitions or other transactions;\n\u25aa\ngeneral economic conditions and trends;\n\u25aa\nlegislative or regulatory changes affecting the businesses we invest in; or\n\u25aa\ndepartures of key personnel.\nAnti-takeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws (our bylaws), as well as provisions of Delaware law, could impair a takeover attempt. Our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and Delaware law contain provisions that could have the effect of rendering more difficult or discouraging an acquisition deemed undesirable by our Board. Our corporate governance documents include provisions:\n\u25aa\nauthorizing blank check preferred stock, which could be issued with voting, liquidation, dividend and other rights superior to our common stock;\n\u25aa\nlimiting the liability of, and providing indemnification to, our Board and officers;\n\u25aa\nlimiting the ability of our stockholders to call and bring business before special meetings and to take action by written consent in lieu of a meeting;\n\u25aa\nrequiring advance notice of stockholder proposals for business to be conducted at meetings of our stockholders and for nominations of candidates for election to our Board;\n\u25aa\ncontrolling the procedures for the conduct and scheduling of Board and stockholder meetings;\n\u25aa\nlimiting the ability for persons to acquire 4.99% or more of our common stock;\n\u25aa\nproviding our Board with the express power to postpone previously scheduled annual meetings and to cancel previously scheduled special meetings;\n\u25aa\nlimiting the determination of the number of directors on our Board and the filling of vacancies or newly created seats on the board to our Board then in office; and\n\u25aa\nproviding that directors may be removed by stockholders only for cause.\nThese provisions, alone or together, could delay hostile takeovers and changes in control of our company or changes in our management.\nAs a Delaware corporation, we are also subject to provisions of Delaware law, including Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, which prevents some stockholders holding more than 15% of our outstanding common stock from engaging in certain business combinations without approval of the holders of substantially all of our outstanding common stock. Any provision of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws or Delaware law that has the effect of delaying or deterring a change in control could limit the opportunity for our stockholders to receive a premium for their shares of our common stock and could also affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our common stock.", "PERMNO": 86990, "SIC": 5047, "TIC": "GEC"}
