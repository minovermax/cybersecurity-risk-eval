Risk Factors.\nWe have identified the following risks and uncertainties that may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. The risks described below are not the only ones we face. Additional risks not presently known to us or other factors not perceived by us to present significant risks to our business at this time may also significantly impair our business operations. Our business could be harmed by any of these risks. Investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes, before making any decision to purchase our common stock. If any of the possible adverse events described below actually occurs, we may be unable to conduct our business as currently planned and our prospects, financial condition, operating results and cash flows could be materially harmed. In addition, the trading price of our common stock could decline due to the occurrence of any of the events described below, and you may lose all or part of your investment. In assessing these risks, you should refer to the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our condensed consolidated financial statements and related notes.\nSummary Risk Factors\nWe are subject to a number of risks that if realized could affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. As a clinical stage drug development company, certain elements of risk are inherent to our business. Accordingly, we encounter risks as part of the normal course of our business. Some of the more significant challenges and risks include the following:\n\u2022We are a clinical-stage immuno-oncology company and have incurred significant losses since our inception. We expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future and may never achieve or maintain profitability.\n\u2022We will need substantial additional funding to complete the development and commence commercialization of our product candidates. Failure to obtain this necessary capital at acceptable terms and when needed may force us to delay, reduce or eliminate out product development programs or commercialization efforts.\n\u2022We have identified conditions and events that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, which may hinder our ability to obtain future financing.\n\u2022If we are unable to advance our current or future product candidates through clinical trials, obtain marketing approval and ultimately commercialize any product candidates we develop, or if we experience significant delays in doing so, our business will be materially harmed.\n\u2022Interim, topline, and preliminary data from our clinical trials that we announce or publish from time to time may change as more patient data become available and are subject to audit and verification procedures that could result in material changes in the final data.\n\u2022Our product candidates may have serious adverse, undesirable, or unacceptable side effects that may delay or prevent marketing approval.\n\u2022We may find it difficult to enroll subjects in our clinical trials, which could delay or prevent us from proceeding with clinical trials of our product candidates.\n\u2022We face significant competition for our drug discovery and development efforts, and if we do not compete effectively, our commercial opportunities will be reduced or eliminated.\n\u2022We rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties, including independent clinical investigators, contracted laboratories and CROs, to conduct our preclinical studies and clinical trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates and our business could be substantially harmed\n\u2022The regulatory approval processes of the FDA, the EMA, the MHRA, and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities are lengthy, time consuming and inherently unpredictable, and if we are ultimately unable to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, our business will be substantially harmed.\n\u2022We may become exposed to costly and damaging liability claims, either when testing our product candidates in the clinic or at the commercial stage,\n\u2022Due to our limited resources and access to capital, we must, and have in the past decided to, prioritize development of certain product candidates over other potential product candidates.\n\u2022The successful commercialization of our product candidates will depend in part on the extent to which governmental authorities and health insurers establish coverage and adequate reimbursement levels, as well as pricing policies.\n\u2022The future commercial success of our product candidates will depend on the degree of market acceptance of our potential therapeutic products among physicians, patients, third-party payors and the medical community.\n\u2022Our business operations and current and future relationships with clinical investigators, healthcare professionals, consultants, third-party payors and customers may be subject, directly or indirectly, to federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws, false claims laws, health information privacy and security laws, and other healthcare laws. If we are unable to comply, or has not fully complied, with such laws, we could face substantial penalties.\n\u2022Adverse events in the field of immuno-oncology could damage public perception of our current or future therapeutic product candidates and negatively affect our business.\n\u2022The COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected many companies in the biotechnology industry and may adversely affect our business.\n\u2022The Ukraine conflict may adversely affect many companies in the biotechnology industry, in particular with respect to timely enrollment and data collection in planned and ongoing clinical trials and has adversely affected our business, in particular in relation to planned and ongoing clinical trials.\n\u2022We rely on patents and other intellectual property rights to protect our product candidates and our modular antibody technology platform, the enforcement, defense and maintenance of which may be challenging and costly.\n\u2022We may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or other intellectual property, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful, and issued patents relating to one or more of our product candidates or our modular antibody technology platform could be found invalid or unenforceable if challenged in court.\n\u2022Intellectual property rights of third parties could adversely affect our ability to commercialize our product candidates,\n\u2022We may be subject to claims by third parties asserting that our employees or we have misappropriated their intellectual property or claiming ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property.\n\u2022The manufacture of biotechnology products is complex, and manufacturers often encounter difficulties in production. We rely on third parties to supply and manufacture our product candidates, and we expect to continue to rely on third parties to manufacture our products, if approved. If we or any of our third-party manufacturers encounter such difficulties, or otherwise fail to comply with their contractual obligations, the development or commercialization of our product candidates could be delayed or stopped.\n\u2022Our future growth and ability to compete depends on retaining our key personnel and recruiting additional qualified personnel.\n\u2022Our business is subject to economic, political, regulatory, and other risks associated with international operations.\n\u2022Our business and operations would suffer in the event of computer system failures, cyber-attacks or a deficiency in our, or our collaborators\u2019 or third-party vendors\u2019, cyber-security.\n\u2022Our employees, independent contractors, vendors, principal investigators, CROs and consultants may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including non-compliance with regulatory standards and requirements and insider trading.\nThe above list is not exhaustive, and we face additional challenges and risks. Please carefully consider all of the information in this Form 10-K including matters set forth in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section.\nRisks Related to our Financial Position and Capital Requirements\nWe are a clinical-stage immuno-oncology company and have incurred significant losses since our inception. We expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future and may never achieve or maintain profitability.\nWe are a clinical-stage immuno-oncology company with a limited operating history. We incurred net losses of $31.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and $25.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2021, we had an accumulated loss $78.5 million. Our losses have resulted principally from expenses incurred in research and development, preclinical testing and clinical development of our therapeutic product candidates as well as expenses incurred for research programs and from general and administrative costs associated with our operations. We expect to continue to incur significant and increasing operating losses for the foreseeable future as we continue our clinical trial plans, research and development efforts and seek to obtain regulatory approval and commercialization of our tetravalent bispecific antibody (\u201cmAb2\u201d) product candidates, and SB 11285, and we do not know whether or when we will become profitable. Management believes that its existing cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2021 will fund our current operating plan into February 2023. We have concluded that substantial doubt exists about our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from the issuance date of the financial statements. Our losses, among other things, will continue to cause our working capital and shareholders\u2019 equity to decrease. We anticipate that our expenses will increase substantially if and as we:\n\u2022continue to develop and conduct clinical trials for our current product candidates, FS118, FS222, FS120, and SB 11285;\n\u2022continue the research and development of our product candidates, including completing preclinical studies;\n\u2022discover and develop additional mAb2 product candidates and make further investments in our modular antibody technology platform;\n\u2022seek regulatory approvals for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials;\n\u2022experience any delays or encounter any issues with any of the above, including but not limited to failed studies, complex results, safety issues or other regulatory challenges;\n\u2022establish a sales, marketing and distribution infrastructure and scale-up manufacturing capabilities, whether alone or with third parties, to commercialize any product candidates for which we may obtain regulatory approval, if any;\n\u2022maintain, expand and protect our intellectual property portfolio, including litigation costs associated with defending against alleged patent infringement claims;\n\u2022add clinical, scientific, operational, financial and management information systems and personnel, including personnel to support our product development and potential future commercialization efforts;\n\u2022expand our operations in the United States, Europe and other geographies; and\n\u2022incur additional legal, accounting and other expenses associated with operating as a public company.\nTo date, we have funded our operations through public offering and private placements of equity securities and upfront and milestone payments and expense reimbursement payments received from our collaborators. We have invested substantially all of our financial resources and efforts to developing our mAb2 product candidates and SB 11285 in immuno-oncology, building our intellectual property portfolio, developing our supply chain, conducting business planning, licensing our technology to our collaborators, raising capital and providing general and administrative support for these operations. We do not currently have any approved products and have never generated any revenue from product sales.\nTo become and remain profitable, we must succeed in developing and eventually commercializing products that generate significant revenue. This will require us to be successful in a range of challenging activities, including completing preclinical testing and clinical trials of our product candidates supportive of product approval, discovering and developing additional mAb2 or small-molecule drug product candidates, obtaining regulatory approval for any product candidates that successfully complete clinical trials, establishing manufacturing and marketing capabilities and ultimately selling any products for which we may obtain regulatory approval. We are only in the preliminary stages of most of these activities. We may never succeed in these activities and, even if we do, may never generate revenue that is significant enough to achieve or maintain profitability. Even if one or more of the product candidates that we develop is approved for commercial sale, we anticipate incurring significant costs associated with commercializing any approved product candidate. Our expenses could increase\nbeyond current expectations if we are required by the FDA, the EMA, the MHRA, or other comparable foreign regulatory agencies to perform clinical trials or studies in addition to those that we currently anticipate. Even if we are able to generate revenue from the sale of any approved products, we may not become profitable and may need to obtain additional funding to continue operations.\nEven if we achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. Our failure to become and remain profitable could impair our ability to raise capital, expand our business, maintain our research and development efforts or continue our operations and you could lose some or all of your investment.\nOur limited operating history may make it difficult to evaluate the success of our business to date and to assess our future viability.\nSince inception, we have invested most of our resources in developing our modular antibody technology platform, our mAb2technology and mAb2 product candidates, building our intellectual property portfolio, conducting business planning, licensing our technology to our collaborators, raising capital and providing general and administrative support for these operations. Our most advanced mAb2 product candidate, FS118, is currently being evaluated in proof-of-concept Phase 2 trials in PD-1/PD-L1 acquired resistance head and neck cancer patients and checkpoint inhibitor naive NSCLC and DLBCL. We have not yet demonstrated our ability to successfully complete Phase 2 clinical trials or any Phase 3 or other pivotal clinical trials, obtain regulatory approvals, manufacture a commercial-scale product or arrange for a third party to do so on our behalf or conduct sales and marketing activities necessary for successful product commercialization. In addition, given our limited operating history, we may encounter unforeseen expenses, difficulties, complications, delays and other known and unknown factors in achieving our business objectives. Additionally, we expect our financial condition and operating results to continue to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year due to a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. Consequently, any predictions you make about our future success or viability may not be as accurate as they could be if we had a longer operating history or more experience developing product candidates.\nWe will need substantial additional funding in order to complete the development and commence commercialization of our product candidates. Failure to obtain this necessary capital at acceptable terms and when needed may force us to delay, reduce or eliminate out product development programs or commercialization efforts.\nWe expect our expenses to increase in connection with our ongoing activities, particularly as we complete the proof-of-concept Phase 2 clinical trials of FS118 and Phase 1 trials for FS222, FS120, and SB 11285 and initiate later-stage clinical development, and continue to research, develop and initiate clinical trials for any other product candidates. In addition, if we obtain regulatory approval for any of our product candidates, we expect to incur significant commercialization expenses related to product manufacturing, marketing, sales and distribution.\nFurthermore, we have incurred, and expect to continue to incur, additional costs associated with operating as a public company. Accordingly, we will need to obtain substantial additional funding in connection with our continuing operations. If we are unable to raise capital when needed or on attractive terms, we could be forced to delay, reduce or eliminate our product development programs or any future commercialization efforts.\nThe Company has incurred significant losses and has an accumulated deficit of $78.5 million as of December 31, 2021. We expect to incur substantial losses in the foreseeable future as we conduct and expand our research and development and pre-clinical and clinical activities. We do not expect that our $78.5 million of existing cash as of December 31, 2021 will enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months from the date of filing this Annual Report on Form 10K. We will need to raise additional capital to complete the development and commercialization of FS118, FS222, FS120 and SB 11285, if approved, and may also need to raise additional funds to pursue other development activities related to additional product candidates.\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including:\n\u2022the cost, progress, results of the proof-of-concept Phase 2 clinical trials of FS118 and any later-stage clinical trials for this product candidate;\n\u2022the cost, progress, and results of the Phase 1 clinical trials of FS222, FS120, and SB 11285 and any later-stage clinical trials for these product candidates;\n\u2022the scope, progress, results and costs of preclinical development, laboratory testing and clinical trials for any future product candidate;\n\u2022the number of potential new product candidates we identify and decides to develop;\n\u2022the cost of manufacturing drug supply for the clinical trials of our product candidates;\n\u2022the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approval for our product candidates and any delays we may encounter as a result of evolving regulatory requirements or adverse clinical trial results with respect to any of our product candidates;\n\u2022the costs involved in growing our organization to the size and expertise needed to allow for the research, development and potential commercialization of our current or any future product candidates;\n\u2022fulfilling obligations under our existing collaboration agreements and the entry into new collaboration agreements;\n\u2022the costs and timing of preparing, filing and prosecuting patent applications, maintaining and enforcing our intellectual property rights and defending any intellectual property-related claims, including any claims by third parties that we are infringing upon their intellectual property rights;\n\u2022the cost of commercialization activities and costs involved in the creation of an effective sales, marketing and healthcare compliance organization for any product candidates we develop, if approved;\n\u2022the potential additional expenses attributable to adjusting our development plans (including any supply related matters) to the COVID-19 pandemic;\n\u2022the potential additional expenses attributable to adjusting our development plans (including any supply related matters) to the Ukraine conflict;\n\u2022the revenue, if any, received from commercial sales of our product candidates for which we receive marketing approval; and\n\u2022the costs of operating as a public company.\nUntil we can generate sufficient product revenue to finance our cash requirements, which we may never do, we expect to finance our future cash needs through a combination of public or private equity offerings, debt financings, collaborations, strategic alliances, licensing arrangements and other marketing or distribution arrangements. Disruptions in the financial markets in general and the COVID-19 pandemic may make equity and debt financing more difficult to obtain and may have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet our fundraising needs.\nOur ability to raise additional funds will depend on financial, economic and market conditions and other factors, over which we may have no or limited control. If adequate funds are not available on commercially acceptable terms when needed, we may be forced to delay, reduce or terminate the development or commercialization of all or part of our research programs product candidates or we may be unable to take advantage of future business opportunities.\nRaising additional capital may cause dilution to our existing shareholders, restrict our operations or require us to relinquish rights to our technologies or product candidates.\nUntil such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we expect to finance our operations with our existing cash and cash equivalents, including revenue from our collaborations. In order to further advance development of our product candidates, discover additional product candidates and pursue our other business objectives, however, we will need to seek additional funds.\nWe cannot guarantee that future financing will be available in sufficient amounts or on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. To the extent that we raise additional capital by issuing equity securities, our existing shareholders\u2019 ownership may experience substantial dilution, and the terms of these securities may include liquidation or other preferences that adversely affect our rights as a shareholder. Equity and debt financing, if available, may involve agreements that include covenants limiting or restricting our ability to take specific actions, such as redeeming our shares, making investments, incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures or declaring dividends.\nThe incurrence of indebtedness could result in increased fixed payment obligations and we may be required to agree to certain restrictive covenants therein, such as limitations on our ability to incur additional debt, limitations on our ability to acquire, sell or license intellectual property rights and other operating restrictions that could adversely affect our ability to conduct our business.\nIf we are unable to obtain funding on a timely basis, we may be required to significantly curtail, delay or discontinue one or more of our research or development programs or the commercialization of any of our product candidates, if approved, or be unable to expand our operations or otherwise capitalize on our business opportunities, as desired, which could materially affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have identified conditions and events that raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern, which may hinder our ability to obtain future financing.\nWe expect our costs and expenses to increase as we continue to develop our product candidates and progress our current clinical programs and costs associated with being a public company.\nWe had cash and cash equivalents of $78.5 million as of December 31, 2021, which we believe that should be sufficient to fund our operating plan into February 2023. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our capital resources sooner than we currently expect. Pursuant to the requirements of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 205-40, Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity\u2019s Ability to Continue as a Going Concern, and as a result of our financial condition and other factors described herein, there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern for a period of at least twelve months from the date of the financial statements. Our ability to continue as a going concern will depend on our ability to obtain additional funding, as to which no assurances can be given. Our future success depends on our ability to raise capital and/or execute our current operating plan. However, we cannot be certain that these initiatives or raising additional capital, whether through selling additional debt or equity securities or obtaining a line of credit or other loan, will be available to us or, if available, will be on terms acceptable to us. If we issue additional securities to raise funds, these securities may have rights, preferences, or privileges senior to those of our common stock, and our current shareholders may experience dilution. If we are unable to obtain funds when needed or on acceptable terms, we may be required to curtail our current development programs, cut operating costs, forego future development and other opportunities or even terminate our operations, which may involve seeking bankruptcy protection.\nWe may be subject to adverse legislative or regulatory tax changes that could negatively impact our financial condition.\nThe rules dealing with U.S. federal, state and local income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the IRS and the U.S. Treasury Department. Changes to tax laws (which changes may have retroactive application) could adversely affect our stockholders or us. In recent years, many such changes have been made and changes are likely to continue to occur in the future. We cannot predict whether, when, in what form, or with what effective dates, tax laws, regulations and rulings may be enacted, promulgated or decided, which could result in an increase in our, or our stockholders\u2019, tax liability or require changes in the manner in which we operate in order to minimize increases in our tax liability.\nOur ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards and certain other tax attributes may be limited.\nUnder Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, if a corporation undergoes an \u201cownership change\u201d is subject to limitations on its ability to utilize its pre-change net operating losses (\"NOLs\") and certain other tax assets (tax attributes) to offset future taxable income. In general, an ownership change occurs if the aggregate stock ownership of certain stockholders increases by more than 50 percentage points over such stockholders' lowest percentage ownership during the testing period (generally three years). We have experienced such ownership changes both in October 2018, November 2020, and May 2021; we may also experience an ownership change in the future as a result of shifts in our stock ownership, some of which are outside our control. The Company underwent a 382 study in 2021 and, as a result to the three afformentioned ownership changes, were limited in their NOL realization. As of December 31, 2021, we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately $80.9 million and $79.8 million, respectively, after applying the 382 limitation to the NOL carried forward from 2020. In addition, pursuant to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we may not use U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards to reduce our taxable income in any year by more than 80%, and we may not carry back any net operating losses to prior years. These new rules apply regardless of the occurrence of an ownership change.\nRisks Related to Development and Commercialization\nIf we are unable to advance our current or future product candidates through clinical trials, obtain marketing approval and ultimately commercialize any product candidates we develop, or if we experience significant delays in doing so, our business will be materially harmed.\nWe are early in our product candidate development efforts and have four product candidates in clinical development, each of which is still in early-stage clinical trials. We have invested substantially all of our efforts and financial resources in the development of our proprietary mAb2 technology, identification of targets and preclinical development of our product candidates.\nOur ability to generate product revenues, which we do not expect will occur for several years, if ever, will depend heavily on the successful development and eventual commercialization of the product candidates we develop, which may never occur. Our current product candidates, and any future product candidates we develop, will require additional preclinical and clinical development, management of clinical, preclinical and manufacturing activities, marketing approval in the United States and other jurisdictions, demonstrating cost effectiveness to pricing and reimbursement authorities in various jurisdictions, obtaining and securing sufficient manufacturing supply for both clinical development and commercial production, building of a commercial organization, and substantial investment and significant marketing efforts before we generate any revenues from any future product sales. Moreover, the success of our current and future product candidates will depend on several factors, including the following:\n\u2022successful and timely completion of preclinical studies, including in vivo animal studies if necessary, and human clinical trials;\n\u2022sufficiency of our financial and other resources to complete the necessary preclinical studies and clinical trials;\n\u2022receiving regulatory approvals or authorizations for conducting our planned clinical trials or future clinical trials;\n\u2022initiation and successful patient enrollment in and completion of clinical trials on a timely basis;\n\u2022safety, tolerability and efficacy profiles that are satisfactory to the FDA, the EMA, the MHRA or any other comparable foreign regulatory authority for a product to receive marketing approval;\n\u2022timely receipt of marketing approvals for our product candidates from applicable regulatory authorities;\n\u2022the extent of any required post-marketing approval commitments made to applicable regulatory authorities;\n\u2022establishing and scaling up, either alone or with third-party manufacturers, manufacturing capabilities of clinical supply for our clinical trials and subsequently for commercial manufacturing, if any product candidates are approved;\n\u2022obtaining and maintaining patent and trade secret protection or regulatory exclusivity for our product candidates, the latter only if they receive marketing approval, both in the United States and internationally;\n\u2022successfully scaling a sales and marketing organization and launching commercial sales of our product candidates, if approved;\n\u2022acceptance of our product candidates\u2019 benefits and uses, if approved, by patients, the medical community and third-party payors;\n\u2022maintaining a continued acceptable safety profile of our product candidates following marketing approval and commercial launch;\n\u2022effectively competing with companies developing and commercializing other therapies in the same indications targeted by our product candidates;\n\u2022obtaining and maintaining healthcare coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors for any approved products; and\n\u2022enforcing and defending intellectual property rights and claims.\nIf we are not successful with respect to one or more of these factors in a timely manner or at all, we could experience significant delays or an inability to successfully commercialize any product candidates we develop, which would materially harm our business. If we do not receive marketing approvals for our current and future product candidates, we may not be able to continue our operations.\nAll of our product candidates are in early clinical development. Clinical trials are difficult to design and implement, and they involve a lengthy and expensive process with uncertain outcomes. We may experience delays in completing, or ultimately be unable to complete, the development and commercialization of our current and future product candidates.\nClinical testing is expensive and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. Failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process and our future clinical trial results may not be successful.\nTo date, we have not completed any clinical trials required for the approval of any of our product candidates. Although FS118 is currently being evaluated in Phase 2 proof-of-concept trials and FS222, FS120, and SB 11285 are currently being evaluated in Phase 1 trials, we may experience delays in our ongoing clinical trials and we do not know whether planned clinical trials will begin on time, need to be redesigned, enroll study subjects on time, have sufficient drug supply of our product candidates in order to be completed timely or be completed on schedule, if at all. We may also experience numerous unforeseen events during our clinical trials that could delay or prevent our ability to complete the trials successfully and ultimately to receive marketing approval or to commercialize the product candidates we are developing, including:\n\u2022delays in or failure to obtain regulatory approval or clearance to commence a clinical trial or inability to comply with conditions imposed by a regulatory authority regarding the scope or design of a clinical trial;\n\u2022delays or failure in reaching agreement with the FDA, the EMA, the MHRA, or a comparable foreign regulatory authority on appropriate clinical trial designs;\n\u2022delays in or failure to reach agreement on acceptable terms with prospective contract research organizations (\u201cCROs\u201d), and clinical trial sites, the terms of which can be subject to extensive negotiation and may vary significantly among different CROs and trial sites;\n\u2022inability, delays or failure in identifying and maintaining a sufficient number of clinical trial sites, many of which may already be engaged in other clinical research programs;\n\u2022delays in or failure to obtain ethics committee/institutional review board (\u201cEC/IRB\u201d) approval at each site participating in the trial;\n\u2022delays in or failure to recruit a sufficient number of suitable subjects to participate in a trial;\n\u2022failure to have participants complete a trial or return for post-treatment follow-up, or other inability to monitor patients adequately during or after treatment;\n\u2022clinical sites or clinical investigators deviating from trial protocol or dropping out of a trial;\n\u2022delays in adding new clinical trial sites;\n\u2022failure to manufacture sufficient quantities of a product candidate for use in clinical trials in a timely manner;\n\u2022delay or failure in developing and validating companion diagnostics, if they are deemed necessary, on a timely basis;\n\u2022safety or tolerability concerns that could cause us or our collaborators, as applicable, to suspend or terminate a trial if we or our collaborators find that the participants are being exposed to unacceptable health risks;\n\u2022changes in regulatory requirements, policies and guidelines;\n\u2022failure of our third-party research contractors, including clinical sites and investigators, to comply with regulatory requirements applicable to the trial, including GCPs, or to meet their contractual obligations to us in a timely manner, or at all;\n\u2022delays in establishing the appropriate dosage levels for a particular product candidate through clinical trials;\n\u2022the quality or stability of the product candidate falling below acceptable standards; and\n\u2022business interruptions resulting from pandemics, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, or geo-political actions, including war and terrorism, or natural disasters including earthquakes, typhoons, floods and fires.\nWe could encounter delays if we elect to suspend or terminate a clinical trial, or if a trial is suspended or terminated by the EC/IRBs of the institutions in which such trials are being conducted, or by the FDA, the EMA, the MHRA, or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities, or if a trial is recommended for suspension or termination by the Safety Review Committee (\u201cSRC\u201d), Data Review Committee (\u201cDRC\u201d), or Data Safety Monitoring Board (\u201cDSMB\u201d), for such trial. Any such authorities may impose such a suspension or termination of ongoing human subjects research due to a number of factors, including failure to conduct the clinical trial in accordance with regulatory requirements or our clinical protocols, inspection of the clinical trial operations or trial site by the FDA, the EMA, the MHRA, or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities resulting in the imposition of a clinical hold, unforeseen safety issues or adverse side effects, including those relating to the class to which our product candidates belong, failure to demonstrate a benefit from using a product candidate, changes in governmental regulations or administrative actions or lack of adequate funding to continue the clinical trial. If we experience delays in the completion of, or if we terminate, any clinical trial of a product candidate, the commercial prospects of our product candidates will be harmed, and our ability to generate product revenues from any of these product candidates will be delayed or may become impossible. In addition, any delays in completing clinical trials will increase our costs, slow down our product candidate development and approval process and jeopardize our ability to commence future product sales and generate revenues.\nMoreover, if we make changes to our product candidates, we may need to conduct additional scientific studies to bridge our modified product candidates to earlier versions, which could delay our clinical development plans or future marketing approval for our product candidates. Significant clinical trial delays could also allow our competitors to bring products to market before we do or shorten any periods during which we have the exclusive right to commercialize our product candidates, if approved for marketing, and impair our ability to commercialize any such product candidates.\nAny of these occurrences may harm our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations significantly. In addition, many of the factors that cause, or lead to, a delay in the commencement or completion of clinical trials may also ultimately lead to the denial of regulatory approval for our product candidates or result in the cessation of development of our product candidates.\nOur clinical trials may fail to demonstrate adequately the safety and efficacy of any of our product candidates, which would prevent or delay regulatory approval and commercialization.\nWe currently have no products approved for sale and cannot guarantee that we will ever have marketable products. To obtain the requisite regulatory approvals to market and sell any of our product candidates, including FS118, FS222, FS120, SB 11285, and any other future product candidates, we must demonstrate through extensive preclinical studies and clinical trials that our products are safe and effective in humans for their intended use or uses. Clinical testing is expensive and can take many years to complete, and its outcome is inherently uncertain. Failure can occur at any time during the clinical trial process and our future clinical trial results may not be successful. Further, the process of obtaining regulatory approval to market therapeutic products like our product candidates is expensive, often takes many years following the commencement of clinical trials and can vary substantially based upon the type, complexity and novelty of the product candidates involved, as well as the target indications, patient population and regulatory agency considering the product\u2019s marketing application. Prior to obtaining approval to commercialize a product candidate in the United States or abroad, we or our potential future collaborators must demonstrate with substantial evidence from adequate and well-controlled clinical trials, and to the satisfaction of the FDA, the EMA the MHRA, or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities, that such product candidates are safe and effective for their intended uses.\nClinical trials that we conduct may not demonstrate the efficacy and safety necessary to obtain regulatory approval to market our product candidates. In some instances, there can be significant variability in safety or efficacy results between different clinical trials of the same product candidate due to numerous factors, including changes in trial procedures set forth in protocols, differences in the size and type of the patient populations, changes in and adherence to the clinical trial protocols and the rate of dropout among clinical trial participants. If the results of our ongoing or future clinical trials are inconclusive with respect to the efficacy of our product candidates, if we do not meet the clinical endpoints with statistical and clinically meaningful significance, or if there are safety concerns associated with our product candidates, we may be delayed in obtaining marketing approval, if at all.\nEven if the trials are successfully completed, clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses, and we cannot guarantee that the FDA, the EMA, the MHRA, or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities will interpret the results as we do, and more trials could be required before we submit a product candidate for marketing approval. We cannot guarantee that the FDA, the EMA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities will view our product candidates as being effective and having a favorable benefit-risk profile even if positive results are observed in clinical trials. To the extent that the results of the trials are not satisfactory to the FDA, the EMA, the MHRA, or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities for support of a marketing application, approval of our product candidates may be significantly delayed, or we may be required to expend significant additional resources, which may not be available to us, to conduct additional trials in support of potential approval of our product candidates.\nThe results of preclinical studies and early-stage clinical trials of our product candidates may not be predictive of the results of later-stage clinical trials. Initial success in our ongoing clinical trials may not be indicative of results obtained when these trials are completed or in later-stage trials.\nProduct candidates in later stages of clinical trials may fail to show the desired safety and efficacy traits despite having progressed through preclinical studies and initial clinical trials. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that any of our clinical trials will ultimately be successful or support further clinical development of any of our product candidates. There is a high failure rate for drugs proceeding through clinical trials. Many companies in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries have suffered significant setbacks in late-stage clinical trials after achieving positive results in early-stage development and we cannot be certain that we will not face similar setbacks. These setbacks have been caused by, among other things, preclinical findings made while clinical trials were underway, or safety or efficacy observations made in preclinical studies and clinical trials, including previously unreported adverse events. Moreover, preclinical and clinical data are often susceptible to varying interpretations and analyses and many companies that believed their product candidates performed satisfactorily in preclinical studies and clinical trials nonetheless failed to obtain regulatory authority approval. Any such setbacks in our clinical development could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, some of the clinical trials we conduct may include open-label trials conducted at a limited number of clinical sites on a limited number of patients. An \u201copen-label\u201d clinical trial is one where both the patient and investigator know whether the patient is receiving the investigational product candidate or either an existing approved product or placebo. Most typically, open-label clinical trials test only the investigational product candidate and sometimes may do so at different dose levels. Open-label clinical trials are subject to various limitations that may exaggerate any therapeutic effect as patients in open-label clinical trials are aware when they are receiving treatment. Open-label clinical trials may be subject to a \u201cpatient bias\u201d where patients perceive their symptoms to have improved merely due to their awareness of receiving an experimental treatment. Moreover, patients selected for early-stage clinical trials often include the most severe sufferers and their symptoms may have been bound to improve notwithstanding the new treatment. In addition, open-label clinical trials may be subject to an \u201cinvestigator bias\u201d where those assessing and reviewing the physiological outcomes of the clinical trials are aware of which patients have received treatment and may interpret the information of the treated group more favorably given this knowledge.\nInterim, topline and preliminary data from our clinical trials that we announce or publish from time to time may change as more patient data become available and are subject to audit and verification procedures that could result in material changes in the final data.\nFrom time to time, we may publish interim, topline or preliminary data from our clinical trials. Preliminary and interim data from our clinical trials may change as more patient data become available. Preliminary or interim data from our clinical trials are not necessarily predictive of final results. Preliminary and interim data are subject to the risk that one or more of the clinical outcomes may materially change as patient enrollment continues, more patient data become available, and we issue our final clinical trial report. Interim, topline and preliminary data also remain subject to audit and verification procedures that may result in the final data being materially different from the preliminary data we previously published. As a result, preliminary, topline and interim data should be viewed with caution until the final data are available. Material adverse changes in the final data compared to the interim data could significantly harm our business prospects.\nFurther, others, including regulatory agencies, may not accept or agree with our assumptions, estimates, calculations, conclusions or analyses or may interpret or weigh the importance of data differently, which could impact the value of the particular program, the approvability or commercialization of the particular product candidate or therapeutic product, if any,\nand us in general. In addition, the information we choose to publicly disclose regarding a particular preclinical study or clinical trial is based on what is typically extensive information, and you or others may not agree with what we determine is the material or otherwise appropriate information to include in our disclosure, and any information we determine not to disclose may ultimately be deemed significant with respect to future decisions, conclusions, views, activities or otherwise regarding a particular therapeutic product, if any, product candidate or our business. If the preliminary and interim data that we report differ from actual results, or if others, including regulatory authorities, disagree with the conclusions reached, our ability to obtain approval for, and commercialize, our product candidates may be harmed, which could harm our business, operating results, prospects or financial condition.\nOur product candidates may have serious adverse, undesirable or unacceptable side effects that may delay or prevent marketing approval. If such side effects are identified during the development of our product candidates or following approval, we may need to abandon development of such product candidates, the commercial profile of any approved label may be limited, or we may be subject to other significant negative consequences following marketing approval.\nUndesirable side effects that may be caused by our product candidates could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt, delay or halt clinical trials and could result in a more restrictive label should the candidate be approved for marketing or the delay or denial of regulatory approval by the FDA, the EMA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities. While the data collected on our product candidates in our preclinical studies, and the early clinical trial experience with FS118, FS222, FS120, and SB 11285 to date, suggest that the candidates have generally been well-tolerated from a risk-benefit perspective, the results from future preclinical studies and clinical trials, including of our other product candidates, may not support this conclusion.\nThe results of our ongoing proof-of-concept Phase 2 clinical trials of FS118 and Phase 1 trials for FS222, FS120, and SB 11285, and future clinical trials of these and other product candidates may show that our product candidates cause undesirable or unacceptable side effects or even death. In such an event, our trials could be suspended or terminated and the FDA, the EMA or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities could order us to cease further development of or deny approval of our product candidates for any or all targeted indications. The product-related side effects could affect patient recruitment or the ability of enrolled patients to complete the trial or result in potential product liability claims. Further, because the majority of our current product candidates are based on our modular antibody technology platform and our mAb2 technology, any adverse safety or efficacy findings related to any mAb2 product candidate or preclinical program may adversely impact the viability of our other mAb2 product candidates or preclinical programs. Any of these occurrences may harm our business, reputation, financial condition and results of operations significantly.\nAdditionally, if any of our product candidates receives marketing approval and we or others later identify undesirable or unacceptable side effects caused by such a product, a number of potentially significant negative consequences could result, including:\n\u2022regulatory authorities may withdraw approvals of such product and require our approved product to be taken off the market, through a recall or other action;\n\u2022regulatory authorities may require the addition of labeling statements or specific warnings, such as a \u201cblack box\u201d warning or a contraindication, to the product\u2019s prescribing information, or require field alerts to be sent to physicians and pharmacies;\n\u2022regulatory authorities may require a medication guide explaining the risks of such side effects to be distributed to patients, or that we are to implement a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy to ensure that the benefits of the product outweigh its risks (such as through a REMS in the United States that may include a restricted distribution program or educational programs for prescribers);\n\u2022we may be required to change the way the product is administered;\n\u2022we may be required to conduct additional clinical trials or costly post-marketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety of the product;\n\u2022we may be subject to limitations on how we may promote the product;\n\u2022sales of the product may decrease significantly;\n\u2022we may be subject to litigation or product liability claims; and\n\u2022our reputation may suffer.\nAny of these events could prevent us, our collaborators or our potential future partners from achieving or maintaining market acceptance of the affected product or could substantially increase commercialization costs and expenses, which in turn could delay or prevent us from generating significant revenue from the sale of our mAb2 product candidates, if approved.\nWe may find it difficult to enroll subjects in our clinical trials, which could delay or prevent us from proceeding with clinical trials of our product candidates.\nIdentifying and qualifying study subjects to participate in clinical trials of our product candidates is critical to our success. The timing of our clinical trials depends on our ability to recruit eligible subjects to participate as well as the completion of required follow-up evaluations. Patients and healthy volunteers may be unwilling to participate in our clinical trials because of negative publicity from adverse events related to novel therapeutic approaches, competitive clinical trials for similar patient populations, the existence of current treatments or for other reasons including due to concerns posed by the COVID-19 pandemic. Enrollment risks are heightened with respect to indications that we may target in the future that may be rare or orphan diseases, which may limit the pool of patients that may be enrolled in our planned clinical trials. Any delays related to subject enrollment could result in increased costs, delays in advancing our product candidates, delays in testing the effectiveness of our product candidates or termination of the clinical trials altogether. We may not be able to identify, recruit and enroll a sufficient number of subjects, or those with the required or desired characteristics, to complete our clinical trials in a timely manner. Enrollment and trial completion is affected by many factors, including the:\n\u2022size and nature of the patient population and process for identifying potential study subjects;\n\u2022proximity and availability of clinical trial sites for prospective participants;\n\u2022the extent of we and our collaborators\u2019 efforts to facilitate timely enrollment in clinical trials;\n\u2022eligibility and exclusion criteria for the trial;\n\u2022design of the clinical trial;\n\u2022safety profile, to date, of the product candidate under study;\n\u2022perceived risks and benefits of the product candidate under study;\n\u2022perceived risks and benefits of our approach to treatment of diseases;\n\u2022competition with other companies for clinical sites and qualified clinical investigators;\n\u2022severity of the disease under investigation;\n\u2022degree of progression of the subject\u2019s disease at the time of enrollment;\n\u2022ability to obtain and maintain the study subject\u2019s informed consent;\n\u2022risk that enrolled subjects will drop out before completion of the trial;\n\u2022competing clinical trials and clinicians\u2019 and patients\u2019 perceptions as to the potential advantages of the product candidate being studied in relation to other available therapies, including any new products that may be approved for the indications we are investigating;\n\u2022patient referral practices of physicians; and\n\u2022ability to adequately monitor subjects during and after investigational treatment.\nWe face significant competition for our drug discovery and development efforts, and if we do not compete effectively, our commercial opportunities will be reduced or eliminated.\nWe compete in the segments of the biotechnology, pharmaceutical and other related markets that develop immuno-oncology therapies, and the market for biopharmaceutical products is highly competitive. Our competitors include many established pharmaceutical companies, biotechnology companies, universities and other research or commercial institutions, many of which have substantially greater financial, research and development resources than us. Large pharmaceutical companies, in\nparticular, have extensive experience in clinical testing, recruiting patients, obtaining regulatory approvals, manufacturing and marketing pharmaceutical products. Smaller and early-stage companies may also prove to be significant competitors, particularly through collaborative arrangements with large and established companies. These third parties compete with us in recruiting and retaining qualified scientific and management personnel, establishing clinical trial sites and patient registration for clinical trials, as well as in acquiring technologies complementary to, or necessary for, the development of our product candidates. The fields in which we operate are characterized by rapid technological change and innovation.\nThere are many other companies that have commercialized and/or are developing immuno-oncology therapies for cancer including large biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies, such as AstraZeneca, BMS, Eli Lilly, MSD, Merck KGaA , Darmstadt, Germany (\u201cEMD Serono\u201d), Novartis, Pfizer, Genentech, Inc. (\u201cGenentech\u201d), a subsidiary of the F. Hoffmann-La Roche AG Group (\u201cRoche\u201d) and Sanofi. A number of companies, not limited to those above, are attempting to combine immuno-oncology antibody therapies in order to modulate two cancer pathways simultaneously. Others have developed bispecific antibodies or bispecific fusion proteins in order to leverage the effect of a combination of single-target traditional monoclonal antibodies, which we refer to as traditional antibodies, in a single molecule.\nWith respect to our mAb2 bispecific antibody pipeline, we are aware of several competitors using other technology methods to create bispecific antibodies to treat a variety of cancer types, including, but not limited to Genmab A/S, Inhibrx, MacroGenics, Merus, Pieris Pharmaceuticals, Hoffmann-LaRoche, Shattuck Labs, and Xencor, Inc.\nWith respect to our lead mAb2 product candidate, FS118, we are aware of other competing molecules targeting LAG-3 and PD-1/PD-L1 receptors. Companies pursuing a bispecific molecule directed against LAG-3 and PD-1/PD-L1 in different phases of clinical development include but are not limited to Epimab, Hoffmann-La Roche, I-mab/ABLBio, Innovent, and MacroGenics. We are also aware of other companies pursuing a combination of two traditional antibodies in different phases of clinical development, with the first one targeting PD-1/PD-L1, and the second one targeting LAG-3, which include but are not limited to: BMS, C.H. Boehringer Sohn AG & Co. KG, Nanjing Leads Biolabs/Beigene, and MSD, Novartis, and Regeneron.\nWith respect to our second mAb2 product candidate, FS222, we are aware of other companies pursuing bispecific antibodies targeting PD-L1 and CD137 in clinical development, which include but are not limited to: ABL Bio, Antegene, Biotheus, Genmab/BioNTech SE, Inhibrx/Elpiscience, Merus, Numab Therapeutics AG/CStone Pharmaceuticals, Pieris/Servier, and Qilu Pharmaceutical Co.. We are also aware of other companies that are pursuing a combination of two traditional antibodies in clinical development, with the first one targeting PD-1/PD-L1, and the second one targeting CD137, which include but are not limited to: Adagene, BMS, Eucure Biopharma, Hoffmann-La Roche, Lyvgen Biopharma (Suzhou)/MSD and, Pfizer.\nWith respect to our third mAb2 product candidate, FS120, we are aware of other companies pursuing bispecific antibodies targeting OX40 and CD137, which include but are not limited to Aptevo Therapeutics. We are also aware that Pfizer has ongoing clinical studies evaluating a combination of CD137 plus OX40 traditional antibodies.\nWith respect to our fourth product candidate, SB 11285, we are aware of other companies pursuing a second generation, IV administered STING agonist, in clinical development. These companies include but are not limited to: GSK, Millennium Therapeutics/ Takeda and Stingthera, Inc. Additionally, several other companies are developing a first generation and/or an intratumorally administered STING agonist in the clinic.\nWe anticipate that we will continue to face increasing competition as new treatments enter the market and advanced technologies become available. There can be no assurance that our competitors are not currently developing, or will not in the future develop, products that are equally or more effective or are safer or are more economically attractive than any of our current or future product candidates, or platforms and technology that are superior to our modular antibody technology platform and our mAb2 technology. Competing products or technology platforms may gain faster or greater approval or market acceptance than our products, if any, or modular antibody technology platform and medical advances or rapid technological development by competitors may result in our product candidates or modular antibody technology platform becoming non-competitive or obsolete before we are able to recover our research and development and commercialization expenses. If we, our product candidates or our modular antibody technology platform do not compete effectively, it may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nThe regulatory approval processes of the FDA, the EMA, the MHRA, and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities are lengthy, time consuming and inherently unpredictable, and if we are ultimately unable to obtain regulatory approval for our product candidates, our business will be substantially harmed.\nThe time required to obtain marketing approval for a novel therapeutic product from the FDA, the EMA, the MHRA, and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities is unpredictable but typically takes many years following the commencement of clinical trials and depends upon numerous factors, including the substantial discretion of the regulatory authorities. In addition, approval policies, laws or regulations, or the type and amount of clinical data necessary to gain approval may change during the course of a product candidate\u2019s clinical development and may vary among jurisdictions. We have not obtained regulatory approval for commercialization of any product candidate and it is possible that none of our existing product candidates or any product candidates we may seek to develop in the future will ever obtain that approval.\nOur product candidates could fail to receive regulatory approval for many reasons, including the following:\n\u2022The FDA, the EMA, the MHRA, or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with the design or implementation of our clinical trials;\n\u2022we may be unable to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the FDA, the EMA, the MHRA, or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities that a mAb2 product candidate is safe, pure and potent or effective for its proposed indication(s) or that a small-molecule drug product candidate is safe and effective for its proposed indication(s);\n\u2022the results of clinical trials may not meet the level of statistical significance required by the FDA, the EMA, the MHRA, or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities in order to support approval;\n\u2022we may be unable to demonstrate that a product candidate\u2019s clinical and other benefits outweigh its safety risks;\n\u2022the FDA, the EMA, the MHRA, or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities may disagree with our interpretation of data from preclinical studies or clinical trials;\n\u2022the data collected from clinical trials of our product candidates may not be sufficient to support the submission of a BLA or NDA, to the FDA or other equivalent marketing authorization application submissions to obtain regulatory approval in the United States, the European Union, or elsewhere;\n\u2022upon review of our clinical trial sites and data, the FDA, the EMA, the MHRA, or comparable foreign regulatory authorities may find our record keeping or the record keeping of our clinical trial sites or investigators to be inadequate;\n\u2022the FDA, the EMA, the MHRA, or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities may find deficiencies with or fail to approve the manufacturing processes or facilities of third-party manufacturers with which we contract for clinical and commercial supplies; and\n\u2022the approval policies or regulations of the FDA, the EMA, the MHRA, or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities or the laws they enforce may significantly change in a manner rendering our clinical data insufficient for approval.\nThis lengthy approval process as well as the unpredictability of future clinical trial results may result in our failing to obtain regulatory approval to market any of our product candidates, which would significantly harm our business, financial condition and results of operations. The FDA, the EMA, the MHRA, and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities have substantial discretion in the approval process and determining when or whether to grant regulatory approval will be obtained for any of our product candidates, and whether to impose any conditions on such marketing approvals as described below. Even if we believe the data collected from clinical trials of our product candidates are promising, such data may not be sufficient to support approval by the FDA, the EMA, the MHRA, or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities.\nIn addition, even if we were to obtain approval, regulatory authorities may approve any of our product candidates for fewer or more limited indications than we request, if any, they may grant approval contingent on the performance of costly post-marketing clinical trials, or they may approve a product candidate with a label that does not include the labeling claims necessary or desirable for the successful commercialization of that product candidate or with restrictive risk mitigation measures or warning language or contraindications that make the approved product more difficult or costly to commercialize. Any of the foregoing scenarios could materially harm the commercial prospects for our product candidates.\nIf we are required by the FDA to obtain approval of a companion diagnostic in connection with approval of a product candidate, and we do not obtain or face delays in obtaining FDA approval of a diagnostic device, we will not be able to commercialize the product candidate and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired.\nAccording to current FDA policies, if the FDA determines that a companion diagnostic device is essential to the safe and effective use of a novel therapeutic product in an intent to treat indication, the FDA will not approve the therapeutic product or new therapeutic product indication if the companion diagnostic is not also approved or cleared for that indication. Under the U.S. Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, companion diagnostics are regulated as medical devices, and the FDA requires companion diagnostics intended to select the patients who likely will respond to cancer treatment to receive Premarket Approval (\u201cPMA\u201d) before being commercially distributed. The PMA application process, including the gathering of analytical and prospective clinical data and the submission to and review by the FDA, is rigorous and requires the applicant to provide the FDA with reasonable assurance of the device\u2019s safety and effectiveness and information about the device and its components regarding, among other things, device design, performance, good manufacturing practices, and labeling. A PMA is not guaranteed and may take considerable time, and the FDA may ultimately respond to a PMA submission with a \u201cnot approvable\u201d determination based on deficiencies in the application and require additional clinical trial or other data that may be expensive and time-consuming to generate and that can substantially delay approval. As a result, if we are required by the FDA to obtain approval of a companion diagnostic for a therapeutic product candidate, and we do not obtain or there are delays in obtaining FDA approval of such a diagnostic device, we may not be able to commercialize the product candidate on a timely basis or at all and our ability to generate revenue will be materially impaired.\nAny product candidate for which we obtain marketing approval will be subject to extensive post-marketing regulatory requirements, which may result in significant additional expense, and could be subject to post-marketing restrictions or withdrawal from the market, and we or our partners may be subject to penalties for any failure to comply with regulatory requirements or if problems are discovered with a product after approval.\nOur therapeutic product candidates, if approved, could be subject to labeling and other restrictions and market withdrawal and we may be subject to penalties if we fail to comply with ongoing regulatory requirements or experiences unanticipated problems with any such approved prescription drug or biological products.\nIf the FDA, the EMA, the MHRA, or other comparable foreign regulatory authority approves any of our product candidates, the manufacturing processes, labeling, packaging, distribution, adverse event reporting, storage, advertising, promotion and recordkeeping for the therapeutic product will be subject to extensive and ongoing regulatory requirements. These requirements include submissions of safety and other post-marketing information and reports, establishment registration, as well as continued compliance with cGMP by all facilities involved in the production of the approved therapeutic product and with compliance with GCP by all collaborators in any clinical trials that we may conduct post-approval, each of which may result in significant expense. In addition, any regulatory approvals that we receive for our product candidates may also be subject to limitations on the approved indicated uses for which the product may be marketed or to the conditions of approval, or contain requirements for potentially costly post-marketing testing, including Phase 4 clinical trials, and surveillance to monitor the safety and efficacy of the product candidate. The FDA, as well as its foreign regulatory counterparts, also have significant post-market authority, including the authority to require labeling changes based on new safety information.\nMoreover, the FDA strictly regulates the promotional claims that may be made about prescription drug and biological products. In particular, a product may not be promoted for off-label uses that are not approved by the FDA as reflected in the product\u2019s approved prescribing information and other FDA-approved product labeling. However, companies may share truthful and not misleading information that is otherwise consistent with a product\u2019s FDA approved labeling. The FDA and other agencies actively enforce the laws and regulations prohibiting the promotion of off-label uses for prescription medical products. Further, if there are any modifications to the biologic, including changes in indications, labeling or manufacturing processes or facilities, the applicant may be required to submit and obtain FDA approval of a new BLA/NDA or BLA/NDA supplement.\nIf there are changes in the application of legislation, regulations or regulatory policies, or if problems are discovered with a product or our manufacture of a product, or if we or one of our distributors, licensees or co-marketers fails to comply with regulatory requirements, regulatory authorities could take various actions against the therapeutic product or against us as the product\u2019s sponsor. These include imposing fines on us, imposing restrictions on the product or its manufacture and requiring a recall or other removal of the product from the market. The regulators could also suspend or withdraw our marketing authorizations, require us to conduct additional clinical trials or to submit additional applications for marketing authorization,\nor require safety updates to or otherwise change the product labeling for an approved therapeutic product. If any of these events occurs, our ability to sell such product may be impaired, and We may incur substantial additional expense to comply with regulatory requirements, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may become exposed to costly and damaging liability claims, either when testing our product candidates in the clinic or at the commercial stage, and our product liability insurance may not cover all damages from such claims.\nWe are exposed to potential product liability and professional indemnity risks that are inherent in the research, development, manufacturing, marketing and use of biopharmaceutical products. Currently, we have no products that have been approved for commercial sale; however, the current and future use of product candidates by us and our collaborators in clinical trials, and the potential sale of any approved products in the future, may expose us to liability claims. These claims might be made by patients who use the product, healthcare providers, pharmaceutical companies, our collaborators or others selling such products. Any claims against us, regardless of their merit, could be difficult and costly to defend and could materially adversely affect the market for our product candidates or any prospects for commercialization of our product candidates. Although the clinical trial process is designed to identify and assess potential side effects, it is always possible that a product, even after regulatory approval, may exhibit unforeseen side effects. If any of our product candidates were to cause adverse side effects during clinical trials or after approval of the product candidate, we may be exposed to substantial liabilities. Physicians and patients may not comply with any warnings that identify known potential adverse effects and patients who should not use our product candidates. Regardless of the merits or eventual outcome, liability claims may result in:\n\u2022decreased demand for our products due to negative public perception;\n\u2022injury to our reputation;\n\u2022withdrawal of clinical trial participants or difficulties in recruiting new trial participants;\n\u2022initiation of investigations by regulators;\n\u2022costs to defend or settle the related litigation;\n\u2022a diversion of management\u2019s time and our resources;\n\u2022substantial monetary awards to trial participants or patients;\n\u2022product recalls, withdrawals or labeling, marketing or promotional restrictions;\n\u2022loss of revenues from product sales; and\n\u2022the inability to commercialize any of our product candidates, if approved.\nAlthough we believe we maintain adequate product liability insurance for our product candidates, it is possible that our liabilities could exceed our insurance coverage. We intend to expand our insurance coverage to include the sale of commercial products if we obtain marketing approval for any of our product candidates. However, we may not be able to maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or obtain insurance coverage that will be adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise. If a successful product liability claim or series of claims is brought against us for uninsured liabilities or in excess of insured liabilities, our assets may not be sufficient to cover such claims and our business operations could be impaired.\nShould any of the events described above occur, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDue to our limited resources and access to capital, we must, and have in the past decided to, prioritize development of certain product candidates over other potential product candidates. These decisions may prove to have been wrong and may adversely affect our ability to develop our own programs, our attractiveness as a commercial partner and may ultimately have an impact on our commercial success.\nBecause we have limited resources and access to capital to fund our operations, we must decide which product candidates to pursue and the amount of resources to allocate to each. Our decisions concerning the allocation of research, collaboration, management and financial resources toward particular mAb2 bispecific antibodies, product candidates or therapeutic areas\nmay not lead to the development of viable commercial products and may divert resources away from better opportunities. Similarly, our decisions to delay, terminate or collaborate with third parties in respect of certain product development programs may also prove not to be optimal and could cause us to miss valuable opportunities. If we make incorrect determinations regarding the market potential of our product candidates or misreads trends in the biopharmaceutical industry our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nWe may seek orphan drug designation for product candidates we develop, and we may be unsuccessful or may be unable to maintain the benefits associated with orphan drug designation, including the potential for market exclusivity if a designed product candidate is ultimately approved.\nAs part of our business strategy, we may seek orphan drug designation for any product candidates we develop, and we may be unsuccessful in securing such a designation. Regulatory authorities in some jurisdictions, including the United States and the European Union, may designate drugs for relatively small patient populations as orphan drugs. Under the Orphan Drug Act in the United States, the FDA may designate a drug or a biological product as an orphan drug if it is a drug intended to treat a rare disease or condition, which is generally defined as a patient population of fewer than 200,000 individuals annually in the United States, or a patient population greater than 200,000 in the United States where there is no reasonable expectation that the cost of developing the drug will be recovered from sales in the United States. In the United States, orphan drug designation entitles a party to financial incentives such as opportunities for grant funding towards certain clinical trial costs, tax advantages and user-fee waivers.\nSimilarly, in Europe, the European Commission grants orphan designation after receiving the opinion of the EMA Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products on an orphan designation application. Orphan designation is intended to promote the development of drugs that are intended for the diagnosis, prevention or treatment of life-threatening or chronically debilitating conditions affecting not more than 5 in 10,000 persons in the European Union and for which no satisfactory method of diagnosis, prevention, or treatment has been authorized (or the product would be a significant benefit to those affected). Additionally, designation is granted for drugs intended for the diagnosis, prevention, or treatment of a life-threatening, seriously debilitating or serious and chronic condition and when, without incentives, it is unlikely that sales of the drug in the European Union would be sufficient to justify the necessary investment in developing the drug. In the European Union, orphan designation entitles a party to a number of incentives, such as protocol assistance and scientific advice specifically for designated orphan medicines, and potential fee reductions depending on the status of the sponsor.\nGenerally, in the United States, if a drug or biologic with an orphan drug designation subsequently receives the first marketing approval for the indication for which it has such designation, the drug is entitled to a period of marketing exclusivity, which precludes the FDA from approving another marketing application for the same drug and the same orphan indication for that time period, except in limited circumstances. The applicable period is seven years in the United States. In addition, there is a potential to receive a six-month extension of orphan exclusivity if certain pediatric studies are conducted and the results are reported to the FDA in response to a Written Request for such studies under the Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act.\nIn Europe, an approved orphan medicinal product is entitled to ten years of market exclusivity in all European Union member states. However, marketing authorization may be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication during the ten-year period with the consent of the marketing authorization holder for the original orphan medicinal product or if the manufacturer of the original orphan medicinal product is unable to supply sufficient quantities of such product. Marketing authorization may also be granted to a similar medicinal product with the same orphan indication if the similar product is established to be safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior to the original orphan medicinal product. After five years, an EU member state can request that the period of market exclusivity be reduced to six years if it can be demonstrated that the criteria for orphan designation no longer apply and the medicine is sufficiently profitable. The period of market exclusivity may be extended for an additional two years for medicines that have also complied with an agreed PIP.\nSimilarly, even if we obtain orphan drug exclusivity for a product candidate that is approved for marketing in the United States, such exclusivity may not effectively protect the product candidate from competition because different therapies can be approved for the same condition and the same therapies can be approved for different conditions but used off-label. Even after an orphan drug is approved, the FDA can subsequently approve the later drug for the same condition if the FDA concludes that the later drug is clinically superior in that it is shown to be safer, more effective or makes a major contribution to patient care. In addition, a designated orphan drug may not receive orphan drug exclusivity if it is approved for a use that is broader than the indication for which it received orphan designation. Moreover, orphan drug exclusive marketing rights in\nthe United States may be lost if the FDA later determines that the request for designation was materially defective or if the manufacturer is unable to assure sufficient quantity of the drug to meet the needs of patients with the rare disease or condition.\nOrphan drug designation neither shortens the development time or regulatory review time of a drug nor gives the drug any advantage in the regulatory review or approval process. While we may seek orphan drug designation for applicable indications for our current and any future product candidates, we may never receive such designations.\nAccordingly, even if we do receive such designations in the United States and/or in Europe, there is no guarantee that we will enjoy the benefits of those designations.\nOur approach to the discovery and development of our therapeutic treatments is based on novel technologies that are unproven and may not result in marketable products.\nWe plan to develop a pipeline of mAb2 product candidates using our modular antibody technology platform. We believe that mAb2 product candidates identified with our modular antibody technology platform may offer an improved therapeutic approach by creating fully formed molecules using standard antibody production technology, thereby potentially improving the binding and biological response, and reducing any need for reassembly or other post-synthesis modifications.\nHowever, we have not, nor to our knowledge has any other company, received regulatory approval for a therapeutic that uses tetravalent bispecific IgG1 antibody technology. We cannot be certain that our approach will lead to the development of approvable or marketable products. In addition, the FDA, the EMA, the MHRA, or other comparable foreign regulatory agencies may lack experience in evaluating the safety and efficacy of products based on our mAb2 technology, which could result in a longer than expected regulatory review process, increase our expected development costs and delay or prevent commercialization of our mAb2 product candidates.\nWe may not be successful in our efforts to utilize our modular antibody technology platform and mAb2 technology to build a pipeline of additional mAb2 product candidates. Failure to successfully identify, develop and commercialize additional products or mAb2 product candidates could impair our ability to grow.\nAlthough a substantial amount of our efforts will continue to focus on the preclinical studies and clinical testing and potential approval of the mAb2 product candidates in our current pipeline, a key element of our long-term growth strategy is to identify, develop and market additional products and mAb2 product candidates. Because we have limited financial and managerial resources, continuing to utilize our modular antibody technology platform and our mAb2 technology to generate mAb2 bispecific antibodies and identify mAb2 product candidates with certain advantages, such as safety and potency, beyond what would be achieved with a combination of two traditional antibodies or bispecific antibodies, will require substantial additional technical, financial and human resources, whether or not any mAb2 product candidates are ultimately identified. Our modular antibody technology platform may fail to generate mAb2 bispecific antibodies that are suitable for further development, and we may fail to correctly identify future mAb2 product candidates that have the potential to become successful products. We will need to continue to invest in improving and expanding our modular antibody technology platform and our mAb2 technology, which will require scientific expertise and substantial resources.\nWe also have incorporated a novel technology of synthesizing cyclic dinucleotides for the generation of STING pathway targeting small-molecule drug product candidates, such as our current clinical candidate SB 11285. We cannot be certain that this approach will lead to the development of approvable or marketable products. In addition, the FDA, the EMA or other comparable foreign regulatory agencies may lack experience in evaluating the safety and efficacy of such products, which could result in a longer than expected regulatory review process, increase our expected development costs and delay or prevent commercialization of our product candidates. We may not be successful in our efforts to utilize our cyclic dinucleotide technology to build additional product candidates. Failure to successfully identify, develop and commercialize additional products or product candidates could impair our ability to grow.\nAll therapeutic product candidates are prone to risks of failure typical of biopharmaceutical product development, including the possibility that a product candidate may not be suitable for clinical development as a result of its harmful side effects, limited efficacy or other characteristics that indicate that it is unlikely to be a product that will receive approval by the FDA, the EMA and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities and achieve market acceptance. If we do not successfully\ndevelop and commercialize our mAb2 biological product candidates or small-molecule STING agonist drug product candidates based upon our current platforms and technological approaches, we may not be able to obtain product or collaboration revenues in future periods, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur product candidates that are successful in achieving marketing approval may face generic or biosimilar competition sooner than anticipated.\nEven if we are successful in achieving regulatory approval to commercialize a product candidate for a specific indication ahead of our competitors, such an approved therapeutic candidate may face competition from generic or biosimilar products, as applicable.\nIn the United States, mAb2 product candidates are regulated by the FDA as biological products and we intend to seek approval for these therapeutic candidates pursuant to the BLA pathway. The BPCIA created an abbreviated pathway for the FDA approval of biosimilar biological products based on a previously licensed innovator, or reference, biological product. Under the BPCIA, an application for a biosimilar biological product cannot be approved by the FDA until 12 years after the original reference biological product was approved under a BLA. The law is complex and is still being interpreted and implemented by the FDA. As a result, its ultimate impact, implementation, and meaning are subject to uncertainty. While it is uncertain when such processes intended to implement BPCIA may be fully adopted by the FDA, any such processes could have a material adverse effect on the future commercial prospects for our product candidates.\nWe believe that any of our mAb2 product candidates approved as a biological product under a BLA should qualify for the 12-year period of exclusivity available to reference biological products. However, there is a risk that this exclusivity could be shortened due to Congressional action or otherwise, or that the FDA will not consider our therapeutic candidates to be reference biological products pursuant to its interpretation of the exclusivity provisions of the BPCIA, potentially creating the opportunity for follow-on biosimilar competition sooner than anticipated. Moreover, the extent to which a biosimilar product, once approved, will be substituted for any reference product in a way that is similar to traditional generic substitution for non-biological products is not yet clear, and will depend on a number of marketplace and regulatory factors that are still developing including whether a future competitor seeks an interchangeability designation for a biosimilar of a future approved biological products. Under the BPCIA as well as state pharmacy laws, only so-called \u201cinterchangeable\u201d biosimilar products are considered substitutable for the reference biological product without the intervention of the healthcare provider who prescribed the original biological product. However, as with all prescribing decisions made in the context of a patient-provider relationship and a patient\u2019s specific medical needs, healthcare providers are not restricted from prescribing biosimilar products in an off-label manner. In addition, a competitor could decide to forego the abbreviated approval pathway available for biosimilar products and to submit a full BLA for product licensure after completing its own preclinical studies and clinical trials. In such a situation, any exclusivity to which we may be eligible under the BPCIA would not prevent the competitor from marketing its biological product as soon as it is approved.\nIn Europe, the European Commission has granted marketing authorizations for several biosimilar products pursuant to a set of general and product class-specific guidelines for biosimilar approvals issued over the past few years. In addition, companies may be developing biosimilar products in other countries that could compete with our products, if approved.\nIf competitors are able to obtain marketing approval for biosimilars referencing an approved our mAb2 product candidates, if approved, our future products may become subject to competition from such biosimilars, whether or not they are designated as interchangeable, with the attendant competitive pressure and potential adverse consequences. Such competitive products may be able to immediately compete with us in each indication for which its product candidates may have received approval.\nFurther, our small-molecule drug product candidates such as SB 11285 are regulated by the FDA as drug products and would be subject to marketing approval by the FDA pursuant to an NDA submitted under Section 505(b)(1) of the FDCA. Even if we are successful in achieving regulatory approval to commercialize SB 11285 or a future drug product candidate, we may face competition from generic products earlier or more aggressively than anticipated, depending upon how well the future product performs in the United States prescription drug market. In addition to creating the 505(b)(2) NDA pathway that allows for follow-on applications relying on a reference drug product when some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference, the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the FDCA authorized the FDA to approve generic drugs that are the same as drugs previously approved for marketing under the NDA provisions of the statute pursuant to abbreviated new drug applications, or ANDAs. An ANDA relies on the preclinical and clinical testing conducted for a previously approved reference listed drug\n(\u201cRLD\u201d) and must demonstrate to the FDA that the generic drug product is identical to the RLD with respect to the active ingredients, the route of administration, the dosage form, and the strength of the drug and also that it is \u201cbioequivalent\u201d to the RLD. The FDA is prohibited by statute from approving an ANDA when certain marketing or data exclusivity protections apply to the RLD.\nIf the FDA in the future were to approve an NDA for SB 11285 or another small-molecule drug product candidate, such a product would be expected to be designated as an RLD. Such a designation as an RLD would allow for a subsequent ANDA or 505(b)(2) NDA to rely in whole or in part on our RLD, as applicable. We cannot predict the interest of potential generic or follow-on competitors in the future market, whether someone will attempt to invalidate any period of 5-year or 3-year exclusivity that an approved small-molecule drug product candidate may receive or otherwise force the FDA to take other actions, or how quickly others may seek to come to market with competing products after any such marketing exclusivity period ends. In addition, should any such future generic or follow-on product be identified by the FDA as \u201ctherapeutically equivalent\u201d to our relevant small-molecule drug product candidate, if or when approved and listed in the Orange Book, physicians and pharmacists consider it to be fully substitutable for our relevant RLD. By operation of certain state laws and numerous health insurance programs, the FDA\u2019s designation of therapeutic equivalence often results in substitution of the generic drug without the knowledge or consent of either the prescribing physician or patient. Such competitive products may be able to immediately compete with us in each indication for which its small-molecule drug product candidates may have received approval.\nThe successful commercialization of our product candidates will depend in part on the extent to which governmental authorities and health insurers establish coverage and adequate reimbursement levels, as well as pricing policies. Failure to obtain or maintain adequate coverage and reimbursement for our product candidates, if approved, could limit our ability to market those products and decrease our ability to generate revenue.\nThe availability and adequacy of coverage and reimbursement by governmental healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, private health insurers and other third-party payors are essential for most patients to be able to afford products such as our product candidates, if approved. Even if we receive approval to market one or more of our product candidates in the future, our ability to achieve acceptable levels of coverage and reimbursement for such product candidates by governmental authorities, private health insurers and other organizations will have an effect on our ability to successfully commercialize and attract additional collaboration partners to invest in the development of, our product candidates. Assuming we obtain coverage for a given product by a third-party payor, the resulting reimbursement payment rates may not be adequate or may require co-payments that patients find unacceptably high. We cannot be sure that coverage and reimbursement in the United States, the European Union or elsewhere will be available for any product that we may develop, and any reimbursement that may become available may be decreased or eliminated in the future.\nObtaining and maintaining reimbursement status is time-consuming and costly. No uniform policy for coverage and reimbursement for drug products exist among third-party payors in the United States. Therefore, coverage and reimbursement for drug products can differ significantly from payor to payor. As a result, the coverage determination process is often a time-consuming and costly process that will require us to provide scientific and clinical support for the use of our products to each payor separately, with no assurance that coverage and adequate reimbursement will be applied consistently or obtained in the first instance. Furthermore, rules and regulations regarding reimbursement change frequently, in some cases at short notice, and we believe that changes in these rules and regulations are likely.\nCoverage and reimbursement by a third-party payor may depend upon a number of factors, including the third-party payor\u2019s determination that use of a product is:\n\u2022a covered benefit under its health plan;\n\u2022safe, effective and medically necessary;\n\u2022appropriate for the specific patient;\n\u2022cost-effective; and\n\u2022neither experimental nor investigational.\nThere is significant uncertainty related to the insurance coverage and reimbursement of newly approved products. In the United States, third-party payors, including private and governmental payors, such as the Medicare and Medicaid programs, play an important role in determining the extent to which new drugs and biologics will be covered. The Medicare and\nMedicaid programs increasingly are used as models for how private payors and other governmental payors develop their coverage and reimbursement policies for drugs and biologics. Some third-party payors may require pre-approval of coverage for new or innovative devices or drug therapies before they will reimburse healthcare providers who use such therapies. It is difficult to predict at this time what third-party payors will decide with respect to the coverage and reimbursement for our product candidates.\nThird-party payors increasingly are challenging prices charged for pharmaceutical products and services, and many third-party payors may refuse to provide coverage and reimbursement for particular drugs when an equivalent generic/biosimilar drug or a less expensive therapy is available. It is possible that a third-party payor may consider our product candidate and other therapies as substitutable and only offer to reimburse patients for the less expensive product. Even if we show improved efficacy or improved convenience of administration with our product candidate over other available and comparable products, pricing of existing drugs may limit the amount we will be able to charge for its product candidate. These payors may deny or revoke the reimbursement status of a given drug product or establish prices for new or existing marketed products at levels that are too low to enable it to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development. If coverage and reimbursement is not available or is available only at limited levels, we may not be able to successfully commercialize our product candidates and may not be able to obtain a satisfactory financial return on products that we may develop.\nFor products administered under the supervision of a physician, obtaining coverage and adequate reimbursement may be particularly difficult because of the higher prices often associated with such drugs. Additionally, separate reimbursement for the product itself or the treatment or procedure in which the product is used may not be available, which may impact physician utilization. For example, under these circumstances, physicians may limit how much or under what circumstances they will prescribe or administer our products and patients may deliver to purchase such products. This, in turn, could affect our ability to commercialize our products successfully and impact our profitability, results of operations, financial condition, and future success.\nOutside the United States, international operations are generally subject to extensive governmental price controls and other market regulations, and we believe the increasing emphasis on cost-containment initiatives in Europe, Canada and other countries has and will continue to put pressure on the pricing and usage of our product candidates. In many countries, the prices of medical products are subject to varying price control mechanisms as part of national health systems. Other countries allow companies to fix their own prices for medical products but monitor and control company profits. Additional foreign price controls or other changes in pricing regulation could restrict the amount that we are able to charge for our product candidates. Accordingly, in markets outside the United States, the reimbursement for our products may be reduced compared with the United States and may be insufficient to generate commercially reasonable revenue and profits.\nThe delivery of healthcare in the European Union, including the establishment and operation of health services and the pricing and reimbursement of medicines, is almost exclusively a matter for national, rather than European Union, law and policy. National governments and health service providers have different priorities and approaches to the delivery of healthcare and the pricing and reimbursement of products in that context. In general, however, the healthcare budgetary constraints in most European Union member states have resulted in restrictions on the pricing and reimbursement of medicines by relevant health service providers. Coupled with ever-increasing European Union and national regulatory burdens on those wishing to develop and market products, this could prevent or delay marketing approval of our product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities and affect our ability to commercialize any products for which we obtain marketing approval.\nMoreover, increasing efforts by governmental and third-party payors in the United States, the European Union and other jurisdictions to cap or reduce healthcare costs may cause such organizations to limit both coverage and the level of reimbursement for newly approved products and, as a result, they may not cover or provide adequate payment for our product candidates. We expect to experience pricing pressures in connection with the sale of any of our product candidates due to the trend toward managed healthcare, the increasing influence of health maintenance organizations and additional legislative changes. The downward pressure on healthcare costs in general, particularly prescription drugs and surgical procedures and other treatments, has become very intense. As a result, increasingly high barriers are being erected to the entry of new products.\nThe future commercial success of our product candidates will depend on the degree of market acceptance of our potential therapeutic products among physicians, patients, third-party payors and the medical community.\nTo date, we have no products authorized for marketing and we do not expect to be able to commercialize any of our product candidates for a number of years, if ever. Even if one or more of our product candidates are approved for commercialization, they may not achieve an adequate level of acceptance by physicians, patients and the medical community, and we may not become profitable. In addition, efforts to educate the medical community and third-party payors on the benefits of our future approved products may require significant resources and may never be successful which would prevent us from generating significant revenues or becoming profitable.\nMarket acceptance of our future products by physicians, patients and third-party payors will depend on a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022the clinical indications for which our product candidates are approved for marketing;\n\u2022physicians, hospitals, cancer treatment centers and patients considering our product candidates as a safe and effective treatment;\n\u2022the potential and perceived advantages of our product candidates over alternative treatments;\n\u2022the prevalence and severity of any side effects;\n\u2022product labeling or prescribing information requirements of the FDA, the EMA, the MHRA, or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities, or any risk mitigation measures that are required to be followed as part of the product\u2019s marketing approval;\n\u2022limitations or warnings contained in the product labeling approved by the FDA, the EMA, the MHRA, or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities, including any restrictions on concomitant use of other medications;;\n\u2022the timing of market introduction of our product candidates in relation to other potentially competitive products;\n\u2022the cost and cost-effectiveness of our product candidates in relation to alternative treatments;\n\u2022the amount of upfront costs or training required for physicians to administer our product candidates;\n\u2022the availability of coverage and adequate reimbursement from third-party payors and government authorities;\n\u2022the willingness of patients to pay out-of-pocket in the absence of comprehensive coverage and reimbursement by third-party payors and government authorities;\n\u2022the relative convenience and ease of administration, including as compared to alternative treatments and competitive therapies;\n\u2022support from patient advocacy groups;\n\u2022the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts and distribution support; and\n\u2022the presence or perceived risk of potential product liability claims.\nIf our product candidates fail to gain market acceptance after receiving regulatory approval, this will have a material adverse impact on our ability to generate revenues to provide a satisfactory, or any, return on our investments. Even if some products achieve market acceptance, the market may prove not to be large enough to allow us to generate significant revenues.\nHealthcare legislative reform measures may have a negative impact on our business and results of operations.\nIn the United States and some foreign jurisdictions, there have been, and continue to be, several legislative and regulatory changes and proposed changes regarding the healthcare system that could prevent or delay marketing approval of product candidates, restrict or regulate post-approval activities, and affect our ability to profitably sell any product candidates for which we obtain marketing approval. Changes in regulations, statutes, or the interpretation of existing regulations could impact our business in the future by requiring, for example: (i) changes to our manufacturing arrangements, (ii) additions or modifications to product labeling, (iii) the recall or discontinuation of our products, (iv) restriction on coverage, reimbursement, and pricing for our products, (v) transparency reporting obligations regarding transfers of value to healthcare\nprofessionals or (vi) additional record-keeping requirements. If any such changes were to be imposed, they could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIn the United States, there have been and continue to be a number of legislative initiatives to contain healthcare costs. For example, in March 2010, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the \u201cACA\u201d), was passed, which substantially changed the way healthcare is financed by both governmental and private insurers, and significantly impacted the U.S. pharmaceutical industry. The ACA, among other things, subjected biological products to potential competition by lower-cost biosimilars, addressed a new methodology by which rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program are calculated for drugs and biologics that are inhaled, infused, instilled, implanted or injected, increased the minimum Medicaid rebates owed by manufacturers under the Medicaid Drug Rebate Program and extended the rebate program to individuals enrolled in Medicaid managed care organizations, established annual fees and taxes on manufacturers of certain branded prescription drugs and biologics, and created a new Medicare Part D coverage gap discount program, in which manufacturers must agree to offer 70% (increased from 50% pursuant to the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, effective as of 2019) point-of-sale discounts off negotiated prices of applicable brand drugs and biologics to eligible beneficiaries during their coverage gap period, as a condition for the manufacturer\u2019s outpatient drugs or biologics to be covered under Medicare Part D.\nSince its enactment, there have been judicial, executive and Congressional challenges to certain aspects of the ACA. However, following several years of litigation in the federal courts, in June 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the ACA when it dismissed a legal challenge to the ACA\u2019s constitutionality. Further legislative and regulatory changes under the ACA remain possible, although the new federal administration under President Biden has signaled that it plans to build on the ACA and expand the number of people who are eligible for health insurance subsidies under it. It is unknown what form any such changes or any law would take, and how or whether it may affect the biopharmaceutical industry as a whole or our business in the future. We expect that changes or additions to the ACA, the Medicare and Medicaid programs, such as changes allowing the federal government to directly negotiate drug prices, and changes stemming from other healthcare reform measures, especially with regard to healthcare access, financing or other legislation in individual states, could have a material adverse effect on the health care industry in the United States.\nIn addition, other legislative changes have been proposed and adopted since the ACA was enacted. On August 2, 2011, the Budget Control Act of 2011 was signed into law, which, among other things, resulted in reductions to Medicare payments to providers of 2% per fiscal year, which went into effect on April 1, 2013 and, due to subsequent legislative amendments to the statute, will remain in effect through 2030, with the exception of a temporary suspension from May 1, 2020 through June 30, 2022 (a 1% sequester will apply from April 1, 2022 through June 30, 2022) due to the COVID-19 pandemic, unless additional Congressional action is taken. As another example, the 2021 Consolidated Appropriations Act signed into law on December 27, 2020 incorporated extensive healthcare provisions and amendments to existing laws, including a requirement that all manufacturers of drugs and biological products covered under Medicare Part B report the product\u2019s average sales price, or ASP, to Department of Health and HHS beginning on January 1, 2022, subject to enforcement via civil money penalties.\nFurther, there has been heightened governmental scrutiny in the United States of pharmaceutical pricing practices in light of the rising cost of prescription drugs. Such scrutiny has resulted in several recent congressional inquiries and proposed and enacted federal and state legislation designed to, among other things, bring more transparency to product pricing, review the relationship between pricing and manufacturer patient programs, and reform government program reimbursement methodologies for products. Although a number of these and other measures may require additional authorization to become effective, Congress and the current U.S. administration have each indicated that it will continue to seek new legislative and/or administrative measures to control drug costs. Any reduction in reimbursement from Medicare and other government programs may result in a similar reduction in payments from private payors. Moreover, in July 2021, President Biden issued a sweeping executive order on promoting competition in the American economy that includes several mandates pertaining to the pharmaceutical and healthcare insurance industries. Among other things, the executive order directs the FDA to work towards implementing a system for importing drugs from Canada (following on a Trump administration notice-and-comment rulemaking on Canadian drug importation that was finalized in October 2020). The Biden order also called on HHS to release a comprehensive plan to combat high prescription drug prices, and it includes several directives regarding the Federal Trade Commission\u2019s oversight of potentially anticompetitive practices within the pharmaceutical industry. The drug pricing plan released by HHS in September 2021 in response to the executive order makes clear that the Biden Administration supports aggressive action to address rising drug prices, including allowing HHS to negotiate the cost of Medicare Part B and D drugs, but such significant changes will require either new legislation to be passed by Congress or time-consuming administrative\nactions. Accordingly, there remains a large amount of uncertainty regarding the federal government\u2019s approach to making pharmaceutical treatment costs more affordable for patients.\nAt the state level, legislatures have increasingly passed legislation and implemented regulations designed to control pharmaceutical and biological product pricing, including price or patient reimbursement constraints, discounts, restrictions on certain product access and marketing cost disclosure and transparency measures, and, in some cases, designed to encourage importation from other countries and bulk purchasing. For example, California requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to notify certain purchasers, including health insurers and government health plans at least 60 days before any scheduled increase in the wholesale acquisition cost (\u201cWAC\u201d), of their product if the increase exceeds 16%, and further requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to explain whether a change or improvement in the product necessitates such an increase. Similarly, Vermont requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to disclose price information on certain prescription drugs, and to provide notification to the state if introducing a new drug with a WAC in excess of the Medicare Part D specialty drug threshold. In December 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court also held unanimously that federal law does not preempt the states\u2019 ability to regulate pharmaceutical benefit managers, or PBMs, and other members of the healthcare and pharmaceutical supply chain, an important decision that may lead to further and more aggressive efforts by states in this area. Legally mandated price controls on payment amounts by third-party payors or other restrictions could harm our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects. In addition, regional healthcare authorities and individual hospitals are increasingly using bidding procedures to determine what pharmaceutical products and which suppliers will be included in their prescription drug and other healthcare programs. This could reduce the ultimate demand for our product candidates, if approved, or put pressure on our product pricing, which could negatively affect our business, results of operations, financial condition and prospects.\nWe expect that the ACA, the recent laws described above, and other healthcare reform measures that may be adopted in the future may result in additional reductions in Medicare and other healthcare funding, more rigorous coverage criteria, new payment methodologies and additional downward pressure on the price that we receive for any approved product. The implementation of cost containment measures or other healthcare reforms may prevent us from being able to generate revenue, attain profitability, or commercialize or product candidates, if approved. Further, it is possible that additional governmental action will be taken in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nOutside of the United States, particularly in the European Union, the coverage status and pricing of prescription pharmaceuticals and biologics is subject to governmental control. In these countries, pricing negotiations with governmental authorities can take considerable time after the receipt of marketing approval for a product. Furthermore, the requirements may differ across the European Union Member States. To obtain coverage and reimbursement or pricing approval in some countries, we may be required to conduct a clinical trial that compares the cost-effectiveness of our product candidate to other available therapies. If reimbursement of our products is unavailable or limited in scope or amount, or if pricing is set at unsatisfactory levels, our business could be harmed. Also, at national level, actions have been taken to enact transparency and anti-gift laws (similar to the U.S. Physician Payments Sunshine Act) regarding payments between pharmaceutical companies and healthcare professionals.\nOur business operations and current and future relationships with clinical investigators, healthcare professionals, consultants, third-party payors and customers may be subject, directly or indirectly, to federal and state healthcare fraud and abuse laws, false claims laws, health information privacy and security laws, and other healthcare laws. If we are unable to comply, or has not fully complied, with such laws, we could face substantial penalties.\nAlthough we do not currently have any products on the market, our current and future operations may be directly, or indirectly through our relationships with clinical investigators, healthcare professionals, customers and third-party payors, subject to broadly applicable healthcare laws U.S. federal and state fraud and abuse and other healthcare laws and regulations, including, without limitation, the Anti-Kickback Statute. Healthcare providers, physicians and others play a primary role in the recommendation and prescription of any products for which we obtain marketing approval. These laws impact, among other things, our proposed sales, marketing and education programs and constrain our business and financial arrangements and relationships with third-party payors, healthcare professionals who participate in our clinical research program, healthcare professionals and others who recommend, purchase, or provide our approved products, and other parties through which we market, sell and distribute our products for which we obtain marketing approval. In addition, we may be subject to patient data privacy and security regulation by both the U.S. federal government and the states in which we conduct our business. Finally, our current and future operations are subject to additional healthcare-related statutory and regulatory requirements and enforcement by foreign regulatory authorities in jurisdictions in which we conduct our business.\n\u2022the Anti-Kickback Statute, which prohibits, among other things, persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting, offering, receiving or paying any remuneration (including any kickback, bribe, or certain rebate), directly or indirectly, overtly or covertly, in cash or in kind, to induce or reward either the referral of an individual for, or the purchase, lease, order or recommendation of, any good, facility, item or service, for which payment may be made, in whole or in part, under U.S. federal and state healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. A person or entity does not need to have actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it in order to have committed a violation. In addition, a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil False Claims Act (\u201cFCA\u201d);\n\u2022federal civil and criminal false claims laws and civil monetary penalty laws, including the FCA, which prohibit, among other things, individuals or entities from knowingly presenting, or causing to be presented, false or fraudulent claims for payment to, or approval by Medicare, Medicaid, or other federal healthcare programs, knowingly making, using or causing to be made or used a false record or statement material to a false or fraudulent claim or an obligation to pay or transmit money to the federal government, or knowingly concealing or knowingly and improperly avoiding or decreasing or concealing an obligation to pay money to the federal government. Manufacturers can be held liable under the FCA even when they do not submit claims directly to government payors if they are deemed to \u201ccause\u201d the submission of false or fraudulent claims. The FCA also permits a private individual acting as a \u201cwhistleblower\u201d to bring actions on behalf of the federal government alleging violations of the FCA and to share in any monetary recovery;\n\u2022HIPAA, which created new federal criminal and civil statutes that prohibit, among other actions, knowingly and willfully executing, or attempting to execute, a scheme to defraud any healthcare benefit program or obtain, by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises, any of the money or property owned by, or under the custody or control of, any healthcare benefit program, regardless of the payor (e.g., public or private) and knowingly and willfully falsifying, concealing or covering up by any trick or device a material fact or making any materially false statements in connection with the delivery of, or payment for, healthcare benefits, items or services relating to healthcare matters. Similar to the Anti-Kickback Statute, a person or entity can be found guilty of violating HIPAA without actual knowledge of the statute or specific intent to violate it;\n\u2022HIPAA, as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (\u201cHITECH\u201d), and their implementing regulations, which impose certain obligations, including mandatory contractual terms, with respect to safeguarding the privacy, security and transmission of individually identifiable health information by covered entities subject to the rule, such as health plans, healthcare clearinghouses and certain healthcare providers, as well as their business associates that perform certain services involving the use or disclosure of individually identifiable health information and require notification to affected individuals and regulatory authorities of certain breaches of individually identifiable health information. HITECH also created new tiers of civil monetary penalties, amended HIPAA to make civil and criminal penalties directly applicable to business associates, and gave state attorneys general new authority to file civil actions for damages or injunctions in federal courts to enforce the federal HIPAA laws and seek attorneys\u2019 fees and costs associated with pursuing federal civil actions;\n\u2022federal legislation commonly referred to as Physician Payments Sunshine Act, enacted as part of the ACA, and its implementing regulations, which requires certain manufacturers of drugs, devices, biologics and medical supplies that are reimbursable under Medicare, Medicaid, or the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program to report annually to the CMS information related to certain payments and other transfers of value to physicians (defined to include doctors, dentists, optometrists, podiatrists, chiropractors, and certain advanced non-physician healthcare practitioners) and teaching hospitals, as well as ownership and investment interests held by physicians and their immediate family members;\n\u2022analogous state laws and regulations, including: state anti-kickback and false claims laws that may apply to claims involving healthcare items or services reimbursed by any third-party payor, including private insurers; state laws that require pharmaceutical companies to comply with the pharmaceutical industry\u2019s voluntary compliance guidelines and the relevant compliance guidance promulgated by the U.S. federal government, or otherwise restrict payments that may be made to healthcare providers and other potential referral source; state laws and regulations that require drug manufacturers to file reports relating to pricing and marketing information, which requires tracking gifts and other remuneration and items of value provided to healthcare professionals and entities; state and local laws that require the registration of pharmaceutical sales\nrepresentatives; and state laws governing the privacy and security of health information in certain circumstances, many of which differ from each other in significant ways and often are not preempted by HIPAA, thus complicating compliance efforts; and\n\u2022European and other foreign law equivalents of each of the laws, including reporting requirements detailing interactions with and payments to healthcare providers.\nThe distribution of pharmaceutical products is subject to additional requirements and regulations, including extensive record-keeping, licensing, storage and security requirements intended to prevent the unauthorized sale of pharmaceutical products and to limit the distribution of product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in prescription drug sample distribution.\nThe scope and enforcement of each of these laws is uncertain and subject to rapid change in the current environment of healthcare reform, especially in light of the lack of applicable precedent and regulations. Federal and state enforcement bodies have recently increased their scrutiny of interactions between healthcare companies and healthcare providers, which has led to a number of investigations, prosecutions, convictions and settlements in the healthcare industry.\nIt is possible that governmental authorities will conclude that our business practices may not comply with current or future statutes, regulations or case law involving applicable fraud and abuse or other healthcare laws. If our operations are found to be in violation of any of these laws or any other laws that may apply to us, we may be subject to significant sanctions, including civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, fines, disgorgement, imprisonment, exclusion from participating in government funded healthcare programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, reputational harm and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations. If any of the physicians or other healthcare providers or entities with whom we expect to do business is found not to be in compliance with applicable laws, that person or entity may be subject to significant criminal, civil or administrative sanctions, including exclusions from government funded healthcare programs. Prohibitions or restrictions on sales or withdrawal of future marketed products could materially affect business in an adverse way.\nThe risk of us being found in violation of these laws is increased by the fact that many of them have not been fully interpreted by the regulatory authorities or the courts or otherwise have broad coverage. For example, the definition of the \u201cremuneration\u201d under the Anti-Kickback Statute has been interpreted to include anything of value. Further, courts have found that if \u201cone purpose\u201d of remuneration is to induce referrals, the Anti-Kickback Statute is violated.\nEfforts to ensure that our business arrangements with third parties will comply with applicable healthcare laws will involve substantial costs. Any action against us for violation of these laws, even if we successfully defend against it, could cause us to incur significant legal expenses and divert our management\u2019s attention from the operation of our business. The shifting compliance environment and the need to build and maintain robust and expandable systems to comply with multiple jurisdictions with different compliance or reporting requirements increases the possibility that a biopharmaceutical company may run afoul of one or more of the requirements.\nObtaining and maintaining marketing approval of our current and future product candidates in one jurisdiction does not mean that we will be successful in obtaining marketing approval of our current and future therapeutic product candidates in other jurisdictions.\nObtaining and maintaining marketing approval of our current and future product candidates in one jurisdiction does not guarantee that we will be able to obtain or maintain marketing approval in any other jurisdiction, while a failure or delay in obtaining marketing approval in one jurisdiction may have a negative effect on the marketing approval process in others. For example, even if the FDA grants marketing approval of a product candidate, comparable foreign regulatory authorities in foreign jurisdictions must also approve the manufacturing, marketing and promotion of the product candidate in those countries. Approval procedures vary among jurisdictions and can involve requirements and administrative review periods different from, and greater than, those in the United States, including additional preclinical studies or clinical trials as clinical studies conducted in one jurisdiction may not be accepted by regulatory authorities in other jurisdictions. In many jurisdictions outside the United States, a product candidate must be approved for reimbursement before it can be approved for sale in that jurisdiction. In some cases, the price that we intend to charge for our future products will also be subject to approval.\nWe may submit marketing applications in other countries in addition to the United States. Regulatory authorities in jurisdictions outside of the United States have requirements for approval of product candidates with which we must comply prior to marketing in those jurisdictions. Obtaining foreign marketing approvals and compliance with foreign regulatory requirements could result in significant delays, difficulties and costs for us and could delay or prevent the introduction of our products in certain countries. If we fail to comply with the regulatory requirements in international markets and/or receive applicable marketing approvals, our target market will be reduced and our ability to realize the full market potential of our product candidates will be harmed.\nWe have never commercialized a product candidate before and may lack the necessary expertise, personnel and resources to successfully commercialize our products on our own or together with suitable partners.\nWe do not have a sales or marketing infrastructure and have no experience in the sale or marketing of biopharmaceutical products. To achieve commercial success for any approved product, we must develop or acquire a sales and marketing organization, outsource these functions to third parties or enter into partnerships.\nWe may decide to establish our own sales and marketing capabilities and promote our product candidates if and when regulatory approval has been obtained in the United States and the major European Union countries. There are risks involved if we decide to establish our own sales and marketing capabilities or enter into arrangements with third parties to perform these services. Even if we establish sales and marketing capabilities, we may fail to launch our products effectively or to market our products effectively since we have no experience in the sales and marketing of biopharmaceutical products. In addition, recruiting and training a sales force is expensive and time consuming and could delay any product launch. In the event that any such launch is delayed or does not occur for any reason, we would have prematurely or unnecessarily incurred these commercialization expenses, and our investment would be lost if we cannot retain or reposition our sales and marketing personnel. Factors that may inhibit our efforts to commercialize our products on our own include:\n\u2022Our inability to recruit, train and retain adequate numbers of effective sales and marketing personnel;\n\u2022the inability of sales personnel to obtain access to or persuade adequate numbers of physicians to prescribe our products;\n\u2022the lack of complementary products to be offered by sales personnel, which may put us at a competitive disadvantage relative to companies with more extensive product lines;\n\u2022unforeseen costs and expenses associated with creating an independent sales and marketing organization; and\n\u2022costs of marketing and promotion above those anticipated by us.\nIf we enter into arrangements with third parties to perform sales and marketing services, our product revenues or the profitability of these product revenues to us could be lower than if we were to market and sell any products that we develop ourselves. Such collaborative arrangements with partners may place the commercialization of our products outside of our control and would make us subject to a number of risks including that we may not be able to control the amount or timing of resources that our collaborative partner devotes to our products or that our collaborator\u2019s willingness or ability to complete its obligations, and our obligations under our arrangements may be adversely affected by business combinations or significant changes in our collaborator\u2019s business strategy. In addition, we may not be successful in entering into arrangements with third parties to sell and market our products or may be unable to do so on terms that are favorable to us. Acceptable third parties may fail to devote the necessary resources and attention to sell and market our products effectively.\nIf we do not establish sales and marketing capabilities successfully, either on our own or in collaboration with third parties, we may not be successful in commercializing our products, which in turn would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdverse events in the field of immuno-oncology could damage public perception of our current or future therapeutic product candidates and negatively affect our business.\nThe commercial success of our immuno-oncology product candidates, if approved, will depend in part on public acceptance of the use of cancer immunotherapies. Adverse events in marketed products, in clinical trials of our product candidates or in clinical trials of others developing similar products and the resulting publicity, as well as any other adverse events in the field of immuno-oncology that may occur in the future, could result in a decrease in demand for any products that we may\ndevelop. If public perception is influenced by claims that the use of cancer immunotherapies is unsafe, whether related to our products or those of our competitors, our products may not be accepted by the general public or the medical community.\nFuture adverse events in immuno-oncology or the biopharmaceutical industry could also result in heightened governmental regulation, stricter labeling requirements and potential regulatory delays in the testing or approvals of our product candidates. Any increased scrutiny could delay or increase the costs of obtaining marketing approval for the product candidates we develop or prevent it from receiving marketing approval at all.\nThe market opportunities for any current or future immuno-oncology product candidates we develops, if approved, may be limited to those patients who are ineligible for established therapies or for whom prior therapies have failed, and may be small.\nCancer therapies are sometimes characterized as first-line, second-line or third-line, and the FDA often approves new therapies initially only for third-line use. When cancer is detected early enough, first-line therapy, usually chemotherapy, hormone therapy, surgery, radiation therapy or a combination of these, is sometimes adequate to cure the cancer or prolong life without a cure. Second- and third-line therapies are administered to patients when prior therapy is not effective. We expect to initially seek approval of our current and future immuno-oncology product candidates as a therapy for patients who have received one or more prior treatments. Subsequently, for those products that prove to be sufficiently beneficial, if any, we would expect to seek approval potentially as a first-line therapy, but there is no guarantee that product candidates we develop, even if approved, would be approved for first-line therapy, and, prior to any such approvals, we may have to conduct additional clinical trials.\nIn addition, subsequent developments in cancer biomarkers may demonstrate that our product candidates are not suitable for the treatment of certain cancers or subpopulations, thereby reducing the market opportunity for those product candidates. Even if we obtain significant market share for any product candidate, if approved, if the potential target populations are small, we may never achieve profitability without obtaining marketing approval for additional indications, including to be used as first- or second-line therapy or for other related cancer indications.\nIf the market opportunities for our product candidates are smaller than we believe they are, even assuming approval of a product candidate, our business may suffer.\nOur projections of both the number of people who are affected by disease within our potential target indications, as well as the subset of these people who have the potential to benefit from treatment with our product candidates, are based on our beliefs and estimates. These estimates have been derived from a variety of sources, including the scientific literature, healthcare utilization databases and market research, and may prove to be incorrect. Further, new studies may change the estimated incidence or prevalence of these diseases. The number of patients may turn out to be lower than expected. Likewise, the potentially addressable patient population for each of our product candidates may be limited or may not be amenable to treatment with our product candidates, and new patients may become increasingly difficult to identify or gain access to, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected many companies in the biotechnology industry and has adversely affected our business, in particular, in relation to planned and ongoing clinical trials. Other public health emergencies could also disrupt our activities and render our own or our service providers\u2019 facilities inoperable or inaccessible and require us to curtail or cease operations.\nCOVID-19, a serious and sometimes fatal illness, and its variants have spread to every country in the world and throughout the United States. Many countries, as well as most states of the United States, reacted by instituting quarantines, \u201clockdowns\u201d and other public health restrictions on leisure activities, work and travel. Although pandemic-related restrictions have been eased or removed in certain geographies, our business remains subject to pandemic-related controls, which may become more restrictive at any time. We rely on third-party manufacturers, distributors, information technology and software service providers, law and accounting firms, CROs, and consultants who are subject to, or may become subject to, pandemic-related controls. COVID-19 may also affect employees of third-party CROs located in affected geographies that we rely upon to carry out clinical trials. If these third parties cannot perform the services we require in a timely way and we cannot successfully implement replacements or workarounds, our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be harmed.\nThe continued spread of COVID-19 or variants thereof globally could adversely impact our preclinical or clinical trial operations, including our ability to recruit and retain patients and principal investigators and site staff who, as healthcare providers, may have heightened exposure to COVID-19 if an outbreak occurs in their geography. For example, similar to other biopharmaceutical companies, we may experience delays in initiating preclinical studies, enrolling our clinical trials, or dosing of patients in our clinical trials as well as in activating new trial sites. Many physicians have reduced the frequency of patient office visits and barred office visits by third parties. Many patients have postponed visits to their physicians or testing at clinical laboratories or imaging centers. Patient enrollment or treatment or the execution of our product candidates could cause costly delays to clinical trial activities, which could adversely affect our ability to obtain regulatory approvals for our product candidates, increase our operating expenses, and have a material adverse effect on our financial results. Any negative impact COVID-19 has to patient enrollment or treatment or the execution of our product candidates could cause costly delays to clinical trial activities, which could adversely affect our ability to obtain regulatory approval for and to commercialize our product candidates, increase our operating expenses, and have a material adverse effect on our financial results. Also, there is a risk of corporate and other tax increases or decreases to current tax credits or reliefs as a result of government expenditures to address COVID-19, which could have a material adverse effect on our future financial results.\nAdditionally, timely enrollment and data collection in planned and ongoing clinical trials is dependent upon clinical trial sites that could be adversely affected by global health matters, such as pandemics. We are conducting clinical trials for our mAb2 product candidates in geographies that are currently being affected by the COVID-19. Some factors from the COVID-19 outbreak that may delay or otherwise adversely affect enrollment in the clinical trials of our mAb2 product candidates, as well as our business generally, include:\n\u2022the potential diversion of healthcare resources away from the conduct of clinical trials to focus on pandemic concerns, including the attention of physicians serving as our clinical trial investigators, hospitals serving as our clinical trial sites and hospital staff supporting the conduct of our prospective clinical trials;\n\u2022limitations on travel that could interrupt key trial and business activities, such as clinical trial site initiations and monitoring, domestic and international travel by employees, contractors or patients to clinical trial sites, including any government-imposed travel restrictions or quarantines that will impact the ability or willingness of patients, employees or contractors to travel to our clinical trial sites or secure visas or entry permissions, a loss of face-to-face meetings and other interactions with potential partners, any of which could delay or adversely impact the conduct or progress of our prospective clinical trials;\n\u2022the potential negative affect on the operations of our third-party manufacturers;\n\u2022interruption in global shipping affecting the transport of clinical trial materials, such as patient samples, investigational drug product and conditioning drugs and other supplies used in our prospective clinical trials; and\n\u2022business disruptions caused by potential workplace, laboratory and office closures and an increased reliance on employees working from home, disruptions to or delays in ongoing laboratory experiments.\nThe Ukraine conflict may adversely affect many companies in the biotechnology industry, in particular with respect to timely enrollment and data collection in planned and ongoing clinical trials and has adversely affected our business, in particular, in relation to planned and ongoing clinical trials.\nThe ongoing military conflict in Ukraine could materially disrupt our clinical trials, and increase our costs in this region. Although the length and impacts of any military action are highly unpredictable, clinical trial sites in Ukraine and neighboring regions could suspend or terminate trials, and patients and physicians could be forced to evacuate or voluntarily choose to relocate far from clinical trial sites, making them unavailable. We had planned clinical trials and clinical trial sites in Ukraine. Alternative sites will take time to identify and gain approval to compensate for our clinical trial activities in Ukraine. The potential negative impacts also include interruption in global shipping affecting the transport of clinical trial materials, such as patient samples, investigational drug product and other supplies used in clinical trials.\nRisks Related to our Intellectual Property\nWe rely on patents and other intellectual property rights to protect our product candidates and our modular antibody technology platform, the enforcement, defense and maintenance of which may be challenging and costly. Failure to protect or enforce these rights adequately could harm our ability to compete and impair our business.\nOur commercial success depends in part on obtaining and maintaining patents and other forms of intellectual property rights for our product candidates, methods used to manufacture those product candidates and/or methods for treating patients using those product candidates, or on in-licensing such rights. Failure to protect or to obtain, maintain or extend adequate patent and other intellectual property rights could materially adversely affect our ability to develop and market our products and product candidates.\nPatent applications cannot be enforced against third parties practicing the technology claimed in such applications unless and until a patent issues from such applications, and then only to the extent the issued claims cover the technology at issue. We cannot be certain that patents will be issued or granted with respect to applications that are currently pending, or that issued or granted patents will not later be found to be invalid or enforceable. The patent position of biopharmaceutical companies is generally uncertain because it involves complex legal and factual considerations that have in recent years been the subject of much litigation. The standards applied by the European Patent Office (\u201cEPO\u201d), the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (\u201cUSPTO\u201d), and foreign patent offices in granting patents are not always applied uniformly or predictably. For example, there is no uniform worldwide policy regarding patentable subject matter or the scope of claims allowable in biopharmaceutical patents. Consequently, patents may not issue from our pending patent applications. As such, we do not know the degree of future protection that we will obtain that relates to our proprietary product candidates and modular antibody technology platform. The scope of patent protection that the EPO and the USPTO will grant with respect to the bispecific antibodies in our product pipeline is uncertain. It is possible that the EPO and the USPTO will not allow broad antibody claims that cover antibodies closely related to our mAb2 product candidates as well as the specific antibody. As a result, upon receipt of EMA or FDA approval, competitors may be free to market antibodies almost identical to ours, including biosimilar antibodies, thereby decreasing our market share. However, a competitor cannot submit to the FDA an application for a biosimilar product based on one of our products until four years following the date of approval of our \u201creference product,\u201d and the FDA may not approve such a biosimilar product until 12 years from the date on which the reference product was approved, with a potential six-month extension of exclusivity if certain pediatric studies are conducted and the results are reported to the FDA.\nThe patent prosecution process is expensive and time-consuming, and we and our current or future licensors, licensees or collaboration partners may not be able to prepare, file and prosecute all necessary or desirable patent applications at a reasonable cost or in a timely manner. It is also possible that we or our licensors, licensees or collaboration partners will fail to identify patentable aspects of inventions made in the course of development and commercialization activities before it is too late to obtain patent protection on them. Further, the issuance, scope, validity, enforceability and commercial value of our and our current or future licensors\u2019, licensees\u2019 or collaboration partners\u2019 patent rights are highly uncertain. Our pending and future patent applications may not result in patents being issued which protect our modular antibody technology platform or our product candidates, in whole or in part, or which effectively prevent others from commercializing competitive technologies and products. Our competitors may be able to circumvent our patents by developing similar or alternative product candidates in a non-infringing manner. Moreover, in some circumstances, we may not have the right to control the preparation, filing and prosecution of patent applications, or to maintain the patents, relating to technology that we license from or license to third parties and are reliant on our licensors, licensees or collaboration partners. Therefore, these patents and applications may not be prosecuted and enforced in a manner consistent with the best interests of our business. If our current or future licensors, licensees or collaboration partners fail to establish, maintain or protect such patents and other intellectual property rights, such rights may be reduced or eliminated. If our current or future licensors, licensees or collaboration partners are not fully cooperative or disagree with us as to the prosecution, maintenance or enforcement of any patent rights, such patent rights could be compromised. The patent examination process may require us or our current or future licensors, licensees or collaboration partners to narrow the scope of the claims of our or our licensors\u2019, licensees\u2019 or collaboration partners\u2019 pending and future patent applications, which may limit the scope of patent protection that may be obtained.\nWe cannot assure you that all of the potentially relevant prior art relating to our patents and patent applications has been found. Publications of discoveries in the scientific literature often lag behind the actual discoveries, and patent applications in the United States and other jurisdictions are typically not published until 18 months after filing or, in some cases, not at all. Therefore, we cannot know with certainty whether we were the first to make the inventions claimed in our patents or pending\npatent applications, or that we were the first to file for patent protection of such inventions. If such prior art exists, it can invalidate a patent or prevent a patent from issuing from a pending patent application. Furthermore, if third parties have filed such patent applications on or before March 15, 2013, an interference proceeding can be initiated by such third parties to determine who was the first to invent any of the subject matter covered by the patent claims of our applications. If third parties have filed such applications after March 15, 2013, a derivation proceeding can be initiated by such third parties to determine whether our invention was derived from theirs. Even where we have a valid and enforceable patent, we may not be able to exclude others from practicing our invention where the other party can show that they used the invention in commerce before our filing date or the other party benefits from a compulsory license.\nWe have pending patent applications at the USPTO, the EPO, and the patent offices of other foreign jurisdictions, and it is possible that we will need to defend other patents from challenges by others from time to time. Certain of our U.S. patent applications have been and may in the future be the subject of submissions of prior art by third parties. Even if patents do successfully issue, third parties may initiate an opposition, interference, re-examination, post-grant review, inter partes review, nullification or derivation action in court or before patent offices, or similar proceedings challenging the validity, enforceability or scope of such patents, which may result in the patent claims being narrowed, invalidated, or held unenforceable, in whole or in part. For example, opposition proceedings at the EPO are increasingly common, and are costly and time consuming to defend. Similar proceedings are available in other patent offices around the world. It is possible that one or more of our U.S. patents may be challenged by parties who file a request for post-grant review or inter partes review or ex parte reexamination. Post-grant proceedings are increasingly common in the United States and are costly to defend. Our patent rights may not provide us with a proprietary position or competitive advantages against competitors. An adverse determination in any such submission, proceeding or litigation could reduce the scope of, or invalidate, our patent rights, or allow third parties to commercialize our product candidates and compete directly with us, without payment to us. In addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our patents and patent applications is threatened, regardless of the outcome, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize current or future product candidates. Furthermore, even if the outcome is favorable to us, the enforcement of our intellectual property rights can be extremely expensive and time consuming.\nWe may become involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents or other intellectual property, which could be expensive, time consuming and unsuccessful, and issued patents relating to one or more of our product candidates or our modular antibody technology platform could be found invalid or unenforceable if challenged in court.\nTo protect our competitive position, we may from time to time need to resort to litigation in order to enforce or defend any patents or other intellectual property rights owned by or licensed to us, or to determine or challenge the scope or validity of patents or other intellectual property rights of third parties. As enforcement of intellectual property rights is difficult, unpredictable and expensive, many of our or our collaboration partners\u2019 adversaries in these proceedings may have the ability to dedicate substantially greater resources to prosecuting these legal actions than we or our collaboration partners can. Accordingly, despite our or our collaboration partners\u2019 efforts, we or our collaboration partners may not prevent third parties from infringing upon or misappropriating intellectual property rights we own or control, particularly in countries where the laws may not protect those rights as fully as in the United States and in Europe. We may fail in enforcing our rights, in which case our competitors may be permitted to use our technology without being required to pay it any license fees. In addition, however, litigation involving our patents carries the risk that one or more of our patents will be held invalid (in whole or in part, on a claim-by-claim basis) or held unenforceable. Such an adverse court ruling could allow third parties to commercialize our product candidates or use our modular antibody technology platform, and then compete directly with us, without payment to us.\nIf we were to initiate legal proceedings against a third party to enforce a patent relating to one of our products, the defendant could counterclaim that our patent is invalid or unenforceable. In patent litigation in the United States or in Europe, defendant counterclaims alleging invalidity or unenforceability are commonplace. A claim for a validity challenge may be based on failure to meet any of several statutory requirements, for example, lack of novelty, obviousness or non-enablement. A claim for unenforceability assertion could be an allegation that someone connected with prosecuting the patent withheld relevant information from the USPTO or made a misleading statement, during prosecution. The outcome following legal assertions of invalidity and unenforceability during patent litigation is unpredictable. With respect to the validity question, for example, we cannot be certain that there is no invalidating prior art, of which we and the patent examiner were unaware during prosecution. If a defendant were to prevail on a legal assertion of invalidity or unenforceability, we would lose at least part, and perhaps all, of the patent protection on one or more of our product candidates or certain aspects of our modular antibody technology platform. Such a loss of patent protection could have a material adverse impact on our business. Interference or\nderivation proceedings provoked by third parties or brought by it or declared by the USPTO may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patents or patent applications. An unfavorable outcome could require us to cease using the related technology or to attempt to have rights licensed to us from the prevailing party. Our business could be harmed if the prevailing party does not offer us a license on commercially reasonable terms or at all, or if a non-exclusive license is offered and our competitors gain access to the same technology. Further, litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of management resources, regardless of the outcome, and this could harm our business and financial results. Patents and other intellectual property rights also will not protect our technology if competitors design around our protected technology without infringing our patents or other intellectual property rights. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation. There could also be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions, or other interim proceedings or developments. If securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, it could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock.\nIntellectual property rights of third parties could adversely affect our ability to commercialize our product candidates, such that we could be required to litigate or obtain licenses from third parties in order to develop or market our product candidates. Such litigation is, and will continue to be, costly and any required licenses may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.\nThird-party claims of intellectual property infringement may prevent or delay our development and commercialization efforts. Our commercial success depends in part on our avoiding infringement of the patents and proprietary rights of third parties. However, our research, development and commercialization activities may be subject to claims that we infringe or otherwise violate patents or other intellectual property rights owned or controlled by third parties. There is a substantial amount of litigation, both within and outside the United States, involving patent and other intellectual property rights in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including patent infringement lawsuits, interferences, derivation proceedings, oppositions and inter partes reexamination proceedings before the USPTO, and corresponding foreign patent offices. Numerous U.S. and foreign issued patents and pending patent applications, which are owned by third parties, exist in the fields in which we are pursuing development candidates.\nIn particular, we are aware of a \u201cmethod of use\u201d patent issued in 2021 in the United States to E.R. Squibb & Sons, L.L.C. that expires in 2029, subject to the timely payment of maintenance fees and absent any patent term extension, and which includes claims directed to a method for treating cancer in a subject comprising administering to the subject an anti-LAG-3 antibody and an anti-PD-L1 antibody, which antibodies are specified in a subclaim as being in a bispecific molecule. We believe, based on our review of this U.S. patent, that the patent claims are impermissibly broad and that there would be strong arguments available to us should we decide to challenge its validity in court or USPTO post-grant proceedings, based on prior art and lack of written description and enablement for the entire scope of the claims. If we succeed in developing and obtaining regulatory approval to market our product candidate FS118 in the future, this patent, prior to its expiration, could impact our commercial plans for FS118 in the United States. We do not expect the patent to have any impact on commercialization of FS118 outside of the United States, and we do not expect the patent to impact our pre-commercial development of FS118 inside or outside of the United States. We are also aware of a \u201csecond medical use\u201d patent issued in 2021 in Europe to BMS, which includes claims protecting until 2036 (subject to the timely payment of annual renewal fees and absent any supplementary protection certificates based on the patent) an anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 antibody that inhibits PD-1 activity for use in a method for treating a subject identified as HPV positive and afflicted with a tumor derived from a HPV positive squamous cell carcinoma head and neck cancer, as well as the method comprising administering to the subject a therapeutically effective amount of the antibody. Multiple parties, including Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. and Merck Sharp and Dohme Corp, have filed oppositions at the European Patent Office challenging the validity of this European patent. We believe, based on our review of this European patent and the oppositions that have been filed, that there are strong grounds to argue that the patent is invalid due to lack of novelty and inventive step based on prior art as well as impermissible added matter and lack of sufficiency. If not revoked or amended to a form that poses no or a sufficiently reduced risk to our business, this patent, prior to its expiration, could impact our commercial plans for FS118 and FS222 in Europe, but we do not expect the patent to impact our pre-commercial development efforts. Patent litigation is costly and time-consuming and there is no assurance that we would prevail, should we initiate or defend such litigation. As the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries expand and more patents are issued, the risk increases that we may be subject to claims of infringement of the patent rights of third parties.\nOur competitive position may suffer if patents issued to third parties or other third-party intellectual property rights cover our products or product candidates or elements thereof, our manufacture or uses relevant to our development plans, the targets of\nour mAb2 product candidates, or other attributes of our mAb2 product candidates or our mAb2 technology. In such cases, we may not be in a position to develop or commercialize products or product candidates unless we successfully pursue litigation to nullify or invalidate the third-party intellectual property right concerned or enter into a license agreement with the intellectual property right holder, if available on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nIt is also possible that we fail to identify relevant patents or patent applications. For example, certain U.S. applications filed after November 29, 2000 that will not be filed outside the United States may remain confidential until issuance of a patent. In general, patent applications in the United States and elsewhere are published approximately 18 months after the earliest filing for which priority is claimed, with such earliest filing date being commonly referred to as the priority date. Therefore, patent applications relating to our products or platform technology could have been filed by others without our knowledge. Furthermore, we operate in a highly competitive field, and given our limited resources, it is unreasonable to monitor all patent applications purporting to gain broad coverage in the areas in which we are active. Additionally, pending patent applications which have been published can, subject to certain limitations, be later amended in a manner that could cover our platform technologies, our products or the use of our products.\nParties making claims of infringement against us or defending against our invalidity actions may be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they have substantially greater resources. If we fail in any such dispute, in addition to being forced to pay damages, we or our licensees may be temporarily or permanently prohibited from commercializing any of our product candidates that are held to be infringing. We might, if possible, also be forced to redesign product candidates so that we no longer infringe the third-party intellectual property rights. We may be required to seek a license to any such technology that we are found to infringe, which license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Even if we or our collaboration partners obtain a license, it may be non-exclusive; thereby giving our competitors access to the same technologies licensed to us or our licensors or collaboration partners. Moreover, such a license may require us to pay royalties to the licensor; thus, reducing our expected revenues. In addition, we could be found liable for monetary damages, including treble damages and attorneys\u2019 fees, if we are found to have willfully infringed a patent in the United States. Any of these events, even if we were ultimately to prevail, could require us to divert substantial financial and management resources that we would otherwise be able to devote to our business.\nIn addition, there could be public announcements of the results of hearings, motions or other interim proceedings or developments and if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative, we could have a substantial adverse effect on our share price. Such litigation or proceedings could substantially increase our operating losses and reduce our resources available for development activities. We may not have sufficient financial or other resources to adequately conduct such litigation or proceedings. Some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively than we can because of their substantially greater financial resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace.\nIn addition, if the breadth or strength of protection provided by our or our collaboration partners\u2019 patents and patent applications is threatened, it could dissuade companies from collaborating with us to license, develop or commercialize current or future product candidates. Furthermore, because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation, there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure during this type of litigation.\nIf we fail to comply with our obligations in the agreements under which we license intellectual property rights from third parties or otherwise experience disruptions to our business relationships with our licensors, we could lose intellectual property rights that are important to our business.\nWe are a party to license agreements, and we may in the future need to obtain additional licenses from others to advance our research and development activities or allow the commercialization of our product candidates. Our current license agreements impose, and we expect that future license agreements will impose, various development, diligence, commercialization and other obligations on us. In spite of our efforts, our current or future licensors might conclude that we have materially breached our obligations under such license agreements and might therefore terminate the license agreements, thereby removing or limiting our ability to develop and commercialize product candidates and otherwise use technology covered by these license agreements. If these in-licenses are terminated, or if the underlying patents fail to provide the intended exclusivity, competitors or other third parties would have the freedom to seek regulatory approval of, and to market, products identical to ours and we may be required to cease our development and commercialization of our\nproduct candidates. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our competitive position, business, financial conditions, results of operations, and prospects.\nMoreover, disputes may arise regarding intellectual property subject to a licensing agreement, including:\n\u2022the scope of rights granted under the license agreement and other interpretation-related issues;\n\u2022the extent to which our product candidates, technology and processes infringe on intellectual property of the licensor that is not subject to the licensing agreement;\n\u2022the sublicensing of patent and other rights under our collaborative development relationships;\n\u2022our diligence obligations under the license agreement and what activities satisfy those diligence obligations;\n\u2022the inventorship and ownership of inventions and know-how resulting from the joint creation or use of intellectual property by our licensors and our partners; and\n\u2022the priority of invention of patented technology.\nIn addition, the agreements under which we currently license intellectual property or technology from third parties are complex, and certain provisions in such agreements may be susceptible to multiple interpretations. The resolution of any contract interpretation disagreement that may arise could narrow what we believe to be the scope of our rights to the relevant intellectual property or technology or increase what we believe to be our financial or other obligations under the relevant agreement, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and prospects. Moreover, if disputes over intellectual property that we have licensed prevent or impair our ability to maintain our current licensing arrangements on commercially acceptable terms, we may be unable to successfully develop and commercialize the affected mAb2 product candidates, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions, results of operations, and prospects.\nWe may not be successful in obtaining or maintaining necessary rights to our product candidates through acquisitions and in-licenses.\nBecause our programs may require the use of proprietary rights held by third parties, the growth of our business will likely depend in part on our ability to acquire or in-license such proprietary rights. We may be unable to acquire or in-license any compositions, methods of use, processes, or other third-party intellectual property rights from third parties that we identify as necessary for our product candidates. The licensing and acquisition of third-party intellectual property rights is a competitive area, and a number of more established companies may pursue strategies to license or acquire third-party intellectual property rights that we may consider attractive. These established companies may have a competitive advantage over us due to our size, cash resources and greater clinical development and commercialization capabilities.\nIn addition, companies that perceive us to be a competitor may be unwilling to assign or license rights to us. We also may be unable to license or acquire third-party intellectual property rights on terms that would allow us to make an appropriate return on our investment. If we are unable to successfully obtain a license to third-party intellectual property rights necessary for the development of a product candidate or program, we may have to abandon development of that product candidate or program, and our business and financial condition could suffer.\nIf our trademarks and trade names are not adequately protected, then we may not be able to build name recognition in our markets of interest and our business may be adversely affected.\nOur registered or unregistered trademarks or trade names may be challenged, infringed, circumvented or declared generic or determined to be infringing on other marks. We may not be able to protect our rights to these trademarks and trade names, which we need to build name recognition by potential partners or customers in our markets of interest. Over the long term, if we are unable to establish name recognition based on our trademarks and trade names, then we may not be able to compete effectively, and our business may be adversely affected. If other entities use trademarks similar to ours in different jurisdictions, or have rights that are senior to ours, it could interfere with our use of our current trademarks throughout the world.\nIf we do not obtain protection under the Hatch-Waxman Amendments and similar non-U.S. legislation for extending the term of patents covering each of our product candidates, our business may be materially harmed.\nPatents have a limited duration. In the United States, if all maintenance fees are timely paid, the natural expiration of a patent is generally 20 years from its earliest U.S. non-provisional filing date. Various extensions may be available, but the life of a patent, and the protection it affords, is limited. Even if patents covering our product candidates, their manufacture or use are obtained, once the patent life has expired, we may be open to competition from competitive medications, including biosimilar medications. Given the amount of time required for the development, testing and regulatory review of new product candidates, patents protecting such candidates might expire before or shortly after such candidates are commercialized. As a result, our owned and in-licensed patent portfolio may not provide us with sufficient rights to exclude others from commercializing products similar or identical to ours.\nDepending upon the timing, duration and conditions of FDA marketing approval of our product candidates, one or more of our U.S. patents may be eligible for limited patent term extension under the Drug Price Competition and Patent Term Restoration Act of 1984, referred to as the Hatch-Waxman Amendments to the FDCA, and similar legislation in Europe. The Hatch-Waxman Amendments permit a patent term extension of up to five years for a patent covering an approved product as compensation for effective patent term lost during product development and the FDA regulatory review process. The patent term extension cannot extend the remaining term of a patent beyond a total of 14 years from the date of product approval, and only one patent applicable to an approved drug may be extended. Patent term extension also may be available in certain foreign countries upon regulatory approval of our product candidates. However, we may not receive an extension if we fail to apply within applicable deadlines, fail to apply prior to expiration of relevant patents or otherwise fail to satisfy applicable requirements. Moreover, the length of the extension, as well as the scope of the protection during such an extension, could be less than we request. If we are unable to obtain patent term extension or the term of any such extension is less than we request, the period during which we can enforce our patent rights for that product will be shortened and our competitors may obtain approval to market competing products sooner than we expect. As a result, our revenue from applicable products could be reduced, possibly materially.\nWe enjoy only limited geographical protection with respect to certain patents and may face difficulties in certain jurisdictions, which may diminish the value of intellectual property rights in those jurisdictions.\nWe often file our first patent application (i.e., priority filing) in the United Kingdom or with the USPTO. International applications under the Patent Cooperation Treaty (\u201cPCT\u201d), are usually filed within 12 months after the priority filing. Based on the PCT filing, national and regional patent applications may be filed in additional jurisdictions where we believe our product candidates may be marketed. We have so far not filed for patent protection in all national and regional jurisdictions where such protection may be available. In addition, we may decide to abandon national and regional patent applications before grant. Finally, the grant proceeding of each national/regional patent is an independent proceeding which may lead to situations in which applications might be refused by certain patent offices, while granted by others, and the scope of patent protection may vary for the same product candidate or technology.\nCompetitors may use our and our collaboration partners\u2019 technologies in jurisdictions where we have not obtained patent protection to develop their own products and, further, may export otherwise infringing products to territories where we and our licensors or collaboration partners have patent protection, but enforcement is not as strong as that in the United States and Europe. These products may compete with our product candidates, and our and our collaboration partners\u2019 patents or other intellectual property rights may not be effective or sufficient to prevent them from competing with us.\nThe laws of some jurisdictions do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws in the United States and Europe, and companies have encountered significant difficulties in protecting and defending such rights in such jurisdictions. If we encounter difficulties in protecting, or are otherwise precluded from effectively protecting, the intellectual property rights important for our business in such jurisdictions, the value of these rights may be diminished, and we may face additional competition from others in those jurisdictions.\nSome countries have compulsory licensing laws under which a patent owner may be compelled to grant licenses to third parties. In addition, some countries limit the enforceability of patents against government agencies or government contractors. In these countries, the patent owner may have limited remedies, which could materially diminish the value of such patents. If we or any of our licensors are forced to grant a license to third parties with respect to any patents relevant to\nour business, our competitive position may be impaired, and our business and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nProceedings to enforce our and our collaboration partners\u2019 patent rights in foreign jurisdictions could result in substantial costs and divert our and our collaboration partners\u2019 efforts and attention from other aspects of our business, could put our and our collaboration partners\u2019 patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and our and our collaboration partners\u2019 patent applications at risk of not issuing and could provoke third parties to assert claims against us or our licensors or collaboration partners. We or our collaboration partners may not prevail in any lawsuits that we or our licensors or collaboration partners initiate, and the damages or other remedies awarded, if any, may not be commercially meaningful. Accordingly, our efforts to enforce our intellectual property rights around the world may be inadequate to obtain a significant commercial advantage from the intellectual property that we develop or license.\nIntellectual property rights do not necessarily address all potential threats to our competitive advantage.\nThe degree of future protection afforded by our intellectual property rights is uncertain because intellectual property rights have limitations, and may not adequately protect our business, or permit us to maintain our competitive advantage. The following examples are illustrative:\n\u2022others may be able to make products that are the same as or similar to our product candidates but that are not covered by the claims of the patents that we own or have exclusively licensed;\n\u2022the patents of third parties may have an adverse effect on our business;\n\u2022we or any current or future licensors or strategic partners might not have been the first to conceive or reduce to practice the inventions covered by the issued patent or pending patent application that we own or have exclusively licensed;\n\u2022we or any future licensors or strategic partners might not have been the first to file patent applications relating to certain of our inventions;\n\u2022others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or duplicate any of our technologies without infringing our intellectual property rights;\n\u2022it is possible that our pending patent applications will not lead to issued patents;\n\u2022issued patents that we own or have exclusively licensed may not provide us with any competitive advantage, or may be held invalid or unenforceable, as a result of legal challenges by our competitors;\n\u2022our competitors might conduct research and development activities in countries where we do not have patent rights and then use the information learned from such activities to develop competitive products for sale in our major commercial markets;\n\u2022third parties performing manufacturing or testing for us using our products or technologies could use the intellectual property of others without obtaining a proper license; and\n\u2022we may not develop additional technologies that are patentable.\nChanges in patent laws or patent jurisprudence could diminish the value of patents in general, thereby impairing our ability to protect our products.\nAs is the case with other biopharmaceutical companies, our success is heavily dependent on intellectual property, particularly patents. Obtaining and enforcing patents in the biopharmaceutical industry involves both technological complexity and legal complexity. Therefore, obtaining and enforcing biopharmaceutical patents is costly, time-consuming and inherently uncertain. In addition, the America Invents Act (the \u201cAIA\u201d) has been enacted in the United States, resulting in significant changes to the U.S. patent system.\nAn important change introduced by the AIA is that, as of March 16, 2013, the United States transitioned to a \u201cfirst-to-file\u201d system for deciding which party should be granted a patent when two or more patent applications are filed by different parties claiming the same invention. A third party that files a patent application in the USPTO after that date but before we do could therefore be awarded a patent relating to an invention of ours even if we had made the invention before it was made by the\nthird party. This requires us to be cognizant of the time from invention to filing of a patent application, but circumstances could prevent us from promptly filing patent applications on our inventions.\nAmong some of the other changes introduced by the AIA are changes that limit where a patentee may file a patent infringement suit and providing opportunities for third parties to challenge any issued patent in the USPTO via various proceedings including, e.g., post-grant review, inter partes review, and derivation proceedings. This applies to all of our U.S. patents, even those issued before March 16, 2013. Because of a lower evidentiary standard in USPTO proceedings compared to the evidentiary standard in U.S. federal courts necessary to invalidate a patent claim, a third party could potentially provide evidence in a USPTO proceeding sufficient for the USPTO to hold a claim invalid even though the same evidence would be insufficient to invalidate the claim if first presented in a district court action. Accordingly, a third party may attempt to use the USPTO procedures to invalidate our patent claims that would not have been invalidated if first challenged by the third party as a defendant in a district court action. The AIA and its implementation could increase the uncertainties and costs surrounding the prosecution of our patent applications and the enforcement or defense of our issued patents.\nAdditionally, the U.S. Supreme Court and the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit have ruled on patent cases in recent years, either narrowing the scope of patent protection available in certain circumstances or weakening the rights of patent owners in certain situations. In addition to increasing uncertainty with regard to our ability to obtain patents in the future, this combination of events has created uncertainty with respect to the value of patents, once obtained. Depending on decisions by the U.S. Congress, the federal courts and the USPTO, the laws and regulations governing patents could change in unpredictable ways that could weaken our ability to obtain new patents or to enforce our existing patents and patents that we might obtain in the future.\nConfidentiality agreements with employees and others may not adequately prevent disclosure of trade secrets and protect other proprietary information.\nWe consider proprietary trade secrets, confidential know-how and unpatented know-how to be important to our business. We may rely on trade secrets or confidential know-how to protect our technology, especially where patent protection is believed to be of limited value. However, trade secrets and confidential know-how are difficult to maintain as confidential.\nTo protect this type of information against disclosure or appropriation by competitors, our policy is to require our employees, consultants, contractors and advisors to enter into confidentiality agreements and invention assignment agreements with us. However, we cannot be certain that such agreements have been entered into with all relevant parties, and we cannot be certain that our trade secrets and other confidential proprietary information will not be disclosed or that competitors will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques. Current or former employees, consultants, contractors and advisers may unintentionally or willfully disclose our confidential information to competitors, and confidentiality agreements may not provide an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure of confidential information. Enforcing a claim that a third party obtained illegally and is using trade secrets or confidential know-how is expensive, time consuming and unpredictable. The enforceability of confidentiality agreements may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Furthermore, if a competitor lawfully obtained or independently developed any of our trade secrets, we would have no right to prevent such competitor from using that technology or information to compete with us, which could harm our competitive position. Additionally, if the steps taken to maintain our trade secrets are deemed inadequate, we may have insufficient recourse against third parties for misappropriating the trade secret.\nFailure to obtain or maintain trade secrets or confidential know-how trade protection could adversely affect our competitive position. Moreover, our competitors may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and may even apply for patent protection in respect of the same. If successful in obtaining such patent protection, our competitors could limit our use of our trade secrets or confidential know-how.\nUnder certain circumstances, we may also decide to publish some know-how to attempt to prevent others from obtaining patent rights relating to such know-how.\nWe may be subject to claims by third parties asserting that our employees or we have misappropriated their intellectual property or claiming ownership of what we regard as our own intellectual property.\nMany of our employees, including our senior management, were previously employed at other biotechnology or pharmaceutical companies, including our competitors or potential competitors. Some of these employees executed proprietary rights, non-disclosure and non-competition agreements in connection with such previous employment. Although we try to ensure that our employees do not use the proprietary information or know-how of others in their work for us, we may be subject to claims that we or these employees have used or disclosed confidential information or intellectual property, including trade secrets or other proprietary information, of any such employee\u2019s former employer. Litigation may be necessary to defend against these claims.\nIf we fail in prosecuting or defending any such claims, in addition to paying monetary damages, we may lose valuable intellectual property rights or personnel or sustain damages. Such intellectual property rights could be awarded to a third party, and we could be required to obtain a license from such third party to commercialize our technology or products. Such a license may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Even if we successfully prosecute or defend against such claims, litigation could result in substantial costs and distract management.\nObtaining and maintaining our patent protection depends on compliance with various procedural, document submission, fee payment and other requirements imposed by governmental patent agencies, and our patent protection could be reduced or eliminated for non-compliance with these requirements.\nPeriodic maintenance and annuity fees on any issued patent are due to be paid to the USPTO, the EPO and foreign patent agencies in several stages over the lifetime of the patent. The USPTO, the EPO and various foreign governmental patent agencies require compliance with a number of procedural, documentation, fee payment and other similar provisions during the patent application process. While an inadvertent lapse can in many cases be cured by payment of a late fee or by other means in accordance with the applicable rules, there are situations in which noncompliance can result in abandonment or lapse of the patent or patent application, resulting in partial or complete loss of patent rights in the relevant jurisdiction. Non-compliance events that could result in abandonment or lapse of a patent or patent application include failure to respond to official actions within prescribed time limits, non-payment of fees and failure to properly legalize and submit formal documents. If we or our licensors or collaboration partners fail to maintain the patents and patent applications relating to our product candidates, our competitors might be able to enter the market, which would have an adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to our Dependence on Third Parties\nWe rely, and expect to continue to rely, on third parties, including independent clinical investigators, contracted laboratories and CROs, to conduct our preclinical studies and clinical trials. If these third parties do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or meet expected deadlines, we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or commercialize our product candidates and our business could be substantially harmed.\nWe have relied upon and plan to continue to rely upon third parties, including independent clinical investigators, contracted laboratories and third-party CROs, to conduct our preclinical studies and clinical trials in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements and to monitor and manage data for our ongoing preclinical and clinical programs. We rely on these parties for execution of our preclinical studies and clinical trials, and controls only certain aspects of their activities. Nevertheless, we are responsible for ensuring that each of our studies and trials is conducted in accordance with the applicable protocol, legal and regulatory requirements and scientific standards, and our reliance on these third parties does not relieve us of our regulatory responsibilities. We and our third-party contractors and CROs are required to comply with GLP, as applicable, and GCP requirements, which are regulations and guidelines enforced by the FDA, the EMA, the MHRA, and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities for all of our products in clinical development. Regulatory authorities enforce these GLPs and GCPs through periodic inspections of laboratories conducting GLP studies, and clinical trial sponsors, principal investigators, CROs, and trial sites when auditing for GCP compliance. If we, our investigators or any of our CROs or contracted laboratories fail to comply with applicable GLPs and GCP, as applicable, the data generated in our preclinical studies and clinical trials may be deemed unreliable and the FDA, the EMA, the MHRA, or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities may require us to perform additional preclinical studies or clinical trials before approving our marketing applications for our therapeutic product candidates. We cannot assure you that upon inspection by a given regulatory authority, such regulatory authority will determine that any of our preclinical studies or clinical trials comply with applicable GLP or GCP regulations. In addition, our clinical trials must be conducted with product produced in\ncompliance with applicable cGMP regulations. Our failure to comply with these regulations may require us to repeat preclinical studies or clinical trials, which would delay the regulatory approval process.\nFurther, these laboratories, investigators and CROs are not our employees and we will not be able to control, other than by contract, the amount of resources, including time, which they devote to our product candidates and clinical trials. If independent laboratories, investigators or CROs fail to devote sufficient resources to the development of our product candidates, or if their performance is substandard, it may delay or compromise the prospects for approval and commercialization of any product candidates that we develop. In addition, the use of third-party service providers requires us to disclose our proprietary information to these parties, which could increase the risk that this information will be misappropriated.\nOur CROs have the right to terminate their agreements with us in the event of an uncured material breach. In addition, some of our CROs have an ability to terminate their respective agreements with us if it can be reasonably demonstrated that the safety of the subjects participating in our clinical trials warrants such termination, if we make a general assignment for the benefit of our creditors or if we are liquidated.\nThere is a limited number of third-party service providers that specialize or have the expertise required to achieve our business objectives. If any of our relationships with these third-party laboratories, CROs or clinical investigators terminate, we may not be able to enter into arrangements with alternative laboratories, CROs or investigators or to do so in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms. If laboratories, CROs or clinical investigators do not successfully carry out their contractual duties or obligations or meet expected deadlines, if they need to be replaced or if the quality or accuracy of the clinical data they obtain is compromised due to the failure to adhere to our preclinical or clinical protocols, regulatory requirements or for other reasons, our preclinical studies or clinical trials may be extended, delayed or terminated and we may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for or successfully commercialize our product candidates. As a result, our results of operations and the commercial prospects for our product candidates would be harmed, our costs could increase and our ability to generate revenues could be delayed.\nSwitching or adding additional laboratories or CROs (or investigators) involves additional cost and requires management time and focus. In addition, there is a natural transition period when a new laboratory or CRO commences work. As a result, delays occur, which can materially impact our ability to meet our desired clinical development timelines. Though we carefully manages our relationships with our contracted laboratories and CROs, there can be no assurance that we will not encounter similar challenges or delays in the future or that these delays or challenges will not have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, clinical investigators may serve as scientific advisors or consultants to us from time to time and may receive cash or equity compensation in connection with such services. If these relationships and any related compensation result in perceived or actual conflicts of interest, or the FDA concludes that the financial relationship may have affected the interpretation of the preclinical study or clinical trial, the integrity of the data generated at the applicable preclinical study or clinical trial site may be questioned and the utility of the preclinical study or clinical trial itself may be jeopardized, which could result in the delay or rejection by the FDA. Any such delay or rejection could prevent us from commercializing our clinical-stage product candidate or any future therapeutic product candidates it may develop.\nThe manufacture of biotechnology products is complex, and manufacturers often encounter difficulties in production. If we or any of our third-party manufacturers encounter such difficulties, or otherwise fail to comply with their contractual obligations, the development or commercialization of our product candidates could be delayed or stopped.\nThe manufacture of biotechnology products is generally complex and requires significant expertise and capital investment. We and our contract manufacturers must comply with cGMP regulations and guidelines for clinical trial product manufacture and for commercial product manufacture. Manufacturers of biotechnology products often encounter difficulties in production, particularly in scaling up, addressing product quality, product comparability, validating production processes and mitigating potential sources of contamination. These problems include difficulties with raw material procurement, production costs and yields, quality control, product quality, including stability of the product, quality assurance testing, operator error, shortages of qualified personnel, as well as compliance with strictly enforced federal, state and foreign regulations. Furthermore, if microbial, viral or other contaminations are discovered in therapeutic products or in the manufacturing facilities in which our product candidates are made, such manufacturing facilities may need to be closed for an extended period of time to investigate and remedy the contamination.\nManufacturing facilities require commissioning and validation activities to demonstrate that they operate as designed, and are subject to government inspections by the FDA, the EMA, the MHRA, and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities. If our third-party manufacturers are unable to reliably produce products to specifications acceptable to the regulatory authorities, we may not obtain or maintain the approvals we need to manufacture our product candidates. Further, manufacturing facilities may fail to pass government inspections prior to or after the commercial launch of our product candidates, which would cause significant delays and additional costs required to remediate any deficiencies identified by the regulatory authorities. Any of these challenges could delay completion of clinical trials, increase clinical trial costs, delay approval of our product candidate, impair commercialization efforts, increase our cost of goods, and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and growth prospects.\nWe cannot assure you that manufacturing problems, including supply chain disruptions of any of mAb2 product candidates or other products will not occur in the future. Any delay or interruption in the supply of preclinical or clinical trial supplies, including any delays arising from circumstances related to the COVID-19 pandemic, could delay the completion of these trials, increase the costs associated with maintaining these trial programs or require bridging clinical trials or the repetition of one or more clinical trials or even terminate trials completely.\nIn addition, as product candidates are developed through preclinical studies to later-stage clinical trials towards approval and commercialization, it is common that various aspects of the development program, such as manufacturing methods and formulation, are altered along the way in an effort to optimize processes and results. Any of these changes could cause our current product candidates or any future product candidates to perform differently and affect the results of planned clinical trials or other future clinical trials conducted with the altered materials. Such changes may also require additional testing, or notification to, or approval by the FDA, the EMA, the MHRA, or comparable foreign regulatory authorities. This could delay completion of clinical trials, require the conduct of bridging clinical trials or studies, require the repetition of one or more clinical trials, increase clinical trial costs, delay approval of our current product candidates and any future product candidates and/or jeopardize our ability to commence product sales and generate revenue.\nWe rely on third parties to supply and manufacture our product candidates, and we expect to continue to rely on third parties to manufacture our products, if approved. The development of such product candidates and the commercialization of any products, if approved, could be stopped, delayed or made less profitable if any such third party fails to provide us with sufficient quantities of product candidates or products or fails to do so at acceptable quality levels or prices or fails to maintain or achieve satisfactory regulatory compliance.\nWe do not currently have the infrastructure or capability internally to manufacture our product candidates for use in the conduct of our preclinical studies and clinical trials or for commercial supply if our products are approved. We rely on, and expect to continue to rely on, CMOs. We currently rely mainly on a few CMOs for the manufacturing of our product candidates. Any replacement of our CMOs could require significant effort and expertise because there may be a limited number of qualified CMOs. Reliance on third-party providers may expose us to more risk than if we were to manufacture our product candidates ourselves. We are dependent on our CMOs for the production of our product candidates in accordance with relevant regulations, such as cGMP, which includes, among other things, quality control, quality assurance and the maintenance of records and documentation. Moreover, many of the third parties with whom we contracts may also have relationships with other commercial entities, including our competitors, for whom they may also be conducting product development activities that could harm our competitive position.\nIf we were to experience an unexpected loss of supply of or if any supplier were unable to meet our demand for any of our product candidates, we could experience delays in our research or planned clinical trials or future commercialization activities. We could be unable to find alternative suppliers of acceptable quality, in the appropriate volumes and at an acceptable cost. Moreover, our suppliers are often subject to strict manufacturing requirements and rigorous testing requirements, which could limit or delay production. The long transition periods needed to switch manufacturers and suppliers, if necessary, could significantly delay our clinical studies and the commercialization of our products, if approved, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operation.\nIn complying with the applicable manufacturing regulations of the FDA, the EMA, the MHRA, and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities, we and our third-party suppliers must spend significant time, money and effort in the areas of design and development, testing, production, record-keeping and quality control to assure that the products meet applicable specifications and other regulatory requirements. The failure to comply with these requirements could result in an\nenforcement action against us, including the seizure of products and shutting down of production. We and any of these third-party suppliers may also be subject to audits by the FDA, the EMA, the MHRA, or other comparable foreign regulatory authorities. If any of our third-party suppliers fails to comply with cGMP or other applicable manufacturing regulations, our ability to develop and commercialize our future therapeutics products could suffer significant interruptions. We face risks inherent in relying on a single CMO, as any disruption, such as a fire, natural hazards, disease outbreaks including but not limited to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, or vandalism at the CMO could significantly interrupt our manufacturing capability. All of our CMOs currently do not have alternative production plans in place or disaster-recovery facilities available. In case of a disruption, we will have to establish alternative manufacturing sources. This would require substantial capital on our part, which we may not be able to obtain on commercially acceptable terms or at all. Additionally, we would likely experience months of manufacturing delays as the CMO builds or locates replacement facilities and seeks and obtains necessary regulatory approvals. If this occurs, we will be unable to satisfy manufacturing needs on a timely basis, if at all.\nThe manufacturing of all of our mAb2 product candidates requires using cells that are stored in a cell bank. We have one master cell bank for each product manufactured in accordance with cGMP. Working cell banks have not yet been manufactured. Half of each master cell bank is stored at a separate site so that in case of a catastrophic event at one site we believe sufficient vials of the master cell banks are left at the alternative storage site to continue manufacturing. We believe sufficient working cell banks could be produced from the vials of the master cell bank stored at a given site to assure product supply for the future. However, it is possible that we could lose multiple cell banks and have our manufacturing significantly impacted by the need to replace these cell banks, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely and expect to continue to rely on collaborative partners regarding the development of certain of our research programs and product candidates. If we are not able to maintain our current relationships or enter into new strategic relationships, our business, financial condition, commercialization prospects and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nWe are, and expect to continue to be, dependent on partnerships with partners relating to the development and commercialization of certain of our existing and future research programs and product candidates. We currently have collaborative research relationships with each of Janssen, AstraZeneca, Ares, Denali and Kymab for the development of certain mAb2 product candidates resulting from such collaborations. In addition, we have a clinical collaboration agreement with Roche on the use of the PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor atezolizumab (Tecentriq\u00ae) in combination cohorts of the SB 11285 trial and with Merck & Co. on the use of PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab (Keytruda\u00ae) in combination cohorts of the FS120 trial. We have, and may in the future, depending on our business strategy, continue to have discussions on potential partnering opportunities with various pharmaceutical companies. If we fail to enter into or maintain collaborations on reasonable terms or at all, our ability to develop our existing or future research programs and product candidates could be delayed, the commercial potential of our product could change, and our costs of development and commercialization could increase. Furthermore, we may find that our programs require the use of intellectual property rights held by third parties, and the growth of our business may depend in part on our ability to acquire or in-license these intellectual property rights.\nOur dependence on collaborative partners subjects us to a number of risks, including, but not limited to, the following:\n\u2022we may not be able to control the amount and timing of resources that the collaboration partner devotes to our research programs and product candidates;\n\u2022for collaboration agreements where we are solely or partially responsible for funding development expenses through a defined milestone event, the payments we receive from the collaboration partner may not be sufficient to cover the expenses we have or would need to incur in order to achieve that milestone event;\n\u2022we may be required to relinquish significant rights to our collaborative partners, including rights to exploit our intellectual property and marketing and distribution rights;\n\u2022if the development of the relevant product candidates is not successful, our anticipated payments under any partnership agreement (e.g., royalty payments for licensed products) may not materialize;\n\u2022we rely on the information and data received from third parties regarding their research programs and product candidates and will not have control of the process conducted by the third party in gathering and composing such data and information;\n\u2022if rights to develop and commercialize our product candidates that are subject to collaborations revert to us for any reason, we may not have sufficient financial resources to develop such product candidates, which may result in us failing to recognize any value from our investments in developing such product candidates;\n\u2022a collaborative partner may develop a competing product either by itself or in collaboration with others, including one or more of our competitors, or seek to restrict us from working with other collaborators that may compete with our partner\u2019s products, which could deprioritize the development of our products;\n\u2022our collaborative partners\u2019 willingness or ability to complete their obligations under our partnership arrangements may be adversely affected by business combinations or significant changes in a collaborative partner\u2019s business strategy;\n\u2022we may experience delays in, or increases in the costs of, the development of our research programs and mAb2 product candidates due to the termination or expiration of collaborative research and development arrangements;\n\u2022we may have disagreements with collaborative partners, including disagreements over proprietary rights, contract interpretation, non-competition limitations, or the preferred course of development, that might cause delays or termination of the research, development or commercialization of our product candidates, might lead to additional responsibilities for us with respect to our product candidates, or might result in litigation or arbitration, any of which may be time-consuming and expensive;\n\u2022collaborative partners may not properly maintain or defend our intellectual property rights or may use proprietary information in such a way as to invite litigation or other intellectual property-related proceedings that could invalidate our intellectual property or jeopardize our proprietary information or expose us to potential litigation; or\n\u2022collaborative partners may infringe or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of third parties, which may expose us to litigation and potential liability.\nWe face significant competition in seeking appropriate collaborative partners. Our ability to reach a definitive agreement for a partnership will depend, among other things, upon an assessment of the collaborator\u2019s resources and expertise, the terms and conditions of the proposed partnership and the proposed collaborator\u2019s evaluation of a number of factors. These factors may include the design or results of preclinical studies or clinical trials, the likelihood of regulatory approval, the potential market for the subject product candidate, the costs and complexities of manufacturing and delivering such mAb2 product candidate to patients, the potential of competing products, the existence of any uncertainty with respect to our ownership of technology (which can exist if there is a challenge to such ownership regardless of the merits of the challenge) and industry and market conditions generally. The collaborator may also consider alternative product candidates or technologies for similar indications that may be available to collaborate on and whether such a partnership could be more attractive than the one with us.\nWe may not be able to negotiate collaborations on a timely basis, on acceptable terms, or at all. If we are unable to do so, we may have to curtail the development of the product candidate for which we are seeking to collaborate, reduce or delay our development program or one or more of our other development programs, delay our potential commercialization, reduce the scope of any sales or marketing activities or increase our expenditures and undertake development or commercialization activities at our own expense. If we elect to increase our expenditures to fund development or commercialization activities on our own, we may need to obtain additional capital, which may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. If we do not have sufficient funds, we may not be able to further develop mAb2 product candidates or bring them to market and generate product revenue.\nRisks Related to our Business Operations, Employee Matters and Managing Growth\nOur future growth and ability to compete depends on retaining our key personnel and recruiting additional qualified personnel.\nOur success depends upon the continued contributions of our key management, scientific and technical personnel, many of whom have been instrumental for us and have substantial experience with our mAb2 product candidates, mAb2 technology and modular antibody technology platform. We are highly dependent upon our senior management, particularly Eliot Forster, our Chief Executive Officer, Neil Brewis, our Chief Scientific Officer, and Louis Kayitalire, our Chief Medical Officer, as well as our senior scientists and other members of our senior management team.\nThe loss of key managers and senior scientists could delay our research and development activities. In addition, our ability to compete in the highly competitive biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries depends upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified management, scientific and medical personnel. Many other biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies and academic institutions that we compete with for qualified personnel have greater financial and other resources, different risk profiles and a longer history in the industry than we do. Therefore, we might not be able to attract or retain these key persons on conditions that are economically acceptable. Furthermore, we will need to recruit new managers and qualified scientific personnel to develop our business if we expand into fields that will require additional skills. Our inability to attract and retain these key persons could prevent us from achieving our objectives and implementing our business strategy, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and prospects.\nWe expect to expand our development, regulatory and sales and marketing capabilities, and as a result, we may encounter difficulties in managing our growth, which could disrupt our operations.\nWe expect to experience growth in the number of our employees and the scope of our operations, particularly in the areas of drug development, regulatory affairs and sales and marketing. To manage our anticipated future growth, we must continue to implement and improve our managerial, operational and financial systems, expand our facilities and continue to recruit and train additional qualified personnel. Due to our limited financial resources and the limited experience of our management team in managing a company with such anticipated growth, we may not be able to effectively manage the expansion of our operations or recruit and train additional qualified personnel. The expansion of our operations may lead to significant costs and may divert our management and business development resources. Any inability to manage growth could delay the execution of our business plans or disrupt our operations.\nIf we fail to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting, we may not be able to accurately report our financial results or prevent fraud. As a result, shareholders could lose confidence in our financial and other public reporting, which would harm our business and the trading price of our shares.\nEffective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary for us to provide reliable financial reports and, together with adequate disclosure controls and procedures, are designed to prevent fraud. Any failure to implement required new or improved controls, or difficulties encountered in their implementation could cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations. In addition, any testing by us conducted in connection with Section 404, or any subsequent testing by our independent registered public accounting firm, may reveal deficiencies in our internal controls over financial reporting that are deemed to be material weaknesses or that may require prospective or retroactive changes to our financial statements or identify other areas for further attention or improvement. Inferior internal controls could also cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information, which could have a negative effect on the trading price of our shares.\nOur management will be required to assess the effectiveness of these controls annually. However, for as long as we are a Small Reporting Company, as defined by the SEC rules, our independent registered public accounting firm will not be required to attest to the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting pursuant to Section 404. An independent assessment of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting could detect problems that our management\u2019s assessment might not. Undetected material weaknesses in our internal controls over financial reporting could lead to financial statement restatements and require us to incur the expense of remediation.\nOur disclosure controls and procedures may not prevent or detect all errors or acts of fraud.\nWe are subject to certain reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. Our disclosure controls and procedures are designed to reasonably assure that information required to be disclosed by us in reports we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to management, recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC. We believe that any disclosure controls and procedures or internal controls and procedures, no matter how well conceived and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. These inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decision-making can be faulty, and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake. Additionally, controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons, by collusion of two or more people or by an unauthorized override of the controls. Accordingly, because of the inherent limitations in our control system, misstatements or insufficient disclosures due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected.\nOur business is subject to economic, political, regulatory and other risks associated with international operations.\nAs a company based in the United Kingdom, our business is subject to risks associated with conducting business internationally. Accordingly, our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors, including:\n\u2022economic weakness, including inflation, or political instability in particular non-U.S. economies and markets;\n\u2022differing regulatory requirements for product approvals;\n\u2022differing jurisdictions could present different issues for securing, maintaining or obtaining freedom to operate in such jurisdictions;\n\u2022potentially reduced protection for intellectual property rights;\n\u2022difficulties in compliance with different, complex and changing laws, regulations and court systems of multiple jurisdictions and compliance with a wide variety of foreign laws, treaties and regulations;\n\u2022changes in non-U.S. regulations and customs, tariffs and trade barriers;\n\u2022changes in non-U.S. currency exchange rates of the pound sterling, U.S. dollar, euro and currency controls;\n\u2022changes in a specific country\u2019s or region\u2019s political or economic environment, including the implications of the United Kingdom\u2019s withdrawal from the European Union and entrance into the Trade and Cooperation Agreement between the United Kingdom and the European Union, which remains subject to the European Union\u2019s procedures;\n\u2022trade protection measures, import or export licensing requirements or other restrictive actions by governments;\n\u2022differing reimbursement regimes and price controls in certain international markets;\n\u2022negative consequences from changes in tax laws;\n\u2022compliance with tax, employment, immigration and labor laws for employees living or traveling abroad, including, for example, the variable tax treatment in different jurisdictions of share options granted under our employee stock plan or equity incentive plan;\n\u2022workforce uncertainty in countries where labor unrest is more common than in the United States;\n\u2022difficulties associated with staffing and managing international operations, including differing labor relations;\n\u2022production shortages resulting from any events affecting raw material supply or manufacturing capabilities abroad; and\n\u2022business interruptions resulting from geo-political actions, including war and terrorism, or natural disasters including earthquakes, typhoons, floods and fires.\nExchange rate fluctuations may materially affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nDue to the international scope of our operations, our assets, earnings and cash flows are affected by fluctuations in the exchange rates of several currencies, particularly the U.S. dollar and pound sterling.\nAdditionally, although we are based primarily in the United Kingdom, we may receive payments from our business partners in U.S. dollars, Swiss francs and euros and we regularly acquire services, consumables and materials in U.S. dollars and euros. Further, any potential future revenue may be derived from the United States, countries within the euro zone and various other countries around the world. These future revenues may also be affected by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates which may, in turn, have a significant impact on our results of operations and cash flows from period to period. As a result, to the extent we continue our expansion on a global basis, we expect that increasing portions of our revenue, cost of revenue, assets and liabilities will be affected by fluctuations in currency valuations. We may, therefore, experience economic loss and a negative impact on earnings or net assets solely as a result of currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nOur business and operations would suffer in the event of computer system failures, cyber-attacks or a deficiency in our, or our collaborators\u2019 or third-party vendors\u2019, cyber-security.\nWe collect, store and transmit large amounts of confidential information, including personal information, operational and financial transactions and records, clinical trial data and information relating to intellectual property, on internal information systems and through the information systems of collaborators and third-party vendors with whom we contract. Despite the implementation of security measures, these information systems are vulnerable to damage from computer viruses, malware, natural disasters, terrorism, war, telecommunication and electrical failures, cyber-attacks or cyber-intrusions over the internet or other mechanisms, attachments to emails, persons inside our organization, or persons with access to systems inside the organization. No such security measures can eliminate the possibility of the information systems\u2019 improper functioning or the improper access or disclosure of confidential or personally identifiable information such as in the event of cyber-attacks. The risk of a security breach or disruption, particularly through cyber-attacks or cyber-intrusion, including by computer hackers, criminals, ex-U.S. governments, and cyber terrorists, has generally increased as the number, intensity and sophistication of attempted attacks and intrusions from around the world have increased.\nAdditionally, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees, collaborators, or other third-party vendors to disclose sensitive information or take other actions, including making fraudulent payments or downloading malware, by using \u201cspoofing\u201d and \u201cphishing\u201d emails or other types of attacks. We have previously experienced, and in the future may experience \u201cPhishing\u201d attacks despite efforts to prevent and mitigate future instances. For example, in recent years we were the target of cyber-attacks comprised of phishing incidents where an immaterial unauthorized payment was made based on misrepresentations or confidential company information was inadvertently shared with an unauthorized external party. The related immaterial payment was recovered by us upon identification of the incident. The unauthorized data shared was anonymized therefore no GDPR protection regulations were breached. After an internal investigation, it was determined that no further action was required under either U.K., U.S. federal or state law. It was deemed that the cyber-attacks did not have a material impact to our business or financial condition. As a result of these incidents we, increased our cybersecurity training for all staff. While we believe we responded appropriately, including implementing remedial measures to stop this cyber-attack and with the goal of preventing similar events in the future, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in these remedial and preventative measures or successfully mitigating the effects of future cyber-attacks.\nIf such future events were to occur and cause interruptions in our operations, it could result in a material disruption of our clinical and research and development activities and business operations. To the extent that any disruption or security breach was to result in a loss of or damage to our data or applications, or inappropriate disclosure of confidential or proprietary information or making of fraudulent payments, we could incur material legal claims and liability, damage to our reputation, suffer loss or harm to our intellectual property rights, face significant financial exposure, including incurring significant costs to remediate possible injury to the affected parties and the further research, development and commercial efforts of our future mAb2 products and product candidates could be delayed.\nOur employees, independent contractors, vendors, principal investigators, CROs and consultants may engage in misconduct or other improper activities, including non-compliance with regulatory standards and requirements and insider trading.\nWe are exposed to the risk that our employees, independent contractors, vendors, principal investigators, CROs and consultants may engage in fraudulent conduct or other illegal activity. Misconduct by these parties could include intentional, reckless and/or negligent conduct or disclosure of unauthorized activities to us that violate the regulations of the FDA, the EMA and other comparable foreign regulatory authorities, including those laws requiring the reporting of true, complete and accurate information to such authorities; healthcare fraud and abuse laws and regulations in the United States and abroad; or laws that require the reporting of financial information or data accurately. In particular, sales, marketing and business arrangements in the healthcare industry are subject to extensive laws and regulations intended to prevent fraud, misconduct, kickbacks, self-dealing and other abusive practices. These laws and regulations may restrict or prohibit a wide range of pricing, discounting, marketing and promotion, sales commission, customer incentive programs and other business arrangements. Activities subject to these laws also involve the improper use of information obtained in the course of clinical trials or creating fraudulent data in our preclinical studies or clinical trials, which could result in regulatory sanctions and cause serious harm to our reputation.\nWe have adopted a code of conduct applicable to all of our employees, but it is not always possible to identify and deter misconduct by employees and other third parties, and the precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in controlling unknown or unmanaged risks or losses or in protecting us from governmental investigations or other actions or lawsuits stemming from a failure to comply with these laws or regulations. Additionally, we are subject to the risk that a person could allege such fraud or other misconduct, even if none occurred. If any such actions are instituted against us, and we are not successful in defending itself or asserting our rights, those actions could have a significant impact on our business, including the imposition of civil, criminal and administrative penalties, damages, monetary fines, imprisonment, possible exclusion from participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal healthcare programs, additional reporting requirements and oversight if we become subject to a corporate integrity agreement or similar agreement to resolve allegations of non-compliance with these laws, contractual damages, reputational harm, diminished profits and future earnings, and curtailment of our operations, any of which could adversely affect our ability to operate our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFailure to comply with health and data protection laws and regulations could lead to government enforcement actions, including civil or criminal penalties, private litigation, and adverse publicity and could negatively affect our operating results and business.\nWe and any potential collaborators may be subject to federal, state, and foreign data protection laws and regulations, such as laws and regulations that address privacy and data security. In the United States, numerous federal and state laws and regulations, including federal health information privacy laws, state data breach notification laws, state health information privacy laws, and federal and state consumer protection laws, including Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, that govern the collection, use, disclosure and protection of health-related and other personal information could apply to our operations or the operations of our collaborators. In addition, we may obtain health information from third parties, including research institutions from which we obtain clinical trial data that are subject to privacy and security requirements under HIPAA, as amended by HITECH. Depending on the facts and circumstances, we could be subject to civil, criminal, and administrative penalties if we knowingly obtain, use, or disclose individually identifiable health information maintained by a HIPAA-covered entity in a manner that is not authorized or permitted by HIPAA.\nCompliance with U.S. and international data protection laws and regulations could require us to take on more onerous obligations in our contracts, restrict our ability to collect, use and disclose data, or in some cases, impact our ability to operate in certain jurisdictions. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations could result in government enforcement actions (which could include civil, criminal and administrative penalties), private litigation, and/or adverse publicity and could negatively affect our operating results and business. Moreover, clinical trial subjects, employees and other individuals about whom we or our potential collaborators obtain personal information, as well as the providers who share this information with us, may limit our ability to collect, use and disclose the information. Claims that we have violated individuals\u2019 privacy rights, failed to comply with data protection laws, or breached our contractual obligations, even if we are not found liable, could be expensive and time-consuming to defend and could result in adverse publicity that could harm our business.\nWe are subject to the U.K. Bribery Act 2010, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, and other anti-corruption laws, as well as export control laws, import and customs laws, trade and economic sanctions laws and other laws governing our operations.\nOur operations are subject to anti-corruption laws, including the U.K. Bribery Act 2010 (the \u201cBribery Act\u201d), the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (the \u201cFCPA\u201d), the U.S. domestic bribery statute contained in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7201, the U.S. Travel Act and other anti-corruption laws that apply in countries where we do business. The Bribery Act, the FCPA and these other laws generally prohibit us and our employees and intermediaries from authorizing, promising, offering, or providing, directly or indirectly, a financial or other advantage to government officials or other persons to induce them to improperly perform a relevant function or activity (or reward them for such behavior).\nUnder the Bribery Act, we may also be liable for failing to prevent a person associated with us from committing a bribery offense. We, along with those acting on our behalf and our commercial partners, operate in a number of jurisdictions that pose a high risk of potential Bribery Act or FCPA violations, and we participate in collaborations and relationships with third parties whose corrupt or illegal activities could potentially subject us to liability under the Bribery Act, FCPA or local anti-corruption laws, even if we do not explicitly authorize or have actual knowledge of such activities. In addition, we cannot predict the nature, scope or effect of future regulatory requirements to which our international operations might be subject or the manner in which existing laws might be administered or interpreted.\nCompliance with the Bribery Act, the FCPA and these other laws is expensive and difficult, particularly in countries in which corruption is a recognized problem. In addition, anti-corruption laws present particular challenges in the pharmaceutical industry, because, in many countries, hospitals are operated by the government, and doctors and other hospital employees are considered foreign officials for purposes of the FCPA.\nWe are also subject to other laws and regulations governing our international operations, including regulations administered by the governments of the United Kingdom and the United States, and authorities in the European Union, including applicable export control regulations, economic sanctions and embargoes on certain countries and persons, anti-money laundering laws, import and customs requirements and currency exchange regulations, collectively referred to as the Trade Control laws.\nThere is no assurance that we will be completely effective in ensuring our compliance with all applicable anti-corruption laws, including the Bribery Act, the FCPA or other legal requirements, including Trade Control laws. If we are not in compliance with the Bribery Act, the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws or Trade Control laws, we may be subject to criminal and civil penalties, disgorgement and other sanctions and remedial measures, and legal expenses. Such liabilities could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and liquidity. Likewise, any investigation of any potential violations of the Bribery Act, the FCPA, other anti-corruption laws or Trade Control laws could also have an adverse impact on our reputation, business, results of operations and financial condition. Further, the failure to comply with laws governing international business practices may result in substantial civil and criminal penalties and suspension or debarment from government contracting.\nIf we fail to comply with environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, we could become subject to fines or penalties or incur costs that could have a material adverse effect on the success of our business.\nWe are subject to numerous environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including those governing laboratory procedures and the handling, use, storage, treatment and disposal of hazardous materials and wastes. Our operations involve the use of hazardous and flammable materials, including chemicals and biological materials. Our operations also produce hazardous waste products. We generally contract with third parties for the disposal of these materials and wastes. We cannot eliminate the risk of contamination or injury from these materials. In the event of contamination or injury resulting from our use of hazardous materials, we could be held liable for any resulting damages, and any liability could exceed our resources. We also could incur significant costs associated with civil or criminal fines and penalties.\nAlthough we maintain workers\u2019 compensation insurance to cover us for costs and expenses, we may incur due to injuries to our employees resulting from the use of hazardous materials, this insurance may not provide adequate coverage against potential liabilities. We do not maintain insurance for environmental liability or toxic tort claims that may be asserted against us in connection with our storage or disposal of biological, hazardous or radioactive materials.\nLegal, political and economic uncertainty surrounding the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union may be a source of instability in international markets, create significant currency fluctuations, adversely affect our operations in the United Kingdom and pose additional risks to our business, revenue, financial condition, and results of operations.\nOn June 23, 2016, the electorate in the United Kingdom voted in favor of Brexit. Thereafter, on March 29, 2017, the country formally notified the European Union of its intention to withdraw pursuant to Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty. The withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union took effect on January 31, 2020, with a transition period that ended on December 31, 2020. The United Kingdom entered into a trade agreement known as the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, which was ratified on May 1, 2021, by the European Parliament. We are continuing to evaluate the potential impacts on our business of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement. The implementation of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, and development relating to matters not covered by the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, could lead to a period of considerable uncertainty and volatility, particularly in relation to United Kingdom financial and banking markets. Weakening of economic conditions or economic uncertainties could harm our business, and if such conditions emerge in the United Kingdom or in the rest of Europe, it may have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nCurrency exchange rates in the pound sterling and the euro with respect to each other and the U.S. dollar have already been adversely affected by Brexit and that may continue to be the case. In addition, the United Kingdom no longer benefits from international trade agreements negotiated by the European Union on behalf of its members, which may result in increased trade barriers which could make doing business in Europe and elsewhere more difficult. The United Kingdom has begun to enter into its own international trade agreements, and the economic impacts of those new agreements are not yet known.\nWe may also face new and additional regulatory costs and challenges from Brexit that could have a material adverse effect on operations. Since a significant proportion of the regulatory framework in the United Kingdom is derived from European Union directives and regulations, changes resulting from Brexit could materially impact the regulatory regime with respect to the approval of our product candidates in the United Kingdom or the European Union. Following its departure from the European Union and the expiration of the transitional period, the United Kingdom recently adopted a decentralized and mutual recognition reliance procedure for marketing authorizations that allows the United Kingdom\u2019s clinical trial regulator, the MHRA, to consider marketing authorizations granted in the European Union or the three additional European Economic Area countries. However, additional requests for information may arise and additional time may be required with respect to applications for marketing authorizations in the United Kingdom using these procedures. Any delay in obtaining, or an inability to obtain, any marketing approvals, as a result of Brexit or otherwise, would prevent us from commercializing product candidates in the United Kingdom and/or the European Union and restrict our ability to generate revenue and achieve and sustain profitability. If any of these outcomes occur, we may be forced to restrict or delay efforts to seek regulatory approval in the United Kingdom and/or European Union for our product candidates, which could significantly and materially harm our business.", "PERMNO": 16069, "SIC": 2836, "TIC": "SBPH"}
