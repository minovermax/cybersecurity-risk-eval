RISK FACTORS\nYou should carefully consider the following risk factors in addition to the other information included in this report. Each of these risk factors could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition, as well as the value of an investment in our common stock or other securities.\nRisks Relating to the Global COVID-19 Pandemic\nOur operations have been adversely affected as a result of the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, the pandemic contributed to a dramatic decrease in overall global economic activity generally, and crude oil prices in particular, in early 2020, and decreases in commodity prices can have a variety of negative effects on our business. While many of the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business have receded, it continues to be a unpredictable, particularly in the light of Delta, Omicron and other variants of concern, and additional adverse impacts on our business - including depressed crude oil, natural gas, and NGL prices, reductions in force, and reduced capital expenditures - could remain a risk for an indefinite period of time.\nRisks Relating to Our Business and the Industry\nCrude oil, natural gas and NGL prices fluctuate and declines in these prices, or an extended period of low prices, can significantly affect the value of our assets and our financial results and may impede our growth.\nMany aspects of our business depend upon crude oil, natural gas and NGL prices, including:\n\u2022our revenue, profitability and cash flows;\n\u2022our liquidity;\n\u2022the quantity and present value of our reserves;\n\u2022the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility and access to other sources of capital; and\n\u2022the nature and scale of our operations.\nThe markets for crude oil, natural gas and NGLs are often volatile, and prices may fluctuate in response to, among other things:\n\u2022changes in regional, national or global economic conditions and trends, including supply and demand;\n\u2022geopolitical factors and events that reduce or increase production from oil-producing regions and/or from members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (\u201cOPEC\u201d), and global events, such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic; and\n\u2022regulatory changes.\nThe price of oil has historically been volatile, due in recent years to a combination of factors including increased U.S. supply and global economic concerns. In the past two years, oil prices have ranged from highs over $80 per barrel to lows of approximately negative $40 per barrel. Prices for natural gas and NGLs have also experienced substantial volatility. If we reduce our capital expenditures due to low prices, natural declines in production from our wells will result in reduced cash flow from operations. Reduced cash flow would limit our ability to make the capital expenditures necessary to replace our reserves and production.\nIn addition to factors generally affecting the price of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs, the prices we receive for our production are affected by factors specific to us and to the local markets where production occurs. The prices we receive for our production vary from the relevant benchmark prices that are used for calculating commodity derivative positions. These differences, or differentials, are difficult to predict and may widen or narrow in the future based on markets and other forces, including local or regional supply and demand factors; terms of our sales contracts; investment decisions made by providers of midstream facilities and services, refineries and other industry participants; and the overall regulatory and economic climate. Widening differentials may materially and adversely impact our business.\nWe may be unable to return capital to our stockholders, and there is no assurance we will pay any dividends on or repurchase shares of our common stock in the future or at levels anticipated by our stockholders.\nDuring each of the second, third and fourth quarters of 2021, our board of directors declared and paid a quarterly cash dividend of $0.12 per share of common stock, and in December 2021, our board declared and paid a special cash dividend of\n$0.50 per share of common stock. Our ability to pay cash dividends in the future depends on, among other things, our liquidity, financial condition, financial requirements, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors considered relevant by our board. Our board, based on this evaluation, may decide not to declare future dividends, or to declare dividends at rates less than anticipated, either of which could reduce overall returns to our stockholders.\nIn February 2022, our board of directors has also approved an increase to our Stock Repurchase Program to acquire up to $1.25 billion of our outstanding common stock through December 31, 2023. This program is being implemented at the discretion of our board and may be extended, modified or discontinued at any time. We suspended the program in March 2020 due to adverse market conditions but reinstated it in February 2021.\nOur overall capital return program may change from time to time, and we cannot guarantee we will continue to pay dividends or repurchase shares. Our announcement of capital return programs does not obligate us to pay any particular dividend amount (except with respect to dividends already declared) or repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of shares of common stock. A reduction, suspension or change in our capital return programs could have a negative effect on our stock price.\nWe are subject to complex federal, state, local and other laws and regulations that adversely affect the cost and manner of doing business. Changes in laws and regulations applicable to us could increase our costs, impose additional operating restrictions or have other adverse effects on us.\nOur exploration, development, production and marketing operations are regulated extensively at the federal, state and local levels. Environmental and other governmental laws and regulations have increased the costs of planning, designing, drilling, installing, operating and abandoning crude oil and natural gas wells and associated facilities. Under these laws and regulations, we could also be liable for personal injuries, property damage and natural resource or other damages, and could be required to change, suspend or terminate operations. A summary of certain laws and regulations that apply to us and some potential changes to those laws and regulations is set forth in Items 1 and 2 - Business and Properties - Governmental Regulation. Any of the currently applicable laws and regulations could be amended, including in ways that we do not anticipate, and those changes could adversely affect our operations.\nFrom time to time, we have been subject to sanctions and lawsuits relating to alleged noncompliance with regulatory requirements. For example, in October 2017, in order to settle a lawsuit brought against us by the U.S. Department of Justice, on behalf of the EPA and the State of Colorado, we entered into a consent decree pursuant to which we paid a fine and agreed to implement certain operational changes. The lawsuit claimed that we failed to operate and maintain certain equipment in compliance with applicable law. In addition, as a result of the SRC Acquisition, we are subject to the obligations and requirements of a 2018 Compliance Order on Consent (\u201cCOC\u201d) entered into by SRC with CDPHE, applicable to certain SRC oil and gas production facilities we acquired from SRC. The COC resolved SRC\u2019s alleged violations related to storage tank emissions and contains requirements similar to those contained in our consent decree.\nThe regulatory environment in which we operate also changes frequently, often through the imposition of new or more stringent environmental and other requirements, some of which may apply retroactively. We cannot predict the nature, timing, cost or effect of such additional requirements, but they may have a variety of adverse effects on us. The types of regulatory changes that could impact our operations vary widely and include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\u2022As discussed in Items 1 and 2, Business and Properties - Governmental Regulation, the COGCC completed extensive rulemaking hearings in November 2020 which resulted in the adoption of new requirements for setbacks, permitting, siting cumulative and surface impacts, asset transfers, venting and flaring, and remediation. The implementation of the final rules could have a significant adverse effect on our unpermitted locations and therefore on our future inventory and reserves. For example, the new planning and permitting process associated with long term, landscape level development (referred to as Comprehensive Area Plans) has not yet been successfully utilized by any operators in Colorado due to a lengthy, highly technical, and resource-intensive approval process. The COGCC is still in the process of issuing guidance and direction regarding the new requirements, and we cannot predict the impact of these requirements on our inventory and operations.\n\u2022Federal and various state, local and regional governmental authorities have implemented, or considered implementing, regulations that seek to limit or discourage the emission of carbon, methane and other GHGs. For example, the EPA has made findings and issued regulations that require us to establish and report an inventory of\ngreenhouse gas emissions, and the state of Colorado has adopted rules regulating methane emissions from oil and gas operations. Additional laws or regulations intended to restrict the emission of GHGs could require us to incur additional operating costs and could adversely affect demand for the oil, natural gas and NGLs that we sell. These new laws or rules could, among other things, require us to install new emission controls on our equipment and facilities, acquire allowances to authorize our GHG emissions, pay taxes related to our emissions and administer and manage a GHG emissions program. In addition, like other energy companies, we could be named as a defendant in GHG-related lawsuits.\n\u2022Proposals are made from time to time to amend U.S. federal and state tax laws in ways that would be adverse to us, including by eliminating certain key U.S. federal income tax preferences currently available with respect to crude oil and natural gas exploration and production. The changes could include (i) the repeal of the percentage depletion deduction for crude oil and natural gas properties, (ii) the elimination of current deductions for intangible drilling and development costs, (iii) the elimination of the deduction for certain U.S. production activities and (iv) an extension of the amortization period for certain geological and geophysical expenditures. Also, state severance taxes may increase in the states in which we operate. This could adversely affect our existing operations in the relevant state and the economic viability of future drilling.\n\u2022The development of new environmental initiatives or regulations related to the acquisition, withdrawal, storage and use of surface water or groundwater or treatment and discharge of water waste, may limit our ability to use techniques such as hydraulic fracturing, increase our development and operating costs and cause delays, interruptions or termination of our operations, any of which could have an adverse effect on our operations and financial condition.\nIncreasing scrutiny and changing expectations from stakeholders with respect to our ESG practices may impose additional costs on us or expose us to new or additional risks.\nPublicly traded companies, both in the oil and natural gas industry and otherwise, are facing increased scrutiny from stakeholders of our practices related to ESG. Attention on these issues may come from stakeholders ranging from the SEC to local governments to institutional investors, and these stakeholders may seek certain outcomes or results on issues they perceive to be material. This could result in reduced access to capital, shareholder proposals and other adverse effects. Companies that fail to adapt or comply with evolving stakeholder expectations, or are perceived as failing to respond appropriately, could suffer from reputational damage and the business, financial condition, and/or stock price of such a company could be materially and adversely impacted.\nWe have experienced increased pressure from our stakeholders focused on climate change to reduce our carbon footprint and prioritize sustainable energy practices. Our stakeholders may also require us to implement additional ESG procedures or standards in order to meet their expectations for continued investment.\nWe have publicly communicated commitments related to reductions in methane and greenhouse gas emissions and flaring. It is possible that our stakeholders may not be satisfied with these commitments or our progress towards them. This, or a failure to meet our targets, could lead to decreased access to capital or have a negative impact on our stock price.\nAdditionally, public sentiment related to the oil and gas industry may be affected by uncertainty or instability resulting from climate change, political leadership changes and subsequent policies, changes in social views regarding the importance of fossil fuels, concerns about environmental impact and investor expectations, resulting in decreased demand for our products. This could have a significant financial and operational impact on our business.\nA substantial part of our crude oil, natural gas and NGLs production is located in the Wattenberg Field, making us vulnerable to risks associated with operating primarily in a single geographic area. In addition, we have a large amount of proved reserves attributable to a small number of producing formations.\nAlthough we have significant leasehold positions in the Delaware Basin in Texas, our current production is primarily located in the Wattenberg Field in Colorado. Because our production is not as diversified geographically as many of our competitors, the success of our operations and our profitability may be disproportionately exposed to the effect of any regional events, including natural disasters, government regulations and midstream interruptions.\nFor example, bottlenecks in processing and transportation that have occurred in some recent periods in the Wattenberg Field have negatively affected our results of operations, and these adverse effects may be disproportionately severe to us\ncompared to our more geographically diverse competitors. Similarly, the concentration of our producing assets within a small number of producing formations exposes us to risks, such as changes in field-wide rules that could adversely affect development activities or production relating to those formations. Such an event could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, the demand for, and cost of, drilling rigs, equipment, supplies, chemicals, personnel and oilfield services often increase as a result of numerous factors including increases in exploration and production activity, supply chain problems, and labor shortages. Any shortages or increased costs could delay or adversely affect our development and exploration operations or cause us to incur significant expenditures that are not provided for in our capital forecast, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. All of the producing properties and reserves we acquired in the SRC Acquisition are located in the Wattenberg Field. As a result, the transaction increased the risks we face with respect to the geographic concentration of our properties.\nThe marketability of our production is dependent upon transportation and processing facilities which we do not control. If these facilities are unavailable, or if we are unable to access these facilities on commercially reasonable terms, our operations could be interrupted, negatively affecting our results of operations.\nOur ability to market our production depends in substantial part on the availability, proximity and capacity of in-field gathering systems, compression and processing facilities, and transportation pipelines, all of which are owned and operated by third parties. If adequate midstream facilities and services are not available to us on a timely basis and at acceptable costs, our production may be curtailed and our results of operations will be adversely affected.\nAvailability or capacity issues can be a result of depressed commodity prices that ultimately reduce investment in new midstream facilities, new or amended government regulations curtailing drilling activities in Colorado which could discourage investment in midstream facilities, protests over construction of new pipelines and facilities, weather, fire, or other reasons, and could negatively affect our results of operations. In addition to causing production curtailments, capacity constraints can also reduce the price we receive for the crude oil, natural gas and NGLs we produce.\nLike other producers, we from time to time enter into volume commitments with midstream providers in order to induce them to provide increased capacity. If our production falls below the level required under these agreements, we could be subject to substantial shortfalls, deficiency, or similar fees.\nOur undeveloped acreage must be drilled before lease expiration, and production must thereafter be maintained under applicable lease terms, to hold the acreage by production. In highly competitive markets for acreage, failure to drill sufficient wells and thereafter maintain production under applicable lease terms could result in substantial lease renewal costs or, if renewal is not feasible, loss of our lease and prospective drilling opportunities.\nUnless production is established and thereafter maintained under applicable lease terms within the spacing or pooled units covering our undeveloped acreage, our leases for such acreage will expire. The cost to renew such leases may increase significantly and we may not be able to renew such leases on commercially reasonable terms or at all. Unexpected lease expirations could occur if our actual drilling activities or our ongoing production differ materially from our current expectations, and this could result in impairment charges. The risk of lease expiration is greater at times and in areas where the pace of our exploration and development activity slows or production declines or is otherwise shut-in. Our ability to drill, develop, and maintain production under applicable lease terms from the locations necessary to maintain our leases depends on a number of factors, including oil and natural gas prices, the availability and cost of capital, drilling and production costs, availability of drilling services and equipment, drilling results, gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints, access to and availability of water sourcing and distribution systems, and regulatory approvals, all of which are subject to risks and uncertainties.\nWe may incur losses as a result of title defects in the properties in which we invest or acquire.\nIt is our practice in acquiring oil and gas leases or interests not to incur the expense of retaining lawyers to examine the title to the mineral interest at the time of acquisition. Rather, we rely upon the judgment of oil and gas lease brokers or landmen who perform record title examinations before we acquire oil and gas leases and related interests. The existence of a material title deficiency can decrease a lease\u2019s value and can adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. While we typically obtain title opinions prior to commencing drilling operations on a lease or in a unit, the failure of title may not be discovered until after a well is drilled, in which case we may lose the lease and the right to produce all or a portion of the minerals under the property.\nOur ability to produce crude oil, natural gas and NGLs economically and in commercial quantities could be impaired if we are unable to acquire adequate supplies of water for our drilling and completion operations or are unable to dispose of or recycle the water we use at a reasonable cost, in a timely manner and within applicable environmental rules.\nDrilling and development activities such as hydraulic fracturing require the use of water and result in the production of wastewater. Our operations could be adversely impacted if we are unable to locate sufficient amounts of water or dispose of or recycle water used and produced in our exploration and production operations. The quantity of water required in certain completion operations, such as hydraulic fracturing, and changing regulations governing usage may lead to water constraints, supply concerns and regulatory issues, particularly in relatively arid climates such as eastern Colorado and western Texas. For example, increased drilling activity in the Delaware Basin in recent years has led to heightened concerns about water supply issues in the area and this may lead to regulatory actions, including rules providing local governments greater authority over water use, that adversely impact our operations.\nOur operations depend on being able to reuse or dispose of wastewater in a timely and economic fashion. Wastewater from oil and gas operations is often disposed of through underground injection. Wells in the Delaware Basin typically produce relatively large amounts of water that require disposal and an increased number of earthquakes have been detected in the Delaware Basin in recent years. Some studies have linked earthquakes, or induced seismicity, in certain areas to underground injection, which is leading to increased public and regulatory scrutiny of injection safety. This increased scrutiny applied to our Colorado operations as well. For example, in November 2020, the COGCC adopted various new requirements on the underground injection of fluid waste. In December 2021, the Texas Railroad Commission suspended the deep injection of wastewater in the Gardendale Seismic Response Area.\nReduced commodity prices could result in significant impairment charges and significant downward revisions of proved reserves.\nCommodity prices are volatile. Significant and rapid declines in prices have occurred in the past and may occur in the future. Low commodity prices could result in, among other things, significant impairment charges in the future. For example, we incurred impairment charges in a number of recent periods, including charges of $882.4 million and $38.5 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively, to write down assets. Similarly, the significant decline in commodity pricing during 2020 resulted in a reduced year-end proved reserve NYMEX price of $39.57 per barrel of crude and $1.99 per MMBtu of natural gas, a decrease of 29% and 23% respectively from 2019. The decline in pricing resulted in a downward revision of 28.2 MMBoe to reserves for year-end 2020 when compared to year-end 2019. The cash flow model we use to assess properties for impairment includes numerous assumptions, such as management\u2019s estimates of future oil and gas production and commodity prices, the outlook for forward commodity prices and operating and development costs. All inputs to the cash flow model must be evaluated at each date the estimate of future cash flows is made for each producing basin. A significant decrease in long-term forward prices could result in a significant impairment for our properties.\nOur estimated reserves are based on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate. Any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves.\nThe process of estimating crude oil and natural gas reserves is complex, requiring significant decisions in the evaluation of available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data. The data for a given property may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors, including additional development activity, evolving production history and a continual reassessment of the viability of production under changing economic conditions. In determining the estimates of reserve and economic evaluations, management utilizes independent petroleum engineers. The reserve estimates are based on assumptions regarding commodity prices, production levels and operating and development costs that may prove to be incorrect. As a result, estimated quantities of proved reserves and projections of future production rates and the timing of development expenditures may be inaccurate and revisions in existing reserve estimates occur.\nReserve estimates are based on the volumes of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs that are anticipated to be economically recoverable from a given date forward based on economic conditions that exist at that date. The actual quantities of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs recovered will be different than the reserve estimates, in part because they will not be produced under the same economic conditions as are used for the reserve calculations.\nYou should not assume that the present value of the estimated future net cash flows from our proved reserves is the current market value of those reserves. Pursuant to SEC rules, the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves, and the estimated quantity of those reserves, are based on the average of the previous 12-months\u2019 first day of the month prices and costs as of the date of the estimate. Actual future prices and costs may be materially different. Further, actual future net revenues will be affected by factors such as the amount and timing of actual development expenditures, the rate and timing of production and changes in governmental regulations or taxes. Significant variances could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves shown in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and cause potential impairment charges. In addition, the 10 percent discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flows (the rate required by the SEC) may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates currently in effect and risks associated with our properties or the industry in general.\nUnless reserves are replaced as they are produced, our reserves and production will decline, which would adversely affect our future business, financial condition and results of operations. We may not be able to develop our identified drilling locations as planned.\nProducing crude oil, natural gas and NGL reservoirs are generally characterized by declining production rates that may vary over time and exceed our estimates depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors. Our future reserves and production and, therefore, our cash flows and income, are highly dependent on our ability to efficiently develop and exploit our current reserves and to economically find or acquire additional recoverable reserves. We may not be able to develop, discover or acquire additional reserves to replace our current and future production at acceptable costs. Our failure to do so would adversely affect our future operations, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have identified a number of well locations as an estimation of our future multi-year drilling activities on our existing acreage. These well locations represent a significant part of our growth strategy. Our ability to drill and develop these locations depends on a number of uncertainties, including:\n\u2022crude oil, natural gas and NGL prices;\n\u2022the availability and cost of capital;\n\u2022drilling and production costs;\n\u2022availability and cost of drilling rigs, and equipment, supplies, chemicals, personnel and oilfield services;\n\u2022drilling results;\n\u2022lease expirations or limitations as to depth;\n\u2022midstream constraints;\n\u2022access to and availability of water sourcing and distribution systems;\n\u2022regulatory approvals; and\n\u2022other factors.\nBecause of these factors, we do not know if the numerous potential well locations we have identified will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce crude oil, natural gas or NGLs from these or any other potential well locations. In addition, the number of drilling locations available to us will depend in part on the spacing of wells in our operating areas. An increase in well density in an area could result in additional locations in that area, but a reduced production performance from the area on a per-well basis. Conversely, a decrease in well density could result in fewer locations in an area but possibly increased production performance on a per-well basis. For example, after examining well performance and other factors, we recently determined that our current Delaware Basin position supports fewer wells per unit than previously assumed. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2021, our estimated well locations for our current Delaware Basin position decreased from 135 to 65.\nFurther, certain of the horizontal wells we intend to drill in the future may require pooling of our lease interests with the interests of third parties. Some states, including Colorado, allow the involuntary pooling of tracts in a relatively broad number of circumstances to facilitate exploration, though Colorado now requires applicants to own or secure consent from the owners of more than 45 percent of the minerals to be pooled. Other states, notably Texas, restrict involuntary pooling to a much narrower set of circumstances and consequently these states rely primarily on voluntary pooling of lands and leases. In states such as Texas where pooling is accomplished primarily on a voluntary basis, or in states such as Colorado if we cannot meet the minimum requirement for ownership and consent, it may be more difficult to form units and, therefore, more difficult to fully develop a project if we own less than all (or cannot secure the ownership or consent of the required minimum amount) of the leasehold in the proposed units or one or more of our leases in the proposed units does not provide the necessary pooling\nauthority. If third parties in the proposed units are unwilling to pool their interests with ours, we may be unable to require such pooling on a timely basis or at all, which would limit the total horizontal wells we can drill. Further, the number of available locations will depend in part on the expected lateral lengths of the horizontal wells we drill. Because the intended lateral length of a horizontal well is subject to change for a variety of reasons, our estimated drilling locations will change over time. For this and numerous other reasons, our actual drilling activities may materially differ from those presently identified.\nOur inventory of drilling projects includes locations in addition to those that we currently classify as proved, probable and possible. The development of and results from these additional projects are more uncertain than those relating to probable and possible locations, and significantly more uncertain than those relating to proved locations. We have generally continued a steady pace of development in the Wattenberg Field over the past several years, and while the SRC Acquisition increased our inventory, continued development has reduced our inventory drilling locations. We also anticipate that our remaining locations in the field will not, on average, be as productive or as economic as many of those we have drilled in recent years, due to lower anticipated overall production or higher gas-to-oil ratios. In the Delaware Basin, our inventory is subject to, among other things, potential lease expirations (as to acreage and/or depths) and our continued analysis of geologic challenges in certain areas. For example, as noted above, we recently reduced our estimated number of locations in the Delaware Basin due to geological issues.\nThe wells we drill may not yield crude oil, natural gas or NGLs in commercially viable quantities and productive wells may be less successful than we expect.\nA prospect is a property on which our geologists have identified what they believe, based on available information, to be indications of hydrocarbon-bearing rocks. However, given the limitations of available data and technology, our geologists cannot know conclusively prior to drilling and testing whether crude oil, natural gas or NGLs will be present in sufficient quantities to repay drilling or completion costs and generate a profit. Furthermore, even when properly used and interpreted, 2-D and 3-D seismic data and visualization techniques do not enable our geologists to be certain as to the quantity of the hydrocarbons in those structures. As a result, our drilling activities may not be successful or economical, and our overall drilling success rate or our drilling success rate for activities in a particular area could decline. If a well is determined to be dry or uneconomic, which can occur even though it contains some crude oil, natural gas or NGLs, it is classified as a dry hole and plugged and abandoned in accordance with applicable regulations. This generally results in the loss of the entire cost of drilling and completion to that point. Even wells that are completed and placed into production may not produce sufficient crude oil, natural gas and NGLs to be profitable, or they may be less productive and/or profitable than we expected. For example, the data we use to model anticipated results from wells in a particular area may prove to be not representative of actual results from typical wells in the area, and this could result in production that falls short of estimates reflected in our internal business plans and/or guidance, \u201ctype curve\u201d or other disclosures we make to the public. This risk is higher for us in certain areas in the Delaware Basin that have relatively complex geological characteristics and correspondingly greater variability in well results. In addition, initial results from a well are not necessarily indicative of its performance over a longer period.\nDrilling for and producing crude oil, natural gas and NGLs are high risk activities with many uncertainties that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nDrilling activities are subject to many risks, including the risk that we will not discover commercially productive reservoirs. Drilling can be unprofitable, not only due to dry holes, but also due to curtailments, delays or cancellations as a result of other factors, including:\n\u2022pressures or irregularities in geological formations;\n\u2022fires;\n\u2022floods, winter storms and other natural disasters and adverse weather conditions;\n\u2022loss of well control;\n\u2022loss of drilling fluid circulation and other facility or equipment malfunctions;\n\u2022title problems;\n\u2022facility or equipment malfunctions;\n\u2022unexpected operational events;\n\u2022shortages or delays in the delivery of equipment and services;\n\u2022unanticipated environmental liabilities; and\n\u2022compliance with environmental and other governmental requirements.\nAny of these risks can cause substantial losses, including personal injury or loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment, loss of wells, pollution, environmental contamination and regulatory penalties. For example, a loss of containment of hydrocarbons during drilling activities could potentially subject us to civil and/or criminal liability and the possibility of substantial costs, including for environmental remediation. We maintain insurance against various losses and liabilities arising from our operations; however, insurance against certain operational risks may not be available or may be prohibitively expensive relative to the perceived risks presented. In addition, we may not have coverage with respect to a pollution event if we are unaware of the event while it is occurring and are therefore unable to report the occurrence of the event to our insurance company within the time frame required under our insurance policy. Thus, losses could occur for which we have no effective insurance coverage. The occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance and/or governmental or third-party responses to an event could have a material adverse effect on our business activities, financial condition and results of operations. We are currently involved in various remedial and investigatory activities at some of our wells and related sites.\nIn addition, certain technical risks relating to the drilling of horizontal wells - including those relating to our ability to fracture stimulate the planned number of stages and to successfully run casing the length of the well bore - have increased in recent years because we have increased the average lateral length of the horizontal wells we drill. Longer-lateral wells are also typically more expensive and require more time for preparation. In addition, we use multi-well pads instead of single-well sites. The use of multi-well pad drilling increases some operational risks because problems affecting the pad or a single well could adversely affect production from all of the wells on the pad. Pad drilling can also make our overall production, and therefore our revenue and cash flows, more volatile, because production from multiple wells on a pad will typically commence simultaneously. While we believe that we will be better served by using multi-well pads with longer lateral wells, the risk component involved in such drilling will be increased in some respects, with the result that we might find it more difficult to achieve economic success in our drilling program.\nThe inability of one or more of our customers or other counterparties to meet their obligations may adversely affect our financial results.\nSubstantially all of our accounts receivable result from our crude oil, natural gas and NGLs sales or joint interest billings to a small number of third parties in the energy industry. This concentration of customers and joint interest owners may affect our overall credit risk in that these entities may be similarly affected by changes in economic and other conditions. In addition, our commodity derivatives expose us to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by counterparties. Nonperformance by our customers or derivative counterparties may adversely affect our financial condition and profitability. We face similar risks with respect to our other counterparties, including the lenders under our revolving credit facility and the providers of our insurance coverage.\nWe participate in oil and gas operations with third parties who may not be able to fulfill their commitments to our projects.\nWe frequently own less than all of the working interest in the oil and gas leases and/or wells on which we conduct operations. Financial risks are inherent in any operation where the cost of drilling, equipping, completing and operating wells is shared by more than one person. We could be held liable for joint activity obligations of other working interest owners, such as nonpayment of costs and liabilities, arising from the actions of the other owners. A partner may be unable or unwilling to pay its share of project costs, and, in some cases, may declare bankruptcy. In the event any of our project partners does not pay its share of such costs, we would likely have to pay those costs, and we may be unsuccessful in any efforts to recover the costs from the partner. This could materially adversely affect our financial position.\nWe may not be able to keep pace with technological developments in our industry.\nOur industry is characterized by rapid and significant technological advancements. As our competitors use or develop new technologies, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage, and competitive pressures may force us to implement those or other new technologies at substantial cost. In addition, our competitors may have greater financial, technical and personnel resources that allow them to enjoy technological advantages and may in the future allow them to implement new technologies before we can. We may not be able to respond to these competitive pressures and implement new technologies on a timely basis or at an acceptable cost. If one or more of the technologies we use now or in the future were to become obsolete or if we were unable to use the most advanced technology, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nCompetition in our industry is intense, which may adversely affect our ability to succeed.\nOur industry is intensely competitive, and we compete with other companies that have greater resources. Many of these companies not only explore for and produce crude oil, natural gas and NGLs, but also carry on refining operations and market petroleum and other products on a regional, national or worldwide basis. These companies may be able to pay more for productive properties and exploratory prospects or evaluate, bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than we can. Our ability to acquire additional properties and to discover reserves in the future will be dependent upon our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment. In addition, larger companies may have a greater ability to continue exploration activities during periods of low commodity prices. Larger competitors may also be able to absorb the burden of present and future federal, state, local and other laws and regulations more easily than we can, which could adversely affect our competitive position. These factors could adversely affect our operations and our profitability.\nOur success depends on key members of our management and our ability to attract and retain experienced technical and other professional personnel.\nOur future success depends to a large extent on the services of our key employees. The loss of one or more of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, competition for experienced technical and other professional personnel remains strong. If we cannot retain our current personnel or attract additional experienced personnel, our ability to compete could be adversely affected. Also, the loss of experienced personnel could lead to a loss of technical expertise.\nA failure to complete successful acquisitions would limit our ability to replace our reserves and impact our financial condition.\nBecause our crude oil and natural gas properties are depleting assets, our future reserves, production volumes and cash flows depend on our success in developing and exploiting our current reserves efficiently and finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves economically. In addition, we continue to strive to achieve greater efficiencies in our drilling program, and our ability to do so is dependent in part on our ability to complete asset exchanges and other acquisitions that allow us to increase our working interests in particular properties. We may not be able to identify attractive acquisition opportunities, and if we do identify an appropriate acquisition candidate, we may be unable to negotiate mutually acceptable terms with the seller, finance the acquisition or obtain the necessary regulatory approvals. If we are unable to complete suitable acquisitions on acceptable terms, it will be more difficult to replace our reserves, and an inability to replace our reserves would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nAcquisitions of properties are subject to the uncertainties of evaluating recoverable reserves and potential liabilities, including environmental uncertainties.\nAcquisitions of producing and undeveloped properties have been an important part of our growth over time. We expect acquisitions will also contribute to our future growth. Successful acquisitions require an assessment of a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control. These factors include recoverable reserves, development potential, future commodity prices, operating costs, title issues and potential environmental and other liabilities. Such assessments are inexact and their accuracy is inherently uncertain. In connection with our assessments, we generally perform engineering, environmental, geological and geophysical reviews of the acquired properties that we believe are generally consistent with customary industry practices. However, such reviews are not likely to permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and capabilities. We do not typically inspect every well prior to an acquisition and our ability to evaluate undeveloped acreage is inherently imprecise. Even when we inspect a well, we may not always discover structural, subsurface and environmental problems that may exist or arise after the acquisition. In some cases, our review prior to signing a definitive purchase agreement may be even more limited. In addition, we often acquire acreage without any warranty of title except as to claims made by, through or under the transferor.\nWhen we acquire properties, we will generally have potential exposure to liabilities and costs for environmental and other problems existing on the acquired properties, and these liabilities may exceed our estimates. We may not be entitled to contractual indemnification associated with acquired properties. We often acquire interests in properties on an \u201cas is\u201d basis with no or limited remedies for breaches of representations and warranties. Therefore, we could incur significant unknown liabilities,\nincluding environmental liabilities or losses due to title defects, in connection with acquisitions for which we have limited or no contractual remedies or insurance coverage. In addition, the acquisition of undeveloped acreage is subject to many inherent risks and we may not be able to realize efficiently, or at all, the assumed or expected economic benefits of acreage that we acquire.\nAdditionally, significant acquisitions can change the nature of our operations depending upon the character of the acquired properties, which may have substantially different operating and geological characteristics or may be in different geographic locations than our existing properties. These factors can increase the risks associated with an acquisition. Acquisitions also present risks associated with the additional indebtedness that may be required to finance the purchase price and any related increase in interest expense or other related charges.\nSome of our acquisitions are structured as asset trades or exchanges. These transactions may give rise to any or all of the foregoing risks. In addition, transactions of this type create a risk that we will undervalue the properties we transfer to the counterparty in the trade or exchange or overvalue the properties we receive. Such an undervaluation or overvaluation would result in the transaction being less favorable to us than we expected.\nWe operate in a litigious environment. The cost of defending any suits brought against us, and any judgments or settlements resulting from such suits, could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nLike many oil and gas companies, we are from time to time involved in various legal and other proceedings, such as title, royalty or contractual disputes, employment litigation, regulatory compliance matters and personal injury or property damage matters, in the ordinary course of our business. For example, in January 2021, a purported class action lawsuit was filed against us by a royalty owner alleging we have been improperly deducting certain post-production costs from the owner\u2019s oil royalty payments. While we intend to vigorously defend this suit, the outcome of legal proceedings is inherently uncertain. Regardless of the outcome, such proceedings could have an adverse impact on us because of legal costs, diversion of management attention and other factors. In addition, the resolution of any such legal or other proceedings could result in penalties or sanctions, settlement costs and/or judgments, consent decrees or orders requiring a change in our business practices, any of which could materially and adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. Accruals for such liability, penalties, sanctions or costs may be insufficient. Judgments and estimates to determine accruals or the anticipated range of potential losses related to legal and other proceedings could change from one period to the next, and such changes could be material. Information regarding legal proceedings can be found in Item 3. Legal Proceedings included elsewhere in this report.\nOur business could be negatively impacted by security threats, including cybersecurity threats and other disruptions.\nWe face various security threats, including attempts by third parties to gain unauthorized access to, or control of, competitive information or to render data or systems corrupted or unusable; threats to the safety of our employees; threats to the security of our infrastructure or third-party facilities and infrastructure, such as processing plants and pipelines; and threats from terrorist acts. There can be no assurance that the procedures and controls we use to monitor these threats and mitigate our exposure to them will be sufficient to prevent them from materializing.\nOur industry has become increasingly dependent on digital technologies to conduct day-to-day operations, including certain exploration, development and production activities. We depend on digital technology, including information systems and related infrastructure, as well as cloud applications and services, to store, transmit, process and record sensitive information (including but not limited to trade secrets, employee information and financial and operating data), communicate with our employees and business partners, and for many other activities related to our business. In addition, computer systems control the oil and gas production and processing equipment that are necessary to deliver our production to market. Critical infrastructure targets, such as energy-related assets and transportation assets, may be at greater risk of future cyber-attacks than other targets. A disruption or failure of these systems, or of the networks and infrastructure on which they rely, may cause damage to critical production, distribution and/or storage assets, delay or prevent delivery to markets, or make it difficult to accurately account for production and settle transactions. The various procedures, facilities, infrastructure and controls we utilize to monitor these threats and mitigate our exposure to such threats are costly and labor intensive. Moreover, there can be no assurance that such measures will be sufficient to prevent security breaches from occurring. The continuing and evolving threat of cybersecurity attacks has resulted in increased regulatory focus on prevention, which could potentially elevate costs, and failure to comply with these regulations could result in penalties and potential legal liability.\nAs dependence on digital technologies has increased in our industry, cyber incidents, including deliberate attacks and unintentional events, have also increased. Our systems and infrastructure are, and those of our business partners, including vendors, service providers, operating partners, purchasers of our production and financial institutions may be, subject to damage or interruption from a number of potential sources including natural disasters, software viruses or other malware, power failures, cyber-attacks and other events. We and our business partners also face various other cyber-security threats from criminal hackers, state-sponsored intrusion, industrial espionage and employee malfeasance, including threats to gain access to sensitive information or to render data or systems unusable.\nOur technologies, systems and networks, and those of our business partners, may become the target of cyber-attacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release, gathering, monitoring, misuse, loss or destruction of proprietary and other information, theft of property or other disruption of our business operations. In addition, certain cyber incidents, such as surveillance, may remain undetected for an extended period. To our knowledge, we have not suffered material losses related to cyber-attacks to date; however, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer material losses in the future either as a result of an interruption to or a breach of our systems or those of our third-party vendors and service providers. If we were successfully attacked, we could incur substantial remediation and other costs or suffer other negative consequences, such as a loss of competitive information, critical infrastructure, personnel or capabilities essential to our operations. Events of this nature could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Moreover, as the sophistication of cyber-attacks continues to evolve, we may be required to expend significant additional resources to further enhance our digital security or to remediate vulnerabilities.\nThe physical effects of climate change could disrupt our production and cause us to incur significant costs in preparing for or responding to those effects. An economy-wide transition to lower GHG energy sources could have a variety of adverse effects on our operations and financial results.\nMany scientists have shown that increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane and other GHGs in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere are changing global climate patterns. One consequence of climate change could be increased severity of extreme weather, such as increased hurricanes and floods. If such events were to occur, or become more frequent, our operations could be adversely affected in various ways, including through damage to our facilities or from increased costs for insurance.\nAnother possible consequence of climate change is increased volatility in seasonal temperatures. The market for natural gas is generally improved by periods of colder weather and impaired by periods of warmer weather, so any changes in climate could affect the market for the fuels that we produce. As a result, if there is an overall trend of warmer temperatures, it would be expected to have an adverse effect on our business.\nEfforts by governments, international bodies, businesses and consumers to reduce GHGs and otherwise mitigate the effects of climate change are ongoing. The nature of these efforts and their effects on our business are inherently unpredictable and subject to change. Certain regulatory responses to climate change issues are discussed above under the heading \u201cWe are subject to complex federal, state, local and other laws and regulations that adversely affect the cost and manner of doing business. Changes in laws and regulations applicable to us could increase our costs, impose additional operating restrictions or have other adverse effects on us\u201d and in Items 1 and 2 - Business and Properties - Governmental Regulation. However, actions taken by private parties in anticipation of, or to facilitate, a transition to a lower-GHG economy will affect us as well. For example, our cost of capital may increase if lenders or other market participants decline to invest in fossil fuel-related companies for regulatory or reputational reasons. Similarly, increased demand for low-carbon or renewable energy sources from consumers could reduce the demand for, and the price of, the products we produce. Technological changes, such as developments in renewable energy and low-carbon transportation, could also adversely affect demand for our products.\nRisks Relating to Financial Matters\nOur development and exploration operations require substantial capital, and we may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms, which could lead to a loss of properties and a decline in our production and reserves, and ultimately our profitability. Lender hesitancy to offer financing to our industry may increase this risk.\nOur industry is capital intensive. We expect to continue to make substantial capital expenditures for the exploration, development, production and acquisition of crude oil, natural gas and NGL reserves. To date, we have financed capital expenditures primarily with bank borrowings under our revolving credit facility, cash generated from operations and proceeds\nfrom capital markets transactions and the sale of properties. We intend to finance our future capital expenditures utilizing similar financing sources. Our cash flows from operations and access to capital are subject to a number of variables, including:\n\u2022our proved reserves;\n\u2022the amount of crude oil, natural gas and NGLs we are able to produce from existing wells;\n\u2022the prices at which crude oil, natural gas and NGLs are sold;\n\u2022the costs to produce crude oil, natural gas and NGLs; and\n\u2022our ability to acquire, locate and produce new reserves.\nIf our revenues or the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility decrease as a result of lower commodity prices, operating difficulties or for any other reason, our need for capital from other sources could increase, and there can be no assurance that such other sources of capital would be available at that time on reasonable terms or at all. If we raise funds by issuing additional equity securities, this would have a dilutive effect on existing shareholders. If we raise funds through the incurrence of debt, the risks we face with respect to our indebtedness would increase and we would incur additional interest expense.\nAdditionally, due to recent default rates in the oil and gas industry and other factors, some lenders have expressed a hesitancy to lend to oil and gas producers, and may require terms less favorable to the producers or, in some cases, may refuse to provide financing to the industry altogether. The number of lenders participating in our revolving credit facility decreased in connection with the amendment and restatement of the facility in 2021, and may decline further in the future. Our inability to obtain sufficient financing on acceptable terms would adversely affect our financial condition and profitability.\nThe cost of servicing, and risks related to refinancing, our debt could adversely affect our business. Those risks could increase if we incur more debt.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had a total long-term debt of $950 million. Servicing our indebtedness and satisfying our other obligations will require a significant amount of cash, and cash flow from operating activities and other sources may not be sufficient to fund our liquidity needs. Our ability to pay interest and principal on our indebtedness and to satisfy our other obligations will depend on our future operating performance, our financial condition and the availability of refinancing indebtedness, which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions and financial, business and other factors, many of which are beyond our control.\nA substantial decrease in our operating cash flow or an increase in our expenses could make it difficult for us to meet debt service requirements and could require us to modify our operations, including by curtailing our exploration and drilling programs, reducing our capital expenditures, selling assets, refinancing all or a portion of our existing debt or obtaining additional financing. We may or may not be able to complete any such steps on satisfactory terms. Any ability to generate sufficient cash flows to satisfy our debt obligations or contractual commitments, or to refinance our debt on commercially reasonable terms, could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nCovenants in our debt agreements currently impose, and future financing agreements may impose, operating and financial restrictions.\nOur current debt agreements contain restrictions, and future financing agreements may contain additional restrictions, on our activities, including covenants that restrict our and our restricted subsidiaries\u2019 ability to:\n\u2022incur additional debt;\n\u2022pay dividends on, redeem or repurchase stock;\n\u2022create certain liens;\n\u2022make specified types of investments;\n\u2022apply net proceeds from certain asset sales;\n\u2022engage in transactions with our affiliates;\n\u2022engage in sales and leaseback transactions;\n\u2022merge or consolidate; and\n\u2022sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or dispose of assets.\nOur revolving credit facility is secured by substantially all of our oil and gas properties as well as a pledge of all ownership interests in our current operating subsidiaries. The restrictions contained in our current or future debt agreements may prevent us from taking actions that we believe would be in the best interest of our business. In addition, our ability to comply with covenants and restrictions in our debt agreements in the future is uncertain and will be affected by the levels of cash flows from operations and events or circumstances beyond our control. Our failure to comply with any of these restrictions and covenants could result in a default under our debt agreements. In the event of such a default, the holders of such indebtedness could elect to declare all the funds borrowed thereunder, and under other agreements to which a cross-default or cross-acceleration provision applies, to be due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest; the lenders under our revolving credit facility could elect to terminate their commitments, cease making further loans and institute foreclosure proceedings against our assets; and we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nOur lenders have sole discretion to set our borrowing availability based on anticipated commodity prices and corporate outlook.\nThe revolving credit facility limits the amounts we can borrow to a borrowing base amount, determined by the lenders in their sole discretion based upon projected revenues from the properties securing their loan. Decreases in the price of crude oil, natural gas or NGLs may have an adverse effect on the borrowing base. The lenders can unilaterally adjust the borrowing base and the borrowings permitted to be outstanding under the revolving credit facility. Outstanding borrowings in excess of the borrowing base must be repaid immediately unless we pledge other crude oil and natural gas properties as additional collateral. We do not currently have any substantial unpledged properties, and we may not have the financial resources in the future to make any mandatory principal prepayments required under the revolving credit facility. Our inability to borrow additional funds under our revolving credit facility could adversely affect our operations and our financial results.\nOur commodity derivative activities could result in financial losses or reduced income from failure to perform by our counterparties, could limit our potential gains from increases in prices and could result in volatility in our net income.\nWe use commodity derivatives for a portion of the production from our own wells to achieve more predictable cash flows, to reduce exposure to adverse fluctuations in commodity prices, and to allow our natural gas marketing company to offer pricing options to natural gas sellers and purchasers. These arrangements expose us to the risk of financial loss in some circumstances, including when purchases or sales are different than expected or the counterparty to the commodity derivative contract defaults on its contractual obligations. In addition, many of our commodity derivative contracts are based on WTI or another crude oil or natural gas index price. The risk that the differential between the index price and the price we receive for the relevant production may change unexpectedly makes it more difficult to hedge effectively and increases the risk of a hedging-related loss. Also, commodity derivative arrangements may limit the benefit we would otherwise receive from increases in the prices for the relevant commodity.\nAt December 31, 2021, we had hedged a total of 22.2 MMBbls crude oil for 2022 to 2024 and 102.5 MMBtu of natural gas for 2022 and 2023. These hedges may be inadequate to protect us from continuing and prolonged declines in crude oil and natural gas prices.\nSince we do not designate our commodity derivatives as cash flow hedges, we do not currently qualify for use of hedge accounting; therefore, changes in the fair value of commodity derivatives are recorded in our income statements and our net income is subject to greater volatility than it would be if our commodity derivative instruments qualified for hedge accounting. For instance, if commodity prices rise significantly, this could result in significant non-cash charges during the relevant period, which could have a material negative effect on our net income.\nThe price of our common stock has been and may continue to be highly volatile, which may make it difficult for shareholders to sell our common stock when desired or at attractive prices.\nThe market price of our common stock is highly volatile and we expect it to continue to be volatile for the foreseeable future. Adverse events including changes in production volumes, worldwide demand and prices for crude oil and natural gas, regulatory developments, and changes in securities analysts\u2019 estimates of our financial performance could negatively impact the market price of our common stock. General market conditions, including the level of, and fluctuations in, the trading prices of stocks generally could also have a similar negative impact. The stock markets regularly experience price and volume volatility that affects many companies\u2019 stock prices without regard to the operating performance of those companies. Volatility of this type may affect the trading price of our common stock. Similar factors could also affect the trading prices of our senior notes.\nRisks Relating to Pending Great Western Acquisition\nIf completed, the Great Western Acquisition may not achieve its intended results and may result in us assuming unanticipated liabilities. To date, we have conducted only limited diligence regarding the assets and liabilities we would assume in the transaction.\nWe entered into the Purchase Agreement with the expectation that the Great Western Acquisition would result in various benefits, growth opportunities and synergies. Achieving the anticipated benefits of the transaction is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties. For example, under the Purchase Agreement, we have the opportunity to conduct customary environmental and title due diligence following the execution of the agreement, but our diligence efforts to date have been limited. As a result, we may discover title defects or adverse environmental or other conditions of which we are currently unaware. Environmental, title and other problems could reduce the value of the properties to us, and, depending on the circumstances, we could have limited or no recourse to the sellers with respect to those problems. We would assume substantially all of the liabilities associated with the acquired properties and would be entitled to indemnification in connection with those liabilities in only limited circumstances and in limited amounts. We cannot assure you that such potential remedies will be adequate for any liabilities we incur, and such liabilities could be significant.\nAs with other acquisitions, the success of the Great Western Acquisition depends on, among other things, the accuracy of our assessment of the reserves and drilling locations associated with the acquired properties, future oil, NGL and natural gas prices and operating costs and various other factors. These assessments are necessarily inexact. As a result, we may not recover the purchase price for the acquisition from the sale of production from the property or recognize an acceptable return from such sales.\nThe reserves, production and drilling locations estimates with respect to the properties to be acquired in the Great Western Acquisition may differ materially from the actual amounts.\nOur estimates of the reserves, production and drilling locations associated with the properties to be acquired in the Great Western Acquisition are based on our analysis of historical production data, assumptions regarding capital expenditures and anticipated production declines. Such analysis is based, in significant part, on data provided by the sellers. We cannot assure you that these estimates are accurate. After such data is further reviewed by us and our independent engineers, the actual reserves, production and number of viable drilling locations may differ materially from the amounts we have estimated.\nThe transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement are subject to conditions that may not be satisfied on a timely basis or at all. Failure to complete the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement could have material and adverse effects on us.\nCompletion of the Great Western Acquisition is subject to a number of conditions, including the accuracy of the parties\u2019 representations in the Purchase Agreement and the receipt of certain governmental approvals. Such conditions, some of which are beyond our control, may not be satisfied or waived in a timely manner or at all and therefore make the completion and timing of the completion of the Great Western Acquisition uncertain. In addition, the Purchase Agreement contains certain termination rights for both Great Western and us, which if exercised will also result in the Great Western Acquisition not being consummated. Furthermore, the governmental authorities from which the federal regulatory approvals are required may impose conditions on the completion of the Great Western Acquisition or require changes to the terms of the acquisition or the Purchase Agreement.\nIf the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement are not completed, our business may be adversely affected and, without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the Great Western Acquisition, we will be subject to a number of risks, including the following: we will be required to pay our costs relating to the Great Western Acquisition, such as legal, accounting, and financial advisory fees; time and resources committed by our management to matters relating to the Great Western Acquisition could otherwise have been devoted to pursuing other beneficial opportunities; and the market price of our common stock could be impacted to the extent that the current market price reflects a market assumption that the Great Western Acquisition will be completed. In addition, if the Purchase Agreement is terminated and the Board seeks another acquisition, we cannot be certain that we will be able to find a party willing to enter into a transaction as attractive to us as the Great Western Acquisition.\nWe will be subject to business uncertainties while the Great Western Acquisition is pending, which could adversely affect our business.\nIt is possible that certain persons with whom we have a business relationship may delay certain business decisions relating to us, or seek to terminate, change or renegotiate their relationships with us, in connection with the pendency of the Great Western Acquisition. This could negatively affect our revenues, earnings and cash flows, as well as the market price of our common stock, regardless of whether the Great Western Acquisition is completed. Also, our ability to attract, retain and motivate employees may be impaired until the Great Western Acquisition is completed and for a period of time thereafter as current and prospective employees may experience uncertainty about their roles within the combined company following the transaction.\nIn addition, under the terms of the Purchase Agreement, we are subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to the completion of the Great Western Acquisition, which may adversely affect our ability to execute certain of our business strategies. Such limitations could negatively affect our business and operations prior to the completion of the Great Western Acquisition.\nEven if the Great Western Acquisition is completed, we may not achieve the anticipated benefits and the Great Western Acquisition may disrupt our current plans or operations.\nThe success of the Great Western Acquisition will depend, in part, on our ability to realize the anticipated benefits and cost savings from combining our and Great Western\u2019s businesses, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully integrate Great Western or otherwise realize the anticipated benefits of the Great Western Acquisition. Difficulties in integrating Great Western into our company may result in us performing differently than expected, in operational challenges or in the failure to realize anticipated expense-related efficiencies. Potential difficulties that may be encountered in the integration process include, among others:\n\u2022the inability to successfully integrate Great Western into PDC in a manner that permits us to achieve the full cost savings or operating synergies anticipated from the Great Western Acquisition;\n\u2022complexities associated with managing a larger, more complex, integrated business;\n\u2022the disruption or the loss of momentum in, each company\u2019s ongoing business or inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies.\nWe are expected to incur significant transaction costs in connection with the Great Western Acquisition, which may be in excess of those we currently anticipate.\nWe expect to incur a number of non-recurring costs associated with negotiating and completing the Great Western Acquisition, combining the operations of the two companies and achieving desired synergies. These fees and costs have been, and will continue to be, substantial and, in many cases, will be borne by us whether or not the Great Western Acquisition is completed. A substantial majority of our non-recurring expenses will consist of transaction costs related to the Great Western Acquisition and include, among others, fees paid to financial, legal, accounting and other advisors. We will also incur transaction costs related to formulating and implementing integration plans, including facilities and systems consolidation costs and other employment-related costs. We will continue to assess the magnitude of these costs, and we may incur additional unanticipated costs. The elimination of duplicative costs, as well as the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses, may not offset integration-related costs and achieve a net benefit in the near term or at all. The costs described above and any unanticipated costs and expenses, many of which will be borne by us even if the Great Western Acquisition is not completed, could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results.\nAfter the Great Western Acquisition is completed, PDC will be proportionally more exposed to regulatory risks associated with oil and gas operations in Colorado and other risks associated with a more geographically-concentrated asset base.\nPDC's principal assets in terms of production and reserves are located in the Wattenberg Field located within the Denver-Julesburg Basin of Colorado, but we also have a significant acreage position in the Delaware Basin in Texas. During 2021, 87 percent of PDC's production came from its assets in Colorado and 13 percent came from its assets in Texas. All of Great Western\u2019s properties, and all of its current production and reserves, are located in Colorado. Various new regulatory requirements applicable to oil and natural gas operations in Colorado have been proposed or adopted in recent years as described elsewhere in this report.\nThe increased percentage of PDC's combined production located in the Wattenberg Field following the Great Western Acquisition will proportionately increase PDC's exposure to risks associated with operating in a more concentrated geographic area, including Colorado-specific regulatory and midstream risks as described elsewhere in this section.", "PERMNO": 62341, "SIC": 1311, "TIC": "PDCE"}
