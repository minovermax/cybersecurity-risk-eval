{"cik": "1295401", "company": "Bancorp, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2020-03-16", "item_1A": "Item 1A. Risk Factors\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nOur business may be affected materially by various risks and uncertainties. Any of the risks described below or elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K or our other SEC filings, as well as other risks we have not identified, may have a material negative impact on our financial condition and operating results.\nThe Bank\u2019s allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual losses.\n\ufeff\nLike all financial institutions, the Bank maintains an allowance for loan losses to provide for probable losses inherent in its loan portfolio. At December 31, 2019, the ratios of the allowance for loan losses to total loans and to non-performing loans were, respectively, 0.56% and 113.0%. The Bank\u2019s allowance for loan losses may not be adequate to cover actual loan losses and future provisions for loan losses could materially and adversely affect the Bank\u2019s operating results. The Bank\u2019s allowance for loan losses is determined by management after analyzing historical loan losses, current trends in delinquencies and charge-offs, plans for problem loan resolution, changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio and industry information. Also included in management\u2019s estimates for loan losses are considerations with respect to the impact of economic events, the outcome of which are uncertain. The determination by management of the allowance for loan losses involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires management to estimate current and future credit risk based on both qualitative and quantitative facts, each of which is subject to significant change. The amount of future loan losses is susceptible to changes in economic, operating and other conditions, including changes in interest rates that may be beyond the Bank\u2019s control, and these loan losses may exceed current estimates. Bank regulatory agencies, as an\nintegral part of their examination process, review the Bank\u2019s loans and allowance for loan losses. Although we believe that the Bank\u2019s allowance for loan losses is adequate to provide for probable losses and that the methodology used by the Bank to determine the amount of both the allowance and provision is effective, we cannot assure you that we will not need to increase the Bank\u2019s allowance for loan losses, change our methodology for determining our allowance and provision for loan losses or that our regulators will not require us to increase this allowance. Any of these occurrences could materially reduce our earnings and profitability and could result in our sustaining losses. For more information about risks which are specific to the different types of loans we make and which could impact the allowance for loan losses, see Item 1,\u201d Business -Lending Activities.\u201d\n\ufeff\nRecent changes to the FASB accounting standards will result in a significant change to our recognition of credit losses and may materially impact our financial condition or results of operations.\n\ufeff\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued an update to Accounting Standards Update (ASU or Update) 2016-13 - \u201cFinancial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments\u201d. The Update changes the accounting for credit losses on loans and debt securities. For loans and held-to-maturity debt securities, the Update requires a current expected credit loss (CECL) approach to determine the allowance for credit losses. CECL requires loss estimates for the remaining estimated life of the financial asset using historical experience, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Also, the Update eliminates the existing guidance for purchased credit impaired loans, but requires an allowance for purchased financial assets with more than insignificant deterioration since origination. In addition, the Update modifies the other-than-temporary impairment model for available-for-sale debt securities to require an allowance for credit impairment instead of a direct write-down, which allows for reversal of credit impairments in future periods based on improvements in credit. The CECL model will materially impact how we determine our allowance for loan and lease losses and may require us to significantly increase our allowance for loan and lease losses. Furthermore, our allowance for loan and lease losses may experience more fluctuations, some of which may be significant. Were we required to significantly increase our allowance for loan and lease losses, it may negatively impact our business, earnings, financial condition and results of operations. We expect that the transition to the CECL model will result in an increase in the allowance for credit losses given the change to estimated losses over the contractual life of the asset adjusted for expected prepayments, an additional allowance for the uninsured portion of SBA loan commitments and the potential addition of an allowance for debt securities. The amount of the increase will be impacted by the portfolio composition and credit quality at the adoption date as well as economic conditions and forecasts at that time. If we are required to materially increase our level of allowance for loan and lease losses for any reason, such increase could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. The guidance is effective in first quarter 2020 with a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the year of adoption.\n\ufeff\nThe Bank may suffer losses in its loan portfolio despite its underwriting practices.\n\ufeff\nThe Bank seeks to mitigate the risks inherent in its loan portfolio by adhering to specific underwriting practices. These practices vary depending on the facts and circumstances of each loan. For other than SBLOC and IBLOC loans, these practices may include analysis of a borrower\u2019s prior credit history, financial statements, tax returns and cash flow projections, valuation of certain types of collateral based on reports of independent appraisers and verification of liquid assets. For SBLOC loans, a primary element of the credit decision is the market value of the borrower\u2019s brokerage account, which is reduced by the varying collateral percentages against which the Company is willing to lend, resulting in excess collateral. Rapid excessive movements in the market value of brokerage accounts might not be sufficiently offset by the excess collateral and losses could result. For example, we typically lend against 50% of the value of equity securities. For IBLOC, the credit decision is primarily based upon the cash value of insurance policies which may ultimately be dependent upon the insurer for repayment. Although the Bank believes that its underwriting criteria are appropriate for the various kinds of loans it makes, the Bank may incur losses on loans that meet its underwriting criteria, and these losses may exceed the amounts set aside as reserves in the Bank\u2019s allowance for loan losses. In addition, only certain SBA loans are 75% guaranteed by the U.S. government, and even for those, we still assume credit risk on the remaining 25%. These borrowers, which include new start-ups, may have a higher probability of failure which may result in higher losses on such loans. If the level of non-performing assets increases, interest income will be reduced. If we experience loan defaults in excess of amounts that we have included in our allowance for loan losses, we will have to increase the provision for loan losses which will reduce our income and might cause us to incur losses. At the time loans are classified as troubled debt restructurings, losses are recognized if the fair value of collateral is less than the loan balance. For more information about the risks which are specific to the different types of loans we make and which could impact loan losses, see Item 1,\u201d Business -Lending Activities.\u201d\n\ufeff\nAn inconsistent recovery from an extended period of weak economic and slow growth conditions in the U.S. economy have had, and may continue to have, significant adverse effects on our assets and operating results.\n\ufeff\nSince the end of the recession in 2009, the United States economy has been subject to low rates of growth in general and, in particular localities, recession-like conditions have occurred. As a result, the financial system in the United States, including credit markets and markets for real estate and real-estate related assets, have periodically been subject to weakness. These weaknesses have episodically resulted in declines in the availability of credit, reduction in the values of real estate and real estate-related assets, the reduction of markets for those assets and impairment of the ability of certain borrowers to repay their obligations. As a result of these conditions, we increased our provision for loan losses, and experienced increases in the amount of loans charged off and non-performing assets in our Philadelphia-based commercial loan portfolio which is now reflected in discontinued operations. Rated investment securities, generally considered to be less risky than loans, have in recent economic periods, in certain instances, experienced greater than expected losses, which could recur. A continuation of weak economic conditions could further harm our financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nWe are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision.\n\ufeff\nWe and our subsidiary, The Bancorp Bank, are subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision. Banking regulations are primarily intended to protect customers, depositors\u2019 funds, the federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole, not stockholders. These regulations affect the Bank\u2019s lending practices, capital structure and requirements, investment activities, dividend policy, product offerings, expansionary strategies and growth, among other things. The legal and regulatory landscape is frequently changing as Congress and the regulatory agencies having jurisdiction over our operations adopt or amend laws, or change interpretation of existing statutes, regulations or policies. These changes could affect the Company and the Bank in substantial and unpredictable ways. Additionally, while we have policies and procedures designed to prevent violations of the extensive federal and state regulations that we are subject to, there can be no assurance that such violations will not occur. Failure to comply with these statutes, regulations or policies could result in sanctions against us or the Bank by regulatory agencies, civil money penalties, criminal penalties, reputational damage, and a downgrade in the Bank\u2019s ratings for capital adequacy, asset quality, management, earnings, liquidity and market sensitivity, any of which alone or in combination could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nThe entry into the Consent Orders has imposed certain restrictions and requirements upon us and the Bank.\n\ufeff\nThe Bank entered into a Stipulation and Consent to the Issuance of a Consent Order effective August 7, 2012, which we refer to as the 2012 Consent Order. The Bank took this action without admitting or denying any charges of unsafe or unsound banking practices or violations of law or regulation. Under the 2012 Consent Order, the Bank agreed to increase its supervision of third-party relationships, develop new written compliance and related internal audit compliance programs, develop a new third-party risk management program and screen new third-party relationships as provided in the 2012 Consent Order. As part of the 2012 Consent Order, the Bank agreed to pay a civil money penalty in the amount of $172,000, which was paid in 2012. The 2012 Consent Order was amended and restated in 2015 as noted below.\n\ufeff\nOn June 5, 2014, the Bank entered into a Stipulation and Consent to the Issuance of a Consent Order with the FDIC, which we refer to as the 2014 Consent Order. The Bank took this action without admitting or denying any charges of unsafe or unsound banking practices or violations of law or regulation relating to the Bank\u2019s BSA compliance program. The 2014 Consent Order requires the Bank to take certain affirmative actions to comply with its BSA obligations. Satisfaction of the requirements of the 2014 Consent Order is subject to the review of the FDIC and the Delaware State Bank Commissioner. The Bank has and expects to continue to expend significant management and financial resources to address the Bank\u2019s BSA compliance program. Expenses associated with the required look back review were significant in 2015 and 2016. The look back review was completed in the third quarter of 2016.\n\ufeff\nThe 2014 Consent Order restricts the Bank from signing and boarding new independent sales organizations, establishing new non-benefit reloadable prepaid card programs and originating Automated Clearing House transactions for new merchant-related payments until the Bank submits to the FDIC and the Delaware State Bank Commissioner a report summarizing the completion of certain BSA-related corrective actions (\u201cBSA Report\u201d). Until the BSA Report is approved by the FDIC and Delaware State Bank Commissioner, those aspects of the growth of our card payment processing and prepaid card operations will be affected, which, unless offset by growth from existing customers and new customers in other areas of our prepaid card operations, could reduce growth of our deposits and non-interest income and, possibly, limit our ability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms. The Bank provided the FDIC and the Delaware State Bank Commissioner with the required BSA Report as of December 31, 2019 and it is under review by the regulators.\n\ufeff\nOn August 27, 2015, the Bank entered into an Amendment to Consent Order, or the 2014 Consent Order Amendment, with the FDIC, amending the 2014 Consent Order. The Bank took this action without admitting or denying any additional charges of unsafe or unsound banking practices or violations of law or regulation relating to continued weaknesses in the Bank\u2019s BSA compliance program. The 2014 Consent Order Amendment provides that the Bank shall not declare or pay any dividend without the prior written consent of the FDIC and for certain assurances regarding management.\n\ufeff\nOn May 11, 2015, the Federal Reserve issued a letter, or the Supervisory Letter, to us as a result of the 2014 Consent Order and the 2014 Consent Order Amendment (which, at the time of the Supervisory Letter, was in proposed form), which provides that we shall not pay any dividends on our common stock or make any interest payments on our trust preferred securities, without the prior written approval of the Federal Reserve. It further provides that we may not incur any debt (excluding payables in the ordinary course of business) or redeem any shares of our stock, without the prior written approval of the Federal Reserve. The requirement for such approval was lifted by the Federal Reserve in the fourth quarter of 2019, and that letter was terminated at that time.\n\ufeff\nOn December 23, 2015, the Bank entered into a Stipulation and Consent to the Issuance of an Amended Consent Order, Order for Restitution, and Order to Pay Civil Money Penalty with the FDIC, which we refer to as the 2015 Consent Order. The Bank took this action without admitting or denying any charges of violations of law or regulation. The 2015 Consent Order amended and restated in its entirety the terms of the 2012 Consent Order.\n\ufeff\nThe 2015 Consent Order was based on FDIC allegations regarding electronic fund transfer, or EFT, error resolution practices, account termination practices and fee practices of various third parties with whom the Bank had previously provided, or currently provides, deposit-related products, whom we refer to as Third Parties. The 2015 Consent Order continues the Bank's obligations originally set forth in the 2012 Consent Order, including its obligations to increase board oversight of the Bank's compliance management system, or CMS, improve the Bank's CMS, enhance its internal audit program, increase its management and oversight of Third Parties, and correct any apparent violations of law.\n\ufeff\nIn addition to restating the general terms of the 2012 Consent Order, the 2015 Consent Order directs the Bank\u2019s Board of Directors to establish a Complaint and Error Claim Oversight and Review Committee, which we refer to as the Complaint and Error Claim Committee to review and oversee the Bank\u2019s processes and practices for handling, monitoring and resolving consumer complaints and EFT error claims (whether received directly or through Third Parties) and to review management's plans for correcting any weaknesses that may be found in such processes and practices. The Bank\u2019s Board of Directors appointed the required Complaint and Error Claim Committee on January 29, 2016.\n\ufeff\nThe 2015 Consent Order also requires the Bank to implement a corrective action plan, or CAP, to remediate and provide restitution to those prepaid cardholders who asserted or attempted to assert, or were discouraged from initiating EFT error claims, and to provide restitution to cardholders harmed by EFT error resolution practices. The 2015 Consent Order requires that if, through the CAP, the Bank identifies prepaid cardholders who have been adversely affected by a denial or failure to resolve an EFT error claim, the Bank will ensure that monetary restitution is made. The Bank completed its implementation of the CAP on January 15, 2020. As of the completion date, $1,592,469.20 of restitution was paid to consumers of which $4,352.61 was paid by the Bank and the remaining amount by Third Parties.\n\ufeff\nThe 2015 Consent Order also imposed a $3 million civil money penalty on the Bank, which the Bank has paid and which was recognized as expense in the fourth quarter of 2015.\n\ufeff\nOn March 7, 2018, the Bank entered into a Stipulation and Consent to Order for Restitution and Order To Pay Civil Money Penalty with the FDIC, which we refer to as the 2018 Restitution Order and 2018 CMP Order, respectively. The Bank took this action without admitting or denying any alleged violations of law or regulation. The FDIC\u2019s action principally emanated from one of the Bank\u2019s third-party payment processors (\u201cThird-Party Processor\u201d) that suffered an internal system programming glitch. This inadvertently resulted in consumers that engaged in signature-based point of sale transactions during the period from December 2010 to November 2014 being charged a greater fee than what was disclosed by the Bank. The FDIC alleged the Bank\u2019s incorrect fee imposition due to the Third-Party Processor error was an unfair or deceptive act or practice and violated Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act. The 2018 CMP Order imposed a $2 million civil money penalty on the Bank which the Bank has paid, and was recognized as expense on September 30, 2017. The civil money penalty was not subject to any indemnification or recovery from any third party.\n\ufeff\nThe 2018 Restitution Order required the Bank to develop a written Restitution Plan, subject to independent audit and FDIC non-objection, to ensure impacted consumers are compensated for any incorrectly charged fees. The 2018 Restitution Order required\nthe Bank to make such reimbursements if not otherwise made by the Third-Party Processor and the Bank is indemnified by the Third-Party Processor for such reimbursements. Impacted consumers were reimbursed by the Third-Party Processor at its own expense. On December 19, 2019, the FDIC concluded the Bank had fully complied with the 2018 Restitution Order and issued an order terminating the 2018 Restitution Order.\n\ufeff\nOn December 18, 2019, the Bank\u2019s Board of Directors, without admitting or denying any violations of law, regulation or the provisions of the 2014 Consent Order, executed a Stipulation and Consent to the Issuance of an Order to Pay Civil Money Penalty in the amount of $7.5 million based on supervisory findings during the period of 2013 to 2019 related principally to deficiencies in the Bank\u2019s legacy Bank Secrecy Act/Anti-Money Laundering (BSA/AML) Programs and alleged violations of law during the period, as well as the length of time the Bank has taken to fully implement the corrective actions required by the 2014 Consent Order. The Bank paid this amount, and it was recognized as an expense in the Company\u2019s financial statements in the fourth quarter of 2019.\n\ufeff\nWe cannot assure you that our regulators will ultimately determine that we have met all of the requirements of the 2014 Consent Order, the 2014 Consent Order Amendment, and the 2015 Consent Order, collectively, the Consent Orders, to their satisfaction. If our regulators believe that we have not made sufficient progress in complying with these Consent Orders, they could seek to impose additional regulatory requirements, operational restrictions, enhanced supervision and/or civil money penalties. If any of these measures is imposed in the future, it could reduce our earnings, result in our incurring losses or otherwise materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations and reduce or eliminate our ability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms. Further, we are at risk of the imposition of additional civil money penalties by our regulators, based on, among other things, apparent violations of law, repeat violations, or supervisory determinations of non-compliance with any consent order. Depending on the circumstances, the imposition and size of any such penalty is at the discretion of the regulator. While the Bank is contractually indemnified for related losses, civil money penalties, if assessed against the Bank, are not recoverable from third parties.\n\ufeff\nOur reputation and business could be damaged by our entry into the Consent Orders and any future enforcement matters with our regulators and other negative publicity.\n\ufeff\nReputational risk, or the risk to our business, earnings and capital from negative publicity, is inherent in our business. Negative publicity can result from actual or alleged conduct in a number of areas, including legal and regulatory compliance, lending practices, corporate governance, litigation, inadequate protection of customer data, ethical behavior of our employees, and from actions taken by regulators and others as a result of that conduct. Damage to our reputation, including as a result of negative publicity associated with the Consent Orders, or future regulatory enforcement actions, could impact our ability to attract new and maintain existing loan and deposit customers, employees and business relationships, and could result in the imposition of additional regulatory requirements, operational restrictions, enhanced supervision and/or civil money penalties. Such damage could also adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms.\n\ufeff\nThe provisions contained in the Consent Orders present interpretive challenges that may give rise to a difference of interpretation by us and our regulators.\n\ufeff\nThe provisions of the Consent Orders are subject to interpretation and may give rise to differing views between us and our regulators with respect to their scope and application. Accordingly, management, employees at all levels, and legal counsel of the Bank face significant challenges in applying the terms of the Consent Orders to the myriad factual scenarios that arise in the ordinary course of business. While we have sought, and will continue to seek, guidance from our regulators as to the application of the Consent Orders on our business, there can be no assurance that our regulators will provide such guidance or that we and our regulators will interpret the terms of the Consent Orders uniformly in every instance.\n\ufeff\nIf the regulators interpret the Consent Orders in a manner contrary to our interpretation despite our good faith efforts to comply, including the time required to comply, the FDIC may conclude a violation has occurred, which may result in the imposition of additional regulatory requirements, operational restrictions, enhanced supervision and/or civil money penalties.\n\ufeff\nWe may have difficulty managing our growth which may divert resources and limit our ability to expand our operations successfully.\n\ufeff\nOur future profitability will depend in part on our continued ability to grow; however, we may not be able to sustain our historical growth rate or be able to grow. Our future success will depend on the ability of our officers and key employees to continue to implement and improve our operational, financial and management controls, reporting systems and procedures and manage a growing number of customer relationships. We may not implement improvements to our management information and control\nsystems in an efficient or timely manner and may discover deficiencies in existing systems and controls. Consequently, any future growth may place a strain on our administrative and operational infrastructure. Any such strain could increase our costs, reduce or eliminate our profitability and reduce the price at which our common shares trade.\n\ufeff\nNew lines of business, and new products and services may result in exposure to new risks and the value and earnings related to existing lines of business are subject to market conditions.\n\ufeff\nThe Bank has introduced, and in the future, may introduce new products and services to differing markets either alone or in conjunction with third parties. New lines of business, products or services could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of our system of internal controls or the controls of third parties and could reduce our revenues and potentially generate losses. There are material inherent risks and uncertainties associated with offering new products and services, especially when new markets are not fully developed or when the laws and regulations regarding a new product are not mature. New products and services, or entrance into new markets, may require substantial time, resources and capital, and profitability targets may not be achieved. Factors outside of our control, such as developing laws and regulations, regulatory orders, competitive product offerings and changes in commercial and consumer demand for products or services may also materially impact the successful launch and implementation of new products or services. Failure to manage these risks, or failure of any product or service offerings to be successful and profitable, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, there are uncertainties regarding the market values of existing lines of business which are difficult to measure and are subject to market conditions which may change significantly. We originate significant amounts of loans for sale or securitization in the CMBS markets which are subject to changes in market conditions at the time of sale, and the sales price realized may accordingly change significantly. Should planned sales of loans not take place, credit risks would increase, as loans would be held on the balance sheet as interest earning assets for longer periods. These loans are accounted for at market value, and a decrease in such value would reduce income and might also impact potential sales, and resulting gains on sale. These loans were underwritten as if they would be held on the balance sheet, to address the possibility of market disruptions delaying or precluding sales. Holding the loans on balance sheet would result in additional interest income, but might impact the level of new originations and future potential gain on sale.\n\ufeff\nChanges in interest rates and loan production could reduce our income, cash flows and asset values.\n\ufeff\nA significant portion of our income and cash flows depends on the difference between the interest rates we earn on interest earning assets, such as loans and investment securities, and the interest rates we pay on interest bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowings. The value of our assets, and particularly loans with fixed or capped rates of interest, may also vary with interest rate changes. We discuss the effects of interest rate changes on the market value of our portfolio and net interest income in \u201cManagement\u2019s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Asset and Liability Management.\u201d Interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors which are beyond our control, including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and, in particular, the Federal Reserve. Changes in monetary policy, including changes in interest rates, will influence not only the interest we receive on our loans and investment securities and the amount of interest we pay on deposits, but also our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits and our costs in doing so. If the rate of interest we pay on our deposits and other borrowings increases more than the rate of interest we earn on our loans and other investments, our net interest income, and therefore our earnings, could decline or we could sustain losses. Our earnings could also decline or we could sustain losses if the rates on our loans and other investments fall more quickly than those on our deposits and other borrowings. While the Bank is generally asset sensitive, which implies that significant increases in market rates would generally increase margins, while decreases in interest rates would generally decrease margins, we cannot assure you that increases or decreases in margins will follow such a pattern in the future. Our net interest income is also determined by our level of loan production to replace loan payoffs and to grow our different loan portfolios. In the case of loans held-for-sale into secondary markets or securitizations, loans must be originated to replace loans sold to maintain related net interest income. Loan demand may vary for economic and competitive reasons and we cannot assure you that historical rates of loan growth will continue or as to other loan production. Net interest income is difficult to project, and our models for making such projections are theoretical. While they may indicate the general direction of changes in net interest income, they do no indicate actual future results. In March 2020, the Federal Reserve instituted an emergency rate cut of 50 basis points, and additional rate cuts may still occur in response to economic and other conditions. These decreases will decrease net interest income, to the extent the reduction is not offset with the impact of loan growth.\n\ufeff\nWe are subject to lending risks.\n\ufeff\nThere are risks inherent in making all loans. These risks include interest rate changes over the time period in which loans may be repaid and changes in the national economy or local economies in which our borrowers operate. Such changes may impact the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans or the value of the collateral securing those loans. Although we have discontinued our Philadelphia-based commercial lending operations, we still hold a significant number of commercial, construction and commercial mortgage loans, some with relatively large balances. The deterioration of one or a few of these loans would cause a significant increase in non-performing loans, notwithstanding that such loans are now held-for-sale. Weak economic conditions have caused increases in our delinquent and defaulted loans in recent years. We cannot assure you that we will not experience further increases in delinquencies and defaults or that any such increases will not be material. On a consolidated basis, an increase in non-performing loans could result in an increase in our provision for loan losses or in loan charge-offs and consequent reductions in our earnings. Our specialty lending operations are subject to additional risks including, with respect to our SBA loans, the risk that the U.S. Government\u2019s partial guaranty on SBA loans is withdrawn due to noncompliance with regulations. For more information about the risks which are specific to the different types of loans we make and which could impact our allowance for loan losses, see Item 1,\u201d Business -Lending Activities.\u201d\n\ufeff\nThere is a significant concentration in prepaid and debit card fee income which is subject to various risks.\n\ufeff\nWe realize a significant portion of our revenues from prepaid and debit card and other prepaid products and services. Actions by government agencies relating to service charges, or increased regulatory compliance costs, could result in reductions in income which may not be offset by reductions in expense. Some of our clients have significant volume, the loss of which would materially affect our revenues. The top ten largest contributors to prepaid, debit card and related fees account for 63% of such fees. Prepaid and debit card deposits comprise a significant portion of the Bank\u2019s deposits.\n\ufeff\nRegulatory and legal requirements applicable to the prepaid and debit card industry are unique and frequently changing.\n\ufeff\nAchieving and maintaining compliance with frequently changing legal and regulatory requirements requires a significant investment in qualified personnel, hardware, software and other technology platforms, external legal counsel and consultants and other infrastructure components. These investments may not ensure compliance or otherwise mitigate risks involved in this business. Our failure to satisfy regulatory mandates applicable to prepaid financial products could result in actions against us by our regulators, legal proceedings being instituted against us by consumers, or other losses, each of which could reduce our earnings or result in losses, make it more difficult to conduct our operations, or prohibit us from conducting specific operations. Other risks related to prepaid cards include competition for prepaid, debit and other payment mediums, possible changes in the rules of networks, such as Visa and MasterCard and others, in which the Bank operates and state regulations related to prepaid cards including escheatment.\n\ufeff\nThe potential for fraud in the card payment industry is significant.\n\ufeff\nIssuers of prepaid and debit cards and other companies have suffered significant losses in recent years with respect to the theft of cardholder data that has been illegally exploited for personal gain. The theft of such information is regularly reported and affects individuals and businesses. Losses from various types of fraud have been substantial for certain card industry participants. The Bank in many cases has indemnification agreements with third parties; however, such indemnifications may not fully cover losses. Although fraud has not had a material impact on the profitability of the Bank, it is possible that such activity could impact the Bank in the future.\n\ufeff\nRisk management processes and strategies must be effective, and concentration of risk increases the potential for losses.\n\ufeff\nOur risk management processes and strategies must be effective, otherwise losses may result. We manage asset quality, liquidity, market sensitivity, operational, regulatory, third-party vendor and partner relationship risks and other risks through various processes and strategies throughout the organization. If our risk management judgments and strategies are not effective, or unanticipated risks arise, our income could be reduced or we could sustain losses.\n\ufeff\nWe may depend in part upon wholesale and brokered certificates of deposit to satisfy funding needs.\n\ufeff\nWe may rely in part on funds provided by wholesale deposits and brokered certificates of deposit to support the growth of our loan portfolio. Wholesale and brokered certificates of deposit are highly sensitive to changes in interest rates and, accordingly, can be a more volatile source of funding. Use of wholesale and brokered deposits involves the risk that growth supported by such\ndeposits would be halted, or the Bank\u2019s total assets could contract, if the rates offered by the Bank were less than those offered by other institutions seeking such deposits, or if the depositors were to perceive a decline in the Bank\u2019s safety and soundness, or both. In addition, if we were unable to match the maturities of the interest rates we pay for wholesale and brokered certificates of deposit to the maturities of the loans we make using those funds, increases in the interest rates we pay for such funds could decrease our consolidated net interest income. Moreover, if the Bank ceases to be categorized as \u201cwell capitalized\u201d under banking regulations, it will be prohibited from accepting, renewing or rolling over brokered deposits without the consent of the FDIC.\n\ufeff\nOur prepaid and debit card and other deposit accounts obtained with the assistance of third parties have been classified as brokered.\n\ufeff\nIn December 2014, the FDIC issued new guidance classifying prepaid deposit accounts and other deposit accounts obtained in cooperation with third parties as brokered, resulting in the vast majority of the Bank\u2019s deposits being classified as brokered. We do not believe that these deposits are subject to the volatility risks associated with brokered wholesale deposits or brokered certificates of deposit. However, if the Bank ceases to be categorized as \u201cwell capitalized\u201d under banking regulations, it will be prohibited from accepting, renewing or rolling over brokered deposits without the consent of the FDIC. In such a case, the FDIC\u2019s refusal to grant consent to our accepting, renewing or rolling over brokered deposits could effectively restrict or eliminate the ability of the Bank to operate its business lines as presently conducted.\n\ufeff\nWe operate in highly competitive markets.\n\ufeff\nWe face substantial competition in all phases of our operations from a variety of different competitors, including commercial banks and their holding companies, credit unions, leasing companies, consumer finance companies, factoring companies, insurance companies and money market mutual funds and card issuers. In 2018, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency announced that it would begin to accept and evaluate charters for entities that wanted to conduct certain components of a banking business pursuant to a federal charter, known as a \"special purpose national bank\" (\"SPNB\") charter. Intended to promote economic opportunity and spur financial innovation, SPNBs may engage in any of the following activities: paying checks, lending money or taking deposits. If any such applications are granted, recipients of an SPNB charter may enter the U.S. payments market in which the Bank operates, which could have a material adverse effect on the Bank and its Payments division.\nWe face national and even global competition with respect to our other products and services, including payment acceptance products and services, private label banking, fleet leasing, government guaranteed lending and payment solutions. Our commercial partners and banking customers for these products and services are located throughout the United States, and the competition is strong in each category. We encounter competition from some of the largest financial institutions in the world as well as smaller specialized regional banks and financial service companies. Increased competition with any of these product or service offerings could result in reduced pricing and lower profit margins, fragmented market share and a failure to enjoy economies of scale, loss of customer and depositor base, and other risks that individually, or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nSome of the financial services organizations with which we compete are not subject to the same degree of regulation as federally-insured and regulated financial institutions such as ours. As a result, those competitors may be able to access funding and provide various services more easily or at less cost than we can.\nWe derive a significant percentage of our deposits, total assets and income from deposit accounts generated with the assistance of diverse independent companies, including those which provide card account marketing services, and investment advisory firms.\n\ufeff\nDeposit accounts acquired with the assistance of our top twenty affinity relationships totaled $4.21 billion at December 31, 2019. The top twenty relationships result in the majority of our payments related income. We provide oversight over these relationships which must meet all internal and regulatory requirements. We may exit relationships where such requirements are not met or be required by our regulators to exit such relationships. Also, an affinity group could terminate a relationship with us for many reasons, including being able to obtain better terms from another provider or dissatisfaction with the level or quality of our services. If an affinity group relationship were to be terminated, it could materially reduce our deposits, assets and income. We cannot assure you that we could replace such relationship. If we cannot replace such relationship, we may be required to seek higher rate funding sources as compared to the exiting affinity group and interest expense might increase. We may also be required to sell securities or other assets to meet funding needs which would reduce revenues or potentially generate losses.\nOur affinity group marketing strategy has been adopted by other institutions with which we compete.\nSeveral online banking operations as well as the online banking programs of conventional banks have instituted affinity group marketing strategies similar to ours. As a consequence, we have encountered competition in this area and anticipate that we will continue to do so in the future. This competition may increase our costs, reduce our revenues or revenue growth or, because we are a relatively small banking operation without the name recognition of other, more established banking operations, make it difficult for us to compete effectively in obtaining affinity group relationships.\nOur lending limit may adversely affect our competitiveness.\nOur regulatory lending limit as of December 31, 2019 to any one customer or related group of customers was $71.7 million for unsecured loans and $119.5 million for secured loans. Our lending limit is substantially smaller than that of many financial institutions with which we compete. While we believe that our lending limit is sufficient for our targeted market of small to mid-size businesses within the four specialty lending operations upon which we focus as well as affinity group members, it may in the future affect our ability to attract or maintain customers or to compete with other financial institutions. Moreover, to the extent that we incur losses and do not obtain additional capital, our lending limit, which depends upon the amount of our capital, will decrease.\nEnvironmental liability associated with lending activities could result in losses.\nIn the course of our business, we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing our loans. If hazardous substances were discovered on any of these properties, we may be liable to governmental entities or third parties for the costs of remediation of the hazard, as well as for personal injury and property damage. Many environmental laws can impose liability regardless of whether we knew of, or were responsible for, the contamination. In addition, if we arrange for the disposal of hazardous or toxic substances at another site, we may be liable for the costs of cleaning up and removing those substances from the site, even if we neither own nor operate the disposal site. Environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses and may materially limit use of properties we acquire through foreclosure, reduce their value or limit our ability to sell them in the event of a default on the loans they secure. In addition, future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability.\nAs a financial institution whose principal medium for delivery of banking services is the internet, we are subject to risks particular to that medium and other technological risks and costs.\nWe utilize the internet and other automated electronic processing in our banking services without physical locations, as distinguished from the internet banking service of an established conventional bank. Independent internet banks often have found it difficult to achieve profitability and revenue growth. Several factors contribute to the unique problems that internet banks face. These include concerns for the security of personal information, the absence of personal relationships between bankers and customers, the absence of loyalty to a conventional hometown bank, the customer\u2019s difficulty in understanding and assessing the substance and financial strength of an Internet bank, a lack of confidence in the likelihood of success and permanence of internet banks and many individuals\u2019 unwillingness to trust their personal assets to a relatively new technological medium such as the internet. As a result, many potential customers may be unwilling to establish a relationship with us.\nMany conventional financial institutions offer the option of internet banking and financial services to their existing and prospective customers. The public may perceive conventional financial institutions as being safer, more responsive, more comfortable to deal with and more accountable as providers of their banking and financial services, including their internet banking services. We may not be able to offer internet banking and financial services and personal relationship characteristics that have sufficient advantages over the internet banking and financial services and other characteristics of established conventional financial institutions to enable us to compete successfully.\nMoreover, both the internet and the financial services industry are undergoing rapid technological changes, with frequent introductions of new technology-driven products and services. In addition to improving the ability to serve customers, the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to reduce costs. Our ability to compete will depend, in part, upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands, as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations. Many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to\ninvest in technological improvements. We may not be able to effectively implement new technology-driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers. Such products may also prove costly to develop or acquire.\nWe face fund transfer and payments-related reputational risks.\nFinancial institutions, including ourselves, bear fund transfer risks of different types which result from large transaction volumes and large dollar amounts of incoming and outgoing money transfers. Loss exposure may result if money is transferred from the bank before it is received, or legal rights to reclaim monies transferred are asserted. Such exposure results from payments which are made to merchants for payment clearing, while customers have statutory periods to reverse their payments. It also results from funds transfers made prior to receipt of offsetting funds, as accommodations to customers. Transfers could also be made in error. Additionally, as with other financial institutions, we may incur legal liability or reputational risk, if we unknowingly process payments for companies in violation of money laundering laws or regulations or immoral activities.\nOur operations may be interrupted if our network or computer systems, or those of our providers, fail.\nBecause we deliver our products and services over the internet and outsource several critical functions to third parties, our operations depend on our ability, as well as that of our service providers, to protect computer systems and network infrastructure against interruptions in service due to damage from fire, power loss, telecommunications failure, physical break-ins and computer hacking or similar catastrophic events. Our operations also depend upon our ability to replace a third-party provider if it experiences difficulties that interrupt our operations or if an operationally essential third-party service terminates. Service interruptions to customers may adversely affect our ability to obtain or retain customers and could result in regulatory sanctions. Moreover, if a customer were unable to access his or her account or complete a financial transaction due to a service interruption, we could be subject to a claim by the customer for his or her loss. While our accounts and other agreements contain disclaimers of liability for these kinds of losses, we cannot predict the outcome of litigation if a customer were to make a claim against us.\nA failure of cyber security may result in a loss of customers and our being liable for damages for such failure.\nA significant barrier to online and other financial transactions is the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks and other mediums. The systems we use rely on encryption and authentication technology to provide secure transmission of confidential information. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the algorithms used to protect customer transaction data. If we, or another provider of financial services through the internet, were to suffer damage from a security breach, public acceptance and use of the internet as a medium for financial transactions could suffer. Any security breach could deter potential customers or cause existing customers to leave, thereby impairing our ability to grow and maintain profitability and, possibly, our ability to continue delivering our products and services through the internet. We could also be liable for any customer damages arising from such a breach. Other cyber threats involving theft of confidential information could also result in liability. Although we, with the help of third-party service providers, intend to continue to implement security technology and establish operational procedures to prevent security breaches, these measures may not be successful.\nWe outsource many essential services to third-party providers who may terminate their agreements with us, resulting in interruptions to our banking operations.\nWe obtain essential technological and customer services support for the systems we use from third-party providers. We outsource our check processing, check imaging, transaction processing, electronic bill payment, statement rendering, and other services to third-party vendors. For a description of these services, see Item 1, \u201cBusiness-Other Operations-Third-Party Service Providers.\u201d Our agreements with each service provider are generally cancelable without cause by either party upon specified notice periods. If one of our third-party service providers terminates its agreement with us and we are unable to replace it with another service provider, our operations may be interrupted. Even a temporary disruption in services could result in our losing customers, incurring liability for any damages our customers may sustain, or losing revenues. Moreover, there can be no assurance that a replacement service provider will provide its services at the same or a lower cost than the service provider it replaces.\nWe may be affected by government regulation including those mandating capital levels and those specifying limitations resulting from Community Reinvestment Act ratings.\nWe are subject to extensive federal and state banking regulation and supervision, which has increased in the past several years as a result of stresses the financial system has undergone for an extended period of years. The regulations are intended primarily to protect our depositors\u2019 funds, the federal deposit insurance fund and the safety and soundness of the Bank, not our stockholders. Regulatory requirements affect lending practices, product offerings, capital structure, investment practices, dividend policy and growth. Under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action, we and the Bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of their assets, liabilities and certain off-balance-sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices. The capital amounts and classification of us and the Bank are also subject to qualitative judgments by the regulators about components, risk weightings and other factors. Moreover, capital requirements may be modified based upon regulatory rules or by regulatory discretion at any time reflecting a variety of factors including deterioration in asset quality. A failure by either the Bank or us to meet regulatory capital requirements will result in the imposition of limitations on our operations and could, if capital levels drop significantly, result in our being required to cease operations. Regulatory capital requirements must also be satisfied such that mandated capital ratios are maintained as the Bank grows, or growth may be required to be curtailed. Moreover, a failure by either the Bank or us to comply with regulatory requirements regarding lending practices, investment practices, customer relationships, anti-money laundering detection and prevention, and other operational practices (see \"Business--Regulation Under Banking Law\" and \u201cRisk Factors- The entry into the Consent Orders and a supervisory letter from the Federal Reserve, have imposed certain restrictions and requirements upon us and the Bank\u201d) could result in regulatory sanctions and possibly third-party liabilities. Changes in governing law, regulations or regulatory practices could impose additional costs on us or impair our ability to obtain deposits or make loans and, as a consequence, negatively impact our consolidated revenues and profitability.\nAs a Delaware-chartered bank whose depositors and financial services customers are located in several states, the Bank may be subject to additional licensure requirements or other regulation of its activities by state regulatory authorities and laws outside of Delaware. If the Bank\u2019s compliance with licensure requirements or other regulation becomes overly burdensome, we may seek to convert its state charter to a federal charter in order to gain the benefits of federal preemption of some of those laws and regulations. Conversion of the Bank to a federal charter will require the prior approval of the relevant federal bank regulatory authorities, which we may not be able to obtain. Moreover, even if we obtain approval, there could be a significant period of time between our application and receipt of the approval, and/or any approval we do obtain may be subject to burdensome conditions or restrictions.\nFailure to maintain a satisfactory CRA rating may result in business restrictions. The Bank operates its CRA program under an FDIC-approved CRA Strategic Plan. The Bank operated an approved plan during the period of July 1, 2018 through December 31, 2019 and now operates under an approved plan for the period of January 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020. On July 3, 2019, the Bank received its 2018 CRA Performance Evaluation which was completed on November 11, 2018. The Bank was assigned a \u201cSatisfactory\u201d CRA rating. The Bank continues to closely monitor its performance in alignment with its CRA Strategic Plan to meet the specified lending, service and investment requirements contained therein. There can be no assurance that we will maintain a satisfactory rating, and if not maintained, the Bank would be subject to certain business restrictions as required by the Community Reinvestment Act and FDIC regulations.\n\ufeff\nImplemented, proposed and future regulatory and legislative financial reforms may result in new laws and regulations that we expect will increase our compliance burdens and operating costs.\n\ufeff\nThe passage of new laws and the adoption of new rules and regulations cannot be fully or accurately predicted. Any such proposed laws and regulations may limit our operations, require higher levels of capital and liquidity, create additional compliance burdens, or otherwise impact our operations. The passage of the Dodd-Frank Act in 2010, and the rules and regulations emanating therefrom, have significantly changed, and will continue to change the bank regulatory structure, and affect the lending, deposit, investment, trading and operating activities of financial institutions and their holding companies. The Dodd-Frank Act requires various federal agencies to adopt a broad range of new implementing rules and regulations, and to prepare numerous studies and reports for Congress. While a significant number of regulations have already been promulgated to implement the Dodd-Frank Act, many of the details and much of the impact of the Dodd-Frank Act may not be known for lengthy periods, which could have a material adverse effect on the financial services industry, generally, and our company in particular.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act\u2019s \u201cDurbin Amendment,\u201d which applies to all banks, required the Federal Reserve to adopt a rule establishing debit card interchange fee standards and limits and prohibiting network exclusivity and routing requirements. The Dodd-\nFrank Act exempts from the debit card interchange fee standards any issuing bank that, together with its affiliates, have assets of less than $10 billion. Because of our asset size, we are exempt from the debit card interchange fee standards but may lose the exemption if it is amended or we, together with our subsidiaries, surpass $10 billion in assets.\nThe Federal Reserve has implemented routing regulatory requirements to prohibit network exclusivity arrangements on debit card transactions and ensure merchants will have choices in debit card routing, which apply to us. The regulations require issuers to make at least two unaffiliated networks available to the merchant, without regard to the method of authentication (PIN or signature), for both debit cards and prepaid cards. As currently applied, a card issuer can guarantee compliance with the network exclusivity regulations by enabling the debit card to process transactions through one signature network and one unaffiliated PIN network. Cards usable only with PINs must be enabled with two unaffiliated PIN networks.\nOn March 21, 2014, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld the Federal Reserve\u2019s rules on network exclusivity and interchange fees as written and thereby rejected a challenge brought by a group of merchant trade associations. On January 21, 2015, the Supreme Court of the United States declined to take an appeal filed by the plaintiff merchant trade associations, effectively ending the litigation and upholding the Federal Reserve\u2019s final rules regarding network exclusivity and interchange fees as written.\n\ufeff\nIt is difficult to predict at this time what specific impact many aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act and the yet to be written implementing rules and regulations will have on regional banks. The Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act of 2018 scaled back portions of the Dodd-Frank Act, and the current administration in the United States may ultimately roll back or modify certain of the regulations adopted since the financial crisis. However, future changes in bank regulation are uncertain and could negatively impact our business and could increase our operating and compliance costs and obligations, which could reduce or eliminate our ability to generate profits.\n\ufeff\nThe CFPB\u2019s Final Prepaid Rule went into effect on April 1, 2019. The Final Prepaid Rule represents a material change in the rules and regulations governing prepaid cards. We rely on prepaid cards as the largest single component of our deposits and the largest single component of our non-interest income. We cannot reasonably quantify the financial impact, if any, that implementation of the Final Prepaid Rule may have on the Bank\u2019s business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nA further downgrade of the U.S. government credit rating could negatively impact our investment portfolio and other operations.\nA significant amount of our investment portfolio is rated by outside ratings agencies as explicitly or implicitly backed by the United States government. In 2011, the credit rating of the United States government was lowered, and it is possible it may be downgraded further, based upon rating agencies\u2019 evaluations of the effect of increasing levels of government debt and related Congressional actions. A lowering of the United States government credit ratings may reduce the market value or liquidity of our investment portfolio.\nPotential acquisitions may disrupt our business and dilute stockholder value.\n\ufeff\nAcquiring other banks or businesses involves various risks including, but not limited to:\n\ufeff\n\u00b7\npotential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the target entity;\n\u00b7\nexposure to potential asset quality issues of the target entity;\n\u00b7\ndifficulty and expense of integrating the operations and personnel of the target entity;\n\u00b7\npotential disruption to our business;\n\u00b7\npotential diversion of our management\u2019s time and attention;\n\u00b7\nthe possible loss of key employees and customers of the target entity;\n\u00b7\ndifficulty in estimating the value of the target entity;\n\u00b7\npotential changes in banking or tax laws or regulations that may affect the target entity; and\n\u00b7\ndifficulty navigating and integrating legal, operating cultural differences between the United States and the countries of the target entity\u2019s operations.\n\ufeff\nFrom time to time we evaluate merger and acquisition opportunities and conduct due diligence activities related to possible transactions with other financial institutions and financial services companies. As a result, merger or acquisition discussions and, in some cases, negotiations may take place and future mergers or acquisitions involving cash, debt or equity securities may occur at any time. Acquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and market values, and, therefore, some dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share may occur in connection with any future transaction. Furthermore, failure to realize the expected revenue increases, cost savings, increases in geographic or product presence, and/or other projected benefits from an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. The Consent Orders likely constrain us from making acquisitions.\n\ufeff\nWe may be subject to potential liability and business risk from actions by our regulators related to supervision of third parties.\n\ufeff\nOur regulators or auditors may require us to increase the level and manner of our oversight of the third parties which provide marketing services which generate most of our accounts and through which we offer products and services. Although we have added significant compliance staff and have used outside consultants, our internal and external compliance examiners must be satisfied with the results of such augmentation and enhancement. We cannot assure you that we will satisfy all related requirements. See \u201cRisk Factors The entry into the Consent Orders and a supervisory letter from the Federal Reserve, have imposed certain restrictions and requirements upon us and the Bank\u201d. Not achieving a compliance management system which is deemed adequate could result in sanctions against the Bank. Our ongoing review and analysis of our compliance management system and implementation of any changes resulting from that review and analysis will likely result in increased non-interest expense.\n\ufeff\nThe Bank may be subject to civil money penalties in connection with examination findings.\nLike all regulated banking institutions, we are at risk of the imposition of civil money penalties by our regulators, based on, among other things, apparent violations of law, repeat violations, or supervisory determinations of non-compliance with any consent order. Depending on the circumstances, the imposition and size of any such penalty is at the discretion of the regulator. While the Bank is contractually indemnified for related losses, civil money penalties, if assessed against the Bank, are not recoverable from third parties.\n\ufeff\nWe are subject to tax audits, and challenges to our tax positions or adverse changes or interpretations of tax laws could result in tax liability.\n\ufeff\nWe are subject to federal and applicable state income tax laws and regulations and related audits. We are also periodically subject to state escheat audits. Income tax and escheat laws and regulations are often complex and require significant judgment in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions. Challenges of such determinations may adversely affect our effective tax rate, tax payments or financial condition.\n\ufeff\nRecently enacted U.S. tax legislation made significant changes to federal tax law, including the taxation of corporations, by, among other changes, reducing the corporate income tax rate, disallowing certain deductions that had previously been allowed, and altering the expensing of capital expenditures. The implementation and evaluation of these changes may require significant judgment and substantial planning on our behalf. These judgments and plans may require us to take new and different tax positions that if challenged could adversely affect our effective tax rate, tax payments or financial condition.\nIn addition, the new tax legislation remains subject to potential amendments, technical corrections, and further regulatory guidance and interpretation, any of which could lessen or increase certain adverse impacts on us. Furthermore, as the new tax legislation goes into effect, future changes may occur at the federal or state level that could result in unfavorable adjustments to our tax liability.\n\ufeff\nThe appraised fair value of the assets from our discontinued commercial loan operations may be more than the amounts received upon sale or other disposition.\n\ufeff\nVarious internal and external inputs were utilized to analyze fair value of the discontinued commercial loan portfolio and the investment in unconsolidated entity which reflects the financing of the securitization of a portion of the discontinued assets. The valuations are estimates and actual sales prices could be significantly less than the estimates, which could materially affect our results of operations in future quarters.\n\ufeff\nWe cannot predict whether income resulting from the reinvestment of proceeds from the loans we hold will match or exceed the income from loan dispositions.\n\ufeff\nWe are seeking to sell or otherwise dispose of the loans in our discontinued commercial loan operations and expect that we will obtain a significant amount of cash from these dispositions. Although we believe, based upon current market conditions, that we will be able to invest such proceeds profitably, reinvestment income is difficult to predict and depends upon a number of economic and market conditions beyond our control, including interest rates and the availability of suitable investments. We cannot assure you that we will be able to generate the same level of income from the reinvested proceeds as we generated from the loan portfolio being sold, or that suitable investments will be available to us. If not, our revenues and net income could be reduced materially.\n\ufeff\nAny future FDIC insurance premium increases will adversely affect our earnings.\nAny further assessments or special assessments that the FDIC levies will be recorded as an expense during the appropriate period and will decrease our earnings. On February 9, 2011, the FDIC adopted a final rule which redefines the deposit insurance assessment base as required by the Dodd-Frank Act. The final rule sets the deposit insurance assessment base as average consolidated total assets minus average tangible equity. It also sets a new assessment rate schedule which reflects assessment rate adjustments based upon regulatory examination classification with increased rates for brokered deposits. The final rule became effective on April 1, 2011. If the Bank\u2019s rating is changed, insurance premiums will increase which will adversely affect our earnings.\n\ufeff\nWe have had material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting in the past and cannot assure you that additional material weaknesses will not be identified in the future. Our failure to implement and maintain effective internal control over financial reporting could result in material misstatements in our financial statements which could require us to restate financial statements, cause investors to lose confidence in our reported financial information and have a negative effect on our stock price.\n\ufeff\nAs previously reported, our management had identified material weaknesses in our internal and disclosure controls over financial reporting that resulted in a restatement of our financial statements in 2014 for that year and for prior periods. These weaknesses related to the timing of the recognition of loan losses and the recognition of other loan losses. We believe these weaknesses have been remediated. However, we cannot assure you that additional significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting will not be identified in the future. Any failure to maintain or implement required new or improved controls, or any difficulties we encounter in their implementation, could result in additional material weaknesses, cause us to fail to meet our periodic reporting obligations or result in material misstatements in our financial statements. Any such failure could also adversely affect the results of periodic management evaluations and annual auditor attestation reports regarding the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules promulgated under Section 404. The existence of a material weakness could result in errors in our financial statements that could result in a restatement of financial statements, cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations and cause investors or customers to lose confidence in our reported financial information, leading to a decline in our stock price or a loss of business, and could result in stockholder actions against us for damages.\n\ufeff\nUnclaimed funds from deposit accounts or represented by unused value on prepaid cards present compliance and other risks.\n\ufeff\nUnclaimed funds held in deposit accounts or represented by unused balances on prepaid cards may be subject to state escheatment laws where the Bank is the actual holder of the funds and when, after a period of time as set forth in applicable state law, the rightful owner of the funds cannot be readily located and/or identified. The Bank implements controls to comply with state unclaimed property laws and regulations, however these laws and regulations are often open to interpretation, particularly when being applied to unused balances on prepaid card products. State regulators may choose to initiate collection or other litigation action against the Bank for unreported abandoned property, and such actions may seek to assess fines and penalties.\n\ufeff\n\ufeff\nA prolonged U.S. government shutdown or default by the U.S. on government obligations could harm our results of operations.\n\ufeff\nOur results of operations, including revenue, non-interest income, expenses and net interest income, could be adversely affected in the event of widespread financial and business disruption due to a default by the United States on U.S. government obligations or a prolonged failure to maintain significant U.S. government operations, particularly those pertaining to the SBA. Any such failure to maintain such U.S. government operations would impede our ability to originate SBA loans and our ability to sell such loans.\n\ufeff\nSevere weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism or other adverse external events could harm the Company's business.\n\ufeff\nSevere weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on our ability to conduct business. The nature and level of severe weather and/or natural disasters cannot be predicted and may be exacerbated by global climate change. Severe weather and natural disasters could harm our operations through interference with communications, including the interruption or loss of our computer systems, which could prevent or impede us from gathering deposits, originating loans and processing and controlling the flow of business, as well as through the destruction of facilities and our operational, financial and management information systems. Additionally, the United States remains a target for potential acts of war or terrorism. Such severe weather, natural disasters, acts of war or terrorism or other adverse external events could negatively impact our business operations or the stability of our deposit base, cause significant property damage, adversely impact the values of collateral securing our loans and/or interrupt our borrowers' abilities to conduct their business in a manner to support their debt obligations, which could result in losses and increased provisions for credit losses. There is no assurance that our business continuity and disaster recovery program can adequately mitigate the risks of such business disruptions and interruptions.\n\ufeff\nPandemic events could have a material adverse effect on our operations and our financial condition.\n\ufeff\nThe outbreak of disease on a national or global level, such as the spread of the COVID-19 coronavirus, could have a material adverse effect on commerce, which may, in turn impact our lines of business. Such an event may also impact our ability to manage those portions of our business or operations which rely on vendors and suppliers from other countries or regions impacted by such a pandemic event.\n\ufeff\nWe may be adversely impacted by the transition from LIBOR as a reference rate.\n\ufeff\nIn July 2017, the United Kingdom\u2019s Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021, and for LIBOR to be replaced with an alternative reference rate that will be calculated in a different manner. Consequently, at this time, it is not possible to predict whether and to what extent banks will continue to provide submissions for the calculation of LIBOR. Similarly, it is not possible to predict whether LIBOR will continue to be viewed as an acceptable market benchmark, what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to LIBOR, or what the effect of any such changes in views or alternatives may be on the markets for LIBOR-indexed financial instruments. Substantially all of our commercial mortgages held for sale are indexed to LIBOR. Additionally, the interest rates of certain of our investment securities and our trust preferred securities are indexed to LIBOR. The transition from LIBOR could create considerable costs and additional risk. Since proposed alternative rates are calculated differently, payments under contracts referencing new rates will differ from those referencing LIBOR. The transition will change our market risk profiles, requiring changes to risk and pricing models, valuation tools, product design and hedging strategies. Furthermore, failure to adequately manage this transition process with our customers could adversely impact our reputation. Although we are currently unable to assess what the ultimate impact of the transition from LIBOR will be, failure to adequately manage the transition could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n\ufeff\nRisks related to ownership of our common stock.\n\ufeff\nThe trading volume in our common stock is less than that of many financial services companies, which may reduce the price at which our common stock would otherwise trade.\n\ufeff\nAlthough our common stock is traded on The NASDAQ Global Select Market, the trading volume is less than that of many financial services companies. A public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth, liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers and sellers of our common stock at any given time. This presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which we have no control. Given the lower trading volume of our common stock, significant sales of our common stock, or the expectation of these sales, could cause our stock price to fall.\n\ufeff\nAn investment in our common stock is not an insured deposit.\n\ufeff\nOur common stock is not a bank deposit and, therefore, is not insured against loss by the FDIC, any other deposit insurance fund or by any other public or private entity. Investment in our common stock is inherently risky for the reasons described in this \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section and is subject to the same market forces that affect the price of common stock in any company. As a result, if you acquire our common stock, you may lose some or all of your investment.\n\ufeff\nOur ability to issue additional shares of our common stock, or the issuance of such additional shares, may reduce the price at which our common stock trades.\n\ufeff\nWe cannot predict whether future issuances of shares of our common stock or the availability of shares for resale in the open market will decrease the market price per share of our common stock. We are not restricted from issuing additional shares of common stock, including any securities that are convertible into or exchangeable for, or that represent the right to receive shares of common stock. Sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market or the perception that such sales might occur could materially adversely affect the market price of the shares of our common stock. The exercise of any options granted to directors, executive officers and other employees under our stock compensation plans, the vesting of restricted stock grants, the issuance of shares of common stock in acquisitions and other issuances of our common stock also could have an adverse effect on the market price of the shares of our common stock. The existence of options, or shares of our common stock reserved for issuance as restricted shares of our common stock may materially adversely affect the terms upon which we may be able to obtain additional capital in the future through the sale of equity securities.\nFuture offerings of debt, which would be senior to our common stock upon liquidation, and/or preferred equity securities which may be senior to our common stock for purposes of dividend distributions or upon liquidation, may reduce the market price at which our common stock trades.\n\ufeff\nIn the future, we may attempt to increase our capital resources or, if the Bank\u2019s capital ratios fall below the required minimums, we could be forced to raise additional capital by making additional offerings of debt or preferred equity securities, including medium-term notes, senior or subordinated notes or preferred stock. Upon liquidation, holders of our debt securities and shares of preferred stock and lenders with respect to other borrowings will receive distributions of our available assets prior to the holders of our common stock. Holders of our common stock are not entitled to preemptive rights or other protections against dilution.\n\ufeff\nThe Bank\u2019s ability to pay dividends is subject to regulatory limitations which, to the extent we require such dividends in the future, may affect our ability to pay our obligations and pay dividends.\n\ufeff\nWe are a separate legal entity from the Bank and our other subsidiaries, and we do not have significant operations of our own. We have historically depended on the Bank\u2019s cash and liquidity, as well as dividends, to pay our operating expenses. Various federal and state statutory provisions limit the amount of dividends that subsidiary banks can pay to their holding companies without regulatory approval. The Bank is also subject to limitations under state law regarding the payment of dividends, including the requirement that dividends may be paid only out of net profits. In addition to these explicit limitations, it is possible, depending upon the financial condition of the Bank and other factors, that federal and state regulatory agencies could take the position that payment of dividends by the Bank would constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice and may therefore seek to prevent the Bank from paying such dividends. Moreover, under the 2014 Consent Order Amendment, the Bank may not pay dividends without the approval of the FDIC. See \u201cRisk Factors-Risks Relating to Our Business-The entry into the Consent has imposed certain restrictions and requirements upon us and the Bank.\u201d Although we believe we have sufficient existing liquidity for our needs for the foreseeable\nfuture, there is risk that, if the amendment remains undischarged for a lengthy period and the Bank is unable to obtain FDIC approval for one or more dividends, we may not be able to service our obligations as they become due or to pay dividends on our common stock or preferred stock. Even if, absent the amendment, the Bank has the capacity to pay dividends, it is not obligated to pay the dividends. Its Board of Directors may determine, as it did in the past, to retain some or all of its earnings to support or increase its capital base.\n\ufeff\nAnti-takeover provisions of our certificate of incorporation, bylaws and Delaware law may make it more difficult for holders of our common stock to receive a change in control premium.\n\ufeff\nCertain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could make a merger, tender offer or proxy contest more difficult, even if such events were perceived by many of our stockholders as beneficial to their interests. These provisions include in particular our ability to issue shares of our common stock and preferred stock with such provisions as our board of directors may approve without further shareholder approval. In addition, as a Delaware corporation, we are subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law which, in general, prevents an interested stockholder, defined generally as a person owning 15% or more of a corporation\u2019s outstanding voting stock, from engaging in a business combination with our company for three years following the date that person became an interested stockholder unless certain specified conditions are satisfied.\n\ufeff", "PERMNO": 90490, "SIC": 6020, "TIC": "TBBK"}
