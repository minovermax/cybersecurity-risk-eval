{"cik": "1499832", "company": "Townsquare Media, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2022-03-16", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nAn investment in Townsquare involves a variety of risks and uncertainties. The following factors and other factors discussed in this Annual Report could cause our actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements made in this Annual Report or presented elsewhere in future SEC reports or statements made by our management from time to time. These factors may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows, and should be carefully considered. We may update these factors in our future periodic reports.\nRisks Related to COVID-19\nThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, or the impact of any future pandemic, is uncertain and difficult to predict, but the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures taken to contain it has had a material adverse effect on our business and revenues to date and may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, stock price, and liquidity in the future.\nThe U.S. economy and financial markets continue to experience volatility due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our business, results of operations and financial condition were adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 and 2021. The COVID-19 pandemic and measures taken to contain it have subjected our business, results of operations, financial condition, stock price and liquidity to a number of material risks and uncertainties, all of which may continue, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022advertising revenue makes up the majority of our revenue, and, like other similar businesses that depend on advertising spend, we have experienced, and may continue to experience, a decline in this revenue stream;\n\u2022although many COVID-19 related government and regulatory restrictions have been lifted, consumer discretionary spending, customer advertising, and attendance at live events may continue to be challenged due to fear, uncertainty, the development of COVID-19 variants, and the increased challenges for businesses to re-start. Any prolonged reduction in actual revenues and anticipated reduction in projected revenues may require us to evaluate our intangible assets or goodwill for impairment;\n\u2022as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have been forced to postpone or cancel a large number of our live events, which has had, and may continue to have, a negative impact on our live events revenue;\n\u2022the potential negative impact on the health of our employees, particularly if a significant number are impacted, could affect our ability to ensure business continuity during the period of disruption related to the pandemic and could increase our health benefits expense. The pandemic has forced many of our on-site and management office employees to work remotely for periods of time, which may adversely impact our ability to effectively manage our business and maintain our financial reporting processes and related controls, as well as introduce operational risk, including an increased vulnerability to potential cyber security attacks;\n\u2022the financial markets and our stock price have also been adversely impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the negative financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic could result in difficulty accessing debt or equity capital on attractive terms, or at all, funding business operations, complying with the covenants and obligations under any existing or future debt, including meeting required payments of principal and interest or repaying outstanding debt, as well as negatively affect our credit rating, and could present similar difficulties to our clients as well as challenging their ability to meet their payment obligations to us and our and their ability to comply with our agreements; and\n\u2022our operations have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. We have taken actions to reduce non-essential capital expenditures and continue to evaluate opportunities for managing our operating expenses\nand conserving our financial resources. Our future strategies, prospects and plans for growth may also be negatively impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nTaken individually, or together in any combination, the above could cause a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity, although the extent of the potential effect will depend on future actions and outcomes, which are uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the development and severity of COVID-19 variants, the short-term and long-term economic impact of the pandemic (including consumer discretionary spending, supply chain disruptions, inflation, labor shortages, and the effect on advertising activity), the actions taken to mitigate the impact of the virus, including the rates and effectiveness of vaccines, and the pace of economic and financial market recovery, among others. Further, many of the Risk Factors described in this report are more likely to occur and be further intensified as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nRisks Related to Economic Conditions and Our Business\nDecreased spending by advertisers, as a result of factors such as supply chain disruption, inflation and changes in the economy have had, and may continue to have a material adverse effect on our business.\nBecause a substantial majority of our net revenue is generated from the sale of local, regional and national advertising on our digital properties and radio stations, and to a lesser extent, at our live events, a downturn in the economy, prolonged supply chain disruptions or labor shortages, a significant increase in inflation rates, or reduction in consumer confidence in the U.S. economy may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations, as advertisers generally reduce their spending during such periods. Furthermore, because a substantial portion of our revenue is derived from local advertisers, our ability to generate advertising revenue in specific markets (including concentrations in and around the Northeast, Upper Midwest, Texas and the Mountain West) could be adversely affected by local or regional economic downturns. A downturn in the U.S. economy could also adversely affect our advertising revenue and our results of operations.\nDecisions by advertisers to delay or reduce their advertising spend on our platforms could also slow our revenue growth or reduce our revenues. For instance, beginning in approximately April 2021, decisions by advertisers to decrease or delay advertising spend due to supply chain disruptions had an adverse impact on our revenue and revenue growth. While many advertisers have increased spending on advertising in 2021 as compared to 2020, certain industries such as the automotive industry, are still experiencing supply chain disruption and as circumstances change, we may continue to see reduced advertising levels and postponed or cancelled campaigns.\nIn addition, a significant percentage of our advertising revenue is generated from the sale of advertising to the automotive, financial services and retail industries. These industries, among others, have been adversely affected by prior downturns in the economy, and may be adversely affected by any future downturns in the economy, and a significant decrease in advertising revenue from advertisers in these industries in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nA decline in attendance at or reduction in the number of concerts, expositions and other experiential events and other forms of entertainment may have an adverse effect on revenue and operating income from our live events business. In addition, during periods of economic slowdown and recession, many consumers have historically reduced their discretionary spending and advertisers have reduced their advertising expenditures. Consumer discretionary spending is sensitive to many factors such as employment, fuel and energy prices, inflation and general economic conditions, and as a result, the risks associated with our live events business may become more acute in periods of a slowing economy or recession, which may be accompanied by a decrease in attendance at our live events. The impact of economic slowdowns on our business is difficult to predict, but they may result in reductions in ticket sales, sponsorships and our ability to generate revenue from live events or grow our live events business.\nOur business, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected if we are unable to acquire certain broadcast rights or our broadcast rights contracts are not renewed on sufficiently favorable terms.\nThe acquisition of broadcast rights is highly competitive, and we may be adversely impacted by certain exclusive content rights held by our competitors. We sometimes enter into broadcast rights contracts in the ordinary course of business for both the acquisition and distribution of media content and products, including contracts for both the acquisition and distribution of content rights for sporting events and other programs, and contracts relating to content produced by third parties on our radio stations. If we are unable to renew these contracts, as they expire, on acceptable terms, we may lose these rights, the related content and the related revenue. Even if these contracts are renewed, the cost of obtaining content rights may increase (or increase at faster rates than in the past) or the revenue from distribution of content may be reduced (or increase at slower rates than in the past). The impact of broadcast rights contracts and the terms of the contracts on our results will depend on a number of factors beyond our control, including the strength of advertising markets, effectiveness of marketing efforts, the size of audiences, and the related contract expenses and costs. There can be no assurance that revenue from content based on these rights will exceed the cost of the rights plus the other costs of producing and distributing the content.\nOur results are impacted by political advertising revenue, which can vary from even to odd-numbered years.\nApproximately 0.8% and 4.3% of our net revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, consisted of political advertising revenue. Political advertising revenue from elections, which is generally greater in even-numbered years and especially the years in which the U.S. President is elected, has the potential to create fluctuations in our operating results on a year-to-year basis. For example, during 2021, we had political advertising revenue of $3.5 million, as compared to $16.0 million in 2020. In addition, political advertising revenue is dependent on the level of political ad spend and competitiveness of local, state and national elections within each local market.\nIf we are unable to retain our digital audience, our business may be adversely affected.\nThe increasing number of digital media options available on the internet, through social networking platforms and through mobile and other devices distributing news and other content is expanding consumer choice significantly. Faced with a multitude of media choices and a dramatic increase in accessible information, consumers may place greater value on when, where, how and at what price they consume digital content than they do on the source or reliability of such content. The popularity of news aggregation websites and customized news feeds (often free to users) may reduce our traffic levels by creating a disincentive for the audience to visit our websites or use our mobile applications. In addition, the undifferentiated presentation of some of our content in aggregation with other content may lead audiences to fail to distinguish our content from the content of other providers. Our reputation for quality journalism and content are important in competing for revenue in this environment and are based on consumer and advertiser perceptions. If consumers fail to differentiate our content from other content providers in digital media, or if the quality of our journalism or content is perceived as less reliable, we may not be able to increase our online traffic sufficiently or retain a base of frequent visitors to our local and national digital properties.\nOnline traffic is also driven by internet search results, including search results provided by Google, the primary search engine directing traffic to our websites. Search engines frequently update and change the methods for directing search queries to websites or change methodologies or metrics for valuing the quality and performance of internet traffic on delivering cost-per-click advertisements. Any such changes could decrease the amount of revenue that we generate from online advertisements. The failure to successfully manage search engine optimization efforts across our business could result in a significant decrease in traffic to our various websites, which could result in substantial decreases in conversion rates and repeat business, as well as increased costs if we were to replace free traffic with paid traffic, any or all of which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to create sufficient advertiser interest in our digital properties or to maintain or increase the advertising rates of the inventory on our digital properties. Even if we maintain traffic levels, the market position of our brands may not be enough to counteract a significant downward pressure on advertising rates.\nTo remain competitive, we must respond to changes in technology, services and standards that characterize our industry.\nThe radio broadcasting and digital advertising industries are subject to technological change, evolving industry standards and the emergence of new media technologies and trends. We may not have the resources to acquire new technologies or to introduce new services that could compete with these new technologies and may allow us to adapt to new trends. Various new media technologies and services have been or are being developed or introduced, including:\n\u2022satellite-delivered digital audio radio service, which resulted in subscriber-based satellite radio services with numerous niche formats;\n\u2022audio content by cable systems, direct-broadcast satellite systems, personal communications systems, content available over the internet and other digital audio broadcast formats;\n\u2022in-band on-channel digital radio, which provides multi-channel, multi-format digital radio services in the same bandwidth currently occupied by traditional AM and FM radio services;\n\u2022Low-Power FM radio stations, which are non-commercial FM radio broadcast outlets, that serve small, localized areas;\n\u2022applications that permit users to listen to programming on a time-delayed basis and to fast-forward through programming and/or advertisements (e.g.. podcasts);\n\u2022iPhone/iPod/iPad and similar mobile devices, gaming consoles, in-home entertainment and enhanced automotive platforms, voice activated smart speakers, and streaming internet services such as Netflix, Spotify, and Pandora, all of which provide access to audio and other entertainment content to consumers.\nThe radio broadcasting industry historically has grown despite the introduction of new technologies for the delivery of entertainment and information, including the introduction of new technologies used in automobiles, as a result, in part, of a growing population, greater use of the automobile and increased commuter times. We cannot guarantee that this historical growth will continue. Some of the technologies, particularly satellite digital audio radio service and internet radio, compete for the consumer\u2019s attention in the car, workplace, outdoors and elsewhere.\nIn addition, we cannot predict the effect, if any, that competition arising from new technologies may have on the radio broadcasting and digital advertising industries or on our business, financial condition and results of operations, some of which could result in the imposition of significant costs and expenses not previously part of our business operations.\nThe failure or destruction of transmitter and other facilities that we depend upon to distribute our content could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe use studios, satellite systems, transmitter facilities and the internet to originate and/or distribute our content. We rely on third-party contracts and services to operate our origination and distribution facilities. These third-party contracts and services include, but are not limited to, electrical power, satellite downlinks, telecom circuits and internet connectivity. Distribution may be disrupted due to one or more third parties losing their ability to provide particular services to us, which could adversely affect our distribution capabilities. A disruption can be caused as a result of any number of events such as local disasters (accidental or environmental), such as weather events or wildfires (which may increase in frequency due to climate change), various acts of terrorism, war or armed conflict, power outages, major telecom and internet connectivity failures or satellite failures. Our ability to distribute content to our radio station audience and/or network affiliates may be disrupted for an undetermined period of time until alternate facilities are engaged and put on-line. Furthermore, until we fix issues that arise or third-party services resume when applicable, the inability to originate or distribute content could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are dependent on key personnel.\nThe leadership, skills and experience of our senior management team are critical to our operations, and the loss of one or more members of our senior management team could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations, including impairing our ability to execute and evolve our business strategy. We believe that our future success will depend greatly on our continued ability to attract, retain and motivate highly skilled and qualified personnel.\nFuture success and growth in our digital businesses depends upon our continued ability to develop and maintain technology and identify, hire, develop, motivate and retain highly skilled technical and sales talent. Competition for employees with these skill sets is intense and our continued ability to compete effectively depends, in part, upon our ability to attract new employees. We will also need to be able to balance the costs of recruiting and retaining these employees with profitable growth. If we are unable to do so, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected.\nThe success of our radio stations is significantly impacted by our on-air talent, and we compete for on-air talent with other radio stations and radio station groups, radio networks, and other providers of syndicated content and other media such as broadcast television, cable television, satellite television, the internet and satellite radio. Our employees and other on-air talent are subject to change and may be lost to competitors or for other reasons, and the contracts we have with certain talent generally are limited in duration. Any adverse changes in particular programs or on-air talent in a particular market could have a negative impact on our ratings and generally could have a material adverse effect on our ratings and our ability to attract advertisers, which could negatively impact our business, financial condition or results of operations adversely affect revenues in that particular market.\nIncreases in or new royalties could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe pay royalties to song composers and publishers through four professional rights organizations (\u201cPROs\u201d), which currently are Broadcast Music, Inc. (\u201cBMI\u201d), the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (\u201cASCAP\u201d), SESAC, Inc. (\u201cSESAC\u201d) and Global Music Rights, Inc. (\u201cGMR\u201d), for the performance of music on our radio stations and websites. We also pay royalties to Sound Exchange for music streamed on our websites. Royalty rates are subject to adjustment and it is possible that our royalty rates associated with obtaining rights to use musical compositions and sound recordings in our programming content could increase as a result of private negotiations, regulatory rate-setting processes, or administrative and court decisions. In addition, the emergence of one or more new PROs could increase the royalties we pay.\nFrom time to time, Congress considers legislation that could require that radio broadcasters pay performance royalties to record labels and recording artists. The proposed legislation has been the subject of considerable debate and activity by the radio broadcast industry and other parties that could be affected. We cannot predict whether any proposed legislation will become law. The proposed legislation would add an additional layer of royalties to be paid directly to record labels and artists. It is currently unknown what proposed legislation, if any, will become law, however such an additional royalty could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Department of Justice has been considering whether to reform or terminate the long-standing consent decrees that govern music licensing by ASCAP and BMI. Additionally, there has been litigation concerning whether these consent decrees require full-work licensing, resulting in a ruling by a federal appeals court that they do not. The reformation or termination of these consent decrees and the resolution of the full-work licensing issue each could lead to the increase of our royalty rates associated with obtaining rights to use musical compositions and sound recordings in our programming content.\nOur substantial indebtedness could have an adverse impact on us.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness. As of December 31, 2021, we had $541.5 million of outstanding indebtedness, net of deferred financing costs of $8.5 million, with annual cash interest expense requirements of approximately $38.0 million. Our substantial level of indebtedness increases the risk that we may be unable to generate\ncash sufficient to pay amounts due in respect of our indebtedness. We may incur substantial additional amounts of indebtedness, as well as incur significant non-debt obligations, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with such indebtedness. Our substantial indebtedness could have other significant effects on our business.\nFor example, it could:\n\u2022increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic, industry and competitive conditions;\n\u2022require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;\n\u2022limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n\u2022restrict us from taking advantage of opportunities to grow our business;\n\u2022make it more difficult to satisfy our financial obligations;\n\u2022place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt obligations; and\n\u2022limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, debt service requirements, the execution of our own business strategy or other general corporate purposes on satisfactory terms or at all.\nIn addition, the agreements evidencing or governing our current indebtedness do contain, and the agreements evidencing or governing our future indebtedness may contain, restrictive covenants that will limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interest. Our ability to comply with those covenants depends on our future operating performance and cash flow, which are in turn subject to prevailing economic conditions, increases or decreases in advertising spending, changes in the highly competitive industry in which we operate, which may be rapid, and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. Our failure to comply with those covenants could result in an event of default which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of all of our indebtedness, which would have a material adverse effect on our business.\nInterest is payable on the 2026 Notes semi-annually in cash in arrears on February 1st and August 1st of each year. Any failure to make payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness on a timely basis would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness. If we cannot make scheduled payments on our indebtedness, we will be in default under one or more of the agreements governing our indebtedness, and, as a result, we could be forced into bankruptcy or liquidation.\nWe may be adversely affected by the occurrence of extraordinary events, such as terrorist attacks, pandemics or natural disasters, as we have experienced with the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe occurrence of extraordinary events, such as terrorist attacks, natural disasters, contagious disease outbreaks or pandemics (for example, the COVID-19 pandemic), intentional or unintentional mass casualty incidents or similar events may substantially impact our operations in specific, geographic areas, as well as nationally, may directly affect our employees, including our key employees, and may decrease the use of and demand for advertising, and the attendance at our live events, which may decrease our revenue or expose us to substantial liability. The occurrence of future terrorist attacks, military actions by the U.S., contagious disease outbreaks or pandemics or other unforeseen similar events cannot be predicted, and their occurrence can be expected to negatively affect the economies where we do business in general and specifically in the market for advertising or live events. In addition, an act of God or a natural disaster, such as a weather event or wildfire, which may increase in frequency due to climate change, could adversely impact any one or more of the markets where we do business, thereby impacting our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCapital requirements necessary to operate our business or consummate acquisitions could pose risks.\nOur business requires a certain level of capital expenditures. If our cash flows and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations, we could be forced to reduce or delay investments and capital expenditures, adversely impacting our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we may be required to increase our debt and/or issue equity securities in order to consummate an acquisition, and we may not have sufficient cash flows and capital resources to consummate one or more acquisitions. In addition, our ability to obtain financing depends on a number of other factors, many of which are also beyond our control, such as interest rates and national and local business conditions. If the cost of obtaining needed financing is too high or the terms of such financing are otherwise unacceptable in relation to the acquisition opportunity we are presented with, we may decide to forego that opportunity. Additional indebtedness could increase our leverage and make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and may limit our ability to withstand competitive pressures.\nRisks Related to Our Industry and Competition\nOur future revenue and earnings growth will be significantly impacted by our digital lines of business, which are subject to significant competition and rapidly changing technology.\nWe invest significant capital and employee resources in our digital businesses, including our subscription digital marketing solutions business, Townsquare Interactive, and our programmatic digital advertising business. These digital business lines are subject to significant competition, rapidly changing technology, and evolving standards. As we continue to grow these lines of business and to expand into new markets, we will also face new sources of competition, including, in certain of these markets, from companies with longer operating histories, established customer bases, greater brand recognition and more financial, technical, marketing, and related resources. We will need to cultivate new relationships with customers, third party providers and other partners in each of these markets. We may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors, and our business, results of operations and financial condition will be harmed if we fail to meet these competitive pressures. In addition, there can be no assurance that our digital technologies we use or develop will be adequate, or that we will be able to establish our proprietary right to the technologies we rely upon.\nThe ability to grow Townsquare Interactive depends in large part on maintaining and expanding our subscriber base. To do so, we must convince prospective subscribers of the benefits of our technology platform and existing subscribers of the continuing value of our products and services. Most of our contracts with subscribers are terminable upon short or no notice. The digital marketing solutions sector is highly competitive. We believe our solutions are well positioned to serve the SMBs in markets outside the top 50 upon which we focus. However, if our net subscriber base decreases, our business, financial condition and operating results will be adversely affected.\nWe may lose audience ratings, market share and advertising revenue to competing radio stations or other types of media competitors.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry. Our radio operations compete for audiences and advertising market share with other radio stations and radio station groups, radio networks, other syndicated content and other media such as broadcast television, newspapers, magazines, cable television, satellite television, the internet, internet radio, digital platforms and applications, satellite radio, outdoor advertising, mobile devices and other portable digital audio players. We also compete for advertising dollars with other large digital companies, such as Facebook, Google and Amazon. Any adverse change in a particular market or in the relative market positions of the radio stations located in a particular market, or any adverse change in audiences\u2019 preferences could have a material adverse effect on our ratings or revenue. Other radio broadcasting companies may enter the markets in which we operate or may operate in the future, offer syndicated content that competes with our content, or try to acquire distribution rights of media content and products or on-air talent that we use or have under contract, and these companies may be larger and have more financial resources than we do.\nIn addition, from time to time, other radio stations may change their format or content, or a radio station may adopt a format to compete directly with us for audiences and advertisers. These tactics could result in lower ratings,\nlower market share and lower advertising revenue or increased promotion and other expenses and, consequently, lower earnings and cash flow for us. Audience preferences as to format or content may also shift due to demographic changes, personnel or other content changes, a decline in broadcast listening trends or other reasons. We may not be able to adapt to these changes or trends, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If we elect to make significant changes to our format or content to respond to changes in audience preferences or competition in a number of markets, such changes could utilize significant management resources, capital and time to implement and our new format and content may not be successful.\nCompetition for advertising is generally based on audience levels and demographics, price, service and advertising results. It has intensified as a result of the continued development of digital media and in recent years, advertisers have shifted dollars toward digital, putting downward pressure on our broadcast revenue. If this trend continues, we may experience a decline in broadcast revenue as a result. In addition, competition from all of these media and services affects our ability to attract and retain advertisers and consumers and to maintain or increase our advertising rates.\nOur success is dependent upon audience engagement with our content, which is difficult to predict.\nDigital media and radio content production and distribution is an inherently risky business because the revenue derived from the production and distribution of digital media content or a radio program, and the licensing of rights to the intellectual property associated with the content or program, depend primarily upon their acceptance by the public, which is difficult to predict. The commercial success of content or a program also depends upon the quality and acceptance of other competing programs released into the marketplace at or near the same time, the availability of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure time activities, general economic conditions and other tangible and intangible factors, all of which are difficult to predict.\nRatings for broadcast radio stations and traffic or visitors to a particular website are also factors that are weighed when advertisers determine which outlets to use and in determining the advertising rates that the outlet receives. Poor ratings or traffic levels can lead to a reduction in pricing and advertising revenue. For example, if there is an event causing a change of programming at one of our radio stations, there could be no assurance that any replacement programming would generate the same level of ratings, revenue or profitability as the previous programming. In addition, changes in ratings methodology and technology could adversely impact our ratings and negatively affect our advertising revenue. In each market, there has been a compression in the relative ratings of all radio stations in the market, enhancing the competitive pressure within the market for advertising dollars. Because of the competitive factors we face, we cannot assure investors that we will be able to maintain or increase our current audience ratings and advertising revenue, which could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur live events business depends in part on our ability to anticipate the tastes of consumers and to offer events that appeal to them. Since we rely on unrelated parties to perform at certain of our live events, any lack of availability of popular artists could limit our ability to generate revenue. In addition, our live events business typically plans and makes certain commitments to future events up to 18 months in advance of the event, and often agrees to pay an artist or other service providers or venues a fixed guaranteed deposit amount prior to our receiving any revenue as is standard in the live events industry. Therefore, if the public is not receptive to the event, or we or an artist cancel the event, we may incur a loss for the event depending on the amount of the fixed guaranteed or incurred costs relative to any revenue earned, as well as revenue we could have earned at the event. For certain events, we have cancellation insurance policies in place to cover a portion of our losses but this coverage may not be sufficient and is subject to deductibles. Furthermore, consumer preferences change from time to time, and our failure to anticipate, identify or react to these changes could result in reduced demand for our live events, which would adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Acquisitions\nThere are risks associated with our acquisition strategy.\nWe may continue to grow in part by acquiring radio stations, digital properties, live events or other businesses in the future. We cannot predict whether we will be successful in pursuing these acquisitions or what the consequences of these acquisitions will be. Any acquisitions in the future may be subject to various conditions, such as compliance with FCC and antitrust regulatory requirements.\nThe FCC requirements include:\n\u2022approval of license assignments and transfers;\n\u2022limits on the number of radio stations a broadcaster may own in a given local market; and\n\u2022other rules and policies, such as the ownership attribution rules, that could limit our ability to acquire radio stations in certain markets where one or more of our stockholders, officers or directors have other media interests.\nThe antitrust regulatory requirements include:\n\u2022filings with the DOJ and the FTC under the HSR Act, where applicable;\n\u2022expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act; and\n\u2022possible review by the DOJ or the FTC of antitrust issues under the HSR Act or otherwise.\nCompletion of any acquisition may be approved by regulatory authorities subject to our compliance with certain conditions. These conditions may be onerous, and may include the requirement that we divest certain assets, which may include radio stations we already own or we propose to acquire. We cannot be certain whether we would be willing to satisfy any of these conditions or whether they can be satisfied, the timing thereof, or the potential impact on us any such conditions may have. In addition, the FCC has in the past asserted the authority to review levels of local radio market concentration as part of its acquisition approval process, even where proposed assignments would comply with the numerical limits on local radio station ownership in the FCC\u2019s rules and the Communications Act.\nOur acquisition strategy involves numerous other risks, including risks associated with:\n\u2022identifying acquisition candidates, competing for such acquisitions and negotiating definitive purchase agreements on satisfactory terms, and the related costs of these activities;\n\u2022integrating operations, systems, and other internal controls, and managing a large and geographically diverse group of assets;\n\u2022unsatisfactory returns on investment or an inability to achieve anticipated synergies on a timely basis or at all;\n\u2022diverting our management\u2019s attention from other business concerns;\n\u2022entry into new markets and geographic areas where we have limited or no experience;\n\u2022retaining key employees, customers, suppliers or other third-party relationships of the acquired businesses;\n\u2022assumption of known and unknown liabilities, some of which may be difficult or impossible to quantify;\n\u2022non-cash impairment charges or other accounting charges relating to the acquired assets;\n\u2022tax costs or inefficiencies; and\n\u2022a diminishing number of properties available for sale in appropriately sized and located markets.\nWe cannot be certain that we will be able to successfully integrate any future acquisitions or manage the resulting business effectively, or that any acquisition will achieve the benefits that we anticipate. In addition, we are not certain that we will be able to acquire properties at valuations as favorable as those of previous acquisitions. Depending upon the nature, size and timing of potential future acquisitions, we may be required to raise additional financing or issue additional securities in order to consummate additional acquisitions. Our debt agreements, as may be in place at any time, may not permit us to consummate an acquisition or access the necessary additional financing because of certain covenant restrictions. Furthermore, we cannot be certain that additional capital will be available to us or, if available, that capital would be on terms acceptable to our management team.\nDue to various market and financial conditions, we may not be able to successfully complete future acquisitions or future dispositions of our radio stations, or achieve the related benefits we anticipate.\nWe pursue strategic acquisitions when such acquisitions are strategic and financially additive and meet our overall business needs. We engage in strategic sales of our assets from time to time, as it makes financial sense to do so and meets our overall business needs. We have also been required by the FCC to divest radio stations. However, due to financial and economic market conditions, both in the radio industry and in the overall U.S. economy, as well as antitrust, FCC and other regulatory requirements, our consummation of future acquisitions or dispositions, including those requiring radio station divestitures, is uncertain and may be difficult. In addition, we cannot be certain that we will be able to successfully integrate any recent or future acquisitions or manage the resulting business effectively, or that any acquisition or disposition will achieve the benefits that we anticipate.\nRisks Related to Our Financial Reporting and Accounting\nWe have remediated several material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting. If we experience additional material weaknesses in the future, our business may be harmed.\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and for evaluating and reporting on the effectiveness of our system of internal control. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP. As a public company, we are required to comply with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and other rules that govern public companies. In particular, we are required to certify our compliance with Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which requires us to furnish annually a report by management on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting.\nManagement performed its assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020 and had concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of December 31, 2020 due to material weaknesses described under \u201cItem 9A. Controls and Procedures\u201d in this Annual Report. During 2021, management took steps to remediate all previously identified material weaknesses as of December 31, 2021.\nRemediation efforts place a significant burden on management and add increased pressure to our financial resources and processes. If we identify material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting in the future, our business may be harmed. Such harm may include: (i) failure to accurately report our financial results, to prevent fraud or to meet our SEC reporting obligations on a timely basis or at all; (ii) material misstatements in our Consolidated Financial Statements and harm to our operating results and investor confidence; and (iii) a material adverse effect on the trading price of our stock. In addition, the foregoing could subject us to sanctions or investigations by the NYSE, the SEC or other regulatory authorities, and result in the breach of covenants in our debt agreements, any of which could have a material adverse impact on our operations, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity and our stock\u2019s trading price.\nFurther, there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any control system, including the potential for human error and the possible circumvention or overriding of controls and procedures. Additionally, judgments in decision-making can be faulty and breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake. An effective control system can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control objectives of the system are adequately met. Finally, projections of any evaluation or assessment of effectiveness of a control system to future periods are subject to the risks that, over time, controls may become inadequate because of changes in an entity\u2019s operating environment or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures.\nFuture losses could be caused by future asset impairment of our FCC licenses and/or goodwill.\nUnder Financial Accounting Standards Board Accounting Standards Codification (\u201cFASB ASC\u201d) Topic 350, \u201cIntangibles-Goodwill and Other,\u201d goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles, including FCC licenses, are not amortized but instead are tested for impairment at least annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that there may be an impairment. Impairment is measured as the excess of the carrying value of the goodwill or intangible asset over its fair value. Intangible assets that have finite useful lives continue to be amortized over their useful lives and are also measured for impairment if events or circumstances indicate that they may be impaired. Impairment losses are recorded as operating expenses.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our FCC licenses and goodwill comprised approximately 37.9% and 21.7% of our consolidated total assets, respectively. The valuation of intangible assets is subjective and based on estimates rather than precise calculations. If actual future results are not consistent with the assumptions and estimates used, we may be exposed to impairment charges in the future. The fair value measurements for both our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets use significant unobservable inputs which reflect our own assumptions about the estimates that market participants would use in measuring fair value including assumptions about risk.\nGiven the current economic environment and the potential negative impact on our business, there can be no assurance that our estimates and assumptions regarding the period and strength of the current economic recovery, made for the purpose of our non-amortizable intangible fair value estimates, will prove to be accurate.\nInterim and/or annual impairment testing, as applicable, could result in future impairment losses. The fair value of FCC licenses and goodwill is primarily dependent on the expected future cash flows of our business. If actual market conditions and operational performance underlying the intangible assets were to deteriorate, or if facts and circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the estimated fair value of the FCC licenses or goodwill below their adjusted carrying amounts, the Company may be required to recognize additional non-cash impairment charges in future periods, which could have a material impact on the Company\u2019s business, financial condition and results of operations.\nRefer to Note 6, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, Net for additional information.\nRisks Related to Technology\nNew technologies could block our digital ads, which could harm our digital advertising business.\nTechnologies have been developed that can block the display of our ads and that provide tools to users to opt out of our advertising products. Most of our revenue from our digital businesses are derived from fees paid to us by advertisers in connection with the display of ads on web pages for our users. As a result, such technologies and tools could adversely affect our operating results.\nA security breach or a cyber-attack could adversely affect our business.\nA security breach or cyber-attack of our computer systems could interrupt or damage our operations or harm our reputation. A security breach could occur both from external sources, including malicious attacks and third-party service provider vulnerabilities, as well as internal sources, such as employee error, failures in our security measures or vulnerabilities in our networks or code base. Any security breaches of our computer systems, including repeated or\nsustained attacks or disruptions, could interrupt delivery of services to customers, potentially increasing costs and reducing revenue. If third parties or our employees are able to penetrate our network security or otherwise misappropriate personal information or contact information of our customers, audience, business partners or advertisers, or if we give third parties or our employees improper access to such data, we could be subject to liability. This liability could include identity theft or other similar fraud-related claims. This liability could also include claims for other misuses or losses of personal information, including for unauthorized marketing purposes. Even in the absence of bad actors, unidentified vulnerabilities or glitches in our systems could result in loss of business-critical data or otherwise compromise the confidentiality, integrity or availability of such data. Other liabilities could include claims alleging misrepresentation of our privacy and data security practices. We could also be subject to regulatory or private rights of action in certain jurisdictions.\nThe number and scale of cyber-attacks causing significant business disruptions, such as global ransomware attacks, are increasing and could pose a risk to our ability to deliver our services and operate our business. Any future ransomware or other cyber-attack could disrupt our service delivery for an indeterminate period of time, as well as compromise or destroy personal and business-critical data and information within our control. Recovering from such an attack may require significant resources to restore business operations and our services, including personnel time and capital costs. In some cases, recovery of such data may not be possible. If a security breach results in the exposure or unauthorized disclosure of personal information, we could incur additional costs associated with data breach notification and remediation expenses, investigation costs, regulatory penalties and fines, and legal proceedings. Our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all the costs related to such breaches or attacks.\nWe rely on encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure online transmission of confidential consumer information. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other events or developments may result in a compromise or breach of the algorithms that we use to protect sensitive customer transaction data. A party who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions in our operations. We may be required to expend capital and other resources to protect against such security breaches or cyber-attacks or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches or attacks. Our security measures are designed to protect against security breaches and cyber-attacks but may not be adequate, implemented properly, or appropriately complied with internally to prevent a security breach or cyber-attack. No network or system can ever be completely secure. Our failure to prevent such security breaches and cyber-attacks could subject us to liability, adversely affect our results of operations and damage our reputation.\nOur engagement of third-party service providers increases our exposure to security and data privacy risks.\nSelect business operations, including online advertising, analytics engines and data storage, rely on partnerships with third party service providers, the operations, practices, and processes of which are outside our control. Despite due diligence in engaging these third parties and efforts to contractually protect our interests, we cannot guarantee that these third parties will adequately protect the personal information that we share with, or that is collected on our behalf by, such third parties or that such third parties will fully or sufficiently comply with all applicable data protection laws and contractual obligations. The failure of our third-party service providers to adequately protect the personal information we process could result in a security breach of such personal information, potentially exposing us to the liability of a data breach or mishandling of personal information. Even where personal information is not involved, a successful cyber-attack on one of our third-party service providers could result in a disruption to our operations and impact revenues.\nUnder recent developments in data protection laws, particularly the European Union\u2019s General Data Protection Regulation (\u201cGDPR\u201d), we may be liable for the compliance of any third parties engaged to process personal information on our behalf with applicable data protection laws. More recently, California enacted the California Consumer Privacy Act (the \u201cCCPA\u201d) that, among other things, requires covered companies to provide new disclosures to California consumers, and afford such consumers new abilities to opt-out of certain sales of personal information and, in some cases, delete such personal information. If any of our third-party service providers fail to comply with applicable laws, we may face additional exposure and liability on behalf of such providers. While we attempt to control against such outcomes through our vetting of third-party service providers and with appropriate contractual obligations, we cannot ensure our third-party service providers will fully comply with all such obligations. Moreover, the regulatory landscape\nis constantly evolving and subject to ongoing interpretations and guidance from regulatory authorities. The costs of compliance with, and other burdens imposed by, the GDPR and CCPA and other privacy laws could have an adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe rely on third parties to provide the technologies necessary to deliver content, advertising and services to our audience, and any change in the licensing terms, costs, availability, or acceptance of these formats and technologies could adversely affect our business.\nWe rely on third parties to provide the technologies that we use to deliver content, advertising, and services. There can be no assurance that these providers will continue to license their technologies or intellectual property to us on reasonable terms, or at all. Providers may change the fees they charge users or otherwise change their business model in a manner that slows the widespread acceptance of their technologies. In order for our services to be successful, there must be a large base of users of the technologies necessary to deliver our content, advertising and services. We have limited or no control over the availability or acceptance of those technologies, and any change in the licensing terms, costs, availability, or user acceptance of these technologies could adversely affect our business.\nCertain components of our digital business depend on continued and unimpeded access to the internet by us and our audience. Internet access providers may be able to block, degrade, or charge for access to certain of our products and services, which could lead to additional expenses and the loss of our audience and advertisers.\nCertain of our products and services depend on the ability of our audience to access the internet, and certain of our products require significant bandwidth to work effectively. Currently, this access is provided by companies that have significant market power in the broadband and internet access marketplace, including incumbent telephone companies, cable companies, mobile communications companies and government-owned service providers. Some of these providers may take measures that could degrade, disrupt, or increase the cost of, access to certain of our products by restricting or prohibiting the use of their infrastructure to support or facilitate our offerings, or by charging increased fees to us or our audience to provide or access our offerings. Such interference could result in a loss of existing audience and advertisers, and increased costs, and could impair our ability to attract new audience and advertisers, thereby harming our revenue and growth.\nRisks Related to Governmental Regulation and Legislation\nOur business depends upon licenses issued by the FCC, and if licenses are not renewed or we are out of compliance with FCC regulations and policies, our business could be materially impaired.\nThe radio industry is subject to extensive regulation by the FCC under the Communications Act. Our radio stations depend upon maintaining their broadcasting licenses issued by the FCC, which are currently issued for a maximum term of eight years and are renewable. Interested parties may challenge a renewal application. On rare occasions, the FCC has revoked licenses, not renewed them, or renewed them with significant qualifications, including renewals for less than a full term of eight years. In the last renewal cycle, the FCC granted all of the license renewal applications that were filed for our radio stations. Our latest license renewal cycle began in 2019. We have now filed all of the required applications for this renewal cycle. 70% of those applications have been granted, all for full eight-year terms. The rest remain pending. We cannot be certain that our pending or future license renewal applications will be approved, or that the renewals will not include conditions or qualifications that could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations, result in material impairment or adversely affect our liquidity and financial condition. If any of our FCC licenses are not renewed, it would prevent us from operating the affected radio station and generating revenue from it. Further, the FCC has a general policy restricting the transferability of a radio station license while a renewal application for that radio station is pending. In addition, we must comply with extensive FCC regulations and policies governing the ownership and operation of our radio stations. FCC regulations limit the number of radio stations that a licensee can own in a market, which could restrict our ability to consummate future transactions. The FCC\u2019s rules governing our radio station operations impose costs on our operations and changes in those rules could have an adverse effect on our business. The FCC also requires radio stations to comply with certain technical requirements to limit interference between two or more radio stations. If the FCC relaxes these technical requirements, it could impair the signals transmitted by our radio stations and could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nMoreover, governmental regulations and policies may change over time, and the changes may have a material adverse impact upon our business, financial condition and results of operations. For further details on federal regulation of radio broadcasting, see \u201cBusiness-Federal Regulation of Radio Broadcasting.\u201d\nThe FCC has been vigorous in its enforcement of its rules and regulations, including its indecency and sponsorship identification rules, violations of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe FCC\u2019s rules prohibit the broadcast of obscene material at any time and indecent material between the hours of 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. Broadcasters risk violating the prohibition against broadcasting indecent material because of the vagueness of the FCC\u2019s definition of indecent material, coupled with the spontaneity of live content. The FCC vigorously enforces its indecency rules against the broadcasting industry as a whole and violations of these rules may result in fines or, in some instances, revocation of an FCC license. The FCC\u2019s focus on the indecency regulatory scheme, against the broadcast industry generally, may encourage third parties to oppose our license renewal applications.\nFurthermore, in recent years the FCC has increased its enforcement of regulations requiring a radio station to include an on-air announcement which identifies the sponsor of all advertisements and other matter broadcast by any radio station for which any money, service or other valuable consideration is received. Fines for such violations can be substantial as they are dependent on the number of times a particular advertisement is broadcast.\nWe cannot predict whether Congress will consider or adopt further legislation in this area. In the ordinary course of business, we or the FCC may receive complaints and we may become subject to FCC inquiries or proceedings related to our stations\u2019 broadcasts or operations, and any resulting settlement with or fines from the FCC, revocation of any of our radio station licenses or denials of license renewal applications, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are required to obtain prior federal approval for each station acquisition, which approvals may be subject to our compliance with certain conditions, possibly including asset divestitures, which may be material.\nAcquisitions have been and may continue to be, a critical component of our overall strategy. The acquisition of a radio station requires the prior approval of the FCC and may require approvals by other governmental agencies, such as the DOJ or the FTC. To obtain that approval, a proposed acquirer is required to file a transfer of control or assignment of license application with the FCC. The Communications Act and FCC rules allow members of the public and other interested parties to file petitions to deny or other objections to the FCC with respect to the grant of any transfer or assignment application. The FCC could rely on those objections or its own initiative to deny a transfer or assignment application or to require changes in the transaction, including the divestiture of radio stations and other assets, as a condition to having the application granted. Although we do not currently expect such divestitures to be material to our financial position or results of operations, no assurances can be provided that we would not be required to divest additional radio stations in connection with obtaining such approval, or that any such required divestitures would not be material to our financial position or results of operations. The FCC could also change its existing rules and policies to reduce the number of radio stations that we would be permitted to acquire in some markets. For these and other reasons, there can be no assurance that the FCC will approve potential future acquisitions that we deem material to our business. See \u201c-There are risks associated with our acquisition strategy\u201d for additional information regarding FCC and other regulatory approvals required for acquisitions.\nWe may be adversely affected by the FCC\u2019s actions with respect to Revitalization of AM Radio.\nIn October 2015, the FCC released a First Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rulemaking titled \u201cRevitalization of AM Radio Service,\u201d enacting several modifications to its technical rules for AM radio stations. One aspect of the FCC\u2019s revitalization order was exclusive AM filing windows in 2016 to allow AM stations to move a FM translator up to 250 miles to rebroadcast that AM station\u2019s signal, and windows in 2017 and 2018 exclusively for AM stations to apply for a new FM translator construction permit. As a result of these filing windows many broadcast companies, including our Company, have constructed and are operating FM broadcast translator stations, or have construction permits to do so in the future, and thereby rebroadcast certain of their AM stations in the FM band. We cannot predict at this time to what extent these FM broadcast translator stations will impact our Company.\nThe information we collect and process is of increasing business importance and new or changing federal, state or international privacy legislation or regulation create uncertainty for our continued use of the information we collect and process.\nIn the course of our ordinary business operations, we may collect personal information and non-personal information that is critical or commercially-useful to our business, including personal information related to our employees, audience, advertisers, contractors, and customers. As a result of our digital expansion efforts and third-party partnerships, the volume, sensitivity, and business importance of the information we collect and use is increasing. We collect this information directly from individuals, through passive tracking technology such as \u201ccookies\u201d and indirectly through third parties engaged to provide services on our behalf. In addition to the risk that a security breach may compromise this information, this information may include personal information such as names, contact information, credit card information, geolocation and demographic information that is subject to specific data protection and privacy laws.\nWe are subject to federal, state and international data protection and privacy laws and regulations that require us to comply with specific consumer protection, information security and data protection and privacy requirements. The legal and regulatory landscape continues to evolve, with new laws being enacted or coming into force. Additionally, we are now required to comply with the CCPA, which requires us to update both our internal and external policies and procedures to meet our compliance obligations under CCPA. Compliance with CCPA may require that we change or amend activities that involve personal information, which may impact business operations or our ability to effectively use personal information in our control. Furthermore, as mentioned under \u201c- Our engagement of third-party service providers increases our exposure to security and data privacy risks\u201d above, such requirements include allowing consumers to limit our use of their personal information, or delete it entirely.\nRegulatory enforcement actions and interpretations of new data protection and privacy laws and regulations may change how these requirements apply to our business and collection, use, storage, and disclosure of personal information, creating uncertainty regarding the continued viability of information-reliant business activities. Certain interpretations or implementation of new data protection and privacy laws, as well as the evolving legal and regulatory landscape, could harm our business, including negatively impacting the cost of doing business or our ability to engage in certain business practices. Furthermore, recent disclosures of major data breaches and company data collection, use and disclosure practices to which large segments of the consumer population have objected may result in both increased interest in U.S. federal data privacy legislation as well as changes to consumer privacy expectations and demands. Such shifts may restrict our ability to collect and/or process personal information in a particular way or derive economic value from personal, and even non-personal, information.\nWe have implemented and are implementing policies and procedures to comply with applicable data protection and privacy laws and regulations, but such measures may not always be effective, particularly as the legal landscape continues to evolve, and regulatory guidance is often ambiguous or inconsistent. Some of our internal processes are manual and rely on employees to follow and adhere to our policies and procedures, which can result in employee error and internal compliance failures. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with our policies or applicable data protection and privacy laws and regulations could result in regulatory enforcement actions against us, proceedings by governmental entities, consumers or others (including our contractual third parties), and loss in brand value and reputation. Such results could possibly require us to incur costs for defending against proceedings or paying regulatory fines or penalties and responding to such outcomes could consume considerable management focus and internal resources, decrease demand for our services, or increase the costs of, or otherwise limit, our ability to do business.\nNew or changing federal, state or international privacy legislation or regulation could hinder the growth of our digital properties.\nA variety of federal and state laws govern the collection, use, retention, sharing and security of consumer data that our digital properties use to operate certain services and to deliver certain advertisements to its customers, as well as the technologies used to collect such data. Not only are existing privacy-related laws in these jurisdictions evolving and subject to potentially disparate interpretation by governmental entities, new legislative proposals affecting privacy are\nnow pending at both the federal and state level in the U.S. Changes to the interpretation of existing law or the adoption of new privacy-related requirements could hinder the growth of our digital presence. Also, a failure or perceived failure to comply with such laws or requirements or with our own policies and procedures could result in significant liabilities, including a possible loss of consumer or investor confidence or a loss of customers or advertisers, and could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Furthermore, the oversight required to monitor and adapt to the ever-changing regulatory landscape could consume considerable management focus and internal resources, or increase the costs of, or otherwise limit, our ability to do business.\nRisks Related to Our Smaller Reporting Company Status\nWe are a smaller reporting company and intend to avail ourselves of certain reduced disclosure requirements applicable to smaller reporting companies, which could make our common stock less attractive to investors.\nWe are a smaller reporting company, as defined in the Exchange Act, and we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not applicable to smaller reporting companies, including reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation. We cannot predict if investors will find our common stock less attractive because we may rely on these exemptions. If some investors find our common stock less attractive as a result, there may be a less active trading market for our common stock and our stock price may be more volatile. We intend to take advantage of certain of these reporting exemptions until we are no longer a smaller reporting company. We will remain a smaller reporting company until the aggregate market value of our outstanding common stock held by non-affiliates as of the last business day of our most recently completed second fiscal quarter is $250 million or more.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nThe public market for our Class A Common Stock may be volatile.\nWe cannot assure you that the market price of our Class A common stock will not fluctuate significantly in response to a number of factors, many of which we cannot control, including those described under \u201cRisks Related to Economic Conditions and Our Business\u201d and the following:\n\u2022our announcement of earnings or operational guidance or changes to such guidance;\n\u2022changes in financial estimates by any securities analysts who follow our Class A common stock, our failure to meet these estimates or failure of those analysts to initiate or maintain coverage of our Class A common stock;\n\u2022publications of research reports about us or the industries in which we compete, and downgrades by any securities analysts who follow our Class A common stock or such industries;\n\u2022future sales or buybacks of our common stock by us, significant stockholders or our other affiliates;\n\u2022market conditions or trends in our industry or the economy as a whole and, in particular, in the advertising sales environment;\n\u2022investors\u2019 perceptions of our prospects;\n\u2022announcements by us or our competitors of significant contracts, acquisitions, joint ventures or capital commitments; and\n\u2022changes in key personnel.\nMany of the factors above are beyond our control and may cause the market price of our common stock to decline, regardless of our financial performance and condition and prospects. Declines in our stock price may limit our\nability to use our common stock as consideration in acquisitions, or our interest or ability to consummate a public equity offering.\nIn addition, the stock market has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue to affect the market prices of equity securities of many companies. In the past, stockholders have instituted securities class action litigation following periods of market volatility. If we were involved in securities litigation, we could incur substantial costs, and our resources and the attention of management could be diverted from our business.\nOur certificate of incorporation designates the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware as the sole and exclusive forum for certain types of actions and proceedings that may be initiated by our stockholders, which could limit our stockholders\u2019 ability to obtain a favorable judicial forum for disputes with us or our directors, officers or employees.\nOur certificate of incorporation provides that, subject to limited exceptions, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware will be the sole and exclusive forum for (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or other employees to us or our stockholders, (iii) any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provision of the Delaware General Corporation Law, our certificate of incorporation or our by-laws, or (iv) any other action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine. This provision is not intended to apply to claims arising under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. To the extent the provision could be construed to apply to such claims, there is uncertainty as to whether a court would enforce the provision in such respect, and our stockholders will not be deemed to have waived compliance with federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. Any person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring any interest in shares of our capital stock shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the provisions of our certificate of incorporation described above. This choice of forum provision may limit a stockholder\u2019s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with us or our directors, officers or other employees, which may discourage such lawsuits against us and our directors, officers and employees. Alternatively, if a court were to find these provisions of our certificate of incorporation inapplicable to, or unenforceable in respect of, one or more of the specified types of actions or proceedings, we may incur additional costs associated with resolving such matters in other jurisdictions, which could adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nAny future cash dividends will be at the discretion of our board of directors and other factors. You may not receive any return on investment unless you are able to sell your Class A common stock for a price greater than your purchase price.\nAs a result of the economic circumstances and uncertainty created by the COVID-19 pandemic, our board of directors has determined to cease payment of quarterly cash dividends, with no intention of reinstating the dividend. Any determination to pay dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend upon results of operations, financial condition, contractual restrictions, including agreements governing our indebtedness, any potential indebtedness we may incur, restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors our board of directors deems relevant. Accordingly, if you purchase shares, realization of a gain on your investment may depend on the appreciation of the price of our Class A common stock, which may never occur.\nAnti-takeover provisions in our certificate of incorporation or bylaws may delay, discourage or prevent a change in control.\nOur certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that may delay, discourage or prevent a merger or acquisition that a stockholder may consider favorable. As a result, stockholders may be limited in their ability to obtain a premium for their shares.", "PERMNO": 87564, "SIC": 4832, "TIC": "TSQ"}
