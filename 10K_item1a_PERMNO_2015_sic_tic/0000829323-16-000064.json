{"cik": "829323", "company": "Inuvo, Inc.", "filing_type": "10-K", "filing_date": "2016-02-12", "item_1A": "ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS.\nAn investment in our common stock involves a significant degree of risk. You should not invest in our common stock unless you can afford to lose your entire investment. You should consider carefully the following risk factors and other information in this report before deciding to invest in our common stock. If any of the following risks and uncertainties develops into actual events, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected and you could lose your entire investment in our company.\nWe rely on two customers for a significant portion of our revenues. We are reliant upon Yahoo! and Google for most of our revenue. During 2015 they accounted for 64.8% and 33.2% of our revenues, respectively, and during 2014 they accounted for 53.5% and 43.8%, respectively. The amount of revenue we receive from these customers is dependent on a number of factors outside of our control, including the amount they charge for advertisements, the depth of advertisements available from them, and their ability to display relevant ads in response to our end-user queries.\nWe would likely experience a significant decline in revenue and our business operations could be significantly harmed if these customers do not approve our new websites and applications, or if we violate their guidelines or they change their guidelines. In addition, if any of these preceding circumstances were to occur, we may not be able to find a suitable alternate paid search results provider or otherwise replace the lost revenues. The loss of either of these customers or a material change in the revenue or gross profit they generate would have a material adverse impact on our business, results of operations and financial condition in future periods.\nWe are dependent upon relationships with and the success of our distribution partners. Our distribution partners are very important to the success of the Partner Network segment. We must recruit and maintain partners who are able to drive traffic successfully to their websites and mobile applications, resulting in clicks on advertisements we have delivered. These partners may experience difficulty in attracting and maintaining users for a number of reasons, including competition, rapidly changing markets and technology, industry consolidation and changing consumer preferences. Further, we may not be able to further develop and maintain relationships with distribution partners. They may be able to make their own deals directly with advertisers, may view us as competitors or may find our competitors offerings more desirable. Any of these potential events could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position and results of operations.\nThe success of our Owned and Operated Network business is dependent on our ability to acquire traffic in a profitable manner. The Owned and Operated Network operates our ALOT-branded websites. This segment is dependent on our ability to attract traffic to our sites in a profitable manner. We use a predictive model to calculate the rate of return for marketing campaigns, which includes estimates and assumptions. If these estimates and assumptions are not accurate, we may not be able to effectively manage our marketing decisions and could acquire traffic in an unprofitable manner. In addition, we may not be able to maintain and grow our traffic for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to, acceptance of our websites by consumers, the availability of advertising to promote our websites, competition, and sufficiency of capital to purchase advertising. If we are unable to maintain and grow traffic to our sites in a profitable manner, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nA significant portion of the traffic to our websites is acquired from other search engines, and the loss of the ability to acquire traffic could have a material adverse effect on our financial results. We advertise on search engine websites to drive traffic to our owned and operated websites. Our keyword advertising is done primarily with Google, but also with Yahoo! and Bing. If we are unable to advertise on these websites, or the cost to advertise on these websites increases, our financial results will suffer.\nWe frequently introduce new products and services requiring significant investment, and such initiatives may not meet expectations in terms of viability, success or profitability. Initiatives such as our current initiative to launch new ALOT-branded owned and operated websites require significant financial investment. These investments include key personnel, technology infrastructure, marketing costs and others. We cannot assure you these initiatives will generate significant revenue or be profitable. If our initiatives do not meet our expectations, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations.\nWe deliver advertisements to users from third-party ad networks which exposes our users to content and functionality over which we do not have ultimate control. We display pay-per-click, banner, cost per acquisition, and other forms of advertisements to users that come from third-party ad networks. We do not control the content and functionality of such third-party advertisements and, while we provide guidelines as to what types of advertisements are acceptable, there can be no assurance that such advertisements will not contain content or functionality that is harmful to users. Our inability to monitor and control what types of advertisements get displayed to users could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business must keep pace with rapid technological change to remain competitive. Our business operates in a market characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry standards, frequent new product and service announcements, enhancements, and changing customer demands. We must adapt to rapidly changing technologies and industry standards and continually improve the speed, performance, features, ease of use and reliability of our services. This includes making our products and services compatible and maintaining compatibility with multiple operating systems, desktop and mobile devices, and evolving network infrastructure. If we fail to do this, our results of operations and financial position could be adversely\naffected.\nOur quarterly operating results can be difficult to predict and can fluctuate substantially, which could result in volatility in the price of our common stock. Our quarterly revenues and other operating results have varied in the past and are likely to continue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter. Our agreements with distribution partners and key customers do not require minimum levels of usage or payments, and our revenues therefore fluctuate based on the actual usage of our service each quarter by existing and new distribution partners. Quarterly fluctuations in our operating results also might be due to numerous other factors, including:\n\u2022\nour ability to attract new distribution partners, including the length of our sales cycles, or to sell increased usage of our service to existing distribution partners;\n\u2022\ntechnical difficulties or interruptions in our services;\n\u2022\nchanges in privacy protection and other governmental regulations applicable to the our industry;\n\u2022\nchanges in our pricing policies or the pricing policies of our competitors;\n\u2022\nthe financial condition and business success of our distribution partners;\n\u2022\npurchasing and budgeting cycles of our distribution partners;\n\u2022\nacquisitions of businesses and products by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\ncompetition, including entry into the market by new competitors or new offerings by existing competitors;\n\u2022\ndiscounts offered to advertisers by upstream advertising networks;\n\u2022\nour history of litigation;\n\u2022\nour ability to hire, train and retain sufficient sales, client management and other personnel;\n\u2022\ntiming of development, introduction and market acceptance of new services or service enhancements by us or our competitors;\n\u2022\nconcentration of marketing expenses for activities such as trade shows and advertising campaigns;\n\u2022\nexpenses related to any new or expanded data centers; and\n\u2022\ngeneral economic and financial market conditions.\nOur services may be interrupted if we experience problems with our network infrastructure. The performance of our network infrastructure is critical to our business and reputation. Because our services are delivered solely through the internet, our network infrastructure could be disrupted by a number of factors, including, but not limited to:\n\u2022\nunexpected increases in usage of our services;\n\u2022\ncomputer viruses and other security issues;\n\u2022\ninterruption or other loss of connectivity provided by third-party internet service providers;\n\u2022\nnatural disasters or other catastrophic events; and\n\u2022\nserver failures or other hardware problems.\nWhile we have data centers in multiple, geographically dispersed locations and active back-up and disaster recovery plans, we cannot assure you that serious interruptions will not occur in the future. If our services were to be interrupted, it could cause loss of users, customers and business partners, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position.\nFailure to comply with the covenants and restrictions in our credit facility could impact our ability to access capital as needed. We have a credit facility with Bridge Bank, N.A. (\"Bridge Bank\") under which we had zero in debt outstanding as of December 31, 2015. The credit facility contains a number of covenants that requires us and certain of our subsidiaries to, among other things,:\n\u2022\npay fees to the lender associated with the credit facility;\n\u2022\nmeet prescribed financial covenants;\n\u2022\nmaintain our corporate existence in good standing;\n\u2022\ngrant the lender a security interest in our assets;\n\u2022\nprovide financial information to the lender; and\n\u2022\nrefrain from any transfer of any of our business or property, subject to customary exceptions.\nWe have historically had difficulties meeting the financial covenants set forth in our credit agreement. Our lender has given us waivers in the past and reset our financial covenants several times. In the event of a breach of our covenants we cannot provide any assurance that our lender would provide a waiver or reset our covenants. A breach in our covenants could result in a default under the credit facility, and in such event Bridge Bank could elect to declare all borrowings outstanding, if any, to be due and payable. If this occurs and we have outstanding obligations and are not able to repay, Bridge Bank could require us to apply all\nof our available cash to repay the debt amounts and could then proceed against the underlying collateral. Should this occur, we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay our debt in full, we would be able to borrow sufficient funds to refinance the debt, or that we would be able to obtain a waiver to cure any such default. In such an event, our ability to conduct our business as it is currently conducted would be in jeopardy.\nFailure to comply with the covenants and restrictions in our grant agreement with the State of Arkansas could result in the repayment of a portion of the grant, which we may not be able to repay or finance on favorable terms. In January 2013, we entered into an agreement with the State of Arkansas whereby we were granted $1,750,000 for the relocation of the Company to Arkansas and for the purchase of equipment. The grant was contingent upon us having at least 50 full-time equivalent permanent positions within four years, maintaining at least 50 full-time equivalent permanent positions for the following six years and paying those positions an average total compensation of $90,000 per year. As of December 31, 2015, the grant required we have 42 employees located in Arkansas and on December 31, 2015 we had 45 employees located in Arkansas.\nIf we fail to meet the requirements of the grant after the initial four year period, we may be required to repay a portion of the grant, up to but not to exceed the full amount of the grant. Should this occur, we cannot assure you that our assets would be sufficient to repay our grant in full, we would be able to borrow sufficient funds to refinance the grant, or that we would be able to obtain a waiver to cure any such default. In such an event, our ability to conduct our business as it is currently conducted would be in jeopardy.\nWe depend on key personnel, the loss of whom could harm our business. Our success depends in part on the retention of personnel critical to our business operations. Loss of key personnel may result in disruption of operations, loss of key business relationships or expertise, additional recruiting and training costs, and diminished anticipated benefits of acquisitions. Our future success is substantially dependent on the continued service of our key senior management. We have experienced difficulty from time to time in attracting or retaining the personnel necessary to support the growth of our business, and we may experience similar difficulties in the future.\nRegulatory and legal uncertainties could harm our business. While there are currently relatively few laws or regulations directly applicable to internet-based commerce or commercial search activity, there is increasing awareness of such activity and interest from state and federal lawmakers in regulating these services. New regulation of activities in which we are involved or the extension of existing laws and regulations to internet-based services could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.\nFailure to comply with federal, state and international privacy laws and regulations, or the expansion of current or the enactment of new privacy laws or regulations, could adversely affect our business. A variety of federal, state and international laws and regulations govern the collection, use, retention, sharing and security of consumer data. The existing privacy-related laws and regulations are evolving and subject to potentially differing interpretations. In addition, various federal, state and foreign legislative and regulatory bodies may expand current or enact new laws regarding privacy matters. For example, recently there have been Congressional hearings and increased attention to the capture and use of location-based information relating to users of smartphones and other mobile devices. We have posted privacy policies and practices concerning the collection, use and disclosure of subscriber data on our websites and applications. Several Internet companies have incurred penalties for failing to abide by the representations made in their privacy policies and practices. In addition, several states have adopted legislation that requires businesses to implement and maintain reasonable security procedures and practices to protect sensitive personal information and to provide notice to consumers in the event of a security breach. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to comply with our posted privacy policies or with any data-related consent orders, FTC requirements or orders or other federal, state or international privacy or consumer protection-related laws, regulations or industry self-regulatory principles could result in claims, proceedings or actions against us by governmental entities or others or other liabilities, which could adversely affect our business.\nWe may face third party intellectual property infringement claims that could be costly to defend and result in the loss of significant rights. From time to time third parties have asserted infringement claims against us including copyright, trademark and patent infringement, among other things. While we believe that we have defenses to these types of claims under appropriate trademark laws, we may not prevail in our defenses to any intellectual property infringement claims. In addition, we may not be adequately insured for any judgments awarded in connection with any litigation. Any such claims and resulting litigation could subject us to significant liability for damages or result in the invalidation of our proprietary rights, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. Even if we were to prevail, these claims could be time-consuming, expensive to defend, and could result in the diversion of management's time and attention.\nWe are subject to risks from publishers who could fabricate clicks either manually or technologically. Our business involves the establishment of relationships with website owners and publishers. In exchange for their consumer traffic, we provide an advertising placement service and share a portion of the revenue we collect with that website publisher. Although we have click\nfraud detection software in place, we cannot guarantee that we will identify all fraudulent clicks or be able to recover funds distributed for fabricated clicks. This risk could materially impact our ability to borrow, our cash flow and the stability of our business.\nWe have a history of losses and there are no assurances that we can consistently generate net income. Although we generated net income in 2015 and 2014, we have a history of net losses that have resulted in an accumulated deficit of $116,748,778 as of December 31, 2015. We cannot provide assurance that we can consistently generate a net income.\nSignificant dilution will occur if outstanding warrants and options are exercised or restricted stock unit grants vest. As of December 31, 2015, we had warrants and stock options outstanding to purchase a total of 1,099,620 shares with exercise prices ranging from $0.56 to $16.01 per share, with a weighted average exercise price of $2.74. We also had 1,229,769 restricted stock units outstanding. If outstanding warrants and stock options are exercised or restricted stock units vest, dilution will occur to our stockholders, which may be significant. See Note 2 to the financial statements for more details.\nOur business is seasonal and our financial results may vary significantly from period to period. Our future results of operations may vary significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year because of numerous factors, including seasonality. Historically, in the later part of the fourth quarter and the earlier part of the first quarter we experience lower Revenue Per Click (\u201cRPC\u201d) due to a decline in demand for inventory on website and app space and the recalibrating of advertiser\u2019s marketing budgets after the holiday selling season. If we are not able to appropriately adjust to seasonal or other factors, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nA downturn or uncertainty in global economic conditions may have a significant negative effect on our access to credit and our ability to raise capital and may impact our business, operating results or financial condition. A future downturn or uncertainty in global economic conditions, may result in significant reductions in, and heightened credit quality standards for, available capital and liquidity from banks and other providers of credit and substantial reductions and/or fluctuations in equity and currency values worldwide, which may make it difficult for us to raise additional capital or obtain additional credit, when needed, on acceptable terms or at all. Moreover, deteriorated economic conditions, or the threat of a prolonged recessionary period, may cause disruptions and volatility in global financial markets, increased rates of default and bankruptcy and have a negative impact on the levels of consumer spending. These macroeconomic developments could negatively affect our business, operating results or financial condition in a number of ways. For example, current or potential customers, such as advertisers, may delay or decrease spending with us or may not pay us or may delay paying us for previously performed services. In addition, if consumer spending decreases, this may result in fewer clicks on our advertisers\u2019 ads displayed on our Owned and Operated Network websites or our Partner Network websites.", "PERMNO": 90608, "SIC": 7370, "TIC": "INUV"}
